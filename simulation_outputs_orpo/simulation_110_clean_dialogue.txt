Patient: Lately I can't stop beating myself up over what I see as constant failures — every little mistake turns into this picture of everything falling apart. After my last rough relationship I just know I'll ruin the next one, then lose friends, get rejected for jobs, end up broke and completely alone — it's this chain reaction that will definitely happen. I try to stay upbeat, but my mind's like a doom-telling machine and when people suggest other outcomes I just can't make myself believe them.

Therapist: That cycle of "what if" feels really exhausting. When you say "I'll ruin the next one," what's one specific thing you're doing right now that you wish you could stop, but can't because it's tied to that worst-case scenario?

Patient: I keep obsessively texting and asking for reassurance — like, if they don't reply I flood them with messages asking if they're mad or if I did something wrong. Of course that will annoy them, they'll decide I'm too much, break up with me, and then I'll lose the few friends I have and end up completely alone and broke — it's the only thing that ever makes sense to me. I try to stop, but the second I see no reply my head spins straight into that disaster story and I can't pull back.

Therapist: That feeling of needing reassurance right away makes sense to you as a way to avoid the worst-case scenario. What would it be like if, instead of texting right away, you took a 30-second pause before sending that first message – just to see if you could sit with the uncertainty for that small moment?

Patient: I tried that once and for those thirty seconds my brain turned it into an hour—telling me that waiting means they’ve lost interest, met someone else, and in a few days they'll block me and I'll never hear from them again. I know it could help logically, but I can't make myself believe that; the pause just becomes more "evidence" that I'm about to be abandoned.

Therapist: You're right, the pause doesn't logically help in this case. What would it take for you to keep that 30-second pause even if your mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios – what's one small value you'd be holding onto that would make the uncertainty worth sitting with?

Patient: Maybe I could try holding onto a small bit of self-respect — like wanting to prove to myself I won't panic and chase people away, that I can show up calmly. But my mind immediately says that's pointless; if I wait they'll already be gone and the pause will just confirm I'm right, so I can't really make myself believe it'll help.

Therapist: That desire for self-respect is a small spark – what would it be like to acknowledge that spark, even if you don't believe it'll help, and simply choose to hold onto it for 1 breath while you wait?

Patient: I guess I can try, but even one breath turns into my brain fast-forwarding the whole disaster: no reply, they get annoyed, they leave, I'm back alone and proof the pause made it happen. Fine — I'll hold that tiny bit of self-respect for one breath, but I already feel my head racing and telling me this will just make the outcome worse.

Therapist: You're willing to hold onto that spark of self-respect for one breath – that's a tiny act of kindness to yourself. What would it be like to focus on that breath itself, without judgment, for just the length of that one breath?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to focus on the breath, but the second I do my head starts narrating the whole disaster — no reply, they've already moved on, I'm panicking, and it just spirals. I might be able to hold it for one slow count, but my mind's already racing to the end of the story and it's hard to stay with just the breath.

Therapist: Notice what's happening just before your mind starts racing – the moment before the story starts, when your breath is still just a sensation. Can you catch that moment, without trying to hold onto the breath, and simply observe it as it is – exactly as it is, right now?

Patient: I can sort of catch that tiny moment — it's a weird little quiet spot — but the instant I notice it my brain screams that quiet means they've already checked out and in a few minutes they'll block me and I'll be humiliated and alone. I can hold it for a second, but then my head drags me into the whole catastrophe and I can't take it seriously that anything else could happen.

Therapist: That moment of quiet before the story starts is a tiny opportunity to practice defusion – and it's not about holding onto it, but about what you do with it. What would it take for you to make a small decision, like sending that one text, while still holding onto the quiet moment, rather than letting the story take over?

Patient: Maybe I'd need a hard rule—like set a timer for 30 minutes and promise myself I won't text until it goes off, or get a friend to call me the minute I feel the urge so I'm not alone with the thought. But the second I try that my brain says the timer will just prove they're ignoring me and the pause will be the moment they decide to leave, so I can't trust any of those strategies to actually help. I want to believe a small step could work, but I'm so convinced the pause equals abandonment that I feel stuck and helpless.

Therapist: You're right, your brain is convinced that any strategy will be proof of abandonment – that's a huge weight to carry. What would it take for you to practice self-compassion with yourself, not just with your thought, when you feel that urge to text?

Patient: Maybe if I had a tiny practiced phrase — like "I'm hurting but I'm okay" — and put my hand on my chest for a few seconds, I could remind myself I'm human and not a disaster machine. But the second I try that my brain sneers that it's fake, says being gentle will just make people see me as needy and they'll bail, so I can't actually believe it will help. I'm trying, but I'm exhausted and frustrated — it feels like we're circling and I don't know how to make any of this stick.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you try to use the phrase – the moment your brain starts sneering at it, that's not about the phrase itself, but about your relationship with that moment. What would it take for you to simply show up with that phrase, without judgment, even if your brain is telling you it won't work?

Patient: I could try saying the phrase and putting my hand on my chest for a few seconds, but the instant I do my brain will sneer and run the louder version of the story — they'll hear me, decide I'm needy, pull away, and that will prove I'm right. Maybe if I practiced it a bunch, taped the words to the mirror, or had a friend remind me when I feel the urge I could squeak it out without exploding, but even that feels like a band-aid before the inevitable. I'm really tired of trying stuff that my mind insists is pointless, and it makes me doubt anything will actually help.

Therapist: You're so tired of trying, and your mind is convinced that anything you try won't work – that's a huge weight to carry. What would it take for you to let go of that exhaustion for just one moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I'm so exhausted that the moment I try to let go my brain drums up the whole disaster: they'll leave me, I'll lose the last friends I have, end up broke and completely alone, so "letting go" feels like stepping off a cliff. Maybe if I had a literal five minutes where no one could respond and I couldn't check my phone I could breathe, but I already don't believe that would stop the avalanche.

Therapist: What's the smallest, most tiny thing that would make you feel like you're not completely drowning in this exhaustion – not the thought of disaster, but the sensation of being human again?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing would be making a cup of tea and sitting by the window for five minutes—just something simple to feel warm and real again, or maybe calling one friend for a minute to hear a human voice. But the second I do that my brain says they'll think I'm needy, the call will go wrong or they won't pick up, and that'll be the first step toward them leaving me and proving I'm right—so even that little comfort feels like it's set up to confirm the disaster, and I'm not sure that makes sense or will help.

Therapist: Notice what's holding you back from making that cup of tea or calling your friend – is it the thought that they'll think you're needy, or is it the thought that they'll leave you? What if you didn't think about the outcome, but just focused on what you're doing in this moment – the sensation of holding the cup, the sound of the kettle, the feeling of the warmth on your skin?

Patient: I think it's both, but mostly the fear they'll leave — so even making tea feels like step one in a chain: they notice I'm needy, they pull away, then I'm alone and spiraling into poverty. I'm not sure I follow how tuning into the kettle or the warmth is supposed to stop that; my brain just turns the quiet into proof the disaster's already underway, so I can't actually stay present.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "they'll leave" – what if you didn't say that word? What if you just noticed the sensation of your body holding the cup, the sound of the kettle, without the story that comes with it?

Patient: I can snag a split-second of the kettle's hiss or the cup's warmth and it does calm me — for like a breath — but the moment I notice it my brain screams that the quiet proves they've checked out and this is the first step toward them leaving. I want to just feel the warmth without it being evidence of disaster, but my mind drags those sensations into the same doom-story before I can stay with them. I'm getting frustrated — I don't know how to keep the calm from turning into proof of the worst thing.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stay with the calm as a way to "avoid" the thought, you simply noticed the sensation of the warmth while the thought is still there – not as a way to stop the thought, but just as it is?

Patient: I can try that — notice the warmth even while the thought's there — and for a weird beat it actually feels okay, like "oh, this is nice," but then my brain immediately shouts that's proof they're already checking out and in a few minutes they'll be gone. I don't really see how noticing the warmth without trying to stop the thought does anything except give my head new evidence for the disaster. I'm frustrated and confused — it feels like every little calm just gets dragged into the same ending.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the thought, you simply noticed the thought itself – just the words, "they're checking out" – without trying to evaluate them as true or false?

Patient: I can try to notice the words "they're checking out" without arguing, but I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing supposed to help? The second those words pop up they feel like facts and my brain immediately fast-forwards to them blocking me, leaving me ruined and alone.

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "they're checking out" – do you notice your body tensing, your heart rate increasing, or your mind racing? What if you simply acknowledged that sensation, without trying to change the thought or evaluate its truth?

Patient: When I say "they're checking out" my chest tightens, my jaw clenches, my breathing gets shallow, and my mind just races into full catastrophe. If I try to notice that feeling without arguing with it, sometimes it eases for a beat, but almost immediately my brain says that ease is proof they're already gone. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing without changing it helps—feels like I'm staring at the thing that's going to eat me—but I can try naming the sensations if you want me to.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to notice the thought "they're checking out," you simply noticed the sensation in your chest when you think that word – the physical tightness, the feeling of constriction, the way it makes your breath catch?

Patient: Yeah, I can feel that tightness — my chest clamps, breath gets shallow, my jaw locks — and for a second it's just a scary little physical thing. But almost immediately this hot shame rolls over me, like some old screw-up is staring back, and my brain fast-forwards that into them leaving me, me being humiliated, everything collapsing. I can try to name the sensations, but right now it just feels like naming it hands the story more ammo and I don't know how to stop that.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "name the sensations" in a way that makes the story come alive, you simply noticed the sensations themselves, without any story or judgment? Just the physical sensation of the tightness in your chest, the feeling of your breath catching, without labeling it or evaluating it as "hot shame"?

Patient: I can try to feel the tightness and the catch in my breath without naming it, but the moment I do that old shame washes over me and it feels like the past failure is right there again. My brain then treats that feeling like confirmation the whole disaster is already happening, so I don't really see how just noticing it stops the story — it just makes it louder and more real.

Therapist: Notice what happens just before the shame washes over you – what's the tiny thing that happens before the story starts playing out? Is it a pause in your breathing, a slight shift in your posture, or a fleeting thought? Try to catch that tiny pause before the shame kicks in.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to catch it there's this tiny hitch in my breath and my shoulders pull up for a split second, then this hot shame just crashes over me and my mind grabs that pause and fast-forwards to everything falling apart. I can snatch that beat sometimes, but it honestly feels like the calm right before the storm, and I don't see how noticing it won't just make the story louder.

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to catch that tiny pause – is it just a moment of stillness, or is there something in your body that's slightly more relaxed during that beat? Try to notice that tiny relaxation, without trying to label it as "good" or "bad".

Patient: I can catch a tiny looseness — my shoulders drop a hair and a breath feels a bit fuller for a split second. But that little relief is instantly flooded by hot shame, and my brain turns it into proof I'm about to fail again — like it's the calm before the storm and they'll notice I'm weak and pull away. I'm frustrated because I want to hold the pause, but my head won't stop turning it into evidence the disaster is real, and I don't know how to keep it from happening.

Therapist: Instead of trying to hold the pause as a way to "win" against the shame, what if you simply allowed the looseness to be there – without trying to use it as evidence or proof? What would happen if you let go of the need to "hold" it and just noticed it as it is, without judgment?

Patient: I guess if I let the looseness be, it might feel a bit lighter for a breath or two, but my head instantly says that calm is just the setup for the storm — they’ll notice I’m fragile and that will be the moment they walk away. I can try to notice it without judging, but I keep getting pulled into the next catastrophe and it feels impossible to trust that the looseness isn't just more proof of disaster.

Therapist: What if, for just one tiny moment, you didn't believe the story that the calm is just the setup for the storm? What if you simply wondered, "What if this looseness is not about being fragile, but about being human?"

Patient: I can try to wonder that, but I don't really buy it — the second I feel loose my brain screams that's exactly when they'll notice I'm weak and walk away. Maybe I can pretend it's just being human for half a breath, but then the whole disaster movie starts and I get pulled under. I'm frustrated — I want to believe it, but I can't stop the spiral.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: for just one breath, what if you say to yourself, "I'm not sure what this looseness means"? No judgment, no story, just "I'm not sure". Can you hold that sentence for just one breath without trying to fit it into the shame narrative?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. I say to myself, “I’m not sure what this looseness means,” and I can hold it for maybe half a breath where it even feels a little okay. But then my brain screams that this is exactly when they’ll notice I’m weak, hot shame from some past screw-up floods me, and the whole disaster movie kicks in so I can’t keep it. I can try again if you want, but I’m already getting frustrated and shaky.

Therapist: Notice what happens just before the shame kicks in – is there a tiny moment of stillness, a slight pause in your breath, before your brain starts screaming? What if you caught that pause and said to yourself, "What's just before the story starts?"

Patient: Yeah — there's a split-second stillness, like my breath hiccups and something could calm down, but the moment I notice it that hot shame floods in and my brain slams the pause into proof that the disaster's already happening. I don't really follow how asking "what's just before the story starts" helps — to me it just feels like giving my head more time to invent the worst. I'm shaky and annoyed right now; it feels impossible to catch that beat without the whole movie kicking back in.

Therapist: You're right, asking "what's just before the story starts" might feel like giving your brain more ammo. Instead, notice what happens when you simply catch that tiny stillness – is it just a fleeting sensation, a tiny drop of calm in the midst of the storm? Can you notice that calm, without trying to use it to stop the story or prove anything?

Patient: I can snatch that tiny stillness — it's like a sliver of calm for one breath and, weirdly, it feels a little good. But the moment I notice it my head screams that's the exact moment they'll spot my weakness and start pulling away, so the calm just turns into more proof. I'm frustrated and shaky — I want to hold onto it, but I keep getting yanked back into the disaster movie and I don't see how noticing it helps.
