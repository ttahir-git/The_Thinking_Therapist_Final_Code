Patient: I guess lately I've been stuck in this cycle of beating myself up over every mistake — even small things at work feel like proof I'm failing. My family's really high-achieving and the pressure to succeed just makes my OCD and perfectionism worse. I don't know, I get nervous talking about it.

Therapist: That cycle of beating yourself up sounds really draining. What happens right after you notice that "I'm failing" thought – do you do something to try to make it go away, or does that thought itself lead to another behavior, like overthinking or avoiding tasks?

Patient: I don't know — I guess at first I start replaying everything in my head, going over what I could've done differently. Then I either try to fix it by over-preparing or double-checking stuff at work, or I freeze and avoid starting things because I'm scared I'll mess up. It makes me feel worn out and kinda embarrassed to even say that.

Therapist: That replaying and over-preparing feels like a heavy weight. What would it be like to take one small step towards work anyway – just to make room for that next breath, or to test the idea that you're capable of handling whatever comes up?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the idea of taking one small step makes my chest tighten and I start imagining all the ways I could mess up. Maybe doing one tiny thing would feel a bit lighter, but I'm scared it'll just confirm I'm not good enough. Can we… take it really slow? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step without focusing on whether it's enough. What's one thing you value about yourself that could show up if you just did that small step – like being able to breathe, or showing up for a colleague?

Patient: I guess one thing I value is that I'm dependable — I do show up for my patients and try to be there for my coworkers even when I'm anxious. I don't know, saying that makes me a little uncomfortable, like I'm bragging, but maybe that could be the thing that shows up if I take a tiny step.

Therapist: Dependability sounds like a core strength you've noticed in yourself, especially when you're anxious. What's one tiny thing you could do right now to show up for someone – maybe a text to a coworker, or a gentle check-in with a patient?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could send a quick text to a coworker like, "Hey, how's your shift going? Need a hand with anything?" Saying it makes me a bit awkward, but maybe checking in would help me feel less useless.

Therapist: Let's experiment with that text right now. Instead of checking in because you're trying to be good, what if you sent it because you genuinely care about how your coworker is doing – without trying to fix anything?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try sending it, but it feels weird not to be trying to fix anything. Maybe something really simple like, "Hey, how's your shift going? Need anything?" Can you stay with me while I send it? I'm kinda nervous.

Therapist: You're about to send that text. I'm here with you. Before you hit send, notice your body for just one second – what's your breath like?

Patient: I don't know — it's shallow and quick, my chest feels tight. I'm kind of overwhelmed, but I'll try to take one slow breath before I send it.

Therapist: Take that slow breath now. You've got this tiny step. Send the text: "Hey, how's your shift going? Need anything?"

Patient: Okay — I took a slow breath and I sent it. My chest is still tight and my hands are a bit shaky, but there's a tiny relief and also this weird awkwardness, like I shouldn't feel proud. I don't know, can we keep sitting with this? I'm kind of worried it'll backfire.

Therapist: That awkwardness is really interesting – it's like your mind is already judging what you just did. What if, instead of trying to fix that feeling, you noticed where the tension is in your body right now – where does it feel most tight?

Patient: I don't know — mostly my chest and this tight knot between my shoulders, and my jaw's clenched. I keep wanting to brush it off or change the subject because it's... uncomfortable. Can we, I guess, talk about ways to keep doing small things without spiraling?

Therapist: It sounds like that knot is still there, and you're wondering how to keep doing small things without letting it take over. What's one small thing you've done recently that you can look back on and say, "I did that, even though I was uncomfortable"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess sending that text is one thing. Also last week I stayed an extra fifteen minutes with a patient who was upset instead of rushing off to redo my charting like I usually would, even though I was exhausted and my brain wanted to double-check everything. Saying that out loud feels weird, like I'm bragging, but it did help a bit — can we keep talking about how to make more of those tiny steps feel less scary?

Therapist: Those moments you mentioned – sending the text and staying with the patient – they might seem small, but they're actually showing up for yourself and others. What if, instead of trying to avoid those feelings of discomfort, you started to treat yourself with kindness for taking those small steps – like acknowledging that it takes courage to do them, even when it's hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess that sounds... nice, but it also makes me really uncomfortable. When I try to be kind to myself it feels like I'm making excuses or letting myself off the hook, like my family's going to say I'm weak or lazy. Can we take it really slow and maybe talk about small, specific ways I could acknowledge myself that don't feel like bragging?

Therapist: Let's focus on tiny, concrete actions that feel authentic to you. What if, when you catch yourself thinking "I did that," you simply say "That was a small step" – without adding any value judgment or explanation?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess calling it "a small step" might make it feel less huge, but it also feels weird, like I'm minimizing or talking myself into something. Can we take it really slow? I'm already getting kinda uncomfortable talking about this.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already feeling uncomfortable when we talk about this – your chest is tight, and your jaw is clenched. I'm here with you. What's one tiny sensation you notice right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — I'm noticing a tightness in my chest and this hot flush in my face, and my hands feel a bit clammy. I guess there's also this heavy, shame-y feeling under the tightness that makes me want to pull away. I'm not sure how noticing it helps, though.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your hands being clammy – it's a physical feeling that's happening right now. What would happen if you simply acknowledged that feeling without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — if I just noticed it, maybe it'd feel heavier, like I'm admitting something's wrong, but maybe it could also make the panic a bit less sharp. Saying that out loud makes me feel embarrassed and kind of exposed, like I'm whining. Can we go slower? My chest is really tight and I'm starting to get overwhelmed.

Therapist: Take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. When you exhale, notice that your body is still feeling tight in your chest – that's okay. What happens to your body when you pause for just one breath?

Patient: I don't know — when I pause for a breath it loosens a little bit, but then this wave of shame and frustration hits and my chest tightens again. My jaw clenches, my hands go clammy, and my mind immediately goes to something I did before and starts telling me I'm not enough. I guess I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: Just one tiny breath. Close your eyes, and without moving, bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. That's it. No thoughts, no feelings, no trying to change anything. Just that breath.

Patient: I don't know — I closed my eyes and did the breath and for a second it loosened, but then this heavy shame came back and I started replaying that thing I messed up and feeling worthless. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow way down? I feel like if we push this I might just shut down.

Therapist: Your eyes are still closed. The weight of shame is still there. What's the sensation of your feet on the ground? Is there any pressure, warmth, or sensation in your feet?

Patient: I don't know — my feet feel kind of numb and a bit heavy, like there's pressure under my heels. It should feel grounding but instead it brings up this hot shame and I want to shrink away. I'm not sure how noticing it helps and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: You said noticing it makes you want to "shrink away." What if, instead of shrinking away, you simply said to yourself, "I'm noticing that I want to shrink away"?

Patient: I don't know — saying that out loud feels weird, like I'm admitting I'm weak, and then this hot shame floods me and I get really pissed at myself. I'm not sure how saying it actually helps; it just makes me want to hide or shut down. Can we slow down a lot? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: You said you felt "pissed at yourself." What's the tone of that anger?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's kind of sharp and biting, like a voice that's impatient and disappointed, almost mocking. Sometimes it's loud and angry, like a slap, and other times it's low and simmering, making me freeze up. I'm getting really uncomfortable talking about it — can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: Your anger is very sharp and biting – it's like a physical presence in your body. What would it take for you to acknowledge that anger without judging it as "bad" or "wrong"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess maybe it would help to try saying something small like, "That's anger," without immediately tacking on "so I'm a failure." But that feels really risky, like if I don't judge it my family (and that voice in my head) will say I'm weak or lazy. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe try naming it once or twice while you stay with me?

Therapist: Let's try something tiny. When that voice says, "You're a failure," what happens in your body right now, just for one breath?

Patient: I don't know — when that voice says "You're a failure," my chest drops and my breath kind of stops for a second, then my jaw clamps and this tight knot between my shoulders gets worse. My face goes hot, my hands get clammy, and there's this heavy shame that makes me want to curl up and run away from it — I get really overwhelmed. Can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: Your chest has dropped, your breath has stopped, and your jaw is clamped. That's where you are right now, in that moment.

Patient: I don't know — my chest feels like it's caving in, my breath's shallow, and my jaw's really clenched. I want to pull away because it's getting too intense. Can we slow way down and do one tiny grounding thing, like naming three things I can see without talking about why this happened?

Therapist: What are three things you can see right now, without trying to talk about the tightness or the shame?

Patient: I don't know — I can see the lamp on my desk, my phone with the text I just sent, and my scrubs draped over the chair. Saying that feels kinda exposed and awkward; can we keep it slow?

Therapist: Those objects are really tangible – you can see them right now. Your hands could rest on them, if that feels safe.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can rest my hands on my phone and the lamp. The lamp's cool and steady under my fingers and the phone feels smooth, which oddly makes my chest loosen a tiny bit, but the shame's still sitting heavy and my jaw's clenched. Can we keep it really slow? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: What's the sensation of your fingers wrapping around the phone or the lamp? Is there any tension in your fingers or your hands?

Patient: I don't know — my fingers are kind of tight around the phone, like my knuckles are white and there's tension up into my forearms. My hands are clammy and a little shaky, and it makes me feel ashamed and like I should hide. Can we slow down a lot? I'm getting pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist: Your hands are shaking and clammy – that's a physical sensation. You've already identified the shame as something that makes you want to hide. What would happen to that shame if you simply acknowledged it right where it is, without trying to move from it?

Patient: I'm not sure — I don't know. If I actually said out loud, "That's shame," it feels like I'm making it real and admitting I'm weak, but maybe it would stop stabbing so sharp if I named it. I guess I could try saying it once, but I'm already getting really overwhelmed and would like to go super slow while you stay with me.
