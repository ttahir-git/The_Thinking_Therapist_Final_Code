Patient: I'm an accountant and lately I get really angry and frustrated, especially during conversations about money or bills. The ongoing financial stress seems to feed my OCD and makes small things feel huge, I guess. I don't know, I don't really like talking about this so it feels awkward.

Therapist: When you feel that anger rising during conversations about money, what's the first small thing that starts to feel overwhelming to you – is it a specific number, a bill due date, or something else?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it's hearing a specific number—like someone saying "the rent's X" or there's a surprise charge or late fee. Also when a bill reminder pops up and I can't immediately tell if I paid it, that tiny doubt makes everything feel urgent and I get tense and snappy.

Therapist: That knot in your stomach when you hear a specific number or see a bill reminder is really connected to your value of certainty – you want to know you've paid everything on time. What would it be like to make room for that uncertainty, just for a tiny moment, so you could still take action and pay the bill?

Patient: I don't know, I guess making room for the uncertainty sounds... really hard — like I'd still have that knot but maybe it wouldn't feel like an emergency. Maybe I could pause for a minute and check my account or set a quick reminder before reacting, but I'm not sure I could actually do that when I'm already upset. I feel weird talking about this — can we maybe focus on practical steps I could try instead of digging too deep into the feeling?

Therapist: You've noticed that when you're already upset, pausing to check your account can actually reduce the knot in your stomach. What would happen to that knot if you made checking your account a small, 30-second pause – just before reacting to the bill reminder?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually paused and checked for 30 seconds the knot might loosen a bit, like from tight to just annoyed. But even then I'd probably nitpick what I saw and worry I missed something, so I'm not sure it'd calm me enough. Can we go over a simple, step-by-step checklist I could use in those 30 seconds instead of talking more about the feeling?

Therapist: Here's a simple 30-second checklist you can use: 

1. Take a deep breath in for 5 seconds
2. Say to yourself, "I'll check my account"
3. Look up your account balance quickly
4. Take another deep breath out for 5 seconds

This small action replaces the analysis with a concrete step, allowing you to reduce anxiety before reacting to the bill reminder.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that sounds... doable on paper, but if I'm already heated I'll probably forget the steps or start nitpicking what I saw. Could we make a 1‑sentence script I can actually say in the moment—like "Let me check and get back to you in 10 minutes"—and a concrete follow-up for when I still worry after checking?

Therapist: Here's a possible script: "Let me check on that for you right now." This acknowledges your need for clarity without committing to a specific outcome – now, you can focus on the action of checking your account and follow it up with a concrete next step.

Follow-up: When you've checked your account and still worry about what you saw, you can say, "I paid that bill last week. It's good to know it's taken care of." This acknowledges the worry and connects it to a tangible action (paying the bill) that you can do now.

Patient: I don't know, I guess "Let me check and get back to you in 10 minutes" sounds better — it gives me a buffer so I don't snap. But even after I check I just replay it in my head and worry I missed something, so saying "It's paid" probably won't stop the loop. Can we come up with a really short line I can tell myself after checking that might actually quiet it down?

Therapist: Here's a possible line: "It's okay, it's done." This simple phrase acknowledges that the task is complete and the thought loop has room to breathe.

Patient: I don't know, I guess "It's okay, it's done" feels a bit vague. Maybe something like "I've paid it — that's enough for now" would land better for me. I'm not sure it'll stop the replaying though; can we try that a few times?

Therapist: Let's practice saying it out loud: "I've paid it — that's enough for now." Repeat it 3 times, slowly and with intention. As you say each phrase, notice how your body feels and whether the thought loop starts to shift. Take a deep breath and try it again.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try. I’ve paid it — that’s enough for now. I’ve paid it — that’s enough for now. I’ve paid it — that’s enough for now. I don't know, it loosens my chest a bit but my head’s still replaying it and I feel kind of awkward doing this — can we try a slightly more concrete line, like "Payment's posted; I'll check again in an hour"?

Therapist: That's a great approach! Using a concrete phrase like "Payment's posted; I'll check again in an hour" gives you a specific task to look forward to and takes the focus off replaying the past. Notice how your body feels when you say that phrase – does it feel like it's taking some pressure off?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it does take a little pressure off — my chest eases some and I can breathe a bit, but my head still replays the details. Saying "I'll check again in an hour" helps because it's concrete, but then I start worrying about what I'll find and feel guilty for not checking right away. Can we make the follow‑up more practical, like setting a timer or having a tiny checklist for that hour so I don't just ruminate?

Therapist: Let's add a tiny concrete action to that phrase: "Payment's posted; I'll check again in an hour – 5-minute timer, no more checking before then." This adds a specific, short-term task (setting the timer) to help you stay on track and avoid rumination.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could help a little. I'm worried I'll still sneak peeks — could we add a concrete backup like "set the 5‑minute timer and do two quick spreadsheet rows" or a short walk so I'm less likely to check?

Therapist: I love the idea of adding a concrete backup action. Let's make it even more specific: "Set the 5-minute timer and do two quick spreadsheet rows to update the total payment received." This way, you're not just setting a timer, but taking a tangible action that helps you stay on track.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could help. When I'm already heated I still think I'll sneak a peek — doing two spreadsheet rows feels like I'm still stuck on numbers instead of stepping away. I feel weird saying this, but maybe instead put my phone away and take a 5‑minute walk or do two deep breaths; also, I'm worried I'll snap if someone keeps asking — can we come up with a short line I can say if they push me while I'm on the timer?

Therapist: It makes sense that taking a 5-minute walk or doing deep breaths might feel more like work when you're already stressed. Let's try a different approach: "I need a minute – can you give me a minute to step away from my screen?" This line acknowledges their question, sets a clear boundary, and gives you time to breathe. If they push you while you're on the timer, you can say: "I'm on my timer – I need to stay focused for 5 minutes. Can we catch up later?" This line reiterates your boundary and gives you permission to prioritize your own work.

Patient: I guess that first line could work, though saying it already feels kind of heavy and I'm wiped out. If they push, a shorter one like "I'm on my timer — five minutes" might be easier to actually use, but I don't know, I'm worried I'll still cave.

Therapist: Your concern is that the shorter line might not be enough. Let's try adding a tiny bit of assertiveness: "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." This line still sets a clear boundary, but also acknowledges that you're doing your best to manage your time.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could work. Saying it already feels heavy and awkward — can we just practice the short line once so it's less weird when someone pushes?

Therapist: Let's practice: "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." Say it out loud with conviction, even if it feels awkward at first. Notice how your body feels as you say it.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." I don't know, that felt kind of weird but maybe doable — can we do it one more time?

Therapist: Let's try it one more time: "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." This time, focus on your breath and the physical sensation of your body as you say it. Imagine yourself responding confidently to someone who pushes you.

Patient: "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." I don't know, that felt heavy and kind of hollow, and I tried to focus on my breath but it's hard — I'm wiped. I guess could you roleplay someone pushing me so I can try a response?

Therapist: I'll play the role of someone pushing you, and you can respond with the line we practiced: "I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now." Go ahead and start by saying your name and the situation (e.g., "Hey, what's going on with the payment?").

Patient: Alex. Uh — about the payment… I'm on my timer — five minutes. That's all I can do right now. I don't know, I guess I just need that time.

Therapist: That's exactly what I need. Can you just give me that 5 minutes to finish this one thing, and then we can talk about it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess okay, five minutes. I'll set a timer and step away, but I'm already wiped and worried I'll cave if they keep pushing — can you remind me after five so I don't spiral?

Therapist: When the timer goes off, just take a few deep breaths, stretch, and remind yourself that you made it through 5 minutes without checking the payment. You can do that.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try that — when it goes off I'll take a few deep breaths and try to notice I made it through. I'm kind of wiped and already worried I'll cave if they keep pushing. If that happens, what’s one really quick thing I can do to not check right away?

Therapist: If you feel like caving, just pause the conversation and say, "I need a sip of water." That's a tiny step that gives you a brief moment to pause and breathe before responding.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could work — it's small enough I might actually do it. But I'm wiped and worried I'll cave if they keep pushing; what's one more tiny line I can say if they follow me while I'm stepping away?

Therapist: If they follow you while you're stepping away, you can say, "I appreciate you waiting for me." This line acknowledges their effort without committing to checking the payment right away.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could help, but it feels awkward and kind of heavy. Can we practice a firmer line I can use if they keep following me?

Therapist: Let's try: "I need some space right now. Can you take a minute?" This line is direct, clear, and sets a boundary without apologizing for needing time.

Patient: "I need some space right now. Can you take a minute?"

I don't know, that felt kind of heavy and awkward but maybe usable. I'm wiped and it's hard to keep going — could we roleplay someone who doesn't give me space so I can try a firmer line?

Therapist: I'll play the role of someone who doesn't give you space. You can start by saying "I need some space right now. Can you take a minute?" and I'll respond as someone who pushes back.

Patient: I need some space right now. Can you take a minute? I don't know, I'm just... really wiped and close to snapping.

Therapist: Come on, just a minute more. We can talk about this then. You're not going anywhere until we figure this out.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can't do that right now. Please, just give me that minute — I'm wiped and I feel like I'll snap if you keep pushing.

Therapist: You're not listening to me! We have to discuss this now, not later. What's going on with you, anyway?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm just overwhelmed — the bills and that constant doubt — and when you keep pushing I feel like I'm going to snap. Please, can you give me that minute to step away and set a timer?

Therapist: No way, you're not walking away from this. We're done talking about it when I get back from my call. Just wait here.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I really can't do this right now. Please give me the five minutes — I'll set a timer and step away. If you keep pushing, I feel like I'm going to snap, so please don't follow me.

Therapist: Fine. You got it. Take your five minutes. But when you're done, we're picking up right where we left off.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll set the timer and step away. I don't know if I can stop checking, so can you please remind me when the five minutes are up? I'm already wiped and this feels like a lot.
