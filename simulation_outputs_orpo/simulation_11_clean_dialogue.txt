Patient: I'm a senior social worker and lately this new demanding program has left me feeling flattened — persistent sadness and no motivation, and it's starting to mess with my relationship. I have PTSD from past work-related stuff and the pressure just makes everything worse. Honestly, I'm skeptical this'll help — I've tried fixes before and they didn't stick, so how is talking about it supposed to change that?

Therapist: When you feel like giving up because the program's demands are too much, what's one thing about your relationship that you're avoiding or struggling to connect with because of how overwhelmed you feel?

Patient: I mostly avoid being emotionally honest — instead of saying I'm drowning I withdraw, throw myself into tasks, or shut down so I don't have to burden them. That means less intimacy and more resentment on both sides. I've tried admitting I need help before and it didn't change the workload or how I felt, so... how is saying it now supposed to help?

Therapist: Before you say anything about needing help, what's one small thing about how you feel when you withdraw from your partner (e.g., feeling unconnected, worried about their reaction) that matters most to you?

Patient: Guilt — I feel like I'm letting them carry everything and that eats at me. I end up avoiding it because I'm afraid they'll get tired of me, but I've said that before and it didn't change anything, so how is pointing that out supposed to help?

Therapist: That guilt is what matters, because when you withdraw, you're not just avoiding your partner – you're also avoiding being the partner they need you to be. What would it take for you to feel like you're showing up for them in a way that feels truly connected, even if it's hard to talk about it?

Patient: Maybe something small and reliable — a five-minute check-in each evening, or me saying plainly, "I'm tired and I need a break," before I shut down, and one shared thing a week so we don't drift completely apart. Realistically, I doubt it'll last; I try those promises and burnout just eats them away after a few days. How is a checklist or a short conversation supposed to fix the exhaustion and guilt that keep me withdrawing?

Therapist: Those specific actions – the check-in and sharing – are actually tiny steps towards showing up for your partner, not because they'll fix everything, but because they'll give you a tiny spark of connection that might make the exhaustion and guilt a little more bearable. Can you imagine holding onto that spark for just one minute, even if it's just to breathe together while you're checking in?

Patient: I can picture it — one minute of breathing together feels tiny and almost silly, but maybe it's something I could muster. I don't know how I'd keep doing it when I'm already so drained, though; I've tried tiny routines before and they vanish after a few days, so how is this supposed to stick when everything else keeps collapsing?

Therapist: That one minute of breathing together might feel silly now, but what if you tied it to something you already know you value – like the safety of your home, or the love of your partner – and made it your tiny anchor for just one minute? For example, "I'll breathe with you for just 1 minute because I love the sound of our home being quiet together."

Patient: I can picture doing that — like tying the minute to turning off the TV or brushing my teeth so I don't have to remember it out of thin air. But I'm skeptical: I've set little anchors before and they vanish after a few days when I'm burned out, and then the guilt just comes back harder. So how is this supposed to stick when the real problem is exhaustion and my PTSD, not a missing habit?

Therapist: That anchor – tying the minute to a specific, tangible thing you already do every day – is actually about anchoring the tiny action to your own survival, not just a habit. When you're exhausted and burnt out, what's one tiny thing you need to survive that moment, just to breathe again?

Patient: I think a physical anchor — literally sitting down, putting my feet flat on the floor, and taking five slow breaths while holding a warm mug or a glass of water — is the one tiny thing that might let me breathe again. I've tried grounding and tiny rituals before and they usually fade when the PTSD and exhaustion kick in, so how is this supposed to help when those things just bulldoze whatever I set up?

Therapist: That physical anchor – sitting down, feeling the floor beneath you, taking slow breaths while holding something tangible – is actually about creating a tiny space between your body's fight response and the rest of your brain. It's not about avoiding PTSD or exhaustion; it's about noticing that you're already there, and that noticing might be enough to create a tiny gap for something else to show up.

Patient: I get the idea of creating a tiny gap, and I can picture the mug and the breaths, but honestly I've tried grounding like that before and when my PTSD spikes the gap gets bulldozed — I can't even notice. How is that noticing supposed to lead to anything more than a momentary pause? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now; can we slow down and talk about what to do when that pause disappears five minutes later?

Therapist: That's a great question – what happens when the pause is gone? It's not about trying to hold onto the pause; it's about what you do with the moment you notice the gap is gone. What would you do instead of trying to push through the overwhelm?

Patient: I'd stop trying to bulldoze through and do a quick triage: tell my partner I need 20 minutes, move anything nonessential off my plate, sit down with my mug and do five slow breaths while a timer runs. If that pause evaporates, Plan B is to call my supervisor or a trusted colleague/friend to pick up the slack or take me out for a short walk so I don't spiral alone. I get that sounds basic — I've tried timers and delegating before, so how is that supposed to change the way my PTSD hits me like a freight train?

Therapist: That triage plan isn't just about managing overwhelm; it's about making space for your own survival. You're saying, "I'm not going to let this task destroy me right now." By having a clear plan for when the pause disappears, you're giving yourself permission to prioritize your own well-being – and that's a value worth fighting for.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense in theory — a triage plan feels like a boundary I could actually use. But when my PTSD hits, my executive function just collapses and even timers or calls feel impossible. How do I make that plan actually doable in the middle of a freight-train panic? I think a very concrete script I can say to my partner or supervisor, and one tiny, automatic cue to trigger the plan, might actually help — can we work on those now?

Therapist: Let's start with the script. What's one sentence you can say to your partner or supervisor that acknowledges your overwhelm and needs their support? For example, "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need to take a break – can you help me figure out what to do next?" What about the tiny cue? What's one small thing you can do when you feel the panic starting to rise (like taking a deep breath, noticing your feet on the floor, or looking at a nearby object)?

Patient: Okay — here's one sentence I can use: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need 20 minutes to regroup — can you pause/cover this for me until then?"  

One tiny cue: plant both feet flat, pick up a mug or glass with both hands and take five slow breaths while quietly saying "20 minutes" to myself; if I don't have a mug, I’ll squeeze my thumb and index finger together once and say the same phrase.  

I know this sounds like the same stuff I've tried before and probably will forget when panic hits — so how is this actually going to be any different? Can we make a simple backup if I can't manage the cue in the moment?

Therapist: That script and cue combination isn't about being perfect; it's about creating a tiny anchor that can help you navigate the panic. The phrase "20 minutes" becomes a simple reminder that you're not alone, and that you have a plan to get through this moment. The physical action of planting your feet, picking up the mug, and taking slow breaths creates a tiny gap between your body's fight response and your brain – a gap that can be used to create space for something else to show up. If the cue gets lost, you can always fall back on the phrase "I need 20 minutes" – a simple reminder that you're prioritizing your own survival.

Patient: Alright — I'll give the "20 minutes" line a shot, but if they're not available or they blow it off, it just falls apart. Can we make two concrete backups: a one-tap automated text I can send that says "Need 20 minutes, please cover me," and a simple default action my partner/supervisor agrees to (like pause the task or take calls)? Also can we role-play now — you be my partner so I can practice saying it and see how it lands, because I need to know what to do when it doesn't go as planned.

Therapist: Let's create the one-tap automated text: "Need 20 minutes, please cover me." That's a clear and concise message that gets the point across. For the default action, let's agree that if your partner/supervisor is available, they'll pause the task or take calls for 20 minutes while you regroup. That way, you've got a clear plan for when the original cue gets lost.

Now, let's role-play. I'll be your partner, and you can practice saying the "20 minutes" line. Remember, the goal is to sound calm and clear, even if you're feeling anxious. I'll respond as your partner would, and we can see how it goes.

Go ahead and say the line: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need 20 minutes to regroup — can you pause/cover this for me until then?"

Patient: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need 20 minutes to regroup — can you pause/cover this for me until then?"

Okay, that felt tight and a little fake coming out of my mouth. How is that supposed to help if they just blow me off or I can't get the words out when I'm panicking?

Therapist: When you said the line, your body tensed up, and your voice sounded tight – that's because your brain was trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable. The problem is that this physical response actually makes it harder to communicate effectively. What if, instead of trying to say the line perfectly, you could use it as a chance to take a tiny breath and connect with your physical body? Try it again, this time noticing how your body feels as you say the line. Focus on your breath, not the words.

Patient: Alright, I tried it again — my chest tightened, my voice came out thin, and my hands went a bit numb; taking that breath eased my shoulders a hair but it still felt forced and awkward. I get the point about noticing my body, but how is that supposed to make them actually honor the 20 minutes when they've brushed me off before? Can we slow down a bit — walk through what I do if they say no or ignore the text so I don't just spiral?

Therapist: Let's walk through what you do if they say no or ignore the text. Take it one step at a time. When they respond with a no or ignore the text, what's the first thing you do? Do you panic, get angry, or try to justify yourself? Or can you take a tiny pause to notice the physical sensation in your body and breathe for a moment? That small pause can give you a chance to choose how you respond.

Here's an example of what you could do: You text "Need 20 minutes, please cover me" and they respond with a no or ignore the text. You notice your chest tighten and your hands feel numb. Instead of panicking, you take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, feeling your shoulders relax a little. Then, you pause for a moment before responding with a calm, clear message like: "I understand you're busy, but I really need that time to regroup. Can we agree on 20 minutes or find a solution that works for both of us?"

Remember, your goal is not to convince them to honor the 20 minutes, but to take care of yourself and communicate your needs clearly.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the script and the breathing, but honestly if they say no or ignore it I usually freeze: chest tightens, fingers go numb, I can’t even get the one-tap text out. My practical fallback would be to leave the room, set a 20-minute timer, put on headphones and do the mug/grounding — or call my supervisor to cover me if I'm at work — but I need to practice that because when panic hits the plan evaporates. Can we role-play two scenarios now: one where my partner says no, and one where they ignore the text, and coach me on what to do when the breathing pause doesn’t calm me?

Therapist: Let's get started. We'll role-play two scenarios: one where your partner says no, and one where they ignore the text. Remember, the goal is to practice your plan, not to "win" or convince them to honor your needs. When the breathing pause doesn't calm you, we'll work on what to do next.

**Scenario 1: Partner says no**

I'll respond with a no: "Sorry, I won't be able to cover you right now. I have a deadline to meet." You've sent the text and we're in the moment. What do you do?

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, and we'll go from there.)

Patient: If they say no, my plan is to do what I can control: notice the tightening in my chest, take one slow breath to buy a second, and then say a short, firm line before I leave the room. Script I'd use: "I hear you — I know you're swamped, but I still need 20 minutes to regroup. I'm going to step out and set a timer; please cover any calls until I'm back."  

Then I walk away, set the 20-minute timer, put on headphones, grab the mug, and do the five breaths. If they're still angry or escalate, I call my supervisor or a trusted colleague to take over — or I just stay out of the situation until the timer's up.  

I know this sounds like the same stuff that evaporates when panic hits, so can we role-play that exact line and have you respond like my partner who says "No" and then escalates? I want to practice staying with the plan when it gets messy.

Therapist: Let's do it. I'll respond as your partner, and we'll go through the scenario. Remember, my goal is to escalate the situation, not to "win" the argument. We'll start with the "no" response, and then I'll add more tension to see how you handle it.

Here we go:

"Sorry, I won't be able to cover you right now. I have a deadline to meet, and this project is already behind schedule. If you're not available for 20 minutes, I'll have to handle all calls myself."

(Note: I'll respond with a bit more anger and frustration to simulate the escalation. Your goal is to stay calm, notice the physical sensations, and use your script to maintain control.)

Go ahead and respond with the script.

Patient: "I hear you — I know you're swamped, but I still need 20 minutes to regroup. I'm going to step out and set a timer; please cover any calls until I'm back."

My chest's already tight and my voice shook a bit, so I take a slow breath as I say it and force my shoulders down. Then I leave the room, set the timer, put on headphones, grab the mug, and do the five breaths — and if they escalate or keep pushing, I call my supervisor to cover me.  

Okay, respond as the partner escalating.

Therapist: "Are you kidding me? You're just going to walk out on me like that? I've got a meeting in 10 minutes, and you're just going to leave me to deal with all these calls? This is ridiculous. You're not even listening to me."

(I'll respond with a bit more anger and frustration, trying to get under your skin. Your goal is to stay calm, notice the physical sensations, and use your plan to maintain control.)

How do you respond?

Patient: "I hear you — I know you're swamped, and I'm sorry. My chest's already tight but I need 20 minutes to regroup, so I'm going to step out now and set a timer; please cover any calls until I'm back. If you can't, I'll call my supervisor to have them take over. I don't know if this'll fix everything, but I need to do this now."

Therapist: *I take a deep breath, trying to calm down* "Fine. You need 20 minutes. I'll cover the calls. But this isn't over. We'll talk about this later."

*I start to walk away, but then turn back* "And by the way, this isn't just about you needing a break. This is about how you're always putting your own needs before mine. It's not fair."

*The timer goes off, and I look at you expectantly*

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, but now that the timer is up, I'll give you space to handle the situation with your supervisor. Your goal is to stay calm and use the plan to maintain control.)

Patient: I felt a little lighter after the 20 minutes — I sat with the mug, did the breaths, and the chest loosened enough to think straight — but when you said that about me always putting my needs first, I got hit with guilt and shame right away. I don't want to blow up this moment; can we agree to table the big conversation for a set time when we're both calm? A short line I'd use now is: "I hear you, and I'm sorry you feel hurt — I need us to talk about this when we're both calmer; can we set 30 minutes tonight to really work through it?"  

I've scheduled talk-time before and it turned into the same fight, so how is setting a time actually going to be different? Can we role-play me saying that de-escalation line and you respond like my partner who is still angry, so I can practice staying calm and steering us to the later conversation?

Therapist: *I look at you with a mix of anger and frustration* "You think 20 minutes is enough? You think you can just walk away from this conversation and I'll be okay with it? You're always doing this, always prioritizing your own needs over mine."

*I take a deep breath, trying to calm down slightly*

"I want to talk about this, but I don't want to do it when I'm still angry. Can we...can we talk about it tonight when we're both calmer?"

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, still trying to assert my needs, but slightly calmer since you've set the timer. Your goal is to stay calm and steer the conversation towards the agreed-upon time.)

Go ahead and say the de-escalation line, and I'll respond as your partner.

Patient: "I hear you, and I'm sorry you're hurt. I need us to talk when we're both calmer — can we set aside 30 minutes tonight at 8 to really work through this? I don't know if that will fix everything, but I think it's better than trying to sort it out while we're both wound up."

Therapist: *I nod slightly, still visibly frustrated* "Yeah, 8 pm sounds good. I'll try to calm down by then. But I need you to understand, this isn't just about us talking. This is about how you're consistently putting your own needs first, without even considering mine. That's not fair."

*I pause, taking a deep breath* "But I appreciate that you're willing to listen and talk about it. That means something."

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, still trying to assert my needs and emotions, but slightly more calm since you've set the clear boundary and agreed on the time. Your goal is to stay calm and continue steering the conversation towards the agreed-upon time.)

Patient: Okay — 8 pm it is. I hear you, and I don't want that pattern either, but I'm skeptical schedules fix things — can we agree on a short agenda and a rule: 30 minutes, no interruptions, five minutes each to speak our feelings, then ten minutes for problem-solving? I need something concrete like that or I know I'll freeze or retreat again.

Therapist: *I nod, slightly surprised by your willingness to create a plan* "Okay, that sounds like a good start. I don't want to promise anything, but I'm willing to try. What if we agree on that agenda, and we stick to it? No interruptions, five minutes each to share our feelings, and then ten minutes to work through the problem together?"

*I pause, looking for your reaction* "And just to make it clear, no blame-shifting or criticizing each other's feelings. We're just trying to understand each other's perspectives and find a solution that works for both of us."

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, acknowledging your need for structure and concrete steps, while also being mindful of your concerns about avoiding blame and criticism. Your goal is to agree on a clear plan that balances speaking feelings and problem-solving.)

Patient: Alright — 8 pm, 30 minutes: five minutes each to speak, ten minutes for problem-solving, no interruptions, no blame. I'll set a timer and put the agenda on a sticky note so it's visible; pragmatic steps help me stick to things. I'm skeptical it'll hold when one of us gets heated — how do we enforce the "no interruptions" rule in the moment? Can we agree on a single pause-word or a physical cue (like whoever holds the mug gets to speak) so it's not just goodwill when we're both wound up?

Therapist: *I nod thoughtfully* "That's a great point about the timer and sticky note. To make the 'no interruptions' rule more concrete, let's agree to use a specific pause-word: 'Connect.' When either of us says 'Connect,' we pause and acknowledge each other's turn before continuing. No matter how heated we get, we can use that one word to reset and show respect for each other's time."

*I pause, considering another idea* "And to make it even more tangible, let's also agree that whoever holds the mug gets to speak first. That way, when you're holding the mug, you know it's your turn to start. When I'm holding the mug, I'll make sure to listen carefully and wait for my turn."

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, acknowledging your need for concrete steps to enforce the "no interruptions" rule, while also suggesting a simple yet effective solution that leverages the physical object of the mug to signal respect for each other's time.)

Patient: Okay — I can try the "Connect" word and mug rule, but I'm skeptical it'll stick or won't be turned into a power move ("You get the mug, I get to talk"). What I need now is to actually practice using the pause-word and the mug so it feels less awkward — can we role-play a few quick scenes: one where I say "Connect" and it works, one where they ignore it, and one where they try to weaponize the mug so I can practice responding without freezing? I'm tired and a bit anxious about this, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's do a few quick role-plays. Remember, these are just simulations to help you practice, not actual conversations.

**Scene 1: "Connect" works**
I'll start by holding the mug and saying, "Hey, I need to talk about something." You respond with "Connect," and we take a pause. Then, you speak your thoughts, and I listen attentively. Let's go!

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, allowing you to practice using the pause-word and mug rule.)

Go ahead and respond with "Connect"!

Patient: Connect.

Okay — that actually made me pause and my shoulders eased a bit; felt awkward saying it, but it opened space to speak. Let's do the ignore and the mug-weapon scenes next so I can practice staying steady when it goes sideways.

Therapist: Let's move on to the next two scenes.

**Scene 2: Ignoring the "Connect" word**
I'll start by holding the mug and saying, "Let's not waste time on this conversation." You respond with "Connect," but I ignore it and continue talking. How do you respond to the interruption?

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, testing your ability to stay calm and focused when the other person tries to derail the conversation.)

Go ahead and respond!

Patient: If they ignore "Connect," I try one calm, firm reminder and a concrete action I can actually do in the moment so I don't freeze.

Script: "Connect — I'm asking you to pause. If you can't stop now, I'm going to step away for 20 minutes and we’ll pick this up at 8." Then I stand up, leave the room, set the timer, put on headphones, and do the grounding (mug/5 breaths). My chest's already tight just thinking about it, but having that short script and a physical action helps me move past the freeze.

Okay, I'm ready for Scene 3 — the mug gets weaponized and they try to control who speaks. Can we role-play that one now so I can practice staying steady?

Therapist: Let's do Scene 3. I'll start by holding the mug and saying, "I don't think we need to talk about this right now. You're just going to keep talking until I say yes." You respond with "Connect," but I use the mug to block your voice or make you repeat yourself. How do you respond to this attempt to control the conversation?

(Note: I'll respond as your partner would, using the mug as a physical barrier to test your ability to stay calm and focused while maintaining the conversation.)

Patient: "Connect — I asked you to pause." If they keep using the mug as a barrier or try to control me, I'd hold my ground: "If you can't stop now, I'm stepping out for 20 minutes. We will pick this up at 8." Then I actually get up, set the timer, put on headphones, grab the mug (or squeeze my fingers), and do the five breaths so I don't freeze.

Honestly, that sounds confrontational and I hate having to be that rigid, but when they weaponize the mug I need a concrete exit plan or I implode. Can we run that scene now — you escalate with the mug and I practice the exact words and the movement so it isn't just theory?
