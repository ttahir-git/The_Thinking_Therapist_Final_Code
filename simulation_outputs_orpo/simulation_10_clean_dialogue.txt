Patient: I've been feeling totally stuck and directionless — like being an accountant is the only thing tying me to any kind of identity. Whenever I try to picture anything else, my brain goes straight to worst-case: I burn out, start making mistakes, get fired, spiral into debt, lose my apartment, and end up completely alone and back with my ex just because it's the only familiar thing left. I know it sounds extreme, but in my head that's definitely the future waiting for me.

Therapist: That sense of being tied to accounting by fear of failure is really draining. When you picture yourself exploring other paths, what's one thing you're avoiding doing – a small action – that feels like it would lead to that worst-case scenario?

Patient: I keep avoiding telling my manager I'm burned out. If I do, they'll see me as unreliable, start micromanaging or quietly cut my hours, then find a way to let me go, I won't be able to pay rent, my savings vanish, my credit collapses, and I'll end up crashing back with my ex because it's the only place I can afford — it's this whole chain that I can already picture. I know it sounds dramatic, but that's the only real outcome my brain accepts.

Therapist: That fear of job loss is creating a tight squeeze. What would it take for you to be willing to tell your manager you're burned out, just for a tiny moment – like taking 5 deep breaths, or writing down one small step you'd take if you did – to see if that would change the chain of thoughts in your head?

Patient: I guess I could force myself to write one sentence — like, “I’m feeling burned out” — and not even send it, just to prove I can say it. But the minute I imagine doing that, my mind goes straight to them thinking I’m unreliable, then micromanaging, then finding a reason to let me go, and everything collapses — rent, savings, credit, and then back to my ex because I have no other options. Five breaths sounds useless next to that chain; I can’t make my brain believe a tiny pause will stop the avalanche.

Therapist: That mental avalanche feels like it's coming from your brain's "what-if" engine. Can you name the one thing you're "what-if"-ing about – the part that says "they'll let me go" – without judgment, just for a moment?

Patient: It's the voice that says if I show any weakness — even one sentence about being burned out — they'll instantly label me unreliable and start watching me for mistakes. That watching becomes documentation, HR gets involved, they put me on a plan, and I'm fired; after that everything I have just unravels. I know people might say that's extreme, but my brain's like a fortune-telling machine and that's the only plot it can see.

Therapist: That voice saying you're unreliable is warning you that your work matters – it's tied to your identity. What would it take for you to take a tiny step towards saying "I'm burned out" without labeling yourself unreliable, just to show that your worth isn't tied to that one moment?

Patient: Maybe I could write that one sentence and stash it in my notes, but the second I picture actually saying it, my brain fast-forwards to them labeling me unreliable, then micromanaging, then finding a reason to fire me and everything collapsing. For me to even try, I'd need some kind of guarantee that speaking up won't start that chain—like HR or my manager explicitly saying it's safe—but that feels impossible and out of my control. I'm trying to see how a tiny step could matter, but honestly I'm stuck and frustrated because nothing small seems capable of stopping the avalanche my mind insists is coming.

Therapist: In that moment when you say "I'm burned out," what's the tiny thing that might actually matter to you – not what you think others will think, but what you value about your work or yourself? For example, is it that you'll be able to take care of your health, or show up with more energy, or do a job that matters to you?

Patient: I think what would actually matter is just a tiny bit of breathing room — being able to sleep, think clearly, and not feel like I'm one mistake from collapse. But the minute I imagine asking for that, my brain says that's the proof my manager needs that I'm unreliable, they'll start documenting me, HR will put me on a plan, and I'm fired, and then everything falls apart. I want that relief, but I can't make myself believe anyone would respond with support instead of using it as ammunition.

Therapist: When you imagine saying "I'm burned out," what's the thought that says you're asking for proof of your unreliability? Can you look at that thought and say, "That's what happens when I'm vulnerable – people see it as a weakness"? Instead of trying to protect against that, what if you were to notice that thought without judgment, just as it is?

Patient: It's basically the thought: "If I'm vulnerable they'll see I'm unreliable and that'll be the proof they need to push me out." I can name it, but the moment I admit it to myself my brain fast-forwards — documenting, HR, a performance plan, getting fired, losing my apartment, savings gone, and somehow ending up back with my ex — like it's already written. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't convince myself of any other ending, and it's making me feel stuck and furious.

Therapist: Notice what just happens when you say that thought to yourself – you immediately start imagining the worst-case scenario. What if, for just a tiny moment, you could say that thought without judgment, without trying to "stop" it or change it? Would you be able to simply observe it, like a cloud passing by, without getting caught up in the story it's telling you?

Patient: I wish I could, but the second I try to just notice it, my brain grabs the plot and runs — documenting, HR, fired, eviction, back with my ex. I can say the thought out loud, “If I’m vulnerable they’ll see I’m unreliable,” but even saying it feels like lighting a fuse. I don’t know how to be an observer — it feels impossible and it makes me angry and stuck.

Therapist: When you say the thought to yourself, "If I'm vulnerable they'll see I'm unreliable," what's the physical sensation in your body – tension, tightness, a knot in your stomach? Can you notice that sensation, just for a moment, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Yeah—when I say that thought I get this tight, hollow knot in my stomach, my chest clamps down, breathing gets shallow, my jaw clenches and my hands go clammy like my body's already bracing for impact. The second I even try to notice it, my brain treats the sensation like proof and starts the whole movie again—manager notices, they document me, HR, fired, can’t pay rent, back with my ex—it's like the body and the story feed each other. I'm getting really overwhelmed just saying that; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the weight of your body in this chair. What's one small thing you can see, hear, or feel right now, without trying to change it or analyze it? For example, is there a faint hum of the air conditioner, a tickle on the back of your neck, or the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I can hear the AC humming and a faint buzz of traffic, and I can feel my feet on the floor and the chair under me. But the second I pay attention, my brain twists it into more evidence for the story — “they’ll notice the change, they’ll document me, HR, fired, homeless” — and the movie starts again. I’m getting claustrophobic saying that; can we slow down?

Therapist: Just before your brain starts spinning the story again, pause for one tiny breath. Take a deep, slow inhale, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "Wait." That's all. Just "wait" – no judgment, no story, no analysis. Let the pause be the only thing that matters for one second.

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I took a slow breath and on the exhale I told myself "Wait." For maybe half a second it was quieter, but then my brain slammed the brakes and the movie kicked back in — manager notices, they document me, HR, fired, rent gone, back with my ex — and that hollow knot spiked again. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down? I don't know how to keep that pause from turning into the avalanche.

Therapist: As you take that slow breath and say "Wait," notice what your body is doing right now – is your jaw still clenched, your chest still tight, or is there a tiny release? That small physical sensation is a tiny anchor that can hold onto during the pause. When you catch yourself in the story, try to connect with that anchor instead of the story itself.

Patient: My jaw's still clenched and my chest is tight, but there’s a tiny loosening in my shoulders and my feet feel a bit heavier on the floor. The second I try to hold onto that small release my brain starts the movie again—manager notices, documents me, HR, fired, rent gone, back with my ex—and it feels impossible to keep the anchor without the avalanche. I’m getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tiny loosening in your shoulders. What value is connected to that feeling for you – is it relaxation, freedom, or something else? As you hold onto that value, notice how your body responds to it – does the loosening deepen, or does your chest still tighten? Try to connect the anchor (the loosening) to the value (relaxation) just for a moment, without trying to stop the story.

Patient: I think that little loosening feels like hope for breathing room — like being able to sleep and not be constantly on edge. When I try to hold onto that, my shoulders do relax a hair, but my chest still tightens because my brain immediately spins the movie — manager notices, documents me, HR, fired, rent gone, back with my ex — and the loosening gets shoved out. I'm getting really overwhelmed and frustrated; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that when you try to hold onto the loosening, your chest tightens – that's your brain's automatic response. Instead of trying to stop it, try saying "yes" to the value (hope for breathing room) without judgment. Just say "yes" to the feeling of relaxation that comes with that hope, without analyzing it or trying to change it. Can you say "yes" to that tiny loosening without the story kicking in?

Patient: I can force out a "yes" for a heartbeat — "yes" to the loosening — but it's immediately swallowed by the movie: manager notices, documents me, HR, fired, rent gone, back with my ex. Saying "yes" feels like lighting a fuse that guarantees that chain, so I'm tense and skeptical the whole time. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of your mouth and throat when you say "yes" – what's it feel like to make that tiny sound? Is it a slight vibration, a slight tightness, or a slight release? Bring your attention to that physical sensation, without trying to change it or connect it to the story. Just notice what happens in your body when you say "yes" to the loosening, without judgment.

Patient: When I say "yes" there's a tiny vibration in the back of my throat and a little loosening, but my jaw stays tight and my chest immediately clamps. The second I notice that small release my brain screams that it's proof they'll see me as unreliable — manager documents me, HR steps in, I'm put on a plan, fired, lose my apartment, and somehow end up back with my ex — the loosening disappears. I tried to hold onto the "yes" but it feels like lighting a fuse, and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what just happened when you noticed the small release – the story came flooding back. Can you name that story without judgment, just for a moment? Without trying to change it or analyze it, simply say to yourself, "That's the story I'm telling myself – 'they'll see me as unreliable'." Just name it, without judgment.

Patient: "That's the story I'm telling myself — 'they'll see me as unreliable'." Saying that out loud makes me feel ashamed and stupid, like I'm already the failure, and then my brain drags me straight into the movie: manager documents me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, I can't pay rent, my savings vanish, and I end up back with my ex. I know it sounds extreme but I can't imagine any other outcome, and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of shame in your body right now – is it a tightness in your chest, a lump in your throat, or a feeling of heaviness? Bring your attention to that sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just notice what it feels like to be in that place, without judgment. Say to yourself, "I feel this way" – just that – without adding any commentary or interpretation.

Patient: There's a heavy, sinking tightness in my chest, a lump in my throat, my stomach's clenched, and my face feels hot — it's shame and frustration sitting in my body. "I feel this way." I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tiny part of you that's still present, even in the midst of that tightness – is it a breath, a heartbeat, or a small sense of "I'm here"? Connect that tiny value to the present moment, without judgment. For example, you could say to yourself, "I'm still here, even with this tightness." Just that – "I'm here" – without trying to change it or make it bigger.

Patient: "I'm here." Saying it feels thin, like a whisper I can barely hold. The second I notice it this stupid shame grabs me and my head shoots into the movie — they'll see me as unreliable, document me, HR, fired, no rent, back with my ex — and it drains whatever little grip I had on that "here." Can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the moment when your head started to go to the movie – what was happening in your body just before that? Was there a slight pause, a slight hesitation, or a slight tightening before the shame kicked in? Try to hold onto that tiny moment, even if it's just a fraction of a second. You could say to yourself, "Just before..." and pause there, without judgment.

Patient: Just before... there was this tiny hitch — my breath caught, my throat tightened, a split-second of a pause — and I thought maybe I could stay with that. Then my chest slammed shut and the movie flooded back: manager documents me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, I lose my apartment, and somehow end up back with my ex. I tried to hold onto that tiny moment but I can't; I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tiny hitch again, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just say to yourself, "I notice a tiny hitch" – no judgment, no commentary. Just the fact that there's a small pause. Let it be what it is, without trying to make it bigger or smaller.

Patient: "I notice a tiny hitch." It barely lasts before the movie kicks in—manager documents me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, I lose my apartment and somehow end up back with my ex—and that thought just wipes me out; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground – is there any sensation, any feeling, in your feet right now? Even if it's just a tiny sensation, try to anchor that feeling to the present moment. You could say to yourself, "My feet are on the ground" – just that – without trying to change it or make it bigger.

Patient: My feet are on the floor — I can feel a dull pressure under my soles, like a tiny anchor. But the second I notice it my brain pulls me into the movie — they'll see me as unreliable, document me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, I lose my apartment, end up back with my ex — and that grounding just disappears. I can barely hold onto it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that you can still feel the dull pressure under your soles for a tiny fraction of a second – just long enough to say to yourself, "I feel that" – without judgment. Don't try to change it or make it bigger, just acknowledge it as it is. This tiny pause can help you stay present just before the movie response kicks in.

Patient: "I feel that." I can barely hold it for a beat, but as soon as I notice the pressure my brain slams the movie on — they'll see me as unreliable, document me, HR, fired, no rent, back with my ex — and it makes me feel ashamed and stupid. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of shame that's arising – is it a tightness in your chest, a lump in your throat, or a feeling of heaviness? Try to connect that feeling to the dull pressure under your soles, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just say to yourself, "This shame feels like that pressure" – no judgment, no commentary.

Patient: "This shame feels like that pressure." It's a heavy, sinking knot in my chest and a hot lump in my throat, and the second I notice it my brain snaps to the movie — they'll see me as unreliable, document me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, I can't pay rent, savings gone, and somehow I'm back with my ex. I can barely hold onto that sentence; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the mental image that's arising – it's the movie scenario. Try to name it without judgment, just as it is. Say to yourself, "That's the story I'm telling myself – 'they'll see me as unreliable'". Don't try to change it or analyze it, just acknowledge it as a thought. This tiny step can help you create space between the thought and the shame response.

Patient: "That's the story I'm telling myself — 'they'll see me as unreliable'." Saying it out loud makes me feel ashamed and stupid, like I'm reliving something, and my brain immediately runs the whole movie: manager documents me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, can't pay rent, savings gone, and I end up back with my ex. I can barely hold that sentence — it's draining me and I feel too worn out; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that you can still feel the weight of shame for just one tiny breath – the space between the words "That's the story I'm telling myself" and the shame response. Take just that one breath, without judgment. You can say to yourself, "I'll wait for just one more breath" – just that – without trying to change it or make it bigger.

Patient: "I'll wait for just one more breath." I did — a tiny inhale and exhale, and for a half-beat the tightness eased and my feet felt a touch heavier, but then the movie slammed back in — they'll see me as unreliable, document me, HR, fired, lose my apartment, back with my ex — and that little relief just vanished. I can barely hold onto that beat; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet feeling heavier for just that half-beat – the weight, the pressure. Try to anchor that sensation to the present moment, without thinking about the story or the shame response. You could say to yourself, "My feet feel heavy" – just that – without judgment or commentary.

Patient: "My feet feel heavy." For that half-beat it grounded me, but then my brain slammed back into the movie — manager documents me, HR puts me on a plan, I'm fired, can't pay rent, and somehow I'm back with my ex — and it just makes me feel ashamed and stupid. I can barely hold that sentence; can we slow down?
