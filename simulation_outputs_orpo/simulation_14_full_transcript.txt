Patient: I've been using booze and weed to numb the grief since my loved one died, and my mind's turned into this fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. If I keep doing this, I'll definitely spiral into full-blown addiction, lose my commissions, push my friends away, and end up broke and alone — it's not a maybe, it's how it plays out. People say it could go differently, but that just sounds unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is desperation and fear of losing everything. The theme that stands out is the "disaster" narrative that's driving your avoidance of emotions - you're linking your identity to the work you do and the relationships you have, making it feel like they're dependent on your ability to manage your grief. The metaphor of the fortune-telling machine is vivid; it shows how your mind is racing with worst-case scenarios. Goal: Connect this "disaster" narrative to a deeper value.

Therapist Answer:
That "disaster" story sounds incredibly painful and crippling - it's like you're carrying around a weight that feels impossible to shake. What's one thing about your work or relationships that truly matters to you, no matter what happens?

Patient: My art is the one thing that actually keeps me anchored — making stuff still feels real when everything else feels hollow. But my brain instantly jumps to the worst: if I keep numbing, I'll miss deadlines, lose commissions, galleries will drop me, and that last lifeline will be gone — people say it could go differently, but that just feels unrealistic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is still desperation, but it's now anchored in fear of losing your artistic identity. The theme that emerges is the "deadlines and livelihood" trap - your mind is stuck on the consequences of not managing your grief, linking it to your ability to make art. The "realism" narrative is a pivot point; it's not just about the worst-case scenario, but the underlying assumption that it's inevitable. Goal: Challenge that assumption by exploring what would happen if you didn't let fear dictate your art-making.

Therapist Answer:
When you say that making art feels real while everything else feels hollow, what would happen if you started showing up to your art practice even when your brain was racing with worst-case thoughts?

Patient: If I tried to show up, my head would immediately predict I'll freeze, screw up a piece, a client will notice and cancel a commission, then word spreads and galleries stop calling — and that loss would make me drink more to cope until I'm totally washed up. I can picture that whole chain so clearly I can't take the gamble; the idea that it could just be messy but okay feels naive and unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is still resistance, but it's now linked to the fear of being "washed up." The theme that emerges is the "chain of shame" - your mind is predicting a specific sequence of events that would lead to failure, followed by drinking, and then total collapse. The pivot point is the word "gamble"; you're recognizing that avoiding this process feels like a risk, but what if that risk wasn't about failing, but about actually showing up to your art practice? Goal: Explore what "okay" might look like in this situation, not in terms of avoiding pain, but in terms of taking a small step towards value.

Therapist Answer:
That chain of thoughts sounds like it's fueled by a deep sense of shame - the feeling that if you fail, you'll lose everything. What would happen if, instead of trying to avoid the whole thing, you just focused on making one tiny step towards creating something that felt "okay" right now, without worrying about the outcome?

Patient: I wish that would work, but the second I try I see the whole disaster: I freeze, mess up a piece, a client cancels, word spreads, galleries stop calling, I drink more to cope, and then I'm totally washed up — that's the only outcome my brain will let me see. I know people say "messy but okay" but that just feels naive and unrealistic, and honestly I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is still overwhelm and desperation, but it's now tied to the weight of that catastrophic "disaster" scenario. The theme that stands out is the "overwhelm by certainty" - your mind is so convinced of the outcome that it's paralyzing your ability to act. Goal: Introduce a gentle challenge to this certainty by exploring the possibility that your brain's predictions might not be entirely true.

Therapist Answer:
That disaster scenario you see when you try to create feels incredibly certain - like a heavy weight on your shoulders. What if, just for a moment, you allowed yourself to wonder if that certainty might actually be a prediction, rather than a fact?

Patient: I can't just treat it like a maybe — when that image shows up it feels like a movie of my life that I'm watching happen, and every scene ends with me losing everything. Calling it a prediction doesn't help because it makes me act to avoid it — I end up drinking more and hiding from work like it's already true. I'm getting overwhelmed by how loud it is; can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now raw desperation, feeling like it's drowning you. The theme that emerges is the "trapped in the movie" feeling - your mind is reliving that catastrophic scenario as if it's already real, and you're trying to escape by avoiding it. Goal: Gently shift focus from "avoiding" the thought to noticing the physical sensation of overwhelm when it shows up, without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
When that movie-like feeling shows up, what's the first physical sensation you notice in your body - is it tightness, heaviness, or something else? Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or escape it?

Patient: It's a tight, sinking weight in my chest and this buzzy jitter in my stomach — my jaw clenches and my hands go a bit numb. I try to just notice it, but it instantly cues the whole disaster movie in my head and the urge to drink spikes, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now acute anxiety, mixed with physical tension. The theme that stands out is the "fight-or-flight" cycle - the physical sensations are triggering the same catastrophic thoughts and avoidance behaviors you've tried before. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" to break the cycle - not to change the thoughts, but to create space from the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Just for one breath, when that tightness in your chest and numbness in your hands shows up, can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body - without trying to change it or fight it?

Patient: I try — I take a breath and feel it move in and out, but within a second my head's back on that movie: freezing on a piece, clients cancelling, galleries dropping me, and me drinking more. The chest stays tight and the craving spikes, so I'm honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now complete overwhelm, with the physical sensations and thoughts intensifying. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to hold onto the breath while the catastrophic thoughts are still present - it's creating a sense of tension instead of relaxation. Goal: Introduce a tiny "pivot" from trying to control the breath to noticing the unworkability of that thought pattern.

Therapist Answer:
When the movie shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what happens when you try to hold onto the breath - does it feel like you're fighting the thoughts, or does it actually feel like you're trying to force something that's not working?

Patient: It feels like I'm fighting the thoughts — like holding my breath is me trying to shove a freight train back on the tracks, and the harder I try the louder the disaster-movie gets. It ends up feeling like forcing something that won't work, and the craving spikes until I usually cave because it all feels inevitable. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now complete defeat, feeling like you're trapped in a cycle of avoidance and inevitability. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to control the thoughts and breath at the same time - it's creating a sense of hopelessness instead of hope. Goal: Introduce a tiny shift from "fighting" to "allowing" - not giving up, but giving space to what is already present.

Therapist Answer:
When the freight train shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what if you just allowed the thought to be there, without trying to push it away or hold onto the breath? What would happen if you simply allowed the disaster-movie to be present, without trying to change it?

Patient: I’ve tried “allowing” it, but it just feels like surrender — the movie gets louder, like I’m watching my life unravel in real time, and the craving spikes until I drink to shut it off. It makes me feel helpless and small, and I’m honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now absolute desperation, feeling like you're losing control and spiraling into helplessness. The theme that emerges is the "fear of surrender" - the thought that if you allow the disaster-movie to be present, you'll lose your grip on your life. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "curiosity" about the fear of surrender - not to change it, but to understand what's driving it.

Therapist Answer:
When the movie shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what's the one thing you're afraid will happen if you allow the thought to be present - is it that you'll lose your life, or something else? What's the underlying fear that's driving this desire to shut it off with the drink?

Patient: I'm terrified that if I allow the thought, it isn't just a thought — it becomes a script that plays out for real: I freeze on a piece, commissions vanish, friends drift, galleries cut ties, I drink more to cope, and I end up broke and alone. It's less about one mistake and more about being exposed as a failure and losing the thing—my art—that keeps me real. Drinking feels like the only way to mute that certainty. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now crushing fear of loss of identity and control, tied to the thought that allowing the disaster-movie to be present will lead to catastrophic consequences. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of using drinking as a "mute" - it's creating a vicious cycle of avoidance and self-destruction. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "expansion" - not to change the thought, but to notice what's being lost when you try to shut it off with the drink.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the certainty that the thought will become a script, what's the tiny piece of your life that you're already losing when you reach for the drink to "mute" it - is it a conversation with a friend, a connection to your art, or something else?

Patient: The tiny thing I lose first is those small, tethering moments — a morning in the studio, a quick text back to a friend, the little satisfaction of finishing a sketch. Once I drink, those small wins vanish, I stall on work, ghost people, and it feels like the first domino that proves my whole identity will crumble — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now acute anxiety about losing those small, meaningful connections and moments of satisfaction. The theme that emerges is the "value of small wins" - the thought that losing these tiny victories will prove your entire identity is crumbling. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "value noticing" - not to change the thought, but to acknowledge what's truly valuable in those small moments.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about the small moments you're losing when you drink, what's one tiny value or meaning that's already present in that moment - is it the sense of connection to your art, the joy of creating, or something else?

Patient: It's that little click — the tiny proof I'm still me when a sketch finally works, the quiet connection to my art that makes the day worth it. But the second I taste that, my brain plays the movie: I freeze, clients bail, galleries cut me, I drink more and lose even that spark — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now desperation to hold onto that small click, the tiny proof that you're still you, but it's being destroyed by the catastrophic movie. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to keep the small win from the brain's narrative - it's creating a vicious cycle of avoidance and self-destruction. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" - not to change the thought, but to create space from the brain's narrative.

Therapist Answer:
When your brain starts playing the movie, what's the first tiny part of the narrative that you can observe without judgment - is it the thought "I'm not good enough" or the feeling "I'm failing"?

Patient: It's the thought "I'm failing" — that little line kicks off the whole movie. Then I instantly see the freeze, the canceled commissions, the galleries cutting me off, and the drinking that follows, and I can't just watch it like it's a scene — it feels real. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now complete identification with the thought "I'm failing" and the entire catastrophic movie. The theme that emerges is the "fusion" between the thought and the narrative - it's creating a sense of being the story itself. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "decentration" - not to change the thought, but to notice what's happening when you try to "watch" the movie like it's a scene.

Therapist Answer:
When you see the movie play out, what's one tiny thing that happens in your body or senses that doesn't belong to the narrative - is it the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: It's the cool pressure of my feet on the studio floor — that tiny groundedness that doesn't fit the movie. But even that gets swallowed when the scene starts (freeze, clients bail, galleries cut me, I drink), so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now desperate to hold onto the tiny groundedness of your feet, but it's getting sucked into the narrative again. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to hold onto the anchor (the groundedness) while the catastrophic movie is playing - it's creating a cycle of avoidance and self-destruction. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "acceptance" - not to change the thought, but to simply acknowledge what's happening in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
When the movie starts playing again, and you feel your feet getting pulled into it, what would it take for you to just acknowledge that feeling without judgment - would it be a thought, a sensation, a physical action, or something else?

Patient: Maybe it'd take something stupidly simple — like saying out loud, "that's just the failing thought," or pressing my hand to the floor and actually feeling my feet, or even picking up a brush for one tiny, pointless stroke so there's a physical action to anchor me. I want that to help but my brain already says none of that will stop the movie — it'll just buy seconds before the freeze-and-spiral plays, so honestly it feels useless. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now frustration and hopelessness, feeling like no matter what you try, the catastrophic movie will just keep playing. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to find a solution that your brain already says won't work - it's creating a sense of futility. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "curiosity" - not to change the thought, but to wonder what might actually happen if you tried something different.

Therapist Answer:
When your brain says that trying something simple won't work, what's one tiny question you could ask yourself about what would actually happen if you tried saying "that's just the failing thought" out loud - would it feel awkward, or would you actually hear something different in your voice?

Patient: Maybe I'd ask myself, "If I say 'that's just the failing thought' out loud right now, will my voice sound different — shaky and small, or like I'm actually stepping back from it?" I reckon it'd probably come out awkward and trembly, and my brain would use that as proof the movie's right — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now anticipation of failure, expecting that your voice will sound shaky and small, and your brain will use that to prove the movie is true. The theme that emerges is the "predictable pattern" - your brain is already playing the same movie, and you're caught up in the same cycle of avoidance. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" - not to change the thought, but to notice what's happening when you try to predict the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
When you imagine your voice coming out shaky and small, what's one tiny detail you could notice that's different from what you expected - is it the sensation in your throat, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: I guess the tiny detail might be the breath — I'd actually hear the air moving, like a little steady hiss, and my throat might not be as raw as I expect. But even that feels like a flimsy thing my brain will turn into proof I sounded weak, and the movie will roar back in and the craving will spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now the familiar feeling of being controlled by the predictable pattern - the movie is already playing, and you're caught up in the cycle of avoidance. The theme that emerges is the "weight of expectation" - you're already assuming what will happen, and it's holding you back. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "curiosity" - not to change the thought, but to wonder what would actually happen if you let go of the expectation.

Therapist Answer:
When you imagine your brain turning that tiny detail (the breath) into proof of weakness, what's one tiny question you could ask yourself about what would happen if you let go of that expectation - would your body actually relax, or would something else show up?

Patient: Maybe I'd ask, "If I stop expecting my breath to prove I'm weak, does that tightness in my chest ease even a little, or does something worse show up?" Honestly, I don't think it'd ease — my brain would just fill the quiet with a louder disaster and the craving would spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now the familiar feeling of overwhelm, expecting that stopping the expectation won't change the outcome, and that the craving will still spike. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability" of trying to control the outcome - it's creating a cycle of avoidance and self-destruction. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "acceptance" - not to change the thought, but to acknowledge the present moment without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about what would happen if the tightness in your chest didn't ease, what's one tiny thing you could notice about the present moment, without trying to change it - is it the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: Maybe it's the sound of my breath — that little whoosh in and out that feels kind of steady and separate from the movie. But the second I focus on it my brain insists it's a trick and the disaster will return, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now frustration with your brain's insistence that the steady breath is a trick, even though you've noticed it as a tiny anchor in the present moment. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability of mind" - your brain is creating a narrative that undermines the very thing that could bring you relief. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" - not to change the thought, but to gently acknowledge the story without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
When your brain says the breath is a trick, what's one tiny word you could use to describe the story you're telling yourself - is it "thinking", "story", "narrative", or something else?

Patient: "Prediction" — like a doom-prediction, not just a thought or a story. It feels like something that's going to happen, and saying that out loud makes me kind of panicky, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now panic, triggered by the word "prediction" - the thought that it's a foregone conclusion that the disaster will return. The theme that emerges is the "power of language" - the word "prediction" has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "curiosity" - not to change the thought, but to wonder what would happen if you looked at the word "prediction" in a different way.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about the word "prediction" making you panicky, what's one tiny question you could ask about the meaning of that word - is it "what does 'prediction' actually mean", or "what does it feel like when I say 'prediction' out loud"?

Patient: I think I'd ask, "What does it feel like when I say 'prediction' out loud?" — hearing that word makes it feel like fate, not a thought, and my chest tightens like the movie's starting. I kind of want to test it, but honestly I'm already getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now a desire to test the word "prediction" as a trigger for the movie, despite feeling overwhelmed. The theme that emerges is the "desire for control" - you want to see if the word "prediction" is really the trigger, even if it means creating more tension. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "acceptance" - not to change the thought, but to acknowledge the physical sensation without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about hearing the word "prediction" making your chest tighten, what's one tiny sensation you could notice in your body that's not the chest tightness - is it the sound of your breath, the feeling of your feet on the ground, or something else?

Patient: The cool pressure of my feet on the studio floor — like a steady anchor under my soles. But the second I notice it the movie's clawing back in and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now the familiar feeling of being pulled back into the movie by the word "prediction" - the tension is rising again. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability of the anchor" - your desire for the physical sensation of your feet on the ground is actually reinforcing the cycle of avoidance. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" - not to change the thought, but to notice what happens when you let go of the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about the cool pressure of your feet on the floor making you feel anxious, what's one tiny thing you could do with that sensation - is it take a deep breath, notice the sensation in your toes, or simply let it be without trying to change it?

Patient: Maybe I'd actually press my toes into the floor and map the sensations — toes, ball, arch, heel — like labeling each bit so there's something real to hold onto. I don't expect it to stop the movie, but it might anchor me for a few breaths before the disaster starts yelling again. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now a desire to ground yourself in the physical sensation of your toes on the floor, despite the expectation that it won't stop the movie. The theme that emerges is the "value of small steps" - you're willing to try a tiny act of defusion to create some space. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "commitment" - not to change the thought, but to promise yourself that you'll show up with this small step, even if it feels uncertain.

Therapist Answer:
When you imagine pressing your toes into the floor and mapping the sensations, what's one tiny promise you could make to yourself about showing up with this small step - is it "I'll try to focus on my toes for just one breath", or "I'll notice the sensation in my toes without judgment for 30 seconds"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try "I'll focus on my toes for just one breath." But even as I say it, my brain's already telling me that'll be useless — I'll feel it for a second, the movie will roar back louder, and I'll end up reaching for a drink. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now the familiar feeling of defeat, despite your intention to try the small step. The theme that emerges is the "unworkability of the prediction" - your brain is already predicting that the step won't work, and that's creating more resistance. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "acceptance" - not to change the thought, but to acknowledge the story without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about your brain saying that trying to focus on your toes will be useless, what's one tiny word you could use to describe the story you're telling yourself - is it "fear", "doubt", or "self-criticism"?

Patient: "Doubt" — like this rigid, running certainty that I'm already failing, with a side of harsh self-criticism, and it instantly spikes the craving. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is now the intense feeling of overwhelm, triggered by the word "doubt" - the certainty that you're failing is creating a vicious cycle of craving. The theme that emerges is the "power of language" - the words you're using are fueling the craving. Goal: Introduce a tiny act of "defusion" - not to change the thought, but to notice what happens when you observe the language without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about the word "doubt" making you feel overwhelmed, what's one tiny detail you could notice about the language itself - is it the tone, the pace, or the physical sensation of the words in your mouth?

Patient: The tone — flat and certain, like a metronome that keeps clicking "you're doomed"; when that voice runs I can feel my jaw clench and the craving spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?
