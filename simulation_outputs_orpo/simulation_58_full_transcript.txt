--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a senior artist and lately what's been on my mind is this anger and frustration that flares up around the instability of my work and the constant worry about losing gigs. It comes out in sharp ways — I snap at people or shut down, and I can't seem to keep it from ruining things. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing exercises and talking about it before; it doesn't work.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your skepticism is understandable; it's a natural response to feeling stuck. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Explore the tangible impact of this anger on your work and relationships to identify an unworkable pattern.

Therapist Answer:
That frustration with your work's instability and fear of losing gigs feels really raw. What's one thing that happens when that anger comes up, like when you snap at someone or shut down during a conversation? How does it affect the people you care about, like your clients or fellow artists?

Patient: Usually I either blurt something cutting and then feel stupid, or I shut down completely and stop answering calls. Clients and collaborators get hurt or confused, some stop reaching out, and I’ve lost gigs because people think I’m difficult. It leaves me ashamed and panicked, like I’ve sabotaged myself and can’t fix it afterward. How is talking about this supposed to actually change any of that?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a clear pattern of behavior that's causing problems. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Connect the shame to an underlying value to identify a potential pivot.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel ashamed after snapping or shutting down, what's one thing you value about yourself that gets lost in that moment? Is it being a good partner to your clients, a team player to your collaborators, or an artist who can take risks?

Patient: Being reliable and professional — I want clients to know they can count on me. When I snap or shut down that part of me disappears and all anyone sees is someone angry or flaky, which just makes me panic and pull away. How is saying that supposed to help? I've noticed it a hundred times and it doesn't change what happens.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've linked the shame to a core value, but you're skeptical about how talking about it will change the pattern. Goal: Introduce a small experiment to test the connection between noticing the value and acting on it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tiny experiment. When you notice that snap or shutdown happening, what's one tiny thing you could do to touch that value of being reliable and professional? For example, you could pause for just a breath before responding to the client, or ask yourself "What would it take for me to show up fully for this conversation?"

Patient: Maybe I could try something tiny like literally counting to three before I answer or saying, "Give me a moment," so I don't blurt something. I guess I could also put a sticky note on my phone to remind me. But I've tried pausing and it just doesn't stick — in the heat of it I either forget or it feels fake, so how is that supposed to actually change things long-term?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small, tangible action to test the connection between noticing the value and acting on it. Core emotion is skepticism about its effectiveness. Goal: Explore the underlying motivation for why you're resistant to trying this small action.

Therapist Answer:
What's the underlying reason you're hesitant to try pausing or reminding yourself to breathe in the heat of the moment? Is it because you're afraid it'll feel like you're losing control, or that it won't actually help you show up more reliably?

Patient: I think I'm afraid it'll feel like I'm losing control or admitting I'm fragile — and that in the moment my body just takes over and nothing I planned will register. Pausing feels fake to me, like I'm putting on a performance instead of actually fixing anything, and I'm terrified it'll just make me look indecisive and cost me more work. I don't know, it just seems like saying "pause" doesn't change the panic or the shame that follows.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the fear of losing control and the underlying shame that's driving your resistance. Goal: Introduce a subtle shift in language to connect the pause to a value that's not about control, but about what you're trying to protect.

Therapist Answer:
When you say "pause" or "give me a moment," what are you actually trying to protect or preserve in that moment? Is it the person on the other end of the conversation, or is it the work itself, or something else entirely?

Patient: Mostly I'm trying to protect my reputation and the work — to keep clients trusting me instead of seeing me as flaky. I'm also trying to protect my dignity; if I can pause I might not say something I'll later hate. But it feels hollow — I'm worried it'll just delay the panic, and people might think I'm weak or indecisive. How is that supposed to actually keep gigs from slipping away?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core values at stake: reputation, work, and dignity. Core emotion is anxiety about maintaining these values. Goal: Connect the pause to a concrete action that aligns with those values.

Therapist Answer:
What would it take for you to pause that isn't about avoiding shame or control, but about doing the work that matters to you and your clients? For example, what would it mean to pause to ask a client what they need from you right now, instead of trying to "fix" the conversation?

Patient: Maybe pausing could be framed as actually doing the work — like asking, "What do you need from me right now?" — so it sounds purposeful, not just me stalling. I could keep a couple short, honest phrases ready so it doesn't feel like I'm putting on an act: "Give me a minute, I'll get back with a plan" or "Help me understand what matters most here." But I'm skeptical — what if that just makes me look unsure and people stop trusting me? How is that supposed to help when the panic's already clawing up my throat?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a key pivot: reframing the pause as a purposeful action, not a stall. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's now about protecting the work. Goal: Introduce a tiny experiment to test the hypothesis that this reframed pause can actually build trust.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small experiment. When you feel the panic clawing up your throat, what's one tiny phrase you could use to connect with the work instead of the panic? For example, instead of "I'm going to lose control," you could say "I need to stay with this question."

Patient: Maybe I could try, "Give me a minute — what's most important here?" It sounds purposeful, like I'm prioritizing the work, not stalling, but honestly I've used lines like that and when I'm flooded it still feels fake — how is that supposed to actually stop the panic?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the gap between the phrase and the feeling of authenticity. Core emotion is still anxiety about the panic. Goal: Explore the physical sensation of the panic to connect it to a value that's not about avoiding it.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that panic clawing up your throat, what's the physical sensation in your body that you've noticed before it starts? Is it a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, or a racing heartbeat?

Patient: It's this tight band across my chest and a knot in my stomach — my throat closes up and my breathing goes shallow and fast. My hands get clammy or shaky and my vision narrows so everything feels urgent and loud, and then I just either blurt or freeze. I can point it out now, but how is noticing that supposed to stop it when my body's already in charge?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations of the panic, and they're now linked to a specific behavior (blurring or freezing). Core emotion is still anxiety about losing control. Goal: Introduce a small shift in language to connect the physical sensations to a value that's not about control.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice that tight band across your chest and knot in your stomach, what's one thing you value that's happening in that moment? For example, what's the tiny part of you that's still working, even when the panic takes over?

Patient: I guess there's this tiny part that's still trying to be professional — the bit that wants to finish the work and not burn bridges. Even when the panic hits I can sometimes hear a faint voice saying "don't ruin this," like a last-ditch reminder of my standards, but it's so quiet it barely matters. How is noticing that supposed to help when my chest's already clamped shut and my hands are shaking?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the faint voice of your values amidst the panic. Core emotion is still anxiety about losing control. Goal: Connect the faint voice to a concrete action that can create space for the panic.

Therapist Answer:
What's one tiny physical action you could take when you hear that faint voice saying "don't ruin this" that would give your body just a tiny bit of space to breathe? For example, could you take one deep breath in, or just notice the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I could try one long, slow breath and really feel my feet on the floor—count four in, four out—just to give my chest a second of space. Or press my fingertips together or squeeze something in my hand for a few seconds to ground my hands and break the urge to blurt. But even saying that pulls up this hot shame and frustration, like I'm back at some past failure, so I'm skeptical it'll stop the panic—how is that supposed to actually help when I'm already flooded?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small physical action that could create space for the panic, but it's now linked to past shame and frustration. Core emotion is still anxiety about failing. Goal: Explore the past shame to connect it to a value that's not about avoiding it.

Therapist Answer:
When that hot shame and frustration come up, what's one thing you value that they're trying to protect? Is it your worth as a person, your ability to show up for others, or something else? Try to connect the shame to that value, rather than the action itself.

Patient: I think that hot shame is trying to protect my sense of worth and professional identity — like it’s shouting to prove I still deserve gigs and respect. It’s clinging to my dignity, so I don’t look weak or expendable, but all it does is make me clench and panic. Okay, but really — how is naming that supposed to actually tame the panic when it’s already taken over?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core value being protected by the shame. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Introduce a subtle shift in language to connect the panic to the value, rather than the shame.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of saying "I don't want to look weak," try saying "I'm worth respect" or "My worth matters." This shifts the focus from avoiding shame to holding onto value. When you feel the panic rising, what's one tiny phrase you could use to connect with that value, like "I'm worthy of respect" or "My work matters"?

Patient: Maybe I'd try, "My work matters" or "I deserve respect" — say it quietly and do that long slow breath or press my fingertips together at the same time. But honestly, when the panic and that hot shame spike, it just sounds hollow; the words don't land and I end up angrier and more humiliated. How is that supposed to actually help when all I feel is that pressure in my chest?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a strategy that sounds promising, but it's not working for you. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore what's happening when the words feel hollow.

Therapist Answer:
What happens when you say "My work matters" or "I deserve respect" when the panic spikes? What physical sensation do you notice, besides the pressure in your chest? Is there a physical response in your body, like a knot in your stomach or a tightness in your jaw?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try saying "my work matters" while the panic's spiking, my jaw locks and I clench my teeth, my stomach knots up worse, my hands ball into fists and my breathing gets shallow and fast. My face goes hot, I get a dizzy, detached feeling, and those words just sound hollow and make the shame flare so everything tightens more. How is that supposed to actually help when my body's already taken over?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical response to trying to use the words "My work matters" during the panic. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore the possibility that the physical response might be more important than the words themselves.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to use the words, you focused on noticing the physical sensation of your jaw clenching, or the knot in your stomach, or the tightness in your fists? What if you allowed yourself to feel those sensations without trying to change them, without trying to use the words "My work matters"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to "just notice" the sensations, it usually snowballs. That tight jaw and hot shame get louder, my head starts listing every mistake, and I end up more panicked, not calmer. I could try to focus on my jaw or my feet for a few breaths, but how is that supposed to stop the spiral when the body's already in charge?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a pattern of "snowballing" when trying to notice physical sensations. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Introduce a tiny shift in the goal, from stopping the spiral to creating a tiny pause.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of trying to stop the spiral, what if you aimed for a tiny pause? Just one breath? A moment to notice the sensation of your jaw or feet without trying to change it? What would it take for you to pause, even for just a heartbeat, when the panic feels like it's about to overwhelm you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. Maybe a physical anchor — like pressing my thumb and forefinger together and forcing one long exhale, or a single stomp and count to three — something automatic so I don't have to think. But the second it starts I get pulled into that hot shame about past failures and my mind just races, so even that tiny pause feels useless. How is one breath or a press really supposed to stop the whole surge?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential physical anchor, but it's not working as expected. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore why the pause feels useless.

Therapist Answer:
What if the pause isn't about stopping the surge, but about creating space for something else to happen? What if, instead of trying to stop the panic, you were to simply observe what happens when you pause? What might you notice about your body, your thoughts, or your emotions when you're not trying to control them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to "observe" it usually just makes the shame louder. If I pause I notice the same tight chest, jaw clenched, stomach knot, and then my head fills with every mistake I've made; sometimes that faint "don't ruin this" voice is a touch clearer, but more often the noticing just becomes another thing I beat myself up over. I'm jumpy and can't quite focus right now, so the idea of calmly watching it feels unrealistic. How is sitting with it supposed to actually change what happens when I'm already on the edge?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that observing the experience often makes the shame louder. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Introduce a shift from observing to acting on a fundamental need.

Therapist Answer:
When you're feeling overwhelmed and jumpy, what's one tiny thing you need to feel safe and connected to your work right now? For example, is it a small gesture, like taking a sip of water, or a brief touch, like placing a hand on your desk? What would it take for you to do that small thing without trying to control the panic?

Patient: I think a tiny thing that might help is a physical anchor — pressing my thumb and forefinger together and forcing one long slow exhale, or taking a deliberate slow sip of water with my hand flat on the table. If it were automatic — a smooth stone in my pocket or a sticky note on my phone so I don’t have to think about it — I might actually remember when the panic hits. Right now I’m jumpy and a bit overwhelmed and that hot shame from past mistakes creeps back in, so even this feels flimsy. How is that really supposed to stop the spiral?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential physical anchor and a way to make it automatic. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore how the anchor can be used to build a tiny act of self-care that can interrupt the spiral.

Therapist Answer:
What if the goal of the anchor wasn't to stop the panic, but to create a tiny gap between the panic and your usual reaction? What if, when the panic hits, you simply brought your hand to the stone or touched the sticky note, without trying to do anything else? Could that tiny act of touch and breath actually create space for something else to happen, like a thought or a feeling that's not driven by shame?

Patient: Maybe—yeah, touching the stone and doing one slow breath could make a tiny gap where that "don't ruin this" voice is a little quieter. But honestly, when I'm flooded that gap feels laughably small; my hands shake, the shame spikes, and I can't tell if anything else can get in. I'm jumpy and distracted right now and probably wouldn't even reach for it unless it were automatic. How is that really supposed to help when the panic already has me?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential strategy that could create a tiny gap, but it's not enough to interrupt the panic when you're already jumpy. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore a new direction that leverages your current state of jumpy distraction.

Therapist Answer:
What if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you used the distraction of your jumpy state to your advantage? What if, instead of trying to calm down, you simply noticed how your body is moving, like your fingers shaking or your chest rising and falling? Could that observation be a tiny step towards noticing what's happening inside your body, rather than getting caught in the shame loop?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — maybe noticing my fingers shaking or my chest heaving could be a tiny step, and sometimes that little gap lets the "don't ruin this" voice whisper through. But the second I try it the shame spikes and my head floods with past mistakes, so it often just feels like another thing I'm failing at. How is that supposed to actually help when I'm already rattled and can't even remember to reach for the stone?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential strategy that might create a tiny gap, but it's not sustainable when the shame spikes. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore a radical shift from trying to control the panic to embracing the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to notice your fingers shaking or your chest heaving, you simply let the shaking happen without judgment? What if you allowed yourself to feel the uncertainty and chaos of the moment, without trying to control it or make sense of it? Could that tiny act of surrender create space for something else to emerge, like a thought or a feeling that's not driven by shame?

Patient: I don't know — letting the shaking happen "without judgment" sounds okay on paper, but in the moment it just feels like surrender and then my head floods with all those failures and the shame gets louder. Maybe if I paired it with something concrete, like touching the stone and saying "okay" to myself, it could make a tiny sliver of space — but I'm skeptical it'll do anything once I'm already flooded. How is that actually supposed to stop the spiral when the shame hits so hard?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential combination that might create a tiny gap, but it's still not enough to interrupt the shame when it hits hard. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore a fundamental shift in the relationship between the shame and the "okay" moment.

Therapist Answer:
What if the "okay" moment wasn't about changing the shame, but about creating a tiny connection between the shame and your breath? What if, when the shame hits, you simply said "okay" to it, without judgment or trying to change it, and then breathed in one more breath? Could that tiny act of acknowledgment create space for the shame to become just a sensation, rather than a story?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — maybe saying "okay" could help me treat the shame like a sensation instead of a final judgment. In reality, when I'm flooded it feels like admitting defeat and the words ring hollow; my chest clamps, my jaw locks, and the shame just drowns everything out. I could try pairing "okay" with the stone or a long exhale, but I'm skeptical — how is that supposed to actually stop the spiral, and how do I make it happen automatically when I'm already panicked?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential strategy that might create a tiny gap, but it's still not enough to interrupt the shame when it hits hard. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore a fundamental shift in the relationship between the shame, the physical anchor, and the automaticity of the action.

Therapist Answer:
What if the physical anchor (stone, long exhale) wasn't just a tool to calm the shame, but a trigger to automatically acknowledge the shame as a physical sensation, without judgment or trying to change it? What if, when you felt the chest clamping, jaw locking, or shame flooding, you simply reached for the stone or took a deep breath without thinking, and said "I'm feeling this" or "my chest is tight" as if it were a neutral fact? Could that tiny act of acknowledgment create space for the shame to become just a sensation, rather than a story that controls you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — maybe. If reaching for the stone and saying "I'm feeling this" could turn the shame into just a sensation, that might carve a tiny gap. But when I'm flooded the hot shame spikes, my chest clamps, my jaw locks, and the words feel hollow — it just becomes one more thing I fail at. How do I make that small action happen automatically when my body's already taken over?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential strategy that might create a tiny gap, but it's still not enough to interrupt the shame when it hits hard. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore a radical shift from trying to control the shame to leveraging the existing physical response.

Therapist Answer:
What if, when your body starts to physically respond to the shame (chest clamps, jaw locks, etc.), you simply noticed that response without trying to change it or judge it? What if you observed it as a physical sensation, like a knot in your stomach or a tightness in your chest, without adding any narrative or meaning to it? Could that tiny act of noticing create space for the shame to become just a sensation, rather than a story that controls you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice the sensations the shame often just gets louder and my chest clamps harder. Maybe in theory that noticing could make it "just a sensation," but in practice I only get a tiny gap if I have a concrete, practiced anchor (a stone, a sticky note, a forced long exhale) that happens automatically. How do I make that automatic so it actually helps when I'm already flooded?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a key point: concrete anchors work, but you need them to happen automatically. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore how to make the anchor automatic.

Therapist Answer:
What if you paired the anchor with a specific physical action that you already do automatically, like touching your thumb and index finger together or making a small gesture with your hand? For example, when your chest starts to clamp, you touch your thumb and index finger together and say "okay" or "I'm here". Could this small gesture create a connection between the shame and a automatic action, making the anchor happen without you needing to think about it?

Patient: Maybe — touching my thumb and finger and saying "I'm here" could work if it actually happened without me having to think. But when I'm flooded that hot shame from that failure spikes, my hands shake, and it just feels like one more thing I'm going to mess up; how is that supposed to help if I can't even remember to do it? So how do I make it automatic — I've practiced things before and they never stick, what's different this time?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the key challenge: the shame makes it hard to remember the action, and you're struggling to make it automatic. Core emotion is still anxiety about being "expendable". Goal: Explore what's different about this situation that might make the action stick.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to remember the action, you focused on what happens when you don't do it? What if, when your hands shake and your mind goes blank, you noticed that you're already doing the action without thinking - you're already touching your thumb and finger together? Could that tiny observation create a connection between the shame and the automatic action, making it happen even when you're flooded?

Patient: Maybe — sometimes, in the worst moments, I catch myself and my fingers are already touching, like some tiny muscle remembered before my head did. But most of the time I'm so flooded I don't even notice until it's too late, and that just makes me furious and ashamed that I need a trick at all. How is noticing that supposed to actually make it reliable when half the time I don't even see it happening? What makes you think this will stick when everything else I try just... doesn't?
