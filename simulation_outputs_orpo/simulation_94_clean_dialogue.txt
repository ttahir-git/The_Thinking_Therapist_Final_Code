Patient: I've been feeling this intense anxiety in social situations lately — I avoid gatherings with friends even though my partner is really supportive. I'm in my mid-fifties, back in school after the kids left, and I think a lot of this is tied up with grief over the empty nest. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will change anything — I've tried things before and they didn't work, so how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit to yourself how hard it is to face these gatherings, even when your partner is right there to support you. When you avoid these events, what's one thing you're giving up – something that matters to you, no matter how small it seems?

Patient: I guess what I give up most is that feeling of belonging — even just the small, silly stuff like laughing over a shared joke or grabbing coffee after. It feels petty but those little moments remind me I'm not just someone's parent or a student, I'm... part of a life. But how is naming that supposed to help? I've named things before and it didn't change the pulling panic.

Therapist: When you avoid these gatherings, what happens in those moments when you're there – laughing, grabbing coffee – just before the panic kicks in? Is it like the pause right before a storm, where you can almost feel the calm before the chaos? Can you try to hold onto that small moment just before it hits, without trying to change it, just to see if it shifts the weight of the panic?

Patient: Yeah, there’s a split second — someone says something funny and I actually laugh, and for a breath I feel like I belong. Then my chest tightens, my thoughts sprint to ‘I need to get out,’ and the panic spikes. I can try to hold that moment, but I’ve tried noticing it before and it just made the panic louder — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like that brief moment of laughter is what matters most – not the panic that follows. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that moment, you simply allowed yourself to feel the pause between the laughter and the tightening chest – that small space before the thoughts start racing?

Patient: Okay, I can feel that half-second — the laugh, a tiny pocket of calm, then my chest just clamps down. But when I try to 'sit' with it or breathe through it, it usually makes the panic worse, not better. I've done mindfulness and breathing exercises before and they didn't help — how is just noticing this pause supposed to change anything, and what exactly would you have me do in that split second that's actually different from what I've already tried?

Therapist: When you notice the pause, it's not about "sitting with it" or breathing through it in the way you've done before. It's about noticing the pause as a process, not a goal. Imagine you're observing a storm – you're not trying to stop it, you're just watching the clouds move. What would you do with this pause, if it weren't about avoiding the panic?

Patient: I guess I'd try to let that half-second be enough — let myself enjoy the laugh, make a quick mental note like "this felt okay," and stay instead of bolting. But honestly, every time I've tried to "let it be" it just turns into analyzing and the panic gets louder. So what exactly would I do in that split second that actually changes things, because I'm skeptical another "notice" trick will help?

Therapist: What if, in that half-second, you made a tiny, physical choice – like taking a single step forward, or leaning forward ever so slightly? Not to avoid the panic, but to create a small space between yourself and the thought "I need to get out." By doing something small and concrete, you'd be creating a different relationship with the pause – not noticing it as a problem, but as a small, separate thing.

Patient: I could try making a tiny move instead of bolting — like leaning forward or taking a single step — but honestly that feels performative, like I'm pretending I'm okay. I've pushed myself that way before and it only delayed the panic, didn't stop it — so how is doing a small physical thing supposed to change the panic itself? Give me a concrete example of what you'd want me to do in that half‑second and how I'm supposed to practice it so it actually becomes useful.

Therapist: Imagine, in that half-second, you're not trying to "be okay" or "perform" anything. You're simply noticing the pause between the laugh and the chest tightening. What if, just for a tiny fraction of a second, you looked at your own hand? Not to analyze it, but simply to notice what it's doing – is it relaxed, or is it clenched? Just observe your hand, without trying to change it, without judgment.

Patient: Alright—I tried it in my head. My hand felt a bit tight, fingers curled, and for a breath my chest eased, then my mind started narrating everything and the panic came back. How is looking at my hand supposed to help when at a real party my thoughts are so loud, and how would I actually practice this without just turning it into more analysis?

Therapist: Notice what happened when you tried to look at your hand – your mind started narrating everything, and the panic came back. That's because looking at your hand was trying to solve the problem (calming your hand) instead of noticing the problem itself (the panic). What if, instead of looking at your hand, you simply observed the thought "I'm going to analyze this" as you noticed it? Just notice the thought, without trying to change it or act on it. Ask yourself, "What's the purpose of this thought?"

Patient: If I ask myself that, the answer's obvious — the thought's trying to protect me, get me out before I look foolish or overwhelmed. But the second I start naming its purpose I’m already racing: it just becomes another thing to analyze and the panic jumps. So how is that supposed to actually stop the urgency in the moment — I’ve labeled thoughts before and it didn’t change the pull to flee.

Therapist: Instead of asking "What's the purpose of this thought?", try asking "What would happen if you didn't try to protect yourself from this thought?" What would be the smallest, most tiny thing that could happen if you didn't try to push it away?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing would be more discomfort for a moment — my chest tightens, I might blush or stumble over a word, maybe step back or go quiet. Letting that happen feels like it just feeds the panic though; I've tried not defending myself and it turned into a full-on exit. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — how is letting the small stuff happen supposed to stop the bigger urge to flee?

Therapist: Notice that the moment you start to let go of trying to protect yourself from the thought, you're not just tolerating discomfort – you're creating space for something else to show up. What's the value that's driving your desire to stay in the moment, even if it's just for a tiny fraction of a second? Is it connection with others, or something else?

Patient: It's definitely about connection — those tiny, ordinary moments that make me feel alive and seen, not just defined by roles. But even saying that doesn't fix the panic; I get that connection matters, so how is reminding myself of it supposed to help when my chest's clamping and my feet want to leave?

Therapist: Notice that when your chest is clamping and your feet want to leave, it's not just the thought of connection that's driving this reaction – it's the feeling of being disconnected from what matters. What if, in the midst of this panic, you could just notice that feeling without trying to fix it? Just acknowledge that your body is pushing away connection because it feels like you're not safe enough to stay.

Patient: Okay — I can say it: my body is pushing away because it doesn't feel safe to stay. But the problem is when I try to just "notice" that, it usually snowballs into more panic and I bolt. How is noticing supposed to help in the middle of a party — what do I actually do next that isn't just another thing to ruminate on? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down and walk through a concrete, tiny step I could try in the moment?

Therapist: Let's break it down. In the midst of the party, when your chest is clamping and your feet want to leave, what's the **only** physical thing you could do without analyzing it or trying to fix it? Just one tiny action: Look at the person next to you. Not to think about connection or anything else, just to notice the person's face, their expression, or their hands. That's it.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea of just looking, but that feels exposed — when I've tried to "notice" someone before I end up analyzing every little thing and the panic spikes. So what exactly do you want me to look at (eyes, hands, face?), for how long, and if they meet my gaze and I freeze, what do I do next — give me a one-line script I can actually rehearse. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down and walk through that tiny step concretely?

Therapist: Here's a one-line script for the tiny step: "When my chest clamps, I look at the person's **nose** for 1 second, without thinking, without analyzing, just to notice the shape of it."

Patient: Okay… that feels oddly specific — staring at someone's nose for a second. I can try it, but what if they notice and look back? Do I hold their gaze or look away, and what exactly do I do next without turning it into another thing to analyze? Also, how do I practice this so it becomes natural — rehearse alone in front of a mirror, or try it at a low-stakes coffee first? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with all the steps; can we slow down and pick one concrete thing to start with?

Therapist: Let's start with just the **initial step**: "When my chest clamps, I look up from my drink." That's it. No analyzing, no thinking, just the physical act of lifting your gaze from your drink.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just looking up from my drink supposed to stop my chest from clamping? I've done little tricks like that before and they just delayed the panic or made me more self‑conscious. So tell me exactly: how long do I look up, where do I put my eyes, and if someone notices and meets my gaze, what do I do next? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with all these steps; can we slow down and pick one concrete thing to rehearse first, maybe something I can practice alone at home?

Therapist: Let's start with a single physical action that doesn't require attention or effort: **tilting your head slightly**. Just tilt your head up about 5 degrees. That's it. No thinking, no analyzing, just the physical action of tilting your head.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — tilt my head five degrees? How is that supposed to help when my chest's already clamping and my mind's racing? If I do it and someone notices, do I hold it, look away, smile, or what? Also, how long do I hold that tilt and how do I practice it alone so it doesn't just become another thing to overthink? I'm feeling confused and a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and pick one clear, simple rehearsal I can try at home?

Therapist: Let's start with a simple action that can be practiced in a private setting: **making a small, slight movement with your hand**. Choose one hand, and when your chest clamps, make a tiny, small movement with that hand – like opening your fingers, closing them, or wiggling your thumb. Just one tiny action, no thinking, no analysis.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is wiggling my thumb supposed to stop my chest from clamping? Which hand should I use, how small is "tiny," and for how long do I do it? This is starting to feel like another thing to overthink, but I can try once if you promise to keep it really simple.

Therapist: Let's start with a **single finger movement**. Choose one finger, and when your chest clamps, **touch the tip of that finger to your thumb**. That's it. No thinking, no analysis, just the physical action of touching the finger to the thumb.

Patient: Touch my finger to my thumb? How is that supposed to stop my chest from clamping — it just sounds like another gimmick I've tried. Which finger, which hand, how small and for how long do I do it, and if someone notices what then? I'm worn out by steps like this, but I can try once if you give one clear, simple rehearsal I can do at home without overthinking.

Therapist: Let's start with **a small, gentle touch**. When your chest clamps, **lightly touch the back of your hand to your palm**. Just a tiny, gentle touch, no thinking, no analysis. That's it.

Patient: Okay… I can try that, but I'm skeptical — how is lightly touching my hand to my palm supposed to stop my chest from clamping? Which hand should I use, how long do I hold it, and how do I practice it at home without turning it into another thing to overthink? I'm worn out by steps like this, so give me one very clear rehearsal I can do alone and tell me what I should expect to feel when I do it.

Therapist: Let's start with a **simple, concrete action**: When you feel your chest clamping, **put your finger on your palm for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds)**. That's it. Just touch your finger to your palm, and then let go. No thinking, no analysis. Just observe what happens without judgment.

**What to expect:** As you touch your finger to your palm, you might feel a slight physical sensation, like a tiny spark of awareness. That's it. Don't try to change it or analyze it – just notice what happens.

Patient: Okay... I can try, but I'm really distracted and my mind's already racing — I'm not sure I'll remember the 1–2 seconds in the moment. Which finger and which hand should I use, and how do you want me to practice this at home without turning it into another thing to overthink?

Therapist: Let's simplify it. **Use your index finger and your right hand**. When your chest clamps, **just touch the tip of your index finger to the palm of your right hand**. Don't worry about the timing – just touch it lightly and let go. Practice this in front of a mirror or while standing in a quiet room, so you can see what happens.

Patient: Okay… I can try that — index finger, right hand, touch tip to palm. But I'm skeptical: how is that supposed to calm my chest any more than the dozen little tricks I've tried? I'm distracted and worry I won't remember it at a party — give me one very short rehearsal I can do at home (how many reps, for how long, and what exactly to notice), and tell me what I should expect to feel so I don't start overthinking. Also, if I'm in the middle of panic and it doesn't help, what do I do next — keep touching, breathe, or get out? Can we slow down and just pick one thing to practice first?

Therapist: Let's start with a **simple, 5-second exercise**:

1. Sit comfortably with your back straight.
2. Place your right hand in your lap with your fingers together.
3. When you feel your chest clamping (just for 1-2 seconds), **touch the tip of your index finger to the palm of your right hand**.
4. **Notice the sensation of your finger touching your palm**. Don't think about calming your chest or stopping the panic – just focus on the physical sensation.
5. Take a deep breath and let go of the finger.

**What to expect:** As you touch your finger to your palm, you might feel a slight physical sensation, like a tiny spark of awareness. If you're in the middle of panic and it doesn't help, **don't worry – just breathe**. You can try again later when you feel calmer.

Patient: Okay — I can try, but I'm already distracted and my mind's racing. How many reps should I do at home and for how long each time? What exactly should I notice in that sensation (pressure, warmth, nothing), and if I try it during a panic and it doesn't help, do I keep doing it, take a breath, or leave — give me one very simple rehearsal to actually practice so it doesn't turn into more overthinking.

Therapist: **Do this exercise 5 times, 2 minutes apart**. Each time:

1. Sit comfortably with your back straight.
2. Place your right hand in your lap with your fingers together.
3. When you feel your chest clamping (just for 1-2 seconds), **touch the tip of your index finger to the palm of your right hand**.
4. **Notice the sensation of your finger touching your palm**. Don't try to change it or analyze it – just focus on the physical sensation.

**What to do if it doesn't help:** If you're in the middle of panic and it doesn't help, **stop and breathe**. Take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then, go back to your day, but remember this exercise for later when you feel calmer.

Patient: Okay… I can try the five reps, but I'm already jittery and skeptical this won't just turn into another thing to overthink. Quick clarifications: should I practice the five reps while calm (simulate the clamping) or only when it actually happens, and is the touch one second or two? If it makes the panic worse in the moment, do I stop right away and just breathe, or keep trying until it feels different?

Therapist: **Practice the five reps while you're calm**, simulating the clamping sensation. For each rep:

1. Sit comfortably with your back straight.
2. Place your right hand in your lap with your fingers together.
3. **Touch the tip of your index finger to the palm of your right hand** for **1 second**.
4. **Notice the sensation of your finger touching your palm**.
5. Take a deep breath and let go of the finger.

**What to do if it makes the panic worse:** If you're in the middle of panic and the exercise makes it worse, **stop immediately**. Take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and go back to your day. **Don't try to force it**. When you feel calmer, you can try again.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try the five reps while calm, though I’m skeptical this won’t just turn into more overthinking. I’m jittery and distracted — quick clarifications: when you say “simulate the clamping,” do you want me to tense my chest a little or just imagine it? And how should I time the one second without a timer? Can you walk me through one rep right now, step‑by‑step, so I can actually practice it instead of guessing?

Therapist: Let's walk through one rep together. Imagine you're sitting comfortably with your back straight. Here's what you'll do:

**Step 1: Place your hand**
Place your right hand in your lap with your fingers together.

**Step 2: Touch your finger to palm**
Touch the tip of your index finger to the palm of your right hand. Just lightly touch it - don't press too hard.

**Step 3: Notice the sensation**
Take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your finger touching your palm. Don't try to change it or analyze it - just focus on the physical feeling.

**Timing**
Don't worry about timing it exactly - just do it when you feel your finger touching your palm. If you're not sure when that is, just do it as soon as you feel your finger make contact.

Let's practice it together: Place your right hand in your lap... (pause) Touch the tip of your index finger to the palm... (pause) Notice the sensation...

Patient: Okay... I did it — placed my hand, touched my finger to my palm, breathed. I didn't notice much beyond a faint little warmth and then my mind started listing everything I have to do and I felt jittery again. Should I be tensing my chest a little to "simulate" the clamp or just imagine it when I practice? And if I try this at a real get‑together and it doesn't help, what's the immediate next thing I do? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and stick to one clear answer?

Therapist: When practicing, **don't tense your chest** - just imagine the sensation of the clamping. Think of it as a gentle, soft feeling, like a gentle pressure or a subtle tightening in your chest. Don't try to recreate the actual clamping sensation - just imagine it happening.

If it doesn't help at a real gathering and you feel overwhelmed, **take a 5-second pause** before trying to stay or leave. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and when you're ready, **ask yourself one question**: "What's one thing I can do in this moment to connect with others without getting overwhelmed?"

Patient: Okay... I can try the 5‑second pause, but I'm skeptical it won't just be another thing for my brain to get hung up on. Give me three very concrete, rehearseable options I can pick from in the moment — something tiny I can do without thinking, one thing to say, and one safe physical move (and what to do if it makes things worse). I'm already starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by choices here, so can we slow down and pick one to practice right now?

Therapist: Let's focus on one option. Here are three simple, concrete choices:

1. **Tiny action:** Smile and make eye contact with someone within 3 feet of you. That's it. Just smile and look at them.
2. **One thing to say:** Say "I'm glad you're here" to the person next to you. That's a simple, friendly comment.
3. **Safe physical move:** Lean forward slightly in your chair and relax your shoulders. That's a gentle, non-threatening movement.

**What to do if it makes things worse:** If you try one of these options and it feels like it's making the panic worse, **stop immediately**. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and go back to being present. We'll try again when you feel calmer.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the safe physical move: lean forward slightly and relax my shoulders. Walk me through exactly how much forward (an inch? a tilt?), how long to hold it, and what I'm supposed to notice while I do it, and if it makes the panic worse do I stop immediately and just breathe? I'm feeling a bit worn out and distracted, so please keep it very simple.
