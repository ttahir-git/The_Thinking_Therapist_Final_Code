Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this cycle of harsh self-criticism — I latch onto little perceived failures and it drags me back into the same shame I felt struggling through school, even though I eventually found success as an artist. The recent move's made the anxiety worse because everything feels unsettled and that voice keeps telling me I'm not good enough. I've tried therapy and different techniques before, so honestly, how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: You've been carrying this shame for a long time, and it's understandable that the move would bring it up again. What's the one thing you're willing to hold onto about your past success as an artist – the part that felt good or meaningful to you?

Patient: I guess the one thing is the sense of being seen — when someone really connected with a piece, it felt like I mattered and my work had purpose. That feeling of being in the flow and knowing I could make something honest still matters to me. But... how is that supposed to help now? I've clung to that and it still gets drowned out by the old doubts.

Therapist: That feeling of being seen and connected to your work is a vital part of who you are as an artist – it's what makes your heart feel alive. Instead of letting those doubts drown it out, what if you started small? What would it take for you to hold onto that feeling of being seen today, even if it's just for a minute, while you're getting settled into this new space?

Patient: Maybe I could start by putting one piece where I see it first thing in the morning and spend one minute with it—just notice how it feels to be seen while I drink my coffee. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried tiny rituals like that before and the doubt just creeps back in before the day's even started.

Therapist: When you're struggling with doubt, what's the first thing that shows up – the feeling of not being good enough? And what happens right after that? Can you connect the tiny ritual of noticing your art in the morning to that moment of doubt? Maybe it's not about making the doubt go away, but about being present with it while you're already in that state, so you can ask yourself: What would it be like to make space for that feeling of being seen, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Usually it starts as a tightness in my chest and this small voice saying I'm faking it, like a fraud. Then I start replaying little mistakes, shrinking everything down and avoiding showing work or finishing things, so the day's momentum just dies. Putting a piece where I see it might steady me for a minute, but the doubt always elbows back in and that minute feels like a tease—how is that supposed to help? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: That tightness in your chest and the small voice saying you're a fraud – that's where the work gets stuck. When that voice starts replaying your mistakes, what's the one thing you could do instead of shrinking from it? Instead of trying to silence the voice, what if you simply noticed it – just as it is – and said to yourself, "Ah, my mind is running the 'I'm a fake' story again"?

Patient: I can see how naming it—saying, "Ah, my mind's running the 'I'm a fake' story"—might create a tiny gap between me and the voice. But honestly, when I try that it feels like putting a bandage on a leak; the shame still rushes through and the voice just gets louder. I'll try saying it, though—how is noticing really supposed to make it matter less?

Therapist: You're right, putting a bandage on the leak isn't solving anything. But what if, instead of trying to stop the leak, you started to notice the water – the shame – as it was flowing? What if, while it's still pouring, you gently ask yourself, "What would it be like to hold this feeling of shame – just for a moment – while you're still being seen by your art"? Notice how that shifts the focus from trying to stop the shame to being present with it while still holding onto the value of being seen?

Patient: I can kind of picture sitting with the shame while I look at a piece, but honestly it feels like that just makes the shame louder, not smaller. How is that supposed to help when the feeling already drowns everything out? I'll try it once or twice, but I'm not convinced it won't just become another thing I fail at.

Therapist: You're right, it might feel like the shame gets louder, but what if, instead of trying to make it smaller, you simply asked yourself: What would it be like to make space for this feeling of shame – right now, while you're looking at your art – without trying to change it or make it go away? Would that be willing for you?

Patient: I’ll try making space for the shame while looking at a piece—maybe for a minute—but honestly I’ve done the “sit with it” thing before and it usually spirals and freezes me. How is that supposed to actually help me finish work or stop replaying past mistakes instead of just becoming another thing I fail at?

Therapist: You've tried sitting with the shame before, but it feels like it freezes you. What if, instead of trying to make the shame go away, you simply asked yourself: What's one tiny thing you can do with your hands, with your feet, with your breath – just one small thing – while you're looking at this piece? Not to change the shame, but to make space for it, so you can move forward?

Patient: Maybe I could do something tiny like make one deliberate mark on a canvas or paper, set the brush down, and take three slow breaths. It feels doable—something with my hands that doesn't require finishing—but I can already hear myself worrying it'll just become another ritual I break and then shame myself over. How is that supposed to help when the fraud voice will still be yelling afterward? I'm willing to try it, but I'm not convinced.

Therapist: You're right, the fraud voice might still show up, but what if, before you start making that mark, you simply asked yourself: What's the one thing I'm willing to do with my hands right now, just to make space for being seen – not to finish the painting, not to silence the voice, but just to take one tiny step? You've been willing to try it before, and it's small enough that you can do it without finishing the painting.

Patient: Okay—I'll try making one deliberate mark and taking three slow breaths before I do anything else, but I'm already dreading it feeling like another ritual I break and then beat myself up over. How is that supposed to help when the fraud voice comes back and everything still stalls? If I do this and it doesn't stick, what do I actually do next so it doesn't just become another failure to add to the pile?

Therapist: You're right to worry that the fraud voice might come back, but what if, after you take those three slow breaths and make that one deliberate mark, you simply asked yourself: What's the one thing I'm willing to do next, right now – not to finish the painting, not to silence the voice, but to keep moving forward? Not to fail, but to simply take the next step.

Patient: Okay—maybe the next thing I can do is open a sketchbook and do a two‑minute thumbnail, just to move my hands without expecting anything. I can hear that fraud voice already, though, saying it'll be worthless and I'll quit—how is that supposed to help me actually keep going when I know I'll beat myself up if it doesn't stick?

Therapist: You're already hearing the voice of self-doubt, but what if, instead of trying to silence it, you simply noticed it – just as it is – while you're opening the sketchbook and making that thumbnail? What if you didn't try to make it "good" or "worthwhile," but instead just asked yourself: What's the sensation of my hand moving on the page? Not to create something perfect, but to simply be with my hand and the page for two minutes?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to two‑minute thumbnail and just notice the doubt while my hand moves; right now my hand already feels heavy and a bit shaky. But honestly, how is that supposed to help if my mind just hijacks those two minutes and turns it into another round of self‑criticism?

Therapist: You're right that your mind might hijack those two minutes, but what if, instead of trying to stop the hijacking, you simply focused on the process of noticing the doubt as you move your hand? What if, instead of trying to make it "good" or "worthwhile," you just asked yourself: What's the sensation of my hand moving on the page, right now? Not to create something perfect, but to simply be with the sensation of my hand moving.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to notice the feeling — the paper, the drag, the weight in my hand — but honestly I'm worn out and already expecting my mind to turn those two minutes into another critique. How is simply noticing the sensation actually supposed to stop the hijack from spiraling into replaying mistakes? If it does start spiraling, what's a tiny, doable next step that won't just become another ritual I fail at?

Therapist: You're right that your mind might still hijack those two minutes, but what if, instead of trying to stop it, you simply accepted it – allowed it to be exactly as it is – while you're noticing the sensation of your hand moving? Not to change it, but to simply observe it. If it starts spiraling into replaying mistakes, what tiny, doable next step could you take to simply move forward – like picking up a pencil, or writing a single word – that wouldn't add another ritual to the pile?

Patient: Maybe I’d do something tiny and almost silly—set a 30‑second timer and just scribble without trying to make anything, then set the pencil down. If the replay starts, I’d stand up, go to the window, take three slow breaths, and then sit back down to make one more deliberate mark. But honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: You're right to wonder how setting a timer and scribbling will actually help, but what if that small action was actually a tiny step towards the value of being seen – not just as an artist, but as a person who creates? By taking that small step, you're not trying to fix the replay or change your mind, but simply making space for the next step – like taking a deep breath or making a deliberate mark – that can help you move forward, no matter what.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the 30‑second scribble, the breaths, and that extra mark, but I'm just... worn out by all these 'tiny steps' that feel temporary. How is that actually supposed to help when the doubt just comes back and I'm left feeling like I failed again?

Therapist: You're right that these tiny steps might feel temporary, but what if, instead of trying to fix the replay or make them last, you simply showed up for yourself – for one small moment – by taking that 30-second scribble and breathing? Not to change the replay, but to acknowledge that you're already showing up, even when the doubt comes back. That tiny act of showing up becomes a small anchor that says: "I'm here, I'm willing to be with this feeling, even when it's hard."

Patient: I can see that—maybe the scribble could be an anchor, but right now my chest's tight and that old shame is already making everything feel heavy and useless. I'll try it, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop this from just turning into another thing I fail at when the shame rushes back?

Therapist: You're right that the shame is heavy, but what if, instead of trying to change it, you simply acknowledged its presence – the tightness in your chest, the weight of the shame – and said to yourself: "I'm willing to be with this feeling, even if it's hard"? Not to fix the shame, but to acknowledge that you're willing to stay with it, no matter what. The scribble becomes a small act of willingness, not a solution to the shame.

Patient: I can try the scribble as an act of willingness, but right now it feels hollow—my chest's tight and that old shame just floods everything, making even a tiny mark feel pointless. I'll do it, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when the shame just turns any small thing into another failure to beat myself over? I'm worn out by this cycle and not sure how many more "small steps" I can keep doing if they just pile up into the same pile of mistakes.

Therapist: You're right that the shame is crushing, but what if, instead of trying to push through it with the scribble, you connected that willingness to the very pain it's causing – the tightness in your chest, the weight of the shame? What if, while you're scribbling, you simply asked yourself: "What would it take for me to stay with this feeling, even when it feels like a failure, if it meant just making one tiny mark?" That's not about changing the shame; it's about connecting the willingness to the specific pain it's causing – to make it tangible, to make it real.

Patient: Maybe making it concrete could help—asking what it takes to stay with the feeling while I make that tiny mark—but right now my chest clamps and that shame floods back so fast it feels like I already failed. I can try it, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the spiral once it starts, and what's one tiny, actually doable thing I can do in the moment if it does? I don't know... I'm just worn out by this.

Therapist: You're right that the shame is crushing, but what if, when it starts to flood back, you simply defused it by noticing one tiny thing – the sensation of your breath moving in and out – without trying to change it? Not to push through the shame, but to meet it exactly as it is. For example, you could say to yourself: "The feeling in my chest is... heavy. My breath is moving in and out. That's it." That's not trying to fix the shame; it's just noticing it – the exact sensation of the shame – without judgment.

Patient: Okay—I can try the breathing label, like saying to myself, "The breath is moving in and out," even though my chest already feels like lead and I'm not convinced noticing it will change much. If it starts spiraling, I'll set the pencil down, put my hand flat on the page and take three slow breaths or stand and look out the window for a moment—but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame from turning it into yet another failure?

Therapist: You're right that the shame might still feel overwhelming, but what if, instead of trying to change it with the breath, you simply accepted it – acknowledged it as exactly what it is – without judgment? When you say "The breath is moving in and out," you're not trying to fix the shame; you're simply noticing the breath, the sensation of the breath moving in and out. That's not about changing the shame; it's about being present with it, without trying to change it. The shame might still show up, but you've already taken the first step by simply accepting it as you notice the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying "the breath is moving in and out" while I do the tiny mark, though my chest is tight and my hands feel shaky and my mind's already racing. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame from turning this into yet another failure? If it spirals, I'll set the pencil down, take three slow breaths, and try to come back, but I don't know how many more of these cycles I can keep doing.

Therapist: You're right that the shame might still show up, but what if, instead of trying to stop it, you focused on the tiny act of creating that mark – not the outcome, not the shame, just the act of creating? You're not trying to create a masterpiece; you're just making a tiny mark. If you can bring your hand to the paper, breathe, and say "the breath is moving in and out," that's a small win. You've taken a tiny step, and that's something to build on. The shame might still come, but you've already done something – you've taken a tiny action.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to bring my hand, say "the breath is moving in and out," and make that tiny mark, though my chest's tight and my mind's already racing. How is that supposed to help when the shame just hijacks everything and turns it into another failure? If breathing and setting the pencil down don't break the spiral, what's one actually doable micro-step in the moment that won't just become another thing I beat myself up over?

Therapist: You're right that breathing and setting the pencil down might not stop the spiral, but what if, in the midst of that spiral, you simply noticed the sensation of your fingers making contact with the paper? Not to create something, not to stop the shame, just to notice the physical sensation of your fingers touching the paper. That's a tiny, concrete action that happens right now, without trying to change anything else.

Patient: Okay — I can try to notice the feeling of my fingers on the paper, but my chest's tight and that replaying voice is already churning, so I'm skeptical. How is noticing that sensation actually supposed to stop the shame from hijacking things? If it does start spiraling, what's one tiny, non‑ritual thing I can do in the moment that won't just turn into more shame?

Therapist: You're right that noticing the sensation might not stop the shame, but what if, when you feel your fingers touching the paper, you didn't try to push it away or change it? You simply let it be – the sensation of your fingers on the paper, the feeling of the shame in your chest, the replaying voice. That's defusion. You're not trying to change the shame; you're just letting it be, exactly as it is. If the spiral starts, you're not trying to fight it; you're just noticing the sensation of your fingers on the paper, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I can try to just notice my fingers on the paper and let the shame be, but I’m already bracing for it to spiral and shut me down. If it does, maybe I’ll stand up, put my palm on the window frame, and look outside for ten seconds — something physical that breaks the loop without feeling like another ritual to fail at. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the shame just follows me into the next room?

Therapist: You're right that standing up and looking outside might be a physical action, but what if, instead of trying to push the shame away, you simply made a tiny movement that doesn't try to change it? Like taking a small step forward, or tapping your foot once. That's not trying to change the shame; it's just making a small physical action that breaks the loop. You're not trying to fight the shame; you're just creating a tiny distraction that lets you breathe again.

Patient: I can try tapping my foot once — it feels almost laughably small, and my chest's already tight so the shame's louder than any tap. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame from trailing me into the next room, and if it doesn't, what's one tiny thing I can actually do that won't just turn into another failure to blame myself for?

Therapist: You're right that tapping your foot might feel small, but what if, instead of trying to stop the shame, you simply noticed the sensation of your foot touching the floor? Not to change it, not to stop it, just to notice the tiny physical sensation of your foot touching the floor. That's not trying to fix the shame; it's just focusing on the tiny action itself. If you can tap your foot once and notice the sensation of your foot touching the floor, that's a tiny, tangible thing you've done.

Patient: Okay — I can try tapping my foot once and really notice the contact, though my chest's tight and my attention's already jumping. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame trailing me into the next room? If the tap doesn't help, what's one tiny, non‑ritual thing I can do right then that won't just turn into more self‑blame?

Therapist: You're right that the tap might not stop the shame, but what if, right now, you simply did the tiny action of tapping your foot once? Not to change the shame, not to stop it, just to do the tiny action itself. Don't worry about what happens next; just focus on the sensation of your foot touching the floor. If your attention jumps, that's okay – just gently bring it back to the sensation of your foot touching the floor. That's not about fixing the shame; it's about doing the tiny action in the present moment.

Patient: Alright — I tapped my foot once. I can feel the contact, the little pressure, but my chest's still tight and my attention's already skittering away. How is that supposed to help when the shame just follows me into the next room? If this doesn't work, maybe I'll stand at the window like we said, but I'm worn out by all these tiny fixes.

Therapist: You tapped your foot once, and now you're noticing the contact, the pressure. That's great. But what if, instead of trying to push the shame away or change it, you simply noticed the pause between actions? That tiny pause between tapping your foot and whatever comes next. Not to fix the shame, but to notice the pause itself. That pause is what matters – not the shame, not the next action, just the pause. If you can notice that pause, you've done something tiny, right there, in this moment.

Patient: I did notice the pause — a tiny half‑second like a small loosening in my chest — but it barely lasts before the shame slides back in and everything feels heavier. How is that supposed to help when the pause evaporates and I'm already collapsing into self‑critique? If the pause doesn't hold, what’s one really usable thing I can do in that moment that won’t just become another thing I fail at?
