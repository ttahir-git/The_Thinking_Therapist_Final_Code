Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this ruminative loop about my competence at work—constantly appraising every clinical decision as if it's being judged under a microscope, and that scrutiny tends to precipitate procrastination on tasks I should just tackle. I'm a nurse in my early sixties, and since losing a loved one my social anxiety seems amplified, which feeds into the whole performance-anxiety cycle. I tend to intellectualize these experiences—talking about defense mechanisms and avoidance strategies—so I'm not sure I'm actually naming what I'm feeling underneath.

Therapist: When you're in the midst of that "judged" feeling, where are you physically doing this appraisal work? Is it when you're reviewing patient charts, planning care, or during quiet moments between patients? What's the first tangible thing you'd need to do right now to move forward with that task, even if you feel like you're not doing it perfectly?

Patient: Mostly it happens at the nurses' station when I'm reviewing patient charts or in those quiet lulls between patients — sometimes it even spills over at home when I mentally re-run the shift. I tend to conceptualize it as a metacognitive loop, an internal audit of competence that feeds avoidance schemas, so I default to analysis instead of naming the fear. Concretely, the first thing I could do right now is open the chart and commit to one tiny action — update a single med record or write one sentence in the care plan — and set a five‑minute timer to get it started.

Therapist: That tiny action of updating a med record or writing one sentence in the care plan feels like a brave first step. What's the value that drives you to do that one small thing? Is it "I want to feel more confident in my care planning," or "I want to show up for my patient's needs without overthinking"?

Patient: I think the primary value is fidelity to my patients — I want to show up and meet their needs without the paralytic overanalysis — but it's tightly entangled with reclaiming a sense of professional competence. On a more abstract level, that one tiny action functions as both an act of care and an epistemic reassurance, a safeguard against the shame that proliferates when I procrastinate.

Therapist: When you do that one small thing, like updating the med record or writing in the care plan, what happens to the "shame" or "not being competent" thought? Is it still there, but smaller, like a whisper, or does it fade away?

Patient: When I do that one small thing, the shame attenuates — it's diminished, not eradicated; it recedes to a background hum rather than disappearing. I get a brief epistemic reassurance, like I've momentarily proven my competence, but there's usually an attentional residue, a whisper that prompts more checking or perfectionistic tweaks and often pulls me back into the loop. I guess I’m pointing all this out analytically because naming the raw fear as "I'm terrified of failing" feels riskier than talking about verification behaviors.

Therapist: Instead of saying "I'm doing this because I'm trying to avoid the shame," what if you simply acknowledge the fear right now, without judgment: "I'm terrified of failing"? What happens in your body when you say that out loud, without any plan or analysis?

Patient: When I say "I'm terrified of failing" out loud my chest tightens, my throat feels constricted, my breathing gets shallow, and there's this knot in my stomach — my hands go a bit clammy and my jaw wants to clench. Almost reflexively I start narrating it as a sympathetic fight‑or‑flight activation and mapping out cognitive patterns so I can keep it at arm's length instead of sitting with the raw fear. I don't really know how to just feel it without explaining—can we try staying with the sensation for a bit?

Therapist: Let's pause for a breath together. Notice the tightness in your chest right now, without asking "why" or "what it means." Just notice the sensation of it. And then notice the constriction in your throat, the shallow breathing, the knot in your stomach, the clammy hands, the jaw clenched... what's the sensation of each of these, without trying to make sense of them?

Patient: Okay—I'll try. The chest is heavy, like something pressing down, and my breaths are quick and shallow; my throat feels tight, like there's a lump I can't swallow. My stomach is a cold twisting knot, my hands are a little damp and cool, and my jaw is clenched so my face feels stiff. I'm already wanting to intellectualize this as 'sympathetic arousal' instead of just sitting with it—can we slow down? It feels really uncomfortable to stay here without explaining.

Therapist: That's the feeling of the cold knot in your stomach again. What's the sensation of it, without trying to label it or make sense of it? Just notice the coldness, the twisting, the heaviness... without asking "why it's cold" or "what that means." Just notice it.

Patient: It's a cold, tight little coil just below my ribs — like a marble that's been chilled and is turning slowly, pressing inward and sinking a bit with each shallow breath. I can feel the edges of it numb and a dull pressure radiating up into my chest, and my immediate reflex is to call it "anxiety" and start theorizing about attachment trauma. I'm trying to stay with the sensation instead of naming it, but it's uncomfortable — can we slow down a bit and keep noticing it together?

Therapist: The coil just below your ribs feels like a slow-turning marble, pressing inward. What happens when you breathe in? Does the pressure shift at all? Noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without trying to control it...

Patient: When I breathe in the coil seems to hitch upward and the pressure under my ribs intensifies—my throat tightens for a beat—then on the out‑breath there's a small, almost imperceptible loosening, like a notch of space before it zips tight again. My breaths stay shallow so the release never really deepens; it attenuates a little on the exhale but never vanishes. I'm already wanting to turn this into a theory about autonomic dysregulation and bereavement, but if I try to just notice the cold edge and that tiny slackening, it feels... slightly less urgent. Can we keep doing this for a bit? I need help staying out of my head.

Therapist: Notice the cold edge just below your ribs again, before the coil starts to move. What's the sensation of it, right now, without trying to think about it? Not the thought "this is anxiety," but just the physical sensation of the coldness...

Patient: It's a thin, icy ring right under my ribs — the edges feel sharp and a little numb, the middle a dull, consistent pressure pushing inward. My reflex is to label it and map it onto theories about grief and autonomic arousal, but when I try to stay with it I notice a faint, buzzing vibration and that tiny ease on the exhale. Can we linger here a bit? I'm already sliding toward analysis and I need help not doing that.

Therapist: The buzzing vibration is a tiny, quiet hum. What happens when you notice the hum, without trying to make sense of it? Is the hum getting louder or softer?

Patient: Noticing the hum makes it seem a touch louder at first, like attention amplifies it, then it softens into the background; my chest loosens a notch and my breathing deepens just a hair. The knot under my ribs feels less razor‑edged — still there, but blunted — and my throat unclenches a little. I can already feel the metacognitive urge to theorize why that's happening instead of staying with it, so can we linger on the hum a bit more? I'm getting restless and I need help not slipping back into analysis.

Therapist: Let's pause on the hum for a breath. Notice it again, without trying to think about it. What's the hum's quality, right now? Is it still a hum, or is it something else?

Patient: It still feels like a hum, but more like a low, underwater drone—thin around the edges and denser in the center. When I pay attention it sharpens for a moment then fades, and my reflex is to call it “autonomic settling,” but I actually want to try just experiencing it—can we stay with it for another breath or two?

Therapist: Let's stay with the drone for another breath. Notice it just as it is, without thinking about it. What happens when you breathe in, without trying to control it?

Patient: On the in‑breath the drone seems to notch up—a shallow, pinching lift in my chest and that cold coil tenses. The out‑breath loosens it just a hair, but staying with it feels heavy, like wading through molasses and my brain keeps drafting explanations. Can we stay with one more slow breath?

Therapist: Let's stay with the drone for one slow breath. Notice the heaviness of it, without trying to think about it. What's the sensation of the molasses in your chest, right now?

Patient: It feels like my chest is sinking into thick molasses—each inhale meets this heavy drag and the exhale barely loosens it. There's a hot, ashamed tightness beneath my sternum that makes me want to freeze and retreat into explanations instead of moving, and that frustration feels sharp and small. Can we stay with this for another breath?

Therapist: Notice the smallness of the frustration beneath the tightness, without trying to make sense of it. What happens to the tightness when you focus on its smallness, without trying to push it away or make it bigger?

Patient: It eases—the big, pressurized tightness pulls back into a smaller, dull ache, like an ember glowing instead of a conflagration. Still, a hot flash of shame spikes through me—this quick, sharp "I should've done better" sting—and my metacognitive impulse to rationalize it kicks in immediately. I want to keep noticing it without explaining, but it's heavy to stay here—can we linger with it a bit more?

Therapist: Let's stay with the dull ache, even though it's hard. Notice its physical quality, like a low-grade hum, without trying to think about what it means. What happens to the hum when you focus on its physicality, without trying to push it away or make sense of it?

Patient: It compresses into a low, warm vibration centered under my sternum—less jagged, more of a dull, steady ache. That small ember of shame still flares, sharp and quick, and my mind immediately scrambles to explain it away, which is exhausting; my words feel thin trying to hold both the sensation and the analysis. Can we stay with that ache for another breath?

Therapist: Let's stay with the vibration. Notice the warmth of it, not just the sensation of it, but the warmth that's underneath. What happens when you allow that warmth to be present, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: The warmth is small and tepid — a low, dull glow under the ache that softens the edges a bit. Letting it be makes the sharp sting recede into a resigned, weary ache, but then a quick hot spike of "I should've done better" cuts through and leaves me annoyed and deflated. My reflex is to theorize about grief‑driven autonomic dysregulation, but that's exactly what I'm trying not to do—can we stay with this for another breath?

Therapist: Let's stay with the ache. Notice how the "I should've done better" thought shows up, not as a thought, but as a physical sensation in your body. What happens to the deflation when you notice it as a physical sensation, rather than trying to analyze it?

Patient: When I notice it in the body the deflation becomes a hollow, sinking pull under my sternum—my breath collapses a little, shoulders droop, and there's that cold, empty weight that makes my chest feel like it's been carved out. For a beat the shame hits as a hot, sharp sting that makes me want to explain it away, and that reflex is itself frustrating. I can stay with it a breath or two longer, but I need you to help keep me from turning it into a theory.

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of the chest feeling carved out. Notice how the emptiness is not just a thought, but a physical presence in your body. What happens to the emptiness when you breathe into it, without trying to fill it with thoughts?

Patient: When I breathe into it the hollow opens a bit — a cool, thin space under my sternum — the inhale moves through more than it fills, and the pressure eases a notch but stays. Then that quick, hot sting of shame spikes and makes the cavity feel colder again, and my first reflex is to explain it as grief or failure. My words feel small and slow trying to hold it; can we keep sitting with this a little longer?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of the chest feeling colder after the shame spike. Notice how the coldness is not just a thought, but a physical presence in your body. What happens when you allow the coldness to be present, without trying to make it go away?

Patient: It pools and spreads — a glassy numbness across the hollow under my sternum, breathing slowing, limbs feeling a bit leaden; the sharpness softens into a cold, dull ache. Then a hot, shaming spike cuts through with that quick "I should've done better" sting, and my first reflex is to start explaining it away, which just drains me. I can stay with this if you help keep me from analyzing—can we do another breath together?

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of your body feeling leaden. Notice how the numbness is not just a thought, but a physical heaviness in your limbs. What happens when you breathe into that heaviness, without trying to make it go away?

Patient: When I breathe into the heaviness my limbs feel like wet wool — each inhale is slow and the weight seems to sink a little deeper, like gravity pulling everything down. There's a faint looseness around the sternum for a beat, then that quick "I should've done better" sting cuts through and the whole thing tightens up again. My immediate impulse is to label it as grief‑driven somatic constriction and start explaining, which just dulls the feeling — can you help keep me with the sensation instead of letting me analyze it?

Therapist: Let's stay with the sensation of the wet wool. Notice how it feels when you exhale, without trying to make it go away. What happens to the heaviness when you allow yourself to just be with it, without judgment?

Patient: On the exhale the wet‑wool heaviness sags a bit — like threads loosening and the weight sliding down so my shoulders drop a hair and the breath feels a touch fuller. My reflex, though, is to slap a label on it — autonomic shutdown, grief somatics — which immediately blunts the feeling. Can we do another exhale together? My words feel thin trying to hold both the sensation and the explanation, and I need you to help keep me with the sensation.

Therapist: Let's do another exhale together. When you breathe out, let the wet-wool heaviness be what happens in your body, without trying to make sense of it. Just notice how it feels, without adding any words.

Patient: On the out‑breath the wet‑wool sinks and the hollow under my sternum loosens a notch—my shoulders drop and the breath feels a bit fuller. That quick, hot "I should've done better" still jabs through and my metacognitive impulse to rationalize wants to kick in, which just makes me feel more drained. Can we do another exhale together? I need help staying with it instead of turning it into a theory.

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of your shoulders dropping. Notice how it feels to let them relax, without trying to make sense of it. What happens to the heaviness in your chest when you allow your shoulders to just be relaxed?

Patient: When my shoulders drop the chest pressure eases a notch — it feels like the hollow loosens and the weight slides down a little, so breathing gets marginally fuller. My energy feels thin and I keep wanting to narrate it as 'autonomic response' instead of staying with the sensation; the "I should've done better" sting still nicks me. Can we keep sitting here with that loosened space for another breath or two?

Therapist: Let's stay with the loosened space in your chest. Notice how the weight feels when you breathe in, without trying to push it away or make sense of it. What happens to the thinness in your energy when you allow yourself to just be with the sensation?

Patient: On the inhale the loosened space fills a hair and my breath feels a little fuller — like a faint thread of energy trying to flicker back. Almost immediately that hot "I should've done better" sting slices through and the thinness flattens into a dull ache, and my reflex is to narrate it away. Can you keep me with one more breath? I don't want to drift into analysis.

Therapist: Let's focus on the dull ache. Notice how it feels to breathe into it, without trying to push it away or make sense of it. What happens to the dullness when you allow yourself to just be with it, without judgment?

Patient: When I breathe into it the dullness softens — it spreads outward into a blunt, warm pressure instead of a sharp point, and there's a little more room for the inhale to move. The "I should've done better" sting still flickers through like a flare, and my reflex is to start explaining it away, which just drains whatever little relief there is. My energy feels thin and my words are getting ragged, so can we keep doing another breath or two together? I don't want to slip back into analysis yet.

Therapist: Let's stay with the warm pressure. Notice how it feels when you exhale, without trying to make sense of it. What happens to the space in your chest when you allow yourself to just breathe out, without pushing it away or trying to control it?

Patient: On the out‑breath the warm pressure kind of sighs downward — my chest loosens a notch, the space feels a hair bigger and my shoulders drop, so the inhale comes a bit fuller. Then a quick, hot sting of shame snaps it tighter and I catch myself already drafting an explanation to keep it at arm’s length. Can we do another exhale together? I need help staying with it instead of analyzing.
