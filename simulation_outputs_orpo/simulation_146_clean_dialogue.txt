Patient: Lately I've been stuck in these cycles of tearing myself down over every little perceived failure. I've always been independent, and asking for help feels awkward—especially after that health scare—so the anxiety just gets louder. I don't know, I guess I'm trying to figure out how to stop being so harsh on myself.

Therapist: Those cycles of self-criticism sound really draining. When you notice yourself tearing yourself down, what's the one thing you're trying to do or accomplish in that moment that matters to you (e.g., show up for work, spend time with loved ones)?

Patient: I guess in those moments I'm mostly trying to prove I can still handle things—keep up with school and not be a burden to anyone. I don't know, it feels like I need to show I'm okay even when I'm barely hanging on.

Therapist: That desire to show you're okay, even when you're not, is actually connected to the value of being a responsible person. What would it mean to you to take a tiny step towards being that person, even if it means not having all the answers right now?

Patient: I guess a tiny step would be admitting to someone—maybe a classmate or my sister—that I'm struggling instead of pretending everything's fine. I don't know, it feels exposing to ask for help, but maybe letting one small thing slide or asking for help once could count. I'm kind of uncomfortable saying this out loud, so I'm sorry if I sound like I'm trying to change the subject.

Therapist: That's a really brave thought to share with yourself – it's not about changing the subject, it's about exploring what might happen if you let one small thing slide (like admitting you're struggling) and see what shows up for you afterwards. Would you be willing to try just one tiny experiment with that vulnerability, like saying "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now" to a classmate, without expecting anything in return?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying that, but to a classmate feels way too exposed. Maybe I could text my sister first—just a short, "I'm feeling overwhelmed"—and see how that goes; I'm worried it'll make me look weak, though.

Therapist: That's a really small step you're considering – texting a sister – and it's understandable to worry about how it'll be received. But what if, instead of worrying about what your sister thinks, you simply focus on what you're feeling right now ("I'm feeling overwhelmed") without adding any judgment or self-criticism? Would that tiny experiment feel any less scary if you didn't tie it to how you think your sister will respond?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might help a bit if I didn't worry about her reaction, but it still feels really exposing. Maybe I could draft a short text like "I'm feeling overwhelmed" and wait awhile before sending—would that be okay?

Therapist: That's a great experiment – drafting the text and waiting before sending shows you're willing to take a small step towards sharing without fully committing to it. What would happen if, instead of waiting, you simply sent the text right now, without editing or worrying about how it'll be received?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I sent it right now I'd panic — my chest would tighten and I'd immediately worry I sound pathetic. Maybe it'd also be a tiny relief afterward, but I'm not ready to hit send yet. Can we just... try coming up with a really short version together? I'm kind of uncomfortable and it's making me clam up.

Therapist: Let's focus on the tiny act of writing a short phrase – just one sentence – that captures what you're feeling right now, without worrying about the outcome. What's one word or phrase that might describe what's happening in your chest right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess "tight" — like a knot in my chest, like pressure. It's hard to sit with it and say more.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your chest right now – the tightness feels like a knot, and the pressure is hard to sit with. What happens when you simply acknowledge that sensation, without trying to change it or label it further?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to just notice it, it kind of spikes — my thoughts start racing to everything I've messed up and I feel this rush of shame. Then I want to push it away or joke about it so we don't have to stay here. I guess if I stay with it for a moment it softens a tiny bit, but staying feels... really hard, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one breath – not to change the sensation, but simply to be with it as it is. When you take a deep breath in, notice the sensation in your chest again, without trying to push it away or label it. When you exhale, just let the breath be – no effort to change or control.

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I take a breath it loosens for a second, but then the tightness and shame rush back and my thoughts start racing. I want to make a joke or change the subject because staying with this feels too intense. Can we slow down — maybe just sit with one quiet minute together?

Therapist: Let's sit together in silence for just one minute – no talking, no thinking, no trying to change anything. I'll just be here, quietly, with you. When you're ready, we can slowly open our conversation again.

Patient: I don't know... I tried to sit with it and the tightness loosened for a second, but it came back and now I'm just kind of... exposed. I guess can we keep going slowly? Maybe help me make the text super short—like just "I'm overwhelmed"—so I don't have to think too much.

Therapist: Let's make that text even simpler – just "I'm overwhelmed" – no explanation, no justification, just the one word. We'll send it now, and then we'll pause together to notice what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I did it — I sent "I'm overwhelmed." My hands shook and my chest is racing, and now I keep thinking I sounded pathetic. I also kind of feel a tiny relief, but I'm really tense, so can we stay here and not rush?

Therapist: Notice what's different about this moment – you took a step towards sharing your truth, even when it felt scary. What's the tiny sensation in your chest right now, amidst the racing thoughts? Is it still tight, or has it shifted in any way?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's a little less like a knot and more like a dull pressure now, with this flutter under it. But my thoughts keep snapping to "you sounded pathetic" and I want to make a joke or change the subject. Can we keep going slowly? I'm feeling pretty exposed.

Therapist: That thought "you sounded pathetic" is showing up again – it's a story you're telling yourself. What would happen if you just accepted that thought, without judgment or trying to change it? Would your body relax even a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let the thought be my chest might ease a little, but then this surge of shame and frustration hits — like that old mistake — and I just want to shove it away. I don't really want to pull that up right now. Can we please slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one deep breath, and notice what's happening in your body right now – that dull pressure, the flutter, and the tension. When you exhale, what's the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I exhale it loosens a little — just a tiny bit of space — but then the tightness snaps back and my thoughts sprint to that shameful thing and I get really panicky. I'm kind of all over the place and can't focus on the breath; it feels like my chest is on repeat and I want to make a joke or change the subject so we don't dig in. Can we slow down more—maybe just a few grounded breaths together—or do something small and steady so I don't spiral?

Therapist: Let's do a tiny sensory step together – notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, without trying to think about anything. What does the floor feel like beneath you – is it soft, hard, warm, or cool? Just observe that sensation, and let's stay there for one more breath together.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my feet feel hard and cool on the floor — kind of steady, which is weird because my chest is still tight and my thoughts are already jumping to that thing I messed up. I want to make a joke or change the subject, but maybe one more slow breath together would help; can we do that?

Therapist: Let's take one more slow, deep breath together, and when you exhale, notice that tightness in your chest without trying to change it. Just notice it – is it tight, is it a knot, is it a feeling? Let's keep that breath for just one more moment, and then we'll slowly come back to talking.

Patient: I don't know... I tried the breath and it eased for a second, but then that flush of shame and the memory of messing up barreled back and now I'm jittery and all over the place. I guess my chest is still tight and it's really hard to focus — can we slow down more? Maybe a few more grounding breaths or something steady would help because I feel like I might spiral.

Therapist: Let's try a gentle physical anchor together – notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Is it soft, rough, warm, or cool? Just notice that sensation, and let's keep it there for one more breath. This small anchor can help calm your nervous system and give you space to come back to the present moment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my tongue feels cool and a little pressed up there, like a tiny steady point. It helps for a second but then shame and that old mistake just rush back and my chest tightens and I get jittery. Can we slow down—maybe do a few more grounding breaths or something steady? I feel like I might spiral.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and notice the shame story right now – what's the first thought that comes up when you think of that old mistake? Just notice it, without judgment – is it a story you're telling yourself, a feeling in your body, or a thought that's popping up? Let's keep that thought exactly as it is, without trying to change it, for just one more breath.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the first thought is "you blew it" — like "you're a failure" or "you shouldn't have done that." My chest tightens, my face heats, and my thoughts just sprint through everything I've messed up, so I want to joke or change the subject. Can we slow down and take one more slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's take one slow, deep breath in together, and when we exhale, notice the sensation of your chest tightening right now – is it a knot, a heaviness, or a feeling of pressure? Just observe that sensation, without trying to change it, for just one more moment. We'll hold that breath together before we talk again.

Patient: I don't know... I took the breath and it's like a heavy knot — a dull pressure pushing under my ribs. My thoughts keep shouting "you blew it" and my face heats up, so can we slow down a bit more? Maybe just one more slow breath together because I feel like I might spiral.

Therapist: Let's take one more slow, deep breath together, and when we exhale, notice the sensation of the knot in your chest right now – is it a physical sensation, a feeling, or a thought? Just observe it, without trying to change it, without judgment, and without trying to "fix" it. We'll hold that breath together, and when we're ready, we'll slowly come back to talking.

Patient: I don't know... I took the breath and it's still this heavy knot, like pressure under my ribs, and my mind keeps shouting "you blew it" so I get hot and panicky. I guess can we slow down—maybe a few more slow breaths or something steady? I feel like I might actually spiral if we rush.

Therapist: Let's try one final grounding exercise together – notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now. Is it warm, cool, rough, or soft? Just notice that sensation, without trying to think about anything else, and hold it for just one more breath. When we're ready, we'll come back to talking slowly and gently.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my feet feel cool and steady on the floor — like the only steady thing — but my chest is still this heavy knot and suddenly shame just rushes in and I get really jittery. Can we do a few more slow breaths together? I feel like I might spiral if we rush.

Therapist: Let's take one slow, deep breath in together, and when we exhale, notice the sensation of the knot in your chest – is it still there, or has it shifted at all? Just observe it, without trying to change it, without judgment, and without trying to "fix" it. We'll hold that breath together, and when we're ready, we'll slowly start talking again.

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's still there — maybe a tiny bit softer but mostly the same heavy knot. My thoughts keep yelling "you blew it" and my chest tightens; I'm jittery and having trouble focusing. Can we slow down more? Maybe a few more grounding breaths or keep focusing on my feet — I'm really worried I'll spiral.

Therapist: Let's pause for just one tiny moment – take the weight of your breath, and let it be exactly as it is. Don't try to focus on anything else, just notice the sensation of your breath, and the knot in your chest. We're not moving an inch, we're just being present. When you're ready, we'll slowly come back to talking, and take it one tiny step at a time.

Patient: I don't know... I tried to follow the breath and it eased for a second, but the heavy knot's still there and my mind keeps yelling "you blew it," so I'm jittery and can't really focus. I guess I don't want to pull more of that shame up right now — can we slow down with a few more grounding breaths or maybe a simple steady rhythm (like counting) together? I'm kind of embarrassed I'm stuck like this, but I don't want to stop.

Therapist: Let's try a simple, steady rhythm together – I'll count slowly with you: "One, two, three, four..." Just focus on the sound of my voice, and the rhythm of the numbers. Don't try to think about anything else, just be with the sound. We'll keep counting together until you feel more calm, and then we'll slowly move back to talking.

Patient: Okay... one... two... I don't know... three... four. I guess that helped a little, but my chest is still tight and that "you blew it" thought keeps looping and making me hot and shaky. Can we keep going slower — maybe longer pauses between numbers — because I'm really worried if we rush I'll spiral.

Therapist: Let's slow down even more – I'll count one number per second: "One... pause... two... pause... three... pause... four... pause..." Just focus on the pause between each number, and the sound of my voice. We'll keep going at this slow pace until you feel more calm, and then we'll move back to talking.

Patient: I don't know... One... pause... two... pause... I guess that helps a tiny bit, but the shame keeps creeping back and my chest tightens. Can we keep going even slower—longer pauses between numbers? I'm worried if we rush I'll spiral.

Therapist: Let's go to the absolute slowest pace possible – I'll just say "one" and then wait a really long time before saying "pause" and then "two", and so on. We'll take our time, and I'll wait for you to feel calm before we move on. No pressure, no rush. Just be with the silence.

Patient: I don't know... okay—one... I'm trying to sit with the silence but my mind just darts to that "you blew it" thought and I get hot and shaky. Can we really wait longer between numbers? I guess I need this sloooower rhythm or to keep focusing on my feet because I'm afraid if we rush I'll spiral.
