--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck on this breakup — it tends to amplify my PTSD and I find myself erupting with anger and frustration in interactions in ways I can't predict or manage. My reflex is to intellectualize everything: model triggers, trace causal chains, and generate theories about why I react, which feels like avoidance more than insight. I'm sensitive and prone to self-doubt, so that mix leaves me oscillating between being defensive and feeling paralyzed.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The core emotion here is intense self-doubt. A key theme is the struggle between intellectualizing (avoidance) and wanting insight (workability). Goal: Explore the unworkability of intellectualizing in the context of emotional regulation to pivot toward a concrete behavioral step.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice yourself getting stuck in analyzing why you react, what happens right then—physically? (e.g., do your hands get tight, your breath quickens?)

Patient: Physically, it's pretty obvious: my hands clench, my jaw tightens, and my breathing gets shallow and fast — like a tight band across my chest. But instead of staying with that sensation, my mind immediately starts narrating and theorizing: cataloging triggers, running through causal models, which paradoxically amplifies the tension because I'm not actually naming or sitting with the feeling.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
That physical tension is the unworkability—it's a clear sign that intellectualizing is not helping. Goal: Use this moment to introduce a small, value-driven behavioral step that directly addresses the physical sensation, bypassing the need to analyze it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you pause for just one breath with that tightness in your chest, without trying to figure out what's causing it or what it means?

Patient: Okay—I'll try. I take a breath and there’s that banded tightness across my chest, my jaw loosens a hair, and my shoulders are up near my ears; my breath is shallow but a little longer on the out. Almost instantly my mind wants to label it and trace a causal chain—so staying with the raw sensation feels uncomfortable but slightly relieving for that beat before the narrative returns.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
That moment of staying with the sensation is a small victory—the tension is still there, but it's no longer fueling the narrative. Goal: Identify a tiny value-driven action that connects to that moment, making it worth keeping the discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
What's one tiny thing you value about being able to notice and pause with that tightness in your chest, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I guess I value that micro-agency — that brief pause that punctures the automatic loop and gives me a sliver of choice instead of just reacting. It also hands me a tiny, testable data point for my internal models, which feels safer than being swept away by the surge. Even if I immediately start analyzing, that initial pause usually lowers the intensity a notch.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a value in that small pause—microagency, testing internal models, and a slight intensity reduction. Goal: Connect this value to a concrete action step that builds on this tiny victory, making it a tangible, committed step toward workability.

Therapist Answer:
What would you commit to doing next time that tightness shows up, not to stop it, but to create space for that pause to happen again?

Patient: I'll commit to a tiny, testable ritual: when that banded tightness shows up I'll put a hand on my chest and do three deliberately long exhales, counting each out-breath to make the pause concrete. It's a prospective-memory cue that doesn't hand my brain another theory to chew on—if I feel the narration kicking in I'll say to myself "not now, breathe" to redirect. I know I'll probably slide back into analyzing and that annoys me, but this micro-agency feels doable and less terrifying than trying to solve it in the moment.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created a concrete, testable action step that connects to your value of microagency, making it a tangible commitment to workability. Goal: Validate this small victory, acknowledging that it's a crucial step toward building the skills needed to manage PTSD reactions.

Therapist Answer:
That's a really concrete step, and I appreciate how you've made it specific and manageable. By committing to this tiny ritual, you're taking ownership of creating space for that pause, even if it's just for a few seconds. Can you acknowledge how doing this feels, even if it's not perfect yet?

Patient: It feels oddly both relieving and uncomfortable — a tiny, almost embarrassingly small relief, like I’ve given myself permission to not immediately solve it. At the same time there's this inner critic that immediately starts grading the ritual as insufficient, which brings back a flicker of that tightness and annoyance. I'm trying to hold both: that small easing and the habitual self-critique, but it's messy and I get impatient with myself.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
That tension between relief and self-criticism is the messy reality of trying to build new skills. Goal: Identify the unworkability of holding both these opposing emotions, and pivot to a more manageable step that acknowledges this inner struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Notice when you're holding both that small easing and the criticism—what's the physical sensation in your body when you're trying to keep both?

Patient: It's like a somatic dissonance — my body's trying to register a tiny ease while the alert system spikes. Physically I get a hollow tightness at my sternum, breath shallow and high, jaw clenching, fingers curling a bit, and a queasy flutter low in my stomach with a faint tremor under the skin. Then my mind immediately layers a commentary — measuring and categorizing the feeling — which actually makes the tightness feel more split and jittery.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
This somatic dissonance is a clear sign that holding both relief and criticism is unworkable—it's creating more tension. Goal: Introduce a small behavioral step that acknowledges this physical discomfort without trying to solve it, by accepting the dissonance as it is.

Therapist Answer:
Can you pause for just a moment with that hollow tightness at your sternum, without trying to change it or push it away? Just notice it as it is, with your breath, noticing the physical sensations without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I pause and there’s that dull, banded pressure right at my sternum, my breath stays high and small, and there’s a faint tremor under my ribs and in my fingertips. I’m trying to hold it without narrating, but my mind immediately wants to map the sensation into triggers and timelines, which pulls me out even as I notice the feeling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
That pause shows you're aware of the physical sensations, but your mind is still trying to analyze them as triggers. Goal: Connect this struggle to the value you identified earlier (microagency) and pivot to a concrete action step that builds on noticing the sensation without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
Remember how you valued creating space for that pause earlier? Now, notice that your mind is trying to make sense of the sensation by mapping it into triggers. What if, instead of trying to "solve" it, you simply labeled it as "this tightness at my sternum"?

Patient: "This tightness at my sternum." Saying that actually takes some of the story-making power away — it feels calmer, like the sensation is a thing I can point to instead of an argument I have to win. I'm still fighting the impulse to catalog and analyze it, though, and that fight brings a flicker of irritation, so I'm trying to stay with the label longer even though I want to move on.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
That label gave you a small reprieve from trying to "solve" the sensation, but now the impulse to analyze is still present. Goal: Identify the unworkability of trying to hold onto the label and pivot to a new step that acknowledges the struggle, without giving in to the analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the tension in your body when you're trying to hold onto the label—what's the physical sensation right now, without judgment?

Patient: There's a constrictive band across my sternum, my breath is thin and a bit rapid, and my jaw and shoulders are locked up. My hands curl slightly, there's a low, queasy tremor in my gut, and a faint heat behind my eyes. Calling it "this tightness" dulls the storytelling impulse a bit, but leaves a restless, static agitation under the surface.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
That physical tension is still present, and holding onto the label isn't quite working as a solution. Goal: Connect this agitation to the value you've been trying to create space for (microagency) and pivot to a new step that acknowledges the struggle, without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the agitation feels in your body when you're trying to hold onto the label—the queasy tremor, the heat behind your eyes—it's not exactly comfortable. What if, instead of trying to make it go away, you simply acknowledged that it's there, like a tiny, unwelcome guest?

Patient: I can hold that image — treating the sensation as an awkward, unwelcome houseguest — and that labeling does blunt the story-making impulse a bit. Still, when I try to just acknowledge it, a hot shame and prickly frustration swells up, and my reflex is to either eject the guest or start constructing elaborate explanations to make it manageable. Admitting that I do that analysis to avoid the feeling makes me feel small and irritated with myself, which just layers more tension on top.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The labeling technique worked temporarily, but now the hot shame and frustration are surfacing, making it harder to stay with the acknowledgment. Goal: Identify the unworkability of trying to avoid the feeling by analyzing it, and pivot to a new step that acknowledges the self-criticism without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you tell yourself you're doing analysis to avoid the feeling—what's the physical sensation in your body right now?

Patient: My chest narrows and a hot wave rises into my throat; my jaw and hands clench, breath gets shallow, and there's this queasy, sinking knot low in my gut with a faint tremor under the skin. Naming the analysis-as-avoidance brings a sharp, prickly shame — my face feels hot, I feel small and exposed — and that shame flips into a brittle, irritated energy that wants to lash out or escape. Then, of course, my brain wants to explain why that shame's there, which just layers another flicker of tension on top.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The shame and self-criticism are intensifying, making it harder to stay with the physical sensations. Goal: Pivot to a new step that acknowledges the shame without trying to change it, by recognizing its function.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that the shame is what's trying to protect you from feeling the tightness at your sternum—the way it's trying to "save" you from the discomfort. What if, instead of fighting the shame, you simply acknowledged its role in trying to keep you safe?

Patient: That actually helps me reframe it — seeing the shame as a clumsy protective protocol makes it feel less like a personal defect and more like a dodgy safety system. Right now my face heats, my chest clamps, and there's this prickly, humiliating frustration that wants to shove the feeling away or rationalize it into something tolerable. I can try naming it — "protective shame" — and watch what it does instead of fighting, but honestly I'm already annoyed at myself for how reflexive and embarrassingly obvious it feels.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've reframed the shame as a "clumsy protective protocol," which is a huge step. Goal: Now, instead of getting caught up in the frustration, use this moment to connect the shame to the value you're trying to create space for (microagency).

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you name the protective shame as "protective" — does it change the way you feel about your face heating up or your chest clamping?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is labeling it "protective shame" supposed to change the physical stuff? When I try that reframe it does make the feeling seem less like a personal defect and more like a clunky safety protocol, but then a hot, embarrassing shame hits like I failed again and I get brittle and irritated at myself, which actually tightens my chest more. So it nudges the narrative a bit, but it doesn't stop the somatic surge — it mostly just layers another reaction on top.


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Labeling the shame as "protective" is a narrative shift, not a somatic change. Goal: Acknowledge that the physical tension persists despite the shift in narrative, and pivot to a new step that focuses on the physical sensations themselves.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you try to hold the protective shame label, without trying to change it—what's the physical sensation in your chest right now, without judgment?

Patient: When I hold the label, the band across my sternum actually seems to tighten—my breath shortens, my jaw clenches, and a hot flush climbs into my face. There's a queasy knot low in my gut and a faint tremor under the skin; naming it blunts the narrative but somehow sharpens the rawness, like it makes me feel exposed. I'm not sure I fully follow why that happens—maybe the act of naming leaves me feeling small and sparks that familiar, prickly shame and a brittle irritation that wants to shove it away.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical tension has intensified, despite the narrative shift. Goal: Explore the possibility that the act of naming the shame itself might be triggering the physical response, and pivot to a new step that acknowledges this dynamic.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you try to name the physical sensations right now—what's the exact moment when the sensations change, just before you feel that familiar prickly shame?

Patient: I'm not totally sure, but it seems the pivot happens when my attention makes an inferential leap—when noticing becomes interpreting and my brain frames the sensation as evidence of failure rather than just a sensation. Physically, right before the prickly shame arrives my breath clips, my jaw clenches, a hot flush rises to my face and a queasy knot drops in my gut; that micro-click of judgment is what flips the somatic state into shame and brittle irritation. Then I get mad at myself for getting mad, which immediately layers more tension on top.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the exact moment when the pivot happens—when interpreting becomes judgment, and the physical sensations shift to shame. Goal: Use this insight to create a new behavioral step that avoids this pivot, by focusing on the physical sensations before the judgment sets in.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your breath clipping, your jaw clenching, or the hot flush rising, what's the physical sensation right before that moment of judgment?

Patient: Right before the judgment there's a micro-hiccup — my inhale clips for a beat, a tight clamp in the diaphragm and sternum, a hot flush behind my eyes and a prickly pressure at the base of my throat. That tiny somatic glitch instantly flips my mind into an inferential mode and shame washes in, leaving me simultaneously embarrassed and irritated at myself for even having the reaction.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've pinpointed the exact moment when the judgment sets in—just before the shame. Goal: Now, instead of trying to change this moment, use it as a chance to practice defusion by acknowledging the physical sensation without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation in your diaphragm and sternum right now, without trying to change it or label it as "shame." Just notice the physical feeling, without judgment.

Patient: There's a tight clamp under my ribs — my diaphragm feels like it's being squeezed — and a dull, heavy pressure right at my sternum. My breath is thin, my face heats, and this sharp little churn of embarrassment and frustration rises that makes my jaw and hands clench; I feel small and defensive in that moment. I'm trying to sit with the raw sensation without naming it, but my mind keeps veering toward explanation and that just makes me more irritated.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're sitting with the raw sensation without naming it, which is a great step. Goal: Introduce a small defusion technique to gently break the connection between the physical sensation and the judgmental narrative that's driving the irritation.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the pressure under your ribs feels when you exhale—can you make a tiny, tiny space for that sensation to exist, without trying to push it away or change it, just by allowing the breath to be?

Patient: When I slow the exhale the clamp under my ribs loosens a hair and there's this very narrow hollow—air moving through a tight tunnel—and for a sliver it feels tolerable. Almost instantly my brain starts annotating it as a "data point" or "micro-agency" and a hot, shamey irritation climbs up my throat, which makes me want to explain it away. I can hold that tiny space for a second or two, but it's fragile and I get annoyed at myself for not holding it longer. Can we try another brief pause together? I'm feeling a bit flustered but willing to keep going.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created a tiny space for the sensation to exist, and it's fragile but present. Goal: Let's build on that space without adding any analysis or judgment, by introducing a new technique that focuses on the sensation itself.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the hollow feeling in your chest right now, when your breath is slow. What happens if you focus on the sensation of air moving through that hollow space, without trying to change it or explain it?

Patient: Okay — I try to narrow attention to the air moving through that hollow and it actually has a texture: cooler on the in-breath, a scraped, narrow tunnel on the out, and the band at my sternum loosens a fraction. My data-scientist brain immediately wants to label it as a "transient tension signature" and that impulse brings a hot spike of shame and irritation, like I'm failing at the simplest task, which pulls me right out of the moment. Holding the sensation even for a few slow breaths drops the intensity a notch, but I get impatient and start analyzing again — can we do another brief pause? I'm feeling a bit flustered and annoyed with myself.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the texture of the air moving through the hollow, and your analytical mind is trying to label it again. Goal: This time, let's introduce a pause that doesn't focus on the sensation or its meaning, but rather on the physical act of holding the space.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens to your body when you pause the analysis, right now. Are there any physical sensations that come up, like your chest feeling lighter or your jaw relaxing?

Patient: There's a real, if small, difference — the band at my sternum loosens a fraction, my exhales lengthen, and my jaw unclenches just a notch. But almost as fast my brain rebrands that as a temporary "downregulation" and a hot, ashamed irritation pops up, making me feel small and tightening the chest again. So the pause gives me a few seconds of relief, then my impatience and self-critique kick back in; I'm not sure how to sustain it. Can we try another very brief pause together?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the physical difference in your body when you pause the analysis, but your mind is still trying to label it. Goal: This time, let's introduce a pause that doesn't focus on the sensation or its meaning, but rather on the fact that you're pausing at all.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens to your attention right now when you pause—what's the smallest thing you're paying attention to, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: The tiniest thing I'm noticing is the cool pinprick of air at the tip of my nostrils on the in-breath—almost imperceptible, like a hairline signal. Even as I try to rest on that micro-sensation, my brain immediately re-categorizes it into a data point and that inferential leap ignites a hot, shamey irritation, so I'm simultaneously attending and embarrassed about attending. Can we do another brief pause? I'm flustered but I want to try holding it a bit longer.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the tiny sensation at the tip of your nostrils, and your mind is still trying to label it. Goal: Let's introduce a pause that doesn't focus on the sensation or its meaning, but rather on the act of noticing itself.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that you're trying to rest on the sensation of the air at your nostrils right now—what's the physical sensation of that effort, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: I'm not totally sure I follow—when I try to rest on that tiny air-sensation, the effort shows up as a thin tightness across my forehead and a slight widening of my eyes, like I'm straining to hear something faint. My throat catches, breath gets quieter and shallower, my hands curl a bit, and a hot, shamey prickling rises that makes me feel small and clumsy. It's awkward because my brain immediately starts annotating the sensation, which makes me frustrated and embarrassed, so holding it feels like balancing attention and self-critique—can we do another very brief pause?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensation of the effort to rest on the sensation, and your mind is still trying to label it. Goal: This time, let's pivot to a new step that acknowledges the struggle without trying to change it, by introducing a small act of kindness to your own attention.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation in your throat when you try to breathe quietly right now—what happens if you allow that sensation to be exactly as it is, without trying to change it or push it away, just for one tiny breath?

Patient: Okay—I'll try. My throat feels like a tight cord, a small lump that catches; when I let that be for one tiny breath the throat loosens a hair and the exhale comes a fraction longer, and the sternum-band eases for a moment. Almost immediately a hot flush of shame and irritation spikes—this prickly "I should be farther along" feeling—and my mind wants to explain why instead of staying with the loosened breath. Can we do another very brief pause? I'm flustered and annoyed with myself but I want to keep practicing.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've allowed the sensation to be exactly as it is for one tiny breath, and it's loosened a bit. Goal: Now, let's try to stay with that tiny moment of loosening without adding analysis or judgment, by introducing a small question that acknowledges the struggle without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
What happens if you simply ask yourself, "What's the smallest thing I can do to stay with this loosened breath?" without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: The smallest thing I can do is put a hand on my sternum and let one deliberate, slow exhale be my whole task—counting the out-breath as “one” and nothing else. Framing it as a micro-protocol (a prospective-memory cue) helps keep my analytical brain from immediately hijacking it, though that hot, mortifying spike of shame still flickers and wants to narrate. Can we try one together now? I'm a little embarrassed and impatient with myself, but I want to do it.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete action step that helps you stay with the loosened breath, and it's framed as a micro-protocol. Goal: Now, let's practice this tiny task together, and see if we can build a small moment of connection with the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it together: place your hand on your sternum, take a deep breath in, and when you exhale, count it out loud as "one". Let's start together:

Patient: Okay — hand on my sternum, breathing in now, and exhale: one. That eased the band a hair, but immediately a hot, mortifying shame spikes and I get annoyed at myself for not holding it longer. Can we do another one? I'm flustered but want to keep going.
