Patient: I've been using booze and weed to numb the grief since my loved one died, and my mind's turned into this fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. If I keep doing this, I'll definitely spiral into full-blown addiction, lose my commissions, push my friends away, and end up broke and alone — it's not a maybe, it's how it plays out. People say it could go differently, but that just sounds unrealistic to me.

Therapist: That "disaster" story sounds incredibly painful and crippling - it's like you're carrying around a weight that feels impossible to shake. What's one thing about your work or relationships that truly matters to you, no matter what happens?

Patient: My art is the one thing that actually keeps me anchored — making stuff still feels real when everything else feels hollow. But my brain instantly jumps to the worst: if I keep numbing, I'll miss deadlines, lose commissions, galleries will drop me, and that last lifeline will be gone — people say it could go differently, but that just feels unrealistic.

Therapist: When you say that making art feels real while everything else feels hollow, what would happen if you started showing up to your art practice even when your brain was racing with worst-case thoughts?

Patient: If I tried to show up, my head would immediately predict I'll freeze, screw up a piece, a client will notice and cancel a commission, then word spreads and galleries stop calling — and that loss would make me drink more to cope until I'm totally washed up. I can picture that whole chain so clearly I can't take the gamble; the idea that it could just be messy but okay feels naive and unrealistic to me.

Therapist: That chain of thoughts sounds like it's fueled by a deep sense of shame - the feeling that if you fail, you'll lose everything. What would happen if, instead of trying to avoid the whole thing, you just focused on making one tiny step towards creating something that felt "okay" right now, without worrying about the outcome?

Patient: I wish that would work, but the second I try I see the whole disaster: I freeze, mess up a piece, a client cancels, word spreads, galleries stop calling, I drink more to cope, and then I'm totally washed up — that's the only outcome my brain will let me see. I know people say "messy but okay" but that just feels naive and unrealistic, and honestly I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: That disaster scenario you see when you try to create feels incredibly certain - like a heavy weight on your shoulders. What if, just for a moment, you allowed yourself to wonder if that certainty might actually be a prediction, rather than a fact?

Patient: I can't just treat it like a maybe — when that image shows up it feels like a movie of my life that I'm watching happen, and every scene ends with me losing everything. Calling it a prediction doesn't help because it makes me act to avoid it — I end up drinking more and hiding from work like it's already true. I'm getting overwhelmed by how loud it is; can we slow down?

Therapist: When that movie-like feeling shows up, what's the first physical sensation you notice in your body - is it tightness, heaviness, or something else? Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or escape it?

Patient: It's a tight, sinking weight in my chest and this buzzy jitter in my stomach — my jaw clenches and my hands go a bit numb. I try to just notice it, but it instantly cues the whole disaster movie in my head and the urge to drink spikes, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Just for one breath, when that tightness in your chest and numbness in your hands shows up, can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body - without trying to change it or fight it?

Patient: I try — I take a breath and feel it move in and out, but within a second my head's back on that movie: freezing on a piece, clients cancelling, galleries dropping me, and me drinking more. The chest stays tight and the craving spikes, so I'm honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the movie shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what happens when you try to hold onto the breath - does it feel like you're fighting the thoughts, or does it actually feel like you're trying to force something that's not working?

Patient: It feels like I'm fighting the thoughts — like holding my breath is me trying to shove a freight train back on the tracks, and the harder I try the louder the disaster-movie gets. It ends up feeling like forcing something that won't work, and the craving spikes until I usually cave because it all feels inevitable. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the freight train shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what if you just allowed the thought to be there, without trying to push it away or hold onto the breath? What would happen if you simply allowed the disaster-movie to be present, without trying to change it?

Patient: I’ve tried “allowing” it, but it just feels like surrender — the movie gets louder, like I’m watching my life unravel in real time, and the craving spikes until I drink to shut it off. It makes me feel helpless and small, and I’m honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the movie shows up again, and you feel the chest tightness and craving spike, what's the one thing you're afraid will happen if you allow the thought to be present - is it that you'll lose your life, or something else? What's the underlying fear that's driving this desire to shut it off with the drink?

Patient: I'm terrified that if I allow the thought, it isn't just a thought — it becomes a script that plays out for real: I freeze on a piece, commissions vanish, friends drift, galleries cut ties, I drink more to cope, and I end up broke and alone. It's less about one mistake and more about being exposed as a failure and losing the thing—my art—that keeps me real. Drinking feels like the only way to mute that certainty. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you feel the certainty that the thought will become a script, what's the tiny piece of your life that you're already losing when you reach for the drink to "mute" it - is it a conversation with a friend, a connection to your art, or something else?

Patient: The tiny thing I lose first is those small, tethering moments — a morning in the studio, a quick text back to a friend, the little satisfaction of finishing a sketch. Once I drink, those small wins vanish, I stall on work, ghost people, and it feels like the first domino that proves my whole identity will crumble — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about the small moments you're losing when you drink, what's one tiny value or meaning that's already present in that moment - is it the sense of connection to your art, the joy of creating, or something else?

Patient: It's that little click — the tiny proof I'm still me when a sketch finally works, the quiet connection to my art that makes the day worth it. But the second I taste that, my brain plays the movie: I freeze, clients bail, galleries cut me, I drink more and lose even that spark — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: When your brain starts playing the movie, what's the first tiny part of the narrative that you can observe without judgment - is it the thought "I'm not good enough" or the feeling "I'm failing"?

Patient: It's the thought "I'm failing" — that little line kicks off the whole movie. Then I instantly see the freeze, the canceled commissions, the galleries cutting me off, and the drinking that follows, and I can't just watch it like it's a scene — it feels real. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you see the movie play out, what's one tiny thing that happens in your body or senses that doesn't belong to the narrative - is it the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: It's the cool pressure of my feet on the studio floor — that tiny groundedness that doesn't fit the movie. But even that gets swallowed when the scene starts (freeze, clients bail, galleries cut me, I drink), so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the movie starts playing again, and you feel your feet getting pulled into it, what would it take for you to just acknowledge that feeling without judgment - would it be a thought, a sensation, a physical action, or something else?

Patient: Maybe it'd take something stupidly simple — like saying out loud, "that's just the failing thought," or pressing my hand to the floor and actually feeling my feet, or even picking up a brush for one tiny, pointless stroke so there's a physical action to anchor me. I want that to help but my brain already says none of that will stop the movie — it'll just buy seconds before the freeze-and-spiral plays, so honestly it feels useless. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When your brain says that trying something simple won't work, what's one tiny question you could ask yourself about what would actually happen if you tried saying "that's just the failing thought" out loud - would it feel awkward, or would you actually hear something different in your voice?

Patient: Maybe I'd ask myself, "If I say 'that's just the failing thought' out loud right now, will my voice sound different — shaky and small, or like I'm actually stepping back from it?" I reckon it'd probably come out awkward and trembly, and my brain would use that as proof the movie's right — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: When you imagine your voice coming out shaky and small, what's one tiny detail you could notice that's different from what you expected - is it the sensation in your throat, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: I guess the tiny detail might be the breath — I'd actually hear the air moving, like a little steady hiss, and my throat might not be as raw as I expect. But even that feels like a flimsy thing my brain will turn into proof I sounded weak, and the movie will roar back in and the craving will spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you imagine your brain turning that tiny detail (the breath) into proof of weakness, what's one tiny question you could ask yourself about what would happen if you let go of that expectation - would your body actually relax, or would something else show up?

Patient: Maybe I'd ask, "If I stop expecting my breath to prove I'm weak, does that tightness in my chest ease even a little, or does something worse show up?" Honestly, I don't think it'd ease — my brain would just fill the quiet with a louder disaster and the craving would spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about what would happen if the tightness in your chest didn't ease, what's one tiny thing you could notice about the present moment, without trying to change it - is it the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or something else?

Patient: Maybe it's the sound of my breath — that little whoosh in and out that feels kind of steady and separate from the movie. But the second I focus on it my brain insists it's a trick and the disaster will return, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When your brain says the breath is a trick, what's one tiny word you could use to describe the story you're telling yourself - is it "thinking", "story", "narrative", or something else?

Patient: "Prediction" — like a doom-prediction, not just a thought or a story. It feels like something that's going to happen, and saying that out loud makes me kind of panicky, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about the word "prediction" making you panicky, what's one tiny question you could ask about the meaning of that word - is it "what does 'prediction' actually mean", or "what does it feel like when I say 'prediction' out loud"?

Patient: I think I'd ask, "What does it feel like when I say 'prediction' out loud?" — hearing that word makes it feel like fate, not a thought, and my chest tightens like the movie's starting. I kind of want to test it, but honestly I'm already getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about hearing the word "prediction" making your chest tighten, what's one tiny sensation you could notice in your body that's not the chest tightness - is it the sound of your breath, the feeling of your feet on the ground, or something else?

Patient: The cool pressure of my feet on the studio floor — like a steady anchor under my soles. But the second I notice it the movie's clawing back in and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about the cool pressure of your feet on the floor making you feel anxious, what's one tiny thing you could do with that sensation - is it take a deep breath, notice the sensation in your toes, or simply let it be without trying to change it?

Patient: Maybe I'd actually press my toes into the floor and map the sensations — toes, ball, arch, heel — like labeling each bit so there's something real to hold onto. I don't expect it to stop the movie, but it might anchor me for a few breaths before the disaster starts yelling again. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you imagine pressing your toes into the floor and mapping the sensations, what's one tiny promise you could make to yourself about showing up with this small step - is it "I'll try to focus on my toes for just one breath", or "I'll notice the sensation in my toes without judgment for 30 seconds"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try "I'll focus on my toes for just one breath." But even as I say it, my brain's already telling me that'll be useless — I'll feel it for a second, the movie will roar back louder, and I'll end up reaching for a drink. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about your brain saying that trying to focus on your toes will be useless, what's one tiny word you could use to describe the story you're telling yourself - is it "fear", "doubt", or "self-criticism"?

Patient: "Doubt" — like this rigid, running certainty that I'm already failing, with a side of harsh self-criticism, and it instantly spikes the craving. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about the word "doubt" making you feel overwhelmed, what's one tiny detail you could notice about the language itself - is it the tone, the pace, or the physical sensation of the words in your mouth?

Patient: The tone — flat and certain, like a metronome that keeps clicking "you're doomed"; when that voice runs I can feel my jaw clench and the craving spike. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?
