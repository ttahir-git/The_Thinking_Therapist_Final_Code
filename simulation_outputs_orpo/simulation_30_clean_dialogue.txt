Patient: Lately I've been really anxious in social situations and I've been avoiding gatherings with my few close friends. I just started a demanding new job and it's made everything feel more overwhelming, I guess. I'm kind of uncomfortable talking about it, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: That feeling of being stuck and avoiding social gatherings sounds really tough. When you say your new job is overwhelming, what's one specific thing about it that feels unbearable to talk about with friends – like, is it the workload, the expectations, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's the expectations. I feel like I have to prove myself and I'm terrified they'll see me as incompetent, and it's kind of embarrassing to say out loud so I just avoid bringing it up.

Therapist: It makes sense that the thought of being seen as incompetent feels like a huge risk – but what would happen if you allowed yourself to acknowledge that fear right now, without trying to prove anything to your friends? What's one tiny thing you value about these friendships that wouldn't change if you talked about your struggles with the job?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one tiny thing is that they actually care and would probably still check in on me even if I said something. But I'm scared they'd think I'm whining or not cut out for my job, so I just don't bring it up. I don't know, it just feels risky to make it real.

Therapist: That's a beautiful thing to hold onto – their friends care and would support you. Can you imagine taking just one tiny step this week to talk about your struggles with your friends, even if it feels a little scary? Maybe it's just saying, "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed with this new job and I'm not sure how to handle it," and seeing how they respond?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay in theory, but I'm already feeling nervous just thinking about saying it out loud. Maybe I could text one friend first — like, "I'm really overwhelmed with this new job and could use someone to vent to" — but I worry it'll come off as whining. I feel weird asking for help since I'm the one people come to at work; can you help me figure out how to say it without feeling weak?

Therapist: You're right, it's natural to feel like you're asking for help when you're the one others come to at work. But when you text your friend saying you're overwhelmed, what if you didn't say that you're asking for help? What if you just shared your struggle with work, and said something like, "I'm feeling really frustrated with this project and I'm not sure how to tackle it"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that does sound less exposing than directly asking for help. Even saying "frustrated" makes my stomach flip though — I'm afraid they'll think I'm whining. Maybe a short text would feel safer; can you help me come up with something that doesn't make me sound weak?

Therapist: Instead of focusing on not sounding weak, what if you framed the text as a normal part of your workday? You could say something like, "I'm working on a tough project and wanted to check in with you – I'm struggling to get it done on time" or "Just had a tough meeting, feeling a bit stuck – how's your week going?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess that framing does feel less exposing. Maybe something like, "Hey — tough week, had a rough meeting and I'm stuck on a project. Want to grab coffee?" or a shorter: "Rough day — could use a quick vent. You free?" But I'm still worried it sounds like whining — can we tweak it so it feels less needy?

Therapist: Your "coffee" or "quick vent" invite already feels friendly, but what if you removed the word "vent" and just said, "Hey, tough week – want to grab coffee and chat about it"? Or, instead of "Could use a quick vent", you could say "Free for a quick coffee break – help me unwind?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess I like "Hey — tough week, had a rough meeting and I'm stuck on a project. Want to grab coffee?" It feels honest but I'm still nervous it sounds needy or like I'm complaining. Can we tweak it so it sounds more casual and not like I'm asking for emotional labor?

Therapist: That text is already pretty casual, but what if you added a small non-emotional labor component? Instead of "stuck on a project", you could say "just trying to wrap up some work" or "getting close to finishing a big task"? This shifts the focus from "I'm struggling" to "I'm getting close" – it still sounds like you're checking in, but with less emotional labor.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds better. Maybe something super short like, "Hey — rough week, trying to wrap up a project. Want to grab coffee?" But I'm nervous it still sounds like I'm asking for emotional labor — can we make it even more casual?

Therapist: How about simply, "Hey, want to grab coffee"? This is a low-stakes invitation that doesn't imply you're asking for help or emotional labor. It's just a friendly offer to catch up.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess keeping it super casual feels like pretending nothing's wrong, and I'm worried I'll just freeze up or feel fake if I do that. Honestly, I'm kind of lost on what actually helps me not panic in the moment.

Therapist: It's normal to feel like you're pretending when you're trying something new, especially if you're used to being more serious or worried. The goal of this small step isn't to convince you that everything is fine when it's not, but to create a tiny gap between what's happening in your body and what you're actually saying. By acknowledging the anxiety, you're making room for the possibility that you might still feel it, but also that you can still choose to take that small step.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that makes sense, but my chest's tight and I'm kind of panicking and distracted right now. What do I actually do when I start to freeze—like in the moment? Can you give me a one-line text I can copy, or a short thing to say to myself? I'm nervous about role-playing but maybe we could try something super short.

Therapist: When your chest tightens, say to yourself: "Just breathe, 5 seconds".

Patient: I don't know... I tried saying "Just breathe, 5 seconds" in my head and my chest's still tight — the words almost don't land. Maybe something with numbers helps more, like "breathe in 4, out 6," but I'm not sure. Can we try a quick role-play where you respond like my friend to that coffee text? I'm nervous but maybe that would feel less weird.

Therapist: I'd be happy to respond to your text as a friend. Go ahead and send it, and I'll respond with something simple.

Patient: Okay — I'll send: "Hey — rough week, trying to wrap up a project. Want to grab coffee?" I don't know if I can press send, my chest's tight, so please reply like my friend would so I can practice.

Therapist: Hey, sounds like you're crushing that project – want to grab coffee and celebrate when you're done?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds nice. Maybe Saturday? I don't have much energy and my chest's still tight — can you help me phrase a short reply so it doesn't sound weird?

Therapist: How about: "Saturday sounds great, I'm looking forward to it"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay. I'll send it. My chest's still tight though — if I freeze, what's a super short backup text I can use? Like, "Sorry, something came up — can we do Saturday?" I don't know if that sounds stupid.

Therapist: "Sounds good, I'll hold you to it"

Patient: I don't know... I guess that works. I'll send "Sounds good — see you Saturday." My chest's still tight though—if I freeze, what's a one-line backup I can send? Maybe something like "Sorry, running late—Saturday still good?"

Therapist: "Saturday still works"

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can send that. My chest's still tight and I'm low on energy — if I freeze when I get there, what's a super short thing I can say or text that won't sound dramatic? Can we role-play the moment I arrive and start to panic so I can practice what to say?

Therapist: Let's role-play the moment you arrive. I'll respond as your friend, and you can practice saying "That's okay, I'm here" or just "Thanks".

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try: "Thanks." 

Um—also, "That's okay, I'm here."

Therapist: No need to say anything else, just smile and sit down.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to sit. My smile already feels fake and my chest is tight — I keep replaying something I screwed up and it's making me really embarrassed, so just sitting here feels heavy. I don't know what to do if I start shaking or freeze — can you give me one tiny thing to say or do in that moment?

Therapist: If you start shaking or freeze, take a slow breath in through your nose, and then whisper to yourself "I'm here".

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try whispering "I'm here," but it already feels hollow — that thing I messed up keeps popping up and makes me want to crawl into myself. If that doesn't land, what's one tiny physical thing I can do that won't look weird? Maybe a discreet grounding move like pressing my thumb and forefinger together — can we role-play that moment when I sit and start to freeze?

Therapist: Let's role-play the moment you sit and start to freeze. As you sit, take a small pinch between your thumb and index finger – just a tiny pressure, like you're pressing a small stone.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try it. I pressed my thumb and forefinger together — it's small and weird but it kind of takes the edge off for a second. My chest's still tight though and that thing I messed up keeps looping, so whispering "I'm here" felt flat. Can we try the friend noticing the freeze next, like what would they say so I don't have to be the one to explain?

Therapist: "Hey, you're zoning out – we've got all day, take a deep breath."

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. I'm taking a breath but my chest's still tight and that thing I messed up keeps looping — it's embarrassing and makes me want to disappear. If I start to zone, could you just say "breathe with me" or ask something simple so I don't have to explain?

Therapist: Just breathe with me – notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out.

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to breathe with you. My chest's still tight and that thing I messed up keeps pulling me away — can we slow down and count together, like inhale 4, exhale 6? I guess if you keep the instructions short I can follow, but I feel kind of shaky.

Therapist: Let's count slow together: inhale 1...

Patient: I don't know... okay. Inhale 2, 3, 4 — exhale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

My chest feels a little looser, but that thing I messed up keeps looping into my head. Can we do a few more rounds? I guess I need it.

Therapist: Let's do a few more rounds: inhale 1, exhale 2, 3, 4, 5...

Patient: I don't know... okay. Inhale 2, 3, 4 — exhale 2, 3, 4, 5. 

My chest's a bit looser but that thing I messed up keeps sneaking back in — can we do one more slow round? And can you give me one really short phrase to say if I start spiraling, like something I can whisper?

Therapist: One more round: inhale 1, exhale 2, 3, 4... when you start to feel stuck, whisper "not now".

Patient: I don't know... I guess whispering "not now" felt kind of weird, like I was trying to shove the feeling away. My chest's a bit looser after the breaths but that thing I messed up keeps looping and I feel shaky. Can we do one more slow round and maybe try a different short phrase—like "I'm here" or "one step"—because "not now" feels a bit dismissive to me?

Therapist: One more round: inhale 1, exhale 2, 3, 4... when you start to feel stuck, try "one step".

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try saying "one step" — I said it once and it felt a bit grounding, my chest loosened a little, but that memory's still looping and I'm shaky. Can we practice a super-short thing I can actually say when I get to a group so I don't have to explain, like "Give me a minute" or something less weird? I'm kind of overwhelmed right now, so can we slow down a bit while we try it?
