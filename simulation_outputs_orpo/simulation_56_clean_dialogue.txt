Patient: I've been spiraling lately — every little slip at work turns into this movie in my head where I get called out, lose my job, can't pay rent, and end up completely alone and ruined. I moved away from my family and friends, so there's nobody to talk me down and those worst-case stories just run unchecked and make me tear myself apart. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop seeing that chain of disasters as the only thing that's going to happen.

Therapist: When you imagine that chain of disasters playing out, what's the one thing that would make you feel truly safe, like you're not alone in that worst-case scenario?

Patient: Honestly, the one thing that would make me feel safe is knowing, for sure, that one person would be there no matter what — like my sister moving here or a friend promising they'd take me in and never blame me if I mess up. I know it sounds desperate and maybe unrealistic, but if I had that guarantee I wouldn't be stuck replaying the disaster movie in my head. Right now, without that, it just feels like it's only a matter of time before everything falls apart.

Therapist: That feeling of safety sounds like a fundamental need right now – being with someone who'll catch you when you fall. When you imagine your sister moving here or a friend promising to take you in, what's the tiny step you could take today to make space for that possibility, even if it feels small?

Patient: I guess I could text my sister and say I'm struggling and ask if she might come visit or at least talk more often — it's small and doesn't demand anything huge. But I can already hear the reply: she's too busy, I'll look like I'm whining, and that'll confirm I'm a burden and send me spiraling even worse. I want to try, but I'm frozen because making that ask feel like setting up the disaster I’m always predicting.

Therapist: When you imagine your sister's response, notice how the story you're telling yourself about what that response will be is already creating the disaster. Can you pause for a moment before sending that text and say to yourself, "Just this thought, right now, about what she'll say. That's all it is – a thought. Not a prediction of what will happen."

Patient: I tried saying that to myself, but it just doesn't stick — as soon as I whisper "just this thought," my brain yells that she'll be too busy, she'll think I'm whining, that'll prove I'm a burden, and then everything else in my life collapses after that. I get that you're trying to get me to step back, but imagining any other outcome feels fake and makes me more anxious, not less. Honestly, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: I understand it's hard to step back when the story feels so real. Instead of trying to change the thought, what if we just focus on what's already happening right now? What's one thing you're physically feeling in this moment, just as you're talking to me?

Patient: My chest feels tight, like there's pressure under my ribs, and my stomach's in knots. But the second I notice that, my brain's already shouting that this is the start of the disaster and I get more panicked — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tightness in your chest and the knot in your stomach – these sensations are actually here right now, in this moment. You're feeling them, and they're not the disaster you're predicting. Can you take a tiny breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "This tightness, right now, in my chest"?

Patient: I tried that breath and said it — "this tightness, right now, in my chest" — but as soon as I exhaled my head filled back up with the movie: she'll be too busy, I'll look pathetic, and everything falls apart. It calmed me for like two seconds but then the disaster story came rushing back and I feel myself getting more panicked. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with the feeling without the worst-case playing on loop.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to pause with the tightness in your chest. When the story came back, it felt like you were losing control again. That's okay – it's hard to stay with the feeling when the mind wants to push it away. Notice what's different about the tightness now – it's still there, but it's not the story anymore. Can you commit to just holding onto the physical sensation for another tiny breath, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. I take the breath and hold it: my chest is tight, my heartbeat is loud, and for that one inhale it feels a little less suffocating. But as soon as I exhale the movie's back — she'll be too busy, she'll think I'm pathetic, then my boss notices I'm off, they'll fire me, I won't pay rent, and I'll end up completely alone on the street — like that's the only possible chain of events. I get that you're asking me to stay with the feeling, but imagining any different outcome feels fake and makes me more panicked — can we slow down? What do I actually do when it rushes back like that?

Therapist: When the movie comes back, you're right that imagining a different outcome feels fake – that's because it's still the same story. Instead of trying to push it away, what if you were willing to just sit with that story, even if it's uncomfortable? Not to believe it, but to notice it as it is, without judgment. That's not about changing the thought, but about making space for it to be present, without getting caught up in the story.

Patient: I tried that, but the moment I let the story be, it just gets louder — my chest clamps down and I'm all the way back in the movie: she'll be too busy, I'll look pathetic, my boss will notice, I'll get fired, lose my apartment, and end up homeless. I want to notice it without believing it, but I can't figure out how to keep from spiraling when it rushes back. What do I actually do, step-by-step, when that happens? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's break it down: when the story rushes back, you notice the tightness in your chest, the loud heartbeat, and the mental chatter. Take a tiny breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "This thought is here, right now." Just that. Then, without changing the thought or pushing it away, notice where your body is holding tension – is it in your chest, shoulders, or jaw? Wherever it is, take a tiny bit of attention to that physical sensation, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling this in my [body part]." That's it. No judgment, no trying to change the thought – just noticing the physical sensation.

Patient: Okay — I did it: I took a tiny breath, said "this thought is here, right now," and noticed the tightness in my chest and jaw. It eased for a couple seconds, then the movie flooded back — she'll be too busy, I'll look pathetic, my boss notices, I'm fired, and I end up on the street. I can't seem to stay with just the sensations without the catastrophe tagging along — what do I actually do in that moment? Can we slow down?

Therapist: When the story comes back, you're trying to stay with the sensations, but it's still tied to the story. Now, instead of trying to push it away, notice what's happening when you think about that story. What's the first thing you notice? Is it the sound of your voice telling that story? The image that pops up in your mind? The emotions that show up? Just observe that, without judgment. Ask yourself, "What's happening when I think about this story?" This isn't about changing the story, but about getting curious about what's happening when you think about it.

Patient: The first thing I notice is this loud, accusing voice in my head that narrates the whole thing like it's already happened. Then a quick, vivid image pops up — my boss pointing, an eviction notice on the door, me with a bag on the street — and I just know that's the way it ends; any other outcome feels fake. I want to be curious about it, but I'm already hooked and getting panicky — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the voice – it's loud and accusing. When you notice it, ask yourself: "What would happen if you just paused with that voice, right now, without judgment?" Don't try to change it or push it away; just pause with it. Imagine taking a tiny step back from that voice, just enough to notice it's still speaking. Then, gently ask: "What's the body sensation when you pause with that voice?"

Patient: When I try to pause with the voice, I can do it for a second — then my chest clamps, my jaw locks, my hands tremble, and there's this cold knot in my stomach. That physical stuff makes the voice louder and more certain, and it immediately starts narrating the whole disaster again (boss notices, I'm fired, eviction) so I'm yanked right back into panicking. I'm really jittery and can't focus — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep the body from dragging me back into the movie.

Therapist: Notice that when your body tightens up (chest, jaw, hands, knot in stomach), it's not the body that's the problem – it's the story that's using the body to make you feel like you're already trapped. When the body reacts like that, it's like a warning sign saying, "Hey, we're getting stuck here again!" Ask yourself: "What's the story that's making my body react this way?" This isn't about changing the body; it's about noticing what's happening when the mind starts to get stuck.

Patient: It's this loud narrator in my head that says if I admit I'm struggling my sister will be too busy, my boss will notice I'm "off," they'll call me in and fire me, I won't pay rent, and I'll end up on the street — like that's how it has to go. Trying to look at the story just makes that voice scream louder; my hands are trembling and I can't focus on anything else. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the voice comes up, you're already on high alert. Instead of trying to fight it, notice one tiny thing: your breath. Just notice where you are with your breath – is it shallow, deep, or somewhere in between? Without changing your breath or trying to control it, just say to yourself, "I'm holding my breath right now."

Patient: "I'm holding my breath right now." It's shallow — just up in my chest, barely any air, and my hands are already trembling. The second I notice that, the narrator's back: my boss notices I'm "off," they call me in and fire me, I can't pay rent, and I'm on the street — I can't focus at all, I'm really jittery; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how shallow your breath feels – it's like there's a tiny gap in your chest. That's not the problem; the problem is the story that's using that gap to make you feel like you're already losing control. Instead of trying to fix the gap (by taking a deep breath), ask yourself: "What happens when I hold that gap for just one more second?"

Patient: If I try to hold the gap for another second, nothing changes — the narrator just screams louder, my chest clamps down harder, my hands tremble, and I'm immediately back in the movie where my boss notices and fires me. I can't keep my head on straight; it's all I can do not to spiral — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that the more you try to hold the gap, the louder the narrator gets – and the more you struggle, the more the chest clamps down. This isn't about changing the thought (because it's always going to come back); it's about noticing what's happening when you struggle. Ask yourself: "What's happening to me when I'm struggling to hold this gap?"

Patient: My chest and jaw clamp, my hands tremble, and that only makes the narrator scream louder — I get this vivid loop of my boss calling me in, getting fired, an eviction notice, me on the street, and I can't think past it. My words are getting thin and it's hard to stay with this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the feeling of your chest and jaw clamping down – it's like a physical tightness. When you notice that tightness, say to yourself: "I'm noticing this tightness in my chest right now." Don't try to change it; just notice it.

Patient: I'm noticing the tightness in my chest right now — it softens for a beat, then the narrator's back: my boss sees I'm "off," they fire me, I lose my apartment, I'm on the street — like that's the only outcome that makes sense. My hands are shaking and my head's all fuzzy; I can't hold it without spiraling — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the narrator comes back, notice that your hands are shaking and your head is fuzzy. That's not the story; that's your body reacting to the story. Ask yourself: "What's happening to my body when the narrator comes back?"

Patient: My hands start shaking, my head goes fuzzy like static, my chest clamps and my jaw locks so my breathing gets tiny — it's like adrenaline slamming the brakes and the narrator uses that to shout that I'm already doomed. I'm jittery and kind of spaced out and it's really hard to think straight — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the feeling of your hands shaking – it's like a physical tremor. When you feel that tremor, say to yourself: "This shaking is happening right now, in my hands." Don't try to stop it; just notice it.

Patient: "This shaking is happening right now, in my hands." Saying it made the tremor a hair softer for a second, then the narrator's back louder than ever — boss notices I'm "off," they call me in and fire me, I can't pay rent, eviction notice, me on the street — like that's the only possible ending and any other outcome feels fake. I'm getting worn out and jittery and can't keep this up — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how hard it is to keep going – your body feels worn out, and your mind is getting tired. It's okay to take a breath and say to yourself, "I'm exhausted right now. I need to take a break." Don't try to push through; just acknowledge your exhaustion.

Patient: "I’m exhausted right now. I need to take a break" — I can say that, but the second I do the narrator yells that taking a break proves I’m useless and my boss will notice and fire me. My hands are still shaking and my head’s fuzzy; can we actually slow down? I don’t know how to step out of this without feeling like I’m admitting failure.

Therapist: Notice that the shaking in your hands and the fuzziness in your head aren't about being useless – they're about being physically and mentally exhausted. Ask yourself: "What's happening to my body when I'm exhausted, like this?"

Patient: My body's like it's run on empty — everything feels heavy but my hands won't stop trembling and my head's all fuzzy and static. When that happens the narrator gets meaner and louder and I just know the chain will play out: my boss notices I'm "off," they'll fire me, I won't pay rent, and I'm out on the street. I'm barely holding it together and can't focus — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that your body feels "run on empty" – it's like there's a weight holding you down. When you feel that weight, say to yourself: "I'm feeling this heaviness in my body right now."

Patient: "I'm feeling this heaviness in my body right now." Saying it made it a little dull for a second, then the narrator's already back yelling that my boss will notice I'm useless, they'll fire me, I'll lose my place, and I'm out on the street — like that's the only possible ending. My words are getting thin and I can't keep up with this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that when you tried to say "I'm feeling this heaviness," the story came back – but it felt like you were pushing it away, like you were trying to fight it. Ask yourself: "What's happening to my body when I try to push that heaviness away?"

Patient: When I try to push the heaviness away my chest clamps even harder, my throat tightens so I can't take a real breath, my hands start shaking and my jaw locks, and then my head goes fuzzy and a sick knot sits in my stomach. Pushing just makes that narrator scream louder—as if the struggle proves the disaster is inevitable—so I get more panicked and convinced the chain will play out. I don't have much left in me right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that you're feeling like you're running out of breath – your chest is clamping, your throat is tightening, and your hands are shaking. It's like you're holding on by a thread. Say to yourself: "I need to take a break. I'm exhausted."

Patient: "I need to take a break. I'm exhausted." 

But even saying that makes the narrator shout that taking a break proves I'm useless — my boss will notice I'm slipping, they'll call me in, and the whole chain starts again. I’m fuzzy and my hands are still shaking; can we actually slow down?

Therapist: Notice that your hands are still shaking, even though you're saying you need to take a break. That's not because you're not capable – it's because you're physically and mentally exhausted. Ask yourself: "What would happen if I didn't try to push through this exhaustion? What would I need to do instead?"

Patient: If I don't push through, the narrator says that's the exact moment everything collapses — my boss notices I'm "off," they call me in, they fire me, I can't pay rent, and I'm on the street. I know on paper the alternative would be small things — take a sick day, tell my manager I'm struggling and ask for cover, text my sister or a friend to check in — but those outcomes feel fake to me; I can't stop seeing them as steps toward the disaster. I'm running out of energy even saying this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how hard it is to say those small things out loud – it feels like you're taking a tiny step toward the disaster, not away from it. Ask yourself: "What's the smallest thing you could do right now to take care of yourself, without feeling like it's a step toward the disaster?"

Patient: Maybe the smallest thing is to stand up and get a glass of water, or sit on the couch for five minutes and not look at my phone. But even that sparks the narrator — if I leave my desk my boss will notice, they'll think I'm slacking, and that’ll kick off the whole firing-eviction movie, so it doesn't feel safe. I'm shaky and fuzzy and I can't decide; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how your hands are shaking and your body feels fuzzy when you're trying to decide what to do. That's not because you're not capable of making a choice – it's because you're not sure what the outcome will be. Ask yourself: "What happens to my body when I don't know what's going to happen next?"

Patient: My body just flips into alarm — chest clamps, breath gets tiny, my hands start trembling and my head goes all fuzzy like static. That physical panic makes the narrator scream the disaster movie louder, like it's already happening, and I can't think straight. I'm running out of steam saying this — can we slow down?
