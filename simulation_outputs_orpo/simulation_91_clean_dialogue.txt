Patient: As an older student who's been burned out after a scary health event, I've been stuck obsessing over how angry and frustrated I get in conversations about it. My mind is like a fortune-telling machine — it instantly predicts the worst chain: they miss something, it gets worse, treatments fail, I flunk out and lose my independence. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't seem to accept any other outcome; other possibilities just feel unrealistic to me.

Therapist: That fortune-telling machine sounds like it's really working overtime for you right now. What's one specific part of that story that's most precious to you – the thing that makes it feel like you're losing control or independence when it happens?

Patient: It's when someone—usually a doctor or an admin—shrugs it off with "it's probably nothing" or "you're fine." My brain immediately goes: that's the first domino—missed diagnosis, things worsen, treatments fail, I can't live on my own anymore and I'll lose my classes and everything I worked for—so I get furious because it feels like they're stealing my future. People tell me to consider other outcomes, but those don't feel real; I can see the whole collapse as if it's already happening.

Therapist: That must feel incredibly suffocating when someone dismisses your concern with a shrug. What's one tiny thing you could say to that person, just for a moment, that would let them know you're willing to hold onto hope without letting their dismissal hijack your future?

Patient: I'd probably blurt out something like, "I hear you, but could we please run one more test or at least put a note in my chart? I can't afford to be wrong about this." But the moment I say it, my fortune-telling machine jumps to them just ticking a box, saying it's fine, and then everything spirals—treatment missed, I lose my independence, I flunk out—and I get furious because it feels like they're already stealing my future.

Therapist: That must feel like a huge betrayal when your request is dismissed and your worst-case scenario unfolds. What's one small thing about being able to afford to be wrong that matters deeply to you, and how might letting go of the fight against that "stealing" feel connected to preserving your independence?

Patient: One small thing that matters is not burning bridges—if I can allow myself to be wrong once, I might keep people willing to hear me later instead of writing me off. Letting go could save the energy I need to keep up with school and daily life, which would help me stay independent. But my mind flips it: if I don't push now, they'll tuck it away, miss the real problem later, and everything collapses—so trying to be calm feels like I'm handing them the key to my ruin, and I can't shake that fear.

Therapist: That's a powerful value to hold onto – not wanting to write people off when you're wrong. Can you just notice, without judgment, that the thought "they'll tuck it away" shows up right now, as you're trying to be calm? What would happen to the fight against that fear if you simply acknowledged it, without acting on it, just for one breath?

Patient: I can notice it—the "they'll tuck it away" thought is already loud even as I try to breathe. Taking one breath and naming it barely dents the machine; I still see the whole collapse playing out and I end up angrier, like I've let them off the hook for something that will definitely ruin me. I know that sounds stubborn, but those other outcomes just don't feel real to me.

Therapist: It sounds like the "they'll tuck it away" thought is a kind of anchor for the collapse story – when you name it, you feel like you're letting them off the hook. Can you imagine that thought, just for a moment, without trying to "fix" it or push it away? What if you simply acknowledged it as "that's what my mind is saying right now" – without judgment, without acting on it?

Patient: I can imagine saying "that's what my mind is saying"—I've tried that, but it feels hollow. The fortune-telling machine doesn't stop; it just keeps narrating the sequence—missed test, failed treatment, lose my home, flunk out—and I get angrier, like I'm letting them steal my life. Naming it for a breath barely calms me; instead I feel more furious and helpless. I don't know how to trust that noticing won't just let the collapse happen.

Therapist: That must feel incredibly suffocating – like your life is being hijacked. What's one tiny thing you're willing to hold onto, just for a moment, that would make you feel like you're not losing control?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing I can hold onto is keeping a copy of my records and explicitly asking for one documented step—like, "please add this note and order that test"—so there's something concrete I can point to. Even as I say that my fortune-telling machine screams they'll just tick a box and nothing changes and then everything I've worked for collapses. I'm trying to hold onto that without spiraling, but I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That sounds like a huge step forward – holding onto a concrete action. What happens in your body, just for a moment, when the fortune-telling machine starts screaming "they'll just tick a box" and everything falls apart?

Patient: My chest tightens and my jaw locks — I clench my hands into fists without meaning to. My heart races, my stomach drops, I get hot and shaky, and my vision tunnels so all I can see is the chain of collapse the machine is narrating. That surge flips into this sharp, reactive anger — I want to snap at whoever's shrugging, which then makes me feel guilty and even more furious because it feels like I'm already losing control. I'm getting overwhelmed saying this — can we slow down?

Therapist: That physical tension and anger is really familiar, isn't it? It sounds like it's been happening for a while – can you notice, without judgment, that these sensations are yours to own? They're not the machine's thoughts; they're your body's response to those thoughts.

Patient: I can feel the tightness and the jaw clench — they're definitely mine — but they immediately fuse with the machine's story so I can't separate them. The moment I try to "own" the sensations, the brain fills them with the collapse: missed diagnosis, failed treatments, losing my independence, and I get angrier like I'm defending what's left. Naming the body stuff barely helps; I'm getting more overwhelmed by it — can we please slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to push the thoughts away, but that's making the physical sensations worse. What if, instead of trying to control them, you just let them be there – without judgment, without trying to change them? What would happen if you simply allowed the tightness and the jaw clench to be there, without trying to push the collapse story away?

Patient: I try to let the tightness be, but it doesn't work — the fortune-telling machine just fills the quiet with the whole collapse: they tick a box, miss the real problem, treatments fail, I lose my independence and my classes. When I try that, my chest heats, my jaw locks harder, my hands ball into fists and the anger spikes like I'm being robbed. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: That struggle to let go feels like it's coming from a deep place. What would happen if you paused for just one breath, and instead of fighting the thoughts, you asked yourself: "What's really going on here? What's the one thing I'm really scared of, besides the thoughts?"

Patient: I'm really scared of losing my independence—of ending up unable to care for myself and losing my home and my classes because someone missed something. The fortune-telling machine doesn't let me see any other ending; I can already picture myself dependent and it's like a movie that makes my jaw clench and my anger flare. I'm getting overwhelmed saying this—can we slow down?

Therapist: That fear of losing independence is really strong. Can you imagine, for just one moment, that the fortune-telling machine's story doesn't have to be the only one playing out? What would happen if you let go of trying to control the outcome, and instead, just noticed the uncertainty – like a small, quiet space between the thoughts?

Patient: I try to imagine that quiet space, but the moment there's a pause the fortune-telling machine fills it with the collapse—it's not quiet, it's just a quieter version of "they missed it" and then everything falls apart. Letting go feels like pretending nothing's wrong, and that makes me angrier, like I'm being naive and everyone's about to steal my life. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That anger and frustration feel like they're protecting you from something – what if, instead of fighting the thoughts, you noticed what's really being protected? What would happen if you looked at the anger and frustration as a signal that something inside you is still holding onto control, rather than letting go?

Patient: Maybe the anger is exactly that—my last bit of control, like yelling "don't let them walk off with my life." But it also locks me into the disaster story so I can't think straight; if I let my guard down they'll just tick a box and then everything collapses—treatment fails, I lose my independence and my classes. I'm getting really overwhelmed saying this—can we slow down?

Therapist: Just for a tiny moment, let's do a tiny defusion act. When you feel the anger rising up, can you say to yourself: "Ah, my body is getting angry. That's my body's way of trying to protect me." No judgment, no trying to change it – just noticing that it's a physical sensation, a signal that your mind is still holding onto the disaster story.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it: "Ah, my body's getting angry. That's my body's way of trying to protect me." But the moment I name it, the fortune-telling machine screams they'll just tick a box, miss the real problem, treatments fail, I lose my independence and my classes, and the anger spikes even harder. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That prediction feels like it's coming from a deep place. What's the one thing you're really scared of losing – besides the thoughts? What's the value that's driving this fight?

Patient: I'm terrified of losing my independence—being able to live on my own, finish school, and keep some dignity and competence. That need to stay autonomous is what drives me to fight so hard; my machine immediately narrates that if I don't, treatments fail, I end up dependent, and everything I worked for is gone. Saying that out loud makes me panicky and angrier—can we slow down?

Therapist: That need for autonomy is really strong. Can you imagine, for just one moment, that you let go of trying to control the outcome? What would happen if you allowed yourself to be uncertain about your independence – just for a tiny moment? What would be the smallest, most tiny thing that you could do to take care of yourself, even if it meant not being in control of every outcome?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing I could do is one small, concrete step I control—keep my own copy of records, call to schedule one specific follow-up test, and insist they put a note in writing that I can point to. But my fortune-telling machine immediately says they'll just tick a box, the test will be mishandled or ignored, and then treatments fail and I lose my independence anyway. Trying to hold that tiny step and the uncertainty at the same time makes me furious and panicky—I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: That tiny step sounds like it's coming from a place of wanting to be in control – but your fortune-telling machine is saying it won't work because they'll just ignore it. What's the gap between what you're fighting for (being in control) and the tiny step you're trying to take (controlling records)? What's the one thing you value about autonomy that you're willing to give up just for one tiny moment, if it means you can take that tiny step?

Patient: The gap is that I'm fighting for absolute control over my life—guarantees that nothing will go wrong—while the tiny step is just a small, procedural thing that doesn't feel like enough to stop the collapse. I guess I could try to give up the need to be certain in this exact moment—let myself accept not-knowing long enough to make the record copy and schedule the test. But my fortune-telling machine already screams they'll tick a box, the test will be mishandled, and then everything falls apart, so even that tiny letting-go feels like handing them my future. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That tiny step sounds like it's coming from a place of wanting to be certain – but what if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you just focused on making the record copy and scheduling the test? What would happen if you let go of the need to control the "what" (ticking a box) and just focused on the "how" (making the record copy and scheduling the test)?

Patient: Maybe focusing on the how would help in theory—I could actually copy my records and book that follow-up, and that feels like something I can control. But the fortune-telling machine instantly screams they'll just tick a box, the test will be mishandled, treatments will fail, and I'll lose my independence and my classes, and that makes me furious like I'm handing them my life. Thinking about steps helps a bit, but I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That's a really tough spot – you're getting overwhelmed by the predictions, but you're also getting some traction with the idea of focusing on the how. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you just paused for one tiny moment between the thought "I'll make the record copy" and the thought "they'll just tick a box"? What would happen if you just sat with that pause, without trying to push away the predictions?

Patient: If I try to sit with that pause, the fortune-telling machine just fills the silence with the same collapse—them ticking a box, the test missed, treatment fails, me losing my independence. The quiet becomes a pressure cooker: my chest tightens, my jaw locks, my hands clench, and the anger spikes so hard I want to lash out. I can try to hold the pause, but I'm already getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That pause sounds like it's becoming a source of pressure – your chest is tightening, your jaw is locking, and your anger is spiking. Can you notice, without judgment, that those physical sensations are just your body's way of responding to the predicted outcome? What would happen if, instead of trying to push them away, you simply acknowledged them – with kindness, without judgment?

Patient: I can notice them—the tight chest, jaw clench, the shaking—and try to say something kind like, "okay, you're scared," but the fortune-telling machine just talks over the kindness: "they'll tick a box, treatment fails, you lose everything." Acknowledging it feels like it gives the machine more room to narrate the collapse, and my anger spikes even worse. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That kindness sounds like it's getting pushed away by the machine's predictions – but what if, instead of trying to control the thought, you just let go of the need to push it away? What would happen if you looked at the kindness, and the shaking, and the tight chest, and simply said "I'm feeling this" – without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I try to say "I'm feeling this," but the fortune-telling machine talks right over it — "they'll tick a box, treatment fails, you lose everything" — and my chest tightens, my jaw locks, and the anger spikes like I'm being robbed. Saying it feels almost naive, like I'm handing them the key to my ruin, and the more I try the louder the collapse gets. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That feeling of naivety sounds like it's coming from a place of "this is all or nothing" – but what if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts, you just stopped trying to control the outcome? What would happen if you looked at the tight chest, the jaw clench, and the anger, and simply said "this is what's happening right now"?

Patient: I try to say it — "this is what's happening right now" — but the moment I name it the fortune-telling machine just yells they'll tick a box, the test will be missed, treatments will fail and I'll end up dependent. My chest tightens, my jaw locks harder, and the anger spikes so high I want to snap; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That's a huge surge of anger – it sounds like you're feeling like you're running out of air. What if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts or judge them, you just created a tiny pause between the thought "they'll tick a box" and the thought "I'm going to lose everything"? What would happen if you just let the pause be, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I try to let the pause be, but the fortune-telling machine just jams it full of the collapse—“they’ll tick the box, miss the test, treatments fail”—and my chest tightens, jaw locks, hands ball into fists. It doesn’t feel like a pause, it feels like a pressure cooker that makes me furious and panicky, and I’m getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That pause sounds like it's becoming a pressure cooker – your chest is tightening, your jaw is locking, and your hands are clenching. Can you notice, without judgment, the physical sensations of that pause? What's happening in your body, just for a tiny moment, when you're trying to let go of the thoughts?

Patient: My chest tightens and my jaw locks; my hands ball into fists and my breathing gets shallow. My vision narrows, my face heats, and the fortune-telling machine fills the quiet with the collapse so my body braces like it's about to fight. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That physical tension sounds like it's becoming a physical barrier – your chest is tightening, your jaw is locked, and your hands are clenched. What if, instead of trying to fight it or change it, you simply released the physical tension right now? Just for a tiny moment, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I try to relax my shoulders for a beat, but the moment I unclench the machine screams they'll just tick a box and everything falls apart, so my hands ball up again. Even when I force a slow exhale my chest tightens like I'm bracing for the collapse—treatment missed, lose my independence—and I get angrier. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That chest tightening sounds like it's becoming a reflex – your body is bracing for the worst, even when you try to breathe slowly. What if, instead of trying to fight it or breathe through it, you simply noticed the physical sensation of the chest tightening right now? What would happen if you paused for just a tiny moment, without trying to do anything with it – not even breathing?

Patient: If I pause and do nothing, the fortune-telling machine just fills the gap with the collapse and my body braces harder: chest clamps, jaw locks, hands ball up, heart racing. The quiet becomes a vacuum that pulls the worst-case forward and I get furious and helpless, like I'm handing them the key to my ruin. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?
