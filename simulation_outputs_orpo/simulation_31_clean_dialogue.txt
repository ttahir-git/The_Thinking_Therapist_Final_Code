Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and a lack of motivation for a while now, and it's gotten worse since I started feeling so isolated. It's starting to affect my relationship — I'm more distant and I barely have the energy to connect. I guess I don't know how to change it and it's hard to even talk about.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. When you say you feel overwhelmed by sadness, what's one thing that's making it hard to move forward – like a specific situation, emotion, or even a thought – that keeps you stuck?

Patient: I guess one thing is this stupid voice in my head that I'm a burden — that if I try to reach out I'll just make things worse for my partner. I don't know, it drains me so much I don't even have the energy to try.

Therapist: That voice can be really painful. What would it mean to you if, just for a moment, you made space for that voice without judgment – not trying to silence it, but just noticing it as it shows up – while still reaching out to your partner?

Patient: I don't know... I guess making space for that voice might mean I could notice it without letting it run the show — like admitting I'm scared but still trying to reach out. But that feels risky, like admitting I'm weak or that I really would be a burden and end up pushing my partner away. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: What's one thing about connecting with your partner that feels truly important to you – not just what they need, but what matters to you about that connection?

Patient: I guess what matters is feeling seen — like I'm not invisible or just a problem to fix. I want to be able to be vulnerable without feeling like I'll push them away. I don't know, it's awkward to say out loud.

Therapist: That makes sense. When you imagine reaching out to your partner right now, what's one tiny thing you could say or do that feels small but still connected to wanting to be seen – like "I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I'm worried I'm a burden"?

Patient: I guess I could send a short text like, "I'm having a rough day—could we have ten minutes to sit together later? I don't need you to fix anything, just be with me." But I don't know, it still feels risky, like I'm exposing myself and that might push them away.

Therapist: That text feels honest and small. What would it be like for you if your partner actually responded with something like "I'm here for you" – not fixing the problem, but just being present?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it'd be a huge relief, like maybe I'm not invisible for once. But part of me would be suspicious — worrying they're just saying it to shut me up or that it'll disappear if I actually lean on them. I'm getting a little overwhelmed talking about this, can we slow down?

Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like talking about this is exhausting. What's one tiny thing you can commit to doing tomorrow that feels small – like just picking up your phone and sending that text?

Patient: I guess I can try to send that text tomorrow—maybe mid-morning when it's quieter. Something like, "I'm having a rough day—could we sit together for ten minutes tonight? I don't need you to fix anything." I'm nervous it'll make me feel exposed, but I can try.

Therapist: That's a great plan – sending the text tomorrow morning. What's one thing you hope might happen when you sit together tonight – not what you're trying to avoid, but what you're hoping to experience?

Patient: I guess I hope to feel seen — that he notices me and doesn't try to fix everything, just sits with me. Maybe to feel safe enough to say I'm struggling without being judged. I don't know, it's hard to say out loud and I'm getting a little nervous about this.

Therapist: That's a beautiful hope. Remember, it's not about fixing everything or being perfect – it's about taking a small step towards feeling seen. You're not saying you need to fix anything, just that you need space to breathe. Can you commit to showing up for that small step tomorrow, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I can try. I guess I’ll commit to sending the text tomorrow mid-morning, but I'm really nervous about feeling exposed if he replies. Can we slow down a bit? I don't know, it just feels like a lot to take in right now.

Therapist: That's totally normal. Vulnerability can feel scary, especially when we're used to protecting ourselves. It's okay to feel that way. Take a deep breath – you don't have to do anything more than send the text tomorrow. Just being willing to take that small step feels like progress.

Patient: Okay, I took a breath. I guess I can try to send the text tomorrow mid-morning — it feels small but my chest tightens just thinking about his reply. I keep worrying I’ll come off as needy or push him away, and when I try to say that out loud I... I don't know, I just freeze. Can we slow down? Maybe we could talk about what I might do if he doesn't respond the way I hope.

Therapist: That tension in your chest makes sense. When you imagine his reply, what's the worst-case scenario that feels most unbearable to you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the worst-case is he says I'm being needy or gets annoyed and pulls away, or worse, he just doesn't reply at all. That would feel like proof I'm a burden and I'd probably shut down completely. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed talking about this—can we slow down?

Therapist: That feels really tough. Can you take a moment to notice where you are right now – physically and emotionally – when you think about the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Physically my chest tightens and my stomach feels like a knot — I notice my shoulders hunch and I hold my breath without meaning to. Emotionally I feel panicky and ashamed, like I'm sinking and that talking will prove I'm a burden. I don't know, I want to look away and distract myself — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already responding to the fear. Take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground – just notice that you're sitting or standing there. No need to do anything else, just be with that sensation for a moment.

Patient: Okay — I took a breath. I guess my feet feel kind of heavy on the floor, like they're anchoring me a little. My chest is a bit looser but the knot in my stomach is still there and I'm... getting nervous, can we slow down?

Therapist: The heaviness of your feet is a great anchor. Notice how your nervousness is showing up in your body right now – it's like a gentle hum in the background. Don't try to change it, just observe it as it is.

Patient: I guess I can feel that hum — my stomach's still in a knot, my shoulders are tight, and my heart's a bit fast. My hands feel clammy and I keep wanting to look away. I'm getting overwhelmed right now, can we slow down? I don't know, it just feels like too much.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling completely swamped by all of those sensations right now. That's okay. Just acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed – no judgment. You don't have to do anything to stop the feeling, just notice that it's here.

Patient: I noticed it—my chest's still tight and I feel like I want to shrink away. I don't know, I guess noticing helps a tiny bit, but I'm still really scared he'll not reply or he'll get annoyed; can we talk about what I'd do if he doesn't respond? I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's talk about what you'd do if he doesn't respond, but first, let's make it clear that it's okay to not know what he'll do – that's not the goal. What if, instead of worrying about his response, you focused on what you could control right now – like sending the text tomorrow morning?

Patient: I guess focusing on sending the text tomorrow morning feels like something I can control, even though it scares me. I don't know what I'll do if he doesn't respond — maybe I could have a backup plan like calling a friend or going for a short walk, but I'm not sure. I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: That's a great start – having a backup plan shows you're thinking about how to take care of yourself. What matters most to you about having that backup plan? Is it feeling safe, or being able to move your body, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's mostly about feeling safe—like having something I can do that won't make things worse if he doesn't reply. Maybe it's also about not spiraling, so moving my body or calling someone feels like a reset. I don't know, I'm getting a bit anxious about all this planning—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about planning because it's making the uncertainty feel even bigger. Instead of planning, what if you just focused on the small step you're taking right now – sending the text tomorrow morning?

Patient: Yeah... I guess I'll just focus on that for now. I can try to send the text tomorrow mid-morning, though it feels like such an effort and my chest's still heavy. I don't know, can we slow down?

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the effort right now. Your chest is still heavy, and it's okay that it feels like an effort – that's what's required to take the first step.

Patient: Yeah... I guess that's all I can focus on for now—trying to send the text mid-morning. My chest still feels heavy and it's taking everything I have, and I don't know, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to take a pause right now. You're doing the best you can with everything you have, and that's enough. Take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently say to yourself: "I am enough."

Patient: Okay... I said it — "I am enough." I don't know if I really believe it, but it eased my chest a little. I guess I'll stick with trying to send the text mid-morning, though everything still feels heavy. Can we slow down a bit? I don't know what to say next.

Therapist: That's really small, and it's okay if you're not sure what to say next. What's one tiny thing you're curious about right now – like what you're going to say in the text, or what might happen when you send it?

Patient: I guess I'm mostly curious if saying "I don't need you to fix anything" will actually make him less defensive, or if it'll just come off as needy. I don't know — I keep picturing him getting annoyed or not replying, and that thought makes my chest tighten. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on how he might respond, you simply wondered what would happen if you said those words – without judgment or expectation? What would be the smallest, most gentle question you could ask yourself about that?

Patient: I guess the gentlest question would be, "Can I say this and still feel safe?" I don't know… even that feels big. My energy's low and I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: That's a tiny question, and it's okay if it feels big. What's one tiny thing you can anchor yourself in right now – like the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sound of your breath?

Patient: I guess my feet feel heavy on the floor, and my breath is kind of shallow but steady if I pay attention. I'll try to stay with that for a minute — it feels like it takes everything I have. I don't know, can we slow down?

Therapist: That's exactly what you need – to stay with that sensation without trying to change it. Your breath is steady, and your feet are heavy – that's all you need to hold onto right now. No need to do anything else, just be with that.

Patient: Okay... I'm sticking with my breath and my feet — they're heavy and it makes things a bit quieter. I guess it helps a little, but talking feels like a lot right now and I'm kind of drained. I don't know, can we slow down or just sit with this for a bit?

Therapist: You're exactly where you need to be – sitting with your breath and your feet, without trying to do anything else. That's a beautiful pause. Let's just sit with that for a moment, without moving or talking.

Patient: Okay... I'm sitting with my breath and my feet — it quiets things a little. Talking still feels like a lot, I don't know, can we go a bit slower? I don't want to stop, just... gentle.

Therapist: That's perfectly okay. You're already sitting with your breath and your feet – that's a gentle anchor. What would it mean to take one tiny step back from the need to talk, just for a moment? Would it be okay to simply notice the quietness of the space around you?

Patient: I guess it would mean giving myself permission to stop having to explain or perform for a bit — just existing without pressure. The quiet actually helps my shoulders loosen a little and my head feels a bit less noisy. I don't know, can we just stay with this for a while?
