Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of beating myself up over things I see as failures—mostly stuff from school that never really left me, even though my career eventually worked out. I lost my job recently and it's amplified that self-criticism; I keep replaying mistakes and telling myself I'm not good enough. I don't know, I guess I just keep staying busy to avoid feeling it, but it's getting exhausting.

Therapist: When you replay those "failures" from school, what's the thought that follows – the one that makes you say you're "not good enough"? What would happen if you allowed yourself to notice that thought without judgment, just for a moment, right now?

Patient: Usually it's something like "You're a fraud" or "You should've been better" — like I missed the basic thing everyone else got. That thought makes me feel ashamed and sort of panicked, so I scramble to prove myself or avoid situations that might expose me. I don't know, I guess if I just noticed it without judging it I'd feel a tightness and want to look away, but maybe I'd also realize it's just a thought and not the whole story.

Therapist: Those words might be trying to protect you from feeling ungood-enough, but what's the value that's truly important to you – something that would feel more valuable to you than being "good enough"?

Patient: I don't know, I guess what's more important to me is being useful—actually contributing something that helps people or the team. I care about integrity too, like owning my mistakes and staying curious so I keep learning. Talking about this stuff makes me uneasy, though, so I'm sort of skirting around it.

Therapist: When that thought "You're a fraud" shows up, what would it take for you to notice it in a small, safe way – just for a breath, while you're still sitting here – before you jump to trying to prove yourself or avoid it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess maybe if I actually named it out loud, like "there's the fraud thought," and took one slow, grounding breath while feeling my feet on the floor, I could hold it for a second. But that already feels weird and uncomfortable, and I'd probably try to laugh it off or steer us to something else because I don't like sitting in it.

Therapist: When you feel the urge to laugh it off or change the subject, what happens in your body – tension, tightness, or something else – that might be trying to protect you from that "fraud" thought?

Patient: I don't know, I guess my chest gets tight and my jaw clenches — my shoulders hunch up and my hands start fidgeting with whatever's nearby. My breathing gets shallow and my mind jumps to something to fix or do, so I crack a joke or try to steer us to work stuff to dodge it. Honestly, this already feels pretty uncomfortable — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny pause – just one breath – before we try to do anything with that tightness in your chest. Notice where you're holding your breath – in your chest, in your shoulders, or somewhere else – and what happens when you exhale into that space.

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's mostly in my chest and shoulders and my jaw tightens up too. When I exhale it loosens a bit — like a small space opens — but it still feels weird and my instinct is to move on or joke it away. I'm trying to stay with it, though; can we go slow?

Therapist: Let's take a one-second pause. As you exhale, notice the sensation in your chest and shoulders – exactly where it feels tight – without trying to change it or move on. Just notice it being there, in that one second.

Patient: I don't know — for that one second I felt a tight pressure just under my sternum and my shoulders dropped a fraction when I exhaled, like a tiny hollow opened. My jaw's still clenched and my brain immediately wanted to jump to something to fix — maybe make a joke or bring up work. I'm trying to stay with it, but it feels exposed and awkward.

Therapist: What would it take for you to notice the thought "I need to fix this" or "I need to make a joke" in just one second – before you jump to it? Is there a tiny part of you that's curious about what's happening when you feel that need to fix or joke away?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually named it out loud, like "there's the urge to fix," and breathed for a beat before moving, I might notice it. There is a tiny part that's curious, like it wants to see why I dodge, but most of me gets skittish and scrambles for a joke or something to do. I'm trying to hold that curiosity, but it's hard and I keep wanting to change the subject — can we go slower?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny pause – just a half-beat – after naming the thought "there's the urge to fix". Notice where your attention is pulling you to go (to the joke, to work, to avoid), and what's happening in your body as you hold that pause. Can you simply breathe, without moving or changing the subject, for just that half-beat?

Patient: I don't know — I tried it. My attention immediately skittered to a joke and a list of things to do at work, like my mind was already drafting the fix. My chest tightened and my shoulders hiked up, but when I breathed that half-beat out my shoulders dropped a notch and there was a tiny hollow, then the urge to move on hit fast. I'm trying to stick with it, but it's getting awkward — can we go slower?

Therapist: Let's take an even smaller pause – just one quarter of a breath – right after the urge to move on hits. When you feel that "I need to fix" thought, notice the tiny hollow in your chest and shoulders, without trying to change it or push against it. Can you simply acknowledge that hollow, without judgment, for just that quarter of a breath?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I tried that quarter-breath. There was a tiny hollow under my sternum, my shoulders eased a notch and my jaw stayed clenched, and then my brain immediately started drafting a joke or a fix. It feels exposed and awkward—can we slow down and keep doing smaller pieces like that?

Therapist: Let's focus on the pause, not the content. When you feel the "I need to fix" thought, notice the pause in your chest and shoulders. Instead of trying to do something with it, simply ask yourself: "Is this pause natural, or am I already moving towards something?" Just observe the pause, without judgment, for a moment.

Patient: I tried that—"Is this pause natural..." I don't know, I guess it doesn't feel natural; I can feel my attention already sliding toward a fix or a joke and my chest tightens into that same hollow while my jaw clenches. It feels awkward and exposed—can we slow down and keep sitting with just that tiny pause?

Therapist: Notice the tension in your chest and jaw – the feeling of your chest tightening and your jaw clenching. This is the sensation that's already happening when you feel the urge to fix or joke away. Let's anchor this sensation right here, without trying to change it. Can you simply notice this tension, without judgment, for just one breath?

Patient: I tried that one breath — my chest pinched under the sternum, my jaw held tight, and I felt kind of frozen. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing that actually helps — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess can we go slower?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of being frozen – the physical feeling of your body holding still. Ask yourself: What would it take for your body to relax just a tiny bit, if you didn't have to fix or joke away? Is it possible to imagine your body releasing just a tiny bit of tension, without trying to control it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess when I tried to imagine loosening a bit my shoulders dropped maybe half an inch and that hollow under my sternum softened for a second, but my jaw stayed clenched and it felt kind of forced. I'm not sure I follow how imagining that actually changes anything long-term — it just feels awkward and like I'm pretending. Can we keep going slower? I want to try, but I'm already skittish and want to make a joke to get away.

Therapist: Let's focus on the pause, not the outcome. When you imagined loosening your shoulders and chest, what was the sensation like just before you had to stop? Not the forced jaw, but the moment before you had to move away from it? Can you just notice that moment, without judgment, for just one breath?

Patient: I don't know, I tried to notice it — there was this tiny softening in the chest, like a brief hollow opening and a flicker of relief, then my jaw clenched and my mind immediately started drafting a joke to get away. I'm not sure I follow how just holding that breath actually helps long-term — how is that supposed to make a difference? I guess can we go slower? I'm already feeling skittish.

Therapist: Notice the relief in that brief hollow opening – what were you doing just before that moment? What were you trying to avoid when your jaw clenched? Can you connect that to what you truly value – not the joke, but the value of being able to breathe without getting stuck?

Patient: I don't know — right before that softening my head was already racing through a fix or a joke, trying to keep things moving. I was avoiding that shame, that whole "fraud" feeling from school and the worry of being exposed. I guess that tiny relief matters because I want to be useful and honest — to breathe without getting stuck so I can actually show up instead of panicking. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice that tiny relief again – what would it take for you to hold onto that feeling, just for one more breath, without trying to fix or joke away? Would it be taking a tiny step towards something – like writing that one sentence you've been putting off, or sharing a small truth with someone?

Patient: I don't know, I guess maybe if I named the relief out loud and then did one tiny, non-perfect thing—like write a single sentence about what I learned instead of polishing it—I could hang on to that breath. I can picture typing it and not editing, but it already feels exposed and my instinct is to crack a joke and move away. Can we slow down? I'm not sure I'm ready to actually do it yet, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny pause between naming the relief and writing the sentence. When you say "I learned...", take a deep breath in – just a tiny breath – and notice what happens to your body before you start typing. Can you stay with that feeling for just one more second, without judgment, before you write?

Patient: I don't know — I tried to say "I learned..." and took that tiny breath. My chest tightened, my jaw clenched, my heart sped up, and my mind immediately wanted to throw out a joke or a work task; I'm jittery and it's hard to focus. I can try to hold it for one more second, but can we really go slow and just stay with that beat?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor – how does that feel? Is it heavy, light, warm, cool? Just notice that sensation, without trying to do anything with it yet. Stay with that feeling, and notice how it contrasts with the tension in your chest and jaw. Can you hold onto that sensation, just for one more beat?

Patient: I don't know — my feet felt kind of heavy and cool, like they were rooting me for a second, and that actually made the tightness in my chest seem a little less loud. My jaw's still clenched and my heart's racing and my head is already drafting a joke and a to-do list to get away. I'm jittery and kind of worn out, but I can try to hold that beat if we keep it really slow — can we stay with just that for a moment?

Therapist: Notice the heaviness in your feet again – what's it like to feel that weight supporting you? As you breathe in, imagine that weight spreading down through your legs, into the ground, and into the chair. Now, gently bring your attention to the thought that's coming up in your head – the joke or to-do list – without judgment. Just notice it as a thought, without trying to push it away or change it. Can you hold onto that thought for just one more beat?

Patient: I don't know — my feet did feel heavy and a bit grounding for a split second, but the joke/to‑do list is already shouting in my head: "fix this, handle that, make it funny." My chest tightened and my heart sped up, and I could hold the thought for a beat but then my mind wanted to bolt. I can try one more beat if we keep it really slow.

Therapist: Notice the thought saying "fix this" – what's the sensation of that word in your head? As you breathe in, imagine that sensation of the word "fix" becoming heavier, like it's sinking into the ground. Now, pause just for one second – don't try to change the thought, just notice the feeling of the word sinking in. Can you stay with that feeling, just for one more beat, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the word "fix" lands like a heavy pebble behind my forehead — my chest tenses, jaw locks, and everything else starts yelling a to‑do list. I can hold that sinking feeling for a beat, but my mind's already drafting fixes and jokes to get away. Can we really slow it down and just sit with that one beat?

Therapist: Notice the sinking feeling behind your forehead again – what's the sensation of it? As you breathe in, imagine that sensation sinking deeper, but this time, instead of trying to push it away or fix it, notice what it feels like to simply acknowledge it – like you're saying to yourself, "I notice this feeling." Can you stay with that simple acknowledgment, without judgment, for just one more beat?

Patient: I don't know — I said "I notice this feeling" and for a tiny blink it eased, like the pebble shifted, but my jaw stayed clenched and my heart picked up and my head immediately started drafting a joke and a to‑do list. I'm jittery and sort of distracted, but I can try to hold one more beat if we really go slow. Can we just keep it small?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – just the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. As you breathe out, imagine that sensation of the breath spreading through your chest, just for one second, and notice if it changes anything. Can you stay with that sensation of the breath for just one more heartbeat?

Patient: I don't know — when I tried to feel the breath it was shallow, a tiny softening in my chest but my jaw stayed locked and my heart sped up, and my head's already drafting a joke and a to‑do list to get away. I can try to stay for one more heartbeat, but it feels tight and awkward — can we keep it really tiny and slow?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your heart beating just one beat. Just one beat. Without thinking about it, without trying to change it, just notice the sensation of that one beat. Can you stay with that for just one tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: I don't know — I tried to catch that one beat and it was this soft thud in my chest, then my jaw clenched and my head started racing with a joke and a to‑do list. It felt almost good for a split second but then everything wanted to bolt. I can try one more tiny beat, but can we go even slower?

Therapist: Notice your breath moving in and out of your body... just the sensation of the breath. Not thinking about it, not trying to catch it, just noticing it. As you inhale, imagine that sensation of the breath spreading through your chest... and then as you exhale, imagine that sensation of the breath leaving your body... just a tiny, tiny pause.

Patient: I don't know — I tried that tiny inhale and exhale, felt a faint movement in my chest for a split second and it almost quieted things, then my jaw clenched and my head immediately started drafting a joke and a to‑do list. I'm kind of jittery and it's hard to hold, so can we make it even smaller and slower?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body... just the sensation of the breath. Not thinking about it, not trying to catch it, just noticing it. As you inhale... (pause for just one tiny fraction of a second)...and then exhale... (pause for just one tiny fraction of a second).

Patient: I don't know — I tried that tiny inhale and exhale and there was a faint lift in my chest, like a blink of quiet, but my jaw locked and my head was already throwing up a joke and a list of things to fix. It felt almost useful for a split second, then everything got jittery again. Can we keep it even smaller and slower? I want to try to stay with it but I'm skittish.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body... just the sensation of the breath. Not thinking about it, not trying to catch it, just noticing it. As you inhale... (pause for just one tiny, almost-not-there breath)...and then exhale... (pause for just one tiny, almost-not-there breath).

Patient: I don't know — I did that almost-not-there breath and there was a tiny lift for a blink, then my jaw locked and my head immediately started pitching fixes and jokes. I can try to hold it a bit longer, but I'm pretty worn out and my attention keeps hopping away. Can we keep this really, really slow?
