--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an artist in my late twenties who just started a really demanding program, and I've been leaning on reassurance from friends and coworkers to numb the panic of social situations — asking if I sounded weird or if I messed up, over and over. It's definitely getting in the way of my work and my headspace, but I'm honestly skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything? I don't know, I'm just tired of feeling like I need other people's okay to feel okay.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're stuck in a cycle of seeking external validation to manage social anxiety. Core emotion: exhaustion. Goal: Explore how your need for reassurance is connected to your values (work and creative expression).

Therapist Answer:
When you ask for feedback, it's like you're trying to fill a hole with other people's validation. What's the value of doing art for you, not just what others might think?

Patient: I make art because it’s the one thing that actually feels like mine—when I’m making stuff it’s quieter in my head and I can be honest without performing. But the second someone’s around or I post something I start panicking and need everyone to tell me it’s okay, and that cancels the whole point. How is talking about my values supposed to help when I’m spiraling in the moment?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the tension between creating art as a personal space and needing validation to share it publicly. Core emotion: panic. Goal: Connect the struggle with a specific value (honesty, self-expression) to create a pivot for action.

Therapist Answer:
That honesty you mentioned when making art feels like a lifeline – what would it mean to hold onto that feeling even when sharing your work, instead of letting the need for others' approval take over?

Patient: I guess it would mean trusting my own taste and staying connected to that quiet, honest part of making instead of shrinking into performance when others are around. But when I'm actually posting or talking about my work my chest tightens and I start pinging people for reassurance like it's a reflex — I don't see how "remember your values" stops that. So yeah, how is that supposed to help when the panic's already in full swing?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your reflexive need for reassurance is rooted in the panic, making it hard to connect with values when the storm is raging. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible act of defusion to calm the storm while exploring values.

Therapist Answer:
When that tightening starts, take one tiny breath and notice the sensation in your chest. What's the first thing you'd do if you weren't waiting for someone else's approval – what's the smallest step you could take to connect with that quiet, honest part of making?

Patient: Okay — I take one tiny breath and notice the tightness, and the smallest thing I can actually imagine doing is saving the post/artwork as a draft or putting it in a “share later” folder instead of posting right away. Or before I ping anyone, I’d write one sentence about why I made it for myself and read that once. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when my panic's already spiking? Waiting feels impossible sometimes and I still want someone to tell me it's okay.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small defusion act that can help pause the panic. Core emotion: desperation. Goal: Connect the act of defusion with a value (immediacy, control) to create a pivot for action.

Therapist Answer:
When you put it in a "share later" folder or save as a draft, you're taking control of the timing – that tiny act of defusion gives you a small win, and what's the value of holding onto that sense of control, even when it feels impossible to wait?

Patient: I guess holding onto that control would mean I’m not handing my emotional state over to other people — I get to decide when and why my work goes out, and that could make the panic less powerful because it stops the immediate payoff. It sounds useful — fewer moments of shame, less post-posting regret — but how is that supposed to help when in the moment I still feel like I need someone to tell me it’s okay? I want to try it, but I'm worried it’ll just delay the panic and I’ll still end up fishing for reassurance later; I don't know if those tiny wins actually add up.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've linked defusion to control and delayed gratification – now explore how that small act affects the underlying value of seeking others' validation. Goal: Challenge the assumption that reassurance is necessary for validation.

Therapist Answer:
What if holding onto control by delaying the post wasn't about avoiding shame or regret, but about being true to your own values – what if saying "this is for me" as you save the post was actually a way of honoring your own need for self-expression, rather than seeking external validation?

Patient: That makes sense in theory — saying "this is for me" could kind of anchor me to why I make stuff instead of to other people's reactions. But when the panic hits, a sentence can feel like a scrap of paper in a storm; I'm skeptical it'll actually stop me from reaching out. I'm willing to try writing that one-line reminder when I save a draft, but can we also talk about what to do when the urge to ping someone comes back after I've delayed it?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential pivot: using the sentence to anchor yourself in your values, but now face the challenge of what to do when the urge to seek reassurance returns. Core emotion: frustration. Goal: Introduce a "what's the workability" question to pivot from avoidance to action.

Therapist Answer:
When you reach for the phone to ping someone, what's one tiny step you could take to work with that urge instead of fighting it – could it be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, noticing the physical sensation of your fingers on the phone, or doing something else small that keeps your hands from reaching for it?

Patient: Okay — tiny step: when I reach for my phone I’ll lock it, open a notes app and type the message but don’t send it, then take five slow breaths and read the one-line reminder “this is for me.” But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the urge feels like a reflex? I’m worried it’ll just postpone the ping and I’ll cave — what happens if the timer/notes trick doesn’t stop me?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the challenge of turning a small act into a sustainable habit – now explore what's driving the urgency to send the message. Goal: Connect the urge to seek reassurance with the underlying value of avoiding discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
When that urge to ping someone hits, what's the physical sensation you notice in your body – is it a knot in your stomach, a flutter in your chest, or a tightness in your shoulders? What's the value of tolerating that physical discomfort, even if it means not sending the message right away?

Patient: It's a tight clamp in my chest, my breath gets shallow, my hands go buzzy like I need to do something, and my stomach knots up. I can see the value — tolerating it might prove it passes on its own and that I don't need other people's okay to survive — but honestly, how is sitting with that supposed to stop the reflex in the moment when it feels unbearable? If I try to sit with it and it doesn't work, what's a realistic backup that isn't just "tolerate more"?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations driving the urge to ping – now explore how they might be connected to a specific value or action. Goal: Introduce a "what's the alternative" question to pivot from avoidance to action.

Therapist Answer:
When that tightness in your chest feels unbearable, what's the alternative to reaching for your phone – what's one small, safe thing you could do with your hands that doesn't involve the phone, like picking up a pen or touching a nearby surface, that might help you pause the urge without resisting it?

Patient: I could pick up a pen and doodle, squeeze a stress ball, rub a patch of fabric or the seam of my jeans, trace the edge of a table, hold an ice cube for a minute, or take sips of cold water—anything that gives my hands something to do and shifts attention to a simple physical feeling. But how is that supposed to help when my chest is clamped and the urge feels like a reflex? Squeezing stuff sometimes blunts it a bit, but I've still pinged people—so if this doesn't work, can we come up with a realistic backup that isn't just "tolerate more"?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified some effective alternatives to resist the urge – now explore how they might be connected to a specific value or outcome. Goal: Introduce a "what's the purpose" question to pivot from avoidance to action.

Therapist Answer:
When you're able to shift your focus to one of those physical sensations – doodling, rubbing fabric, tracing the edge of a table – what's the purpose of doing so that it feels meaningful to you, rather than just trying to avoid the urge? Is it to create something, calm down, or remind yourself that you're capable of handling this moment?

Patient: Mostly it feels like doing something physical is a way to interrupt the reflex and bring me back to my body so the panic doesn't just steamroll into a ping. For me it’s meaningful because it can actually create something tiny (a doodle) that reconnects me to being an artist, and it’s proof I can sit with the feeling and not immediately hand my calm to someone else. But honestly — how is that supposed to stop me when the panic’s full-on? If I still end up pinging, what’s a realistic next step that doesn’t just tell me to “tolerate more”?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value of physical activity in interrupting the reflex – now explore how to build on that momentum. Goal: Introduce a "what's the next step" question to pivot from avoidance to action.

Therapist Answer:
When you're able to pause the urge to ping, what's the next small, concrete step you could take that aligns with your values – like posting the doodle on social media, saving it to a shared folder, or sending it to a friend who appreciates your art? This step is not about tolerating more, but about taking a tangible action that honors your values and moves you closer to your goal.

Patient: Okay — a concrete next step I can actually try is saving the doodle to a “share later” folder and either scheduling it for 24 hours or posting it to my private sketch account (less pressure, more for-me energy). That feels like it honors why I make things without handing the timing to other people. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I can still ping people later? So my realistic backup: if I still get the urge I’ll lock my phone/use Focus for 30 minutes, paste the unsent message into Notes, and promise to wait the 30 minutes before deciding — then I’ll write one line about how I felt before and after so I can actually see whether the ping changed anything.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete next step that aligns with your values and a realistic backup plan. Goal: Celebrate the progress made and acknowledge the value of self-experimentation.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great strategy – by saving the doodle to a "share later" folder, you're taking a tangible step towards honoring your values without handing over control to others. And by using Focus to pause the urge, you're taking a concrete action to test the hypothesis that the ping will pass once you wait. By tracking the one-line reminder, you'll be able to observe whether the experience changed after the wait – that's a powerful way to build evidence for your own effectiveness.

Patient: Okay, that actually sounds...reasonable, but I'm not sold — I'm willing to try the draft + Focus + one-line tracker thing, but I'm already worrying about edge cases. Like, what if someone replies to a previous message and that pulls me back in, or if the 30 minutes just gives my brain more time to ruminate and plan a better ping? Can we figure out a realistic script or set of steps for dealing with those interruptions so I don't just cave when someone else shows up?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're anticipating edge cases and wanting to solidify a plan. Goal: Identify a "what's the workability" question for each scenario.

Therapist Answer:
When someone replies to a previous message, what's one small step you could take to pause the urge to respond right away – could it be as simple as typing a single word, like "pause" or "wait"? When your brain starts to ruminate on a better ping, what's one physical sensation you could anchor yourself in, like the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sound of your breath? By identifying these small steps, you'll create a tangible buffer zone to separate your reaction from the initial urge.

Patient: Ugh — when someone replies I get this hot, sinking shame that makes me want to fix everything right away, and it feels stupid and relentless. Okay — practical stuff I can try: type one word like "pause" or "hold" into the reply so it’s drafted, mute that thread or mark it unread, then set Focus/Do Not Disturb for 30 minutes; anchor in my feet on the floor and take five slow breaths or do a quick 5-4-3-2-1 grounding; if a better ping pops into my head, paste it in Notes and wait the timer, then write one line about how I felt before/after. But honestly, how is typing “pause” not just another ritual to soothe the same shame? Can we actually make a short, realistic script I can use in the moment so I stop just making promises to myself and actually follow through?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with the shame response and wanting a concrete script. Goal: Create a simple, non-judgmental phrase to anchor the pause.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that hot sinking shame, what if you say to yourself just one simple phrase, like "I'm already doing the hard thing by waiting" or "This pause is just 30 minutes, I can do this"? No judgment, no analysis, just a factual statement that acknowledges the effort. By using this phrase, you're reframing the pause from a ritual to a tangible action that's already being done – no room for the shame to creep in.

Patient: Saying something like "I'm already doing the hard thing by waiting" sounds nice on paper, but when that hot, sinking shame lands it feels like a punch and the words go flat — it just feels like lying to myself. I've tried pep-talks and mantras before; they don't stick. Okay, I'm willing to try a super-short script I can actually do in the moment, but make it realistic: one sentence I can say in my head plus one tiny physical action — can we draft that now?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a short, action-oriented script that sticks. Goal: Create a simple, tangible phrase with a corresponding physical action.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the shame, say to yourself: "I'm here" (one sentence) while touching your feet on the ground (one tiny physical action). This phrase is short, non-judgmental, and focuses on the present moment – no room for the shame to spin. The physical action of touching your feet grounds you in your body, making the phrase more concrete and believable.

Patient: Ugh — when that hot sinking shame lands, “I’m here” just sounds flat and like lying to myself. How is that supposed to help when my chest clamps and my brain's already sprinting?

Okay — can we try a more concrete script: in my head say, “This will pass in 30 minutes,” while pressing my heels into the floor and taking three slow breathes. I’ll mute the thread and paste any reply into Notes. But be real with me — if I’m still shaking and about to ping, what’s the realistic next move that doesn’t sound like another pep talk?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a more concrete script that works in the moment. Goal: Identify a realistic next step that builds on the pause.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the shame and your chest clamps, instead of trying to convince yourself the pause will pass, acknowledge the physical sensation: "My heart is racing" (acknowledge the physical feeling). Then, take the concrete next step you've identified: "I'll paste the reply in Notes" (tangible action). This focuses on the immediate task, rather than trying to fix the underlying emotion. By acknowledging the physical sensation and taking a specific action, you're creating a buffer zone to pause the urge to ping.

Patient: My heart is racing and my chest feels clamped. I'll paste the reply into Notes, mute the thread, press my heels into the floor, and take three slow breaths. 

But I'm already shaking and feeling ashamed — how is that actually going to stop me from sneaking back and sending it later? If this doesn't work, what's a realistic, concrete next move that isn't just another pep talk?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete next step that builds on the pause. Goal: Identify a small, action-oriented step that reduces the urge to ping.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the shame and your chest clamps, instead of trying to convince yourself the pause will work, take a small, tangible step: "I'll turn off my phone's notifications for the next 5 minutes" (concrete action). This action creates a temporary barrier between you and the phone, making it harder to sneak back to the thread. By focusing on the physical action of turning off notifications, you're shifting your attention away from the shame and onto a manageable, achievable step.

Patient: Okay — I’ll turn off notifications for 5 minutes, paste the reply into Notes, mute the thread, press my heels into the floor and take three slow breaths. I’m already shaking and feeling stupid about still needing tricks like this — it makes me mad at myself. But how is putting the phone away supposed to actually fix the urge when it’s coming from inside me? Realistic backup: if I’m still ready to ping after 5, I’ll put the phone in another room and enable a 30-minute Focus/Screen Time block (or airplane mode), and if I’m still panicked after that I’ll delete the draft and write the message on paper instead — no sending, just to get it out. Can we make that my step-by-step plan so I don’t just promise myself things I won’t follow?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete plan that actually works. Goal: Create a step-by-step plan that builds on the pause.

Therapist Answer:
Here's your step-by-step plan:

**Step 1: Pause**
When you feel the shame and your chest clamps, acknowledge the physical sensation: "My heart is racing" (acknowledge the physical feeling).

**Step 2: Take Action**
Paste the reply into Notes (concrete action).

**Step 3: Set a Barrier**
Turn off phone notifications for 5 minutes (concrete action).

**Step 4: Create Space**
Mute the thread (concrete action).

**Step 5: Ground Yourself**
Press your heels into the floor and take three slow breaths (physical action).

**Step 6: Test the Pause**
If you're still feeling the urge to ping, move to the next step:

**Step 7: Isolate the Phone**
Put the phone in another room (concrete action).

**Step 8: Lock Down Time**
Enable a 30-minute Focus/Screen Time block (or airplane mode) (concrete action).

**Step 9: Write It Out**
If you're still panicked after the 30 minutes, write the message on paper (concrete action) - no sending, just to get it out.

This plan creates a series of small, manageable steps that build on each other. By following this plan, you'll create space between you and the urge to ping, and give yourself concrete opportunities to test the pause.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try the plan, but I already feel dumb and ashamed even saying that — like admitting I need rules makes me look weak and I want to prove I'm not. I'm still worried the 5-minute mute won't stop me when a reply hits and that hot sinking shame kicks in; can we make one ultra-short script I can actually use in the moment (one sentence in my head + one tiny physical action)? And if I break the plan and ping anyway, what’s a realistic, non-shaming next move I can take so I don’t just spiral into more reassurance-seeking?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with shame and self-doubt, making it hard to use the plan. Goal: Create a super-short script that's just enough to pause the shame response.

Therapist Answer:
When the shame kicks in, say to yourself: "I've got 30 seconds" (one sentence). Then, do one tiny physical action: "Take one deep breath" (one action). This script acknowledges the shame without labeling it as "weak" or "dumb". The focus is on the concrete action of taking one deep breath, not on the underlying emotion. By using this script, you'll create a small buffer zone to pause the shame response, giving you time to choose the next step.

If you break the plan and ping anyway, here's a realistic next move: acknowledge the fact that you did send the message, but then immediately ask yourself: "What's the next step to make this conversation more meaningful?" This question helps shift your focus from the action to the impact, rather than getting caught in self-shame or reassurance-seeking. For example, you might say to yourself: "I sent the message, now what can I do to make this conversation about my values, not just my anxiety?"

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the “I’ve got 30 seconds” line and one deep breath, and press my heels into the floor when my chest clamps. I already feel stupid admitting I need that, and my hands are jittery just saying it, so I’m not convinced it’ll stick, but I’ll try.

If I break the plan and ping, can we make a super-concrete, non-shaming fallback I can actually use in the moment? Something like typing to myself or the thread: “I sent this because I was anxious. I’m stepping away for 30 minutes before replying.” That feels more doable than an abstract question — can we lock that in as the next-step script?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to move forward with a concrete script. Goal: Lock in the fallback script.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great script: "I sent this because I was anxious. I'm stepping away for 30 minutes before replying." This script acknowledges the fact that you sent the message (and didn't wait for 30 seconds), but frames it as a deliberate choice to step away and respond thoughtfully. By adding the phrase "I'm stepping away for 30 minutes," you're creating a clear boundary between the anxious moment and the pause.

This script is super-concrete because it:

* Acknowledges the fact that you sent the message
* Identifies the underlying reason (anxiety)
* Specifies the action (stepping away for 30 minutes)
* Creates a clear boundary between the anxious moment and the pause

This script is also non-shaming because it:

* Avoids self-blame or judgment ("I'm a failure")
* Focuses on the action (stepping away) rather than the emotion (anxiety)
* Creates a sense of control and agency ("I'm stepping away")

By locking in this script, you'll have a clear fallback to use when you break the plan and ping anyway. Remember, the goal is to create a new habit by using this script consistently, not to "fix" the fact that you broke the plan.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the script: “I sent this because I was anxious. I’m stepping away for 30 minutes before replying.” Saying that to myself already makes my face hot and I feel that same old failure-shame bubbling up, like I messed up before and I should fix it now. 

But I'm worried about real-life glitches: can we roleplay once so I can practice saying it? And can you give me 3 ultra-brief alternative scripts for different situations — one for work/colleagues, one for close friends, and one for group chats? Also, if they call instead of replying, what’s the realistic next move that doesn’t just make me panic more?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to apply the script in the moment. Goal: Roleplay and provide alternative scripts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's roleplay a scenario where you say the script to yourself. Imagine you're in a quiet space, and you're about to send a message. You take a deep breath, and say the script to yourself: "I sent this because I was anxious. I'm stepping away for 30 minutes before replying."

Now, let's practice three ultra-brief alternative scripts for different situations:

**Work/Colleagues:** "I hit send in the moment, now I need to take a break before responding thoughtfully."
**Close Friends:** "I was feeling overwhelmed, so I sent this now to get it out of my system – I'll talk to you soon when I'm calmer."
**Group Chats:** "Just sent this out – I need a minute to collect my thoughts before responding."

These scripts are designed to be concise and flexible, allowing you to adapt to different situations. Remember, the goal is to acknowledge the fact that you sent the message and take a pause, rather than trying to "fix" the situation.

If someone calls instead of replying, here's a realistic next move: You can say something like, "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?" This acknowledges their call, sets a boundary, and gives you time to compose yourself before responding.

Patient: Okay — let’s do the roleplay now. I’ll try the close-friend line out loud in my head: “I was feeling overwhelmed, so I sent this now to get it out of my system — I’ll talk to you soon when I’m calmer.” Saying that already makes my face hot and my chest clamp and I can feel the urge to explain more. Can you play the friend and push back once so I can practice using the phone-line: “I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?” Also give me one super-short work-version I can think under pressure — like two to three words — because right now I’m jittery and probably won’t remember anything long.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Let's do the roleplay. Goal: Practice using the phone-line and provide a super-short work-version.

Therapist Answer:
I'll play the friend who calls you back. Go ahead and say the script: "I was feeling overwhelmed, so I sent this now to get it out of my system — I'll talk to you soon when I'm calmer."

(Ringing sound)

Me: "Hey, what's up? I saw your message and just wanted to talk about it. You're not okay?"

Now it's your turn. Just respond with the phone-line: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

And remember, your super-short work-version is: "Just sending."

Patient: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?" — I said it and my voice shook, my face went hot, and I immediately wanted to explain more. 

The tiny work-version "Just sending" feels doable under pressure, but honestly I almost caved when they pushed—can we do another round where you keep pressing so I can practice holding the line?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're getting closer, but still struggling with the pushback. Goal: Practice holding the line.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another round. I'll keep pushing, and you try to hold the line.

(Ringing sound)

Me: "Hey, what's up? I saw your message and just wanted to talk about it. You're not okay? You're just going to send it and go? That doesn't feel like you."

Now it's your turn. Remember the phone-line: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

Can you hold the line and not explain?

Patient: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

I actually held it — my voice shook, my face went hot, and shame kept clawing at me like I’d already failed — but I didn't start explaining. Can we do another round where you push harder so I can practice staying with that line?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You held the line, but the shame and self-doubt are still there. Goal: Practice staying with the line despite the pushback.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another round. I'll push harder, and you try to stay with the line.

(Ringing sound)

Me: "Come on, what's going on? You're not just going to send it and disappear? You're my friend, and I care about what's going on with you. What's really wrong?"

Now it's your turn. Remember the phone-line: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

Can you stay with the line and not let the pushback turn into an explanation?

Patient: I held it — my voice shook, my face went hot, shame hit like a punch, but I didn't start explaining. It felt exhausting and like something old bubbled up that wants me to fix it right away. Can we do one more round with even harder push, and then make a two-word cue I can use when my throat tightens so I don't cave?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're getting stronger, but the pushback is still intense. Goal: Practice staying with the line despite the hardest push.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do one more round. I'll push really hard, and you try to stay with the line.

(Ringing sound)

Me: "Seriously, what's going on? You're my friend, and I'm worried about you. You're not just going to send it and pretend everything is fine? You're going to sit down, breathe, and tell me what's really going on? Because I care about you, and I want to help."

Now it's your turn. Remember the phone-line: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

As for the two-word cue, let's try "Stay calm". When your throat tightens, you can say "Stay calm" to yourself to remind you to pause and breathe before responding.

(Note: This is just one suggestion, and you can choose any two words that work for you. The goal is to find a simple phrase that helps you pause and breathe when you feel the urge to cave.)

Patient: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

I said it — my voice shook, my face went hot, my chest tightened, and I kept wanting to explain more. I tried the cue "Stay calm" in my head but it felt flimsy, like a bandaid. 

Can we try one more round where you keep pushing (even in-person push), and also give me one other two-word cue that doesn't sound like a pep talk? And be real with me — if they keep calling or show up, what’s the next realistic move that won't make me spiral?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still struggling with the pushback. Goal: Practice staying with the line despite the hardest push.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do one more round. I'll push really hard, and you try to stay with the line.

(Ringing sound)

Me: "Seriously, you're not going to tell me what's going on? You're just going to send that message and disappear? I care about you, and I want to help. You're not a burden, but you're not just a problem to be solved either. You're my friend, and I'm worried about you. What's really going on?"

Now it's your turn. Remember the phone-line: "I appreciate you calling, but I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can I call you back in 30 minutes?"

As for the second two-word cue, let's try "Hold space". This one doesn't sound like a pep talk, but rather a reminder to create a physical and emotional space for yourself to breathe and think.

Regarding the next move, if they keep calling or show up, here's what you can do:

* Take a deep breath and acknowledge their concern. You can say something like, "I appreciate your concern, but I really need some time to myself right now."
* If they're showing up in person, try to find a quiet space where you can talk without being interrupted. You can say something like, "Can we talk about this later when I'm feeling more centered?"
* If they continue to push or try to fix the situation, it's okay to say, "I appreciate your help, but I need to handle this on my own right now." This sets a clear boundary and prioritizes your own needs.

Remember, the goal is to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself, not to "fix" the situation or "please" others.

Patient: Okay — I'll try "Hold space." It feels less cheesy, but saying any of this still makes my face hot and I feel that same old failure-shame like I already messed up. Can we roleplay one where the friend actually shows up at my door and won't leave so I can practice a short in-person line (two sentences max) that sets a boundary without sounding cold? And be real with me — if they keep knocking or call repeatedly, what's the realistic next move that won't just make me spiral into explaining everything?
