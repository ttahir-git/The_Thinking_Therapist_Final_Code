--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been burying myself in schoolwork and extra shifts to avoid feeling anything about losing my partner, and it's been non-stop. The minute I think about slowing down, my brain tells me I'll fail everything, lose the job that pays the bills, push people away, and end up with nothing—like that's the only possible future and I can't convince myself otherwise. I know it's probably not rational, but I keep getting stuck on those worst-case stories.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a key pattern: when you think about slowing down, your brain immediately conjures up catastrophic worst-case scenarios that feel overwhelming. Core emotion is likely anxiety or fear of failure. Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance strategy ("why are you using schoolwork and extra shifts to avoid these thoughts?") to create space for a more workable alternative.

Therapist Answer:
Those worst-case thoughts are really gripping you, aren't they? When you're working hard to avoid feeling those thoughts, what's one thing you're actually trying to protect yourself from – like what would happen if you did take a break and then couldn't do everything?

Patient: I'm trying to protect myself from a total collapse—if I take a break and then can't keep up, I'll fail classes, lose the scholarship and the job, get kicked out of my place, and then nobody will want to help me and I'll be completely alone. My head keeps replaying that chain like it's inevitable, and I can't make myself believe anything other than that exact outcome. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop seeing it as the only thing that's going to happen.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're trying to protect yourself from a very specific outcome (total collapse), and that fear is driving a tight loop of catastrophic thinking. Core emotion is likely deep-seated fear of abandonment and loss of control. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle by connecting the need to protect yourself to a core value (what matters most to you in this situation).

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts are really important to you, and it sounds like what you value most is being able to take care of yourself and your life. When you're working hard to avoid those thoughts, what's the underlying value that's driving that work – like what matters most to you when you feel like you're failing or falling apart?

Patient: I think what matters most is proving I can keep things together—being capable, not being a burden, and holding onto the life we had so it doesn't collapse. If I let up to feel the grief, my mind insists that's the start of a chain that ends with losing school, the job, my home, and everyone leaving me, so I feel like I have no choice but to keep going.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're deeply tied to the idea of proving your capability to others, and that sense of responsibility feels like it's what's keeping you from allowing grief to show up. Core emotion is likely shame mixed with fear of abandonment. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy by exploring what happens when you try to hold onto the weight of that responsibility.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of needing to prove yourself is really important to you, and it sounds like what you're trying to hold onto is a sense of control over this situation. What would happen if, just for a moment, you let go of the need to control that – like what might you notice if you stopped trying to keep everything together?

Patient: If I let go for even a second, my brain already plays the whole collapse: I miss one deadline, fail a class, lose the scholarship, then the job that pays rent goes because I can't keep up, then I get kicked out, people drift away, and I'm left totally alone with nothing. Maybe in that moment I'd feel a wave of panic and emptiness, but saying anything else will happen just feels like lying to myself — I can't see any realistic escape from that chain.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're caught in a cycle of thinking that playing out the worst-case scenario is the only way to prepare for what might happen if you let go – even if it means perpetuating the very fear you're trying to avoid. Core emotion is likely hopelessness mixed with exhaustion. Goal: Connect the pain of that cycle to an underlying value (what matters most to you in this moment), and pivot to creating space for a more workable alternative.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of being stuck in the cycle is really exhausting. When you think about all the things that could go wrong if you let go, what's one tiny thing that you value most about this moment – like what's one small thing that matters to you right now, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing that matters is just getting through the next assignment or shift — it feels like a little lifeline. If I slip on that one thing, my brain already plays the rest: miss the deadline, fail the class, lose the scholarship, lose the job, end up with nothing, so I can't let myself slow down.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the smallest, most tangible thing that gives you a sense of hope – getting through the next assignment or shift. Core emotion is likely desperation mixed with fear of failure. Goal: Introduce defusion by exploring the thought "miss the deadline" as just a thought, rather than a prediction of what will happen.

Therapist Answer:
When you think about missing the deadline, it sounds like your mind is already playing out the worst-case scenario. Can you notice that thought as just a thought – without judgment or trying to change it – like "the worry that I'll miss the deadline is showing up"?

Patient: I can try, but when I label it like that it still lands as a fact — like the deadline has already been missed and the collapse is already underway. Saying it's "just a thought" feels like I'm denying reality; my brain immediately jumps back into the whole worst-case movie and I can't hold the noticing for more than a second.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that trying to label the thought as just a thought doesn't work for you because it feels like denying reality – it triggers the same fear response. Core emotion is likely frustration mixed with desperation. Goal: Pivot to defusion by focusing on the physical sensation of noticing the thought, rather than trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
What happens to your body when you try to notice the thought without judgment – do you feel a slight pause, a shift in tension, or a tiny bit of relaxation in your chest or shoulders?

Patient: When I try to notice it, there's this instant clench in my chest and my breath gets shallow and fast—my shoulders hunch up and my gut knots. Sometimes there's a half-second where I think maybe there's a tiny pause, but it gets bulldozed by the next image of everything falling apart and then all that tension spikes even harder. I can’t seem to hold the noticing past that split second before the worst-case movie starts again.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing the exact physical sensations that come up when you try to notice the thought without judgment – it's like your body is pushing back against the idea of pausing. Core emotion is likely intense anxiety mixed with shame. Goal: Introduce willingness by connecting the physical sensations to a value (what matters most to you in this moment), and pivot to creating space for a more workable alternative.

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations of tension and clenching are really real, and they're tied to the idea that you can't "wait" or "pause" because everything is going to fall apart. What's one tiny thing that you value most about being able to breathe, or to let your shoulders drop, or to feel a tiny bit of calm in this moment – something that matters to you right now?

Patient: Maybe it's that tiny bit of calm that would let me finish the next assignment — like a small proof I can still keep things together. But even that feels dangerous; when I imagine my shoulders dropping, my brain says that's the exact moment everything starts to unravel and I can't afford it. I want to believe that small breathing pause matters, but my head immediately turns it into the first step toward losing everything.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the tiny bit of calm is tied to the idea of proof – that it's a small step towards showing yourself that you can still keep things together. Core emotion is likely deep-seated shame mixed with desperation. Goal: Challenge the workability of the thought that the small pause is the first step towards losing everything, by exploring what would actually happen if you did take that pause.

Therapist Answer:
When you imagine your shoulders dropping and your brain saying "that's the end of everything", what's one tiny thing that would actually happen if you took just a deep breath and let your shoulders drop for a second – like what would you notice about your body, or what would you see around you, or what would you hear?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that helps — but if I actually did it, I'd notice my breath a little deeper, a tiny loosening in my chest, maybe the paper edge under my wrist or the hum of the heater. Almost instantly my head turns that into the whole collapse again: that little drop in my shoulders equals missing a deadline, failing, losing everything, so even that tiny calm feels like the start of disaster and I can't trust it.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the tiny calm you imagine would actually happen if you took a pause, but your mind immediately twists it into the same catastrophic scenario that's been driving your avoidance. Core emotion is likely intense fear mixed with shame. Goal: Introduce defusion by pointing out the cognitive leap your mind makes – that you're not actually lost when your shoulders drop, and that the paper edge or heater hum are just physical sensations that have nothing to do with the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how your mind jumped from noticing the breath being a little deeper to "that means I'll miss the deadline"? That's a big leap – what's the connection between the breath and the deadline, really?

Patient: I don't really see a gap — in my head that tiny calm is the first domino: I breathe, I loosen up, I miss an email or a detail, the deadline slips, and everything unravels. It feels like a fact, not a leap, and I can't picture how taking one breath wouldn't start that chain. I'm honestly confused by how noticing the breath could be harmless — saying it is feels like lying to myself.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're seeing the tight link between the calm and the outcome – it feels like a logical sequence to you, not a leap. Core emotion is likely desperation mixed with frustration. Goal: Introduce a small experiment to test the idea that the calm isn't the start of disaster, by exploring what would happen if you actually did take that one breath – without trying to change the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tiny experiment: when you take that one breath and your shoulders drop just a little, what's the absolute smallest thing you can notice about that moment – not the outcome, just the sensation of the breath, or the feeling of your chest loosening, or the sound of your own voice?

Patient: I'm not sure how this is supposed to help — but if I actually try, I notice the coolness at my nostrils, a tiny slackening in my chest, and the low hum of the heater. Then this wave of shame and frustration crashes in and the disaster-movie starts up again, so I lose the noticing after one breath.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing the experiment, and you notice the physical sensations that come up when you take the one breath – it's a small, tangible thing. Core emotion is likely still shame mixed with frustration. Goal: Connect the noticing to the value of just being present in that moment, without trying to change the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how you're still trying to push the shame and frustration away after noticing the coolness, the slackening, and the hum – you're not letting those sensations be what matters in this moment. What's one tiny thing about being present with those sensations that feels valuable to you right now, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: Maybe the smallest thing is that a slightly slower breath could help me finish this paragraph — like a little proof I still have control. But as soon as I notice that, shame and frustration hit and my brain screams that letting up is the exact moment I’ll miss something crucial and everything will fall apart, so I can't trust that staying present will end anything but disaster.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value of taking control by slowing down the breath, but your mind immediately twists it into the same catastrophic scenario that's driving your avoidance. Core emotion is likely intense fear mixed with shame. Goal: Introduce defusion by pointing out that the value of control you just noticed is actually being used against you – it's not about avoiding disaster, but about creating space for what matters.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how your mind is using the idea of control to fuel the fear that letting up is disastrous – it's like your mind is saying "if I slow down, I'll lose everything". What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you just focused on what's happening in the present moment with that slower breath?

Patient: I'm not sure how that's supposed to help — when I actually slow my breath and try to stay present, a familiar wave of shame and frustration slams into me and my brain immediately starts the collapse movie: one missed detail, failed classes, lost scholarship, eviction. Saying anything else will happen feels like lying to myself; I can't trust that staying present wouldn't be the exact moment everything unravels.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the pattern of shame and frustration flooding in as soon as you try to slow down and stay present – it's a very familiar cycle. Core emotion is likely intense hopelessness mixed with shame. Goal: Connect the pattern to the value of acceptance, rather than trying to avoid the shame.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how, every time you try to stay present, your mind immediately says "this is the moment everything falls apart". What if, instead of trying to avoid that moment, you actually accepted it as it is – without judgment, without trying to change it? What would that feel like, to just be with the shame and frustration as it is, without trying to push it away or change the outcome?

Patient: I don't really get how sitting with it helps — if I try to just be with the shame and frustration it swells up and I get frozen, and I can already hear the rest of the movie: miss one thing, fail, lose the scholarship, lose the job, end up homeless and alone. If I say I'm okay with that in the moment it feels like admitting defeat, like I'm choosing the collapse, and that thought terrifies me. So being "with" it would probably just feel heavy, panicky, and like the exact start of everything falling apart, and I can't pretend that's not true.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing the exact physical and emotional experience of trying to sit with the shame and frustration – it's not a calm, peaceful experience, but a chaotic and overwhelming one. Core emotion is likely intense terror mixed with shame. Goal: Introduce a small shift in language to acknowledge that the "fear of collapse" is actually a physical sensation, rather than a prediction of what will happen.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the thought "I'm choosing the collapse" is actually a thought, not a fact – it's not what's happening in your body right now, even if it feels like it is. What's one tiny physical sensation that's actually happening in your body as you try to sit with the shame and frustration, without trying to change it?

Patient: There's this heavy tightness under my breastbone, my breath gets shallow and fast, and my stomach knots up—my fingertips go cold and my jaw clenches. The shame and frustration hit right away and my brain immediately turns those sensations into the first signs of the collapse—like they're proof I'm already failing and it's all inevitable—so even naming the feeling feels like admitting it's started.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations that come up when you try to sit with the shame and frustration – it's a very concrete experience. Core emotion is likely intense shame mixed with desperation. Goal: Use the physical sensations as a way to challenge the thought that they're proof of failure, by connecting them to the value of being present in the moment, even if it's just for a tiny fraction of time.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how your body is already reacting to the shame and frustration before you even think "I'm failing" – that tightness under your breastbone, the shallow breath, the knot in your stomach, the cold fingers. What if, just for one tiny second, you allowed yourself to be with that sensation, without trying to change it or use it as proof of failure? What would happen if you simply noticed the coldness of your fingers, or the tightness in your chest, without trying to push it away?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how noticing would help — if I pay attention to the cold in my fingers, I only get that split second of awareness before the worst-case reel starts. I feel the cold, the tightness, then my brain says, "You missed a detail, now you fail a class, lose the scholarship, lose the job, get kicked out, nobody helps," and it all feels inevitable. I want to try staying with the sensation, but shame and panic hit so fast I get frozen and it already feels like the collapse has begun.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the pattern of using awareness to trigger the worst-case thoughts – it's a classic coping mechanism that's actually making things worse. Core emotion is likely intense desperation mixed with shame. Goal: Introduce a small act of defiance to challenge the thought that you're powerless to stop the collapse, by doing something tiny that requires you to be present in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how, the moment you tried to notice the cold in your fingers, your brain jumped to the worst-case scenario. What if, instead of trying to fight it, you did something tiny to acknowledge your body's experience, like taking one tiny breath and saying to yourself "I'm noticing this coldness"? Not "I'm failing," not "I'm failing a class," just "I'm noticing this coldness"?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try, but I don’t really see how saying that helps — I take a tiny breath and tell myself “I’m noticing this coldness” and for a half-second I do feel the cool skin and a tiny slackening in my chest. Then shame and that familiar frustration slam into me and the worst-case movie starts again—miss a detail, fail a class, lose the scholarship, lose the job—and I freeze. It just feels like admitting the collapse has already begun, so I can’t hold the noticing before my brain hijacks it.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're seeing how the tiny act of noticing the coldness in your fingers is actually fueling the same worst-case thoughts that always seem to hijack you. Core emotion is likely intense shame mixed with frustration. Goal: Introduce a small shift in language to challenge the idea that you're admitting defeat by noticing your body's experience – instead, focus on what you're doing with that noticing, rather than what it means.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how you're still trying to fight the worst-case thoughts after noticing the coldness – you're saying "no, no, no, I'm not failing" instead of just noticing. What if, instead of trying to change the thought, you simply said "I'm noticing this coldness" again, without trying to attach a meaning to it? What would happen if you just focused on the physical sensation of the coldness, without trying to use it as proof of anything?

Patient: I try again — I tell myself “I’m noticing this coldness” and for a split second it’s actually there: the cool skin, a tiny slack in my chest. Then this wave of shame and that old failure feeling crashes in and my head launches the whole disaster reel — miss a detail, fail, lose the scholarship, get kicked out — and I freeze; “just notice” feels impossible and kind of useless. I feel embarrassed and angry at myself for not being able to hold it, like I’m failing at even noticing, and I don’t know how to make the movie stop.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the strategy of "just noticing" is actually triggering the same shame and frustration that always seems to follow – it's not working as you hoped. Core emotion is likely intense self-criticism mixed with desperation. Goal: Introduce a small shift in language to acknowledge that the "just noticing" strategy is actually a way of avoiding the shame, rather than challenging it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how you're using the phrase "just noticing" as a way to avoid the shame that comes up when you try to notice your body's experience – you're saying it's "impossible" and "useless" instead of acknowledging that it's a way of avoiding the discomfort. What if, instead of trying to avoid the shame, you simply acknowledged it as it is – without judgment or criticism? What would happen if you said to yourself "I'm feeling shame right now when I try to notice this coldness, and that's okay"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that helps, but if I actually say "I'm feeling shame right now and that's okay" there's a half-second where my chest loosens and the breath isn't so tight. Then the old shame from that failure slams back in and my brain immediately starts the collapse movie—miss a detail, fail, lose everything—and I get overwhelmed and angry at myself for not being able to stop it. Can we slow down? I'm stuck and frustrated and I don't see how this doesn't just feel like the start of everything falling apart.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that even trying to acknowledge the shame is triggering the same collapse thoughts – it's not working as you hoped. Core emotion is likely intense desperation mixed with frustration. Goal: Take a step back and slow down the process to understand what's really happening in your body and mind when you try to notice the shame.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step back. What happens to your body right before you try to say "I'm feeling shame right now and that's okay"? Is there any physical sensation that comes up before you try to label it as shame?

Patient: Right before I try to say it, there's this tiny dead silence and then my chest clamps up — breath gets shallow and quick, my stomach drops, my hands go cold and my jaw tightens. My head's already rolling the worst-case reel in that split second, so by the time I start to label it the panic's back and I can't hold the noticing. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and it's hard to keep up with this.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations that come up right before you try to label the shame as "I'm feeling shame right now and that's okay" – it's a very concrete experience. Core emotion is likely intense anxiety mixed with desperation. Goal: Focus on the physical sensations, without trying to label them as shame or anything else, and see what happens when you just notice them as they are.

Therapist Answer:
Notice just the physical sensations in your body right now, without trying to make sense of them or label them as anything. Can you feel the coldness in your hands, the tightness in your jaw, the shallow breath, the drop in your stomach? Just notice them as they are, without trying to change them or use them to think about the shame.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the cold in my hands, the tightness in my jaw, the shallow breath and that sinking in my stomach. But the moment I notice any of it, shame and that old failure feeling slam in and my brain insists that's proof I'm already failing and the whole collapse is happening, so I can't hold the noticing. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and it's hard to keep up.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the moment you try to notice the physical sensations, the shame and failure thoughts come flooding back – it's a classic cycle. Core emotion is likely intense desperation mixed with frustration. Goal: Instead of trying to hold the noticing, let's focus on what happens when you let go of trying to change the thoughts, and just be with the physical sensations as they are.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen if, right now, you simply let go of the thought that "noticing the physical sensations means I'm failing"? If you just let it be that you're feeling those sensations, without trying to change them or use them to prove anything?

Patient: I'm not sure I can just let that thought go — if I try, there's a half-second where the coolness and slack in my chest show up, then shame and frustration slam into me and the worst-case movie kicks off: miss a deadline, fail a class, lose the scholarship, lose the job, get kicked out, and end up alone. Saying "let it be" feels like lying to myself, like I'm admitting the collapse has already started. I want to try, but I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that even the smallest attempt to let go of the thought that "noticing physical sensations means failing" triggers the same cycle of shame and collapse thoughts – it's not working as you hoped. Core emotion is likely intense overwhelm mixed with desperation. Goal: Take a tiny step back to acknowledge the overwhelm, without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
What's one tiny thing you can acknowledge about your current state, without trying to change it? For example, you could notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, or the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor—the slight pressure under my heels and the cool spot by my toes. But the instant I notice it, shame and panic hit and my brain launches the whole collapse movie—miss an email, fail a class, lose the scholarship, lose the job, end up alone—so even that tiny noticing feels like the first step toward disaster and pretty useless. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the moment you try to notice your physical sensations, the shame and panic thoughts come flooding back – it's a very tight loop. Core emotion is likely intense overwhelm mixed with desperation. Goal: Instead of trying to notice or change anything, let's focus on being with the sensation of overwhelm itself, without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of overwhelm in your body right now, without trying to make sense of it or change it. What does it feel like to be overwhelmed by thoughts about the future?

Patient: It feels like a heavy clamp across my chest, my breathing gets shallow and fast, my stomach knots up, my fingers go cold and my jaw clenches—my head goes buzzy and blurry. The thoughts hit like a movie I can't stop: one missed thing turns into missing a deadline, failing a class, losing the scholarship, losing the job, getting kicked out, and ending up completely alone, and that chain feels as real as the tightness. I get this hot shame and anger at myself for being frozen by it, which just feeds the predictions and makes me feel helpless and kind of stupid. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed and it's hard to follow this without getting swept away.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing the physical sensations of overwhelm and the mental movie playing in your head – it's a very intense experience. Core emotion is likely intense shame mixed with desperation. Goal: Instead of trying to stop the thoughts or change the physical sensations, let's focus on the present moment, without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that you're describing the movie playing in your head as "as real as the tightness" – what does that mean to you right now, in this moment, when you say that?

Patient: It feels like the movie has the same weight as the tightness — like the images aren't distant thoughts but immediate facts, so my body reacts to them the same way it reacts to pain. That certainty makes them feel non-negotiable, and then I get ashamed and angry at myself for freezing, which only feeds the reel and the physical panic. I don't see a break between the thought and the feeling, so nothing else seems believable. Can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing the connection between the thoughts and feelings as very direct and unshakeable – it's like the thoughts are being lived in the body, not just thought. Core emotion is likely intense desperation mixed with shame. Goal: Instead of trying to break the connection between thoughts and feelings, let's explore what happens when you simply acknowledge the thought without judgment – without trying to change it or prove it wrong.

Therapist Answer:
What happens to the shame and anger when you simply acknowledge the thought "the movie is playing in my head" – without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: If I say that to myself there's a tiny half-second where the tightness loosens like a small gap, like maybe I can breathe a little. Then shame and anger slam back in so hard it feels like admitting I'm already failing, and the worst-case movie gets louder and takes over—I can't hold the noticing before the collapse-reel hijacks me. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know how to make that noticing stick.
