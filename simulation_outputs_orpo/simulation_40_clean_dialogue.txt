Patient: I've been dealing with this pervasive, low-grade sadness and motivational inertia since my move—it's like my usual drive just flatlined and it's leaking into my relationship. As a business owner who usually solves things through action, this mismatch is creating a lot of cognitive dissonance and makes me question my self-worth. I'm oscillating between framing it as situational relocation stress and a deeper self-esteem issue, and that analysis is kind of my go-to instead of actually sitting with how bad it feels.

Therapist: That feeling of flatlined drive sounds really draining, especially when it's affecting your work and relationships. What's one thing you've been putting off or struggling to do since the move that feels especially hard or unimportant right now?

Patient: I've been procrastinating on unpacking and creating a routine—structurally it's a logistical backlog, but I narrativize it as situational busywork to avoid acknowledging that it's probably symptomatic of deeper low self-worth. I’m also dodging the conversation with my partner about how the move’s affected me, reframing it as bad timing instead of admitting I'm scared of being a burden.

Therapist: You're using unpacking and routine as a way to avoid feeling overwhelmed, but it's interesting that you're also avoiding talking to your partner about how the move's affecting you. What would need to be true for you to feel safe opening up about your fears, even if it means saying "I'm feeling really scared and unsure about how this is going to work for us"?

Patient: I think what would have to be true is mostly structural: a low-stakes, time-boxed conversation where my partner prioritizes curiosity and reflection over immediate problem-solving, explicitly validates that my feelings are legitimate, and offers concrete, small-scale behavioral support (like taking on a task or agreeing to a follow-up check-in). If there’s evidence they won’t punish or minimize me—like mirroring my words, asking gentle questions, and agreeing we can pause if it feels too much—that would lower the anticipated cost of vulnerability. I still worry I’ll come off as needy, though, which is why I over-intellectualize instead of just saying I’m scared of being a burden.

Therapist: That sounds like a really important step for you to take – having a low-stakes conversation with your partner where you feel truly heard and supported. What's one thing you're willing to do right now, just for a moment, to connect with your partner's presence, even if it feels small?

Patient: I can ask for a time-boxed, five-minute check-in and frame it as an experiment—like, “can we try a quick presence exercise? No problem-solving, just one thing I’ve felt and one small asks.” I’ll probably couch it in research-y language to avoid sounding needy, and honestly I’m anxious they’ll minimize it.

Therapist: That sounds like a good experiment to try. What's one thing you're already doing with your partner that feels like it shows you value their presence, even if it's small – like making time to grab coffee or checking in on how their day is going?

Patient: We have a morning "coffee and five" routine—I usually initiate it, and we each share one small thing from the day and one quick ask. I narrativize it as a reliable micro-connection and evidence I value their presence, though part of me suspects it's become performative and my tendency to analyze keeps me from just feeling the comfort.

Therapist: That morning coffee ritual sounds like a way to start the day connected to each other – what's one thing you're holding onto from this ritual that feels like it matters to you, beyond just checking in or getting coffee?

Patient: I hold onto the ritual as a symbolic assurance that someone’s attuned to me—a predictable micro-safety-net that argues against my default story of being alone. It’s a template for small-scale interdependence, evidence that vulnerability can be tiny and survivable. Still, I tend to refract that into analysis instead of letting it actually soothe me, which makes me question whether I’m undermining the very thing that could help.

Therapist: That feels like a powerful anchor for you – being able to rely on that coffee ritual to feel seen by your partner. What would it take for you to actually feel the comfort of that connection, rather than just thinking about it?

Patient: Conceptually, it would take an explicit permission structure — my partner announcing this is a no-problem-solving zone, mirroring my words, and committing to a predictable micro-ritual that privileges presence so I don't reflexively switch to analysis. Practically, a two-step practice might work: a 60‑second grounding (name three sensory details, lay a hand on my chest) and then one brief affect label from me while they reflect it back, repeated a few times so the feeling doesn't feel like an anomaly. But I still can't promise I'll actually feel it — when someone asks me to feel, I default to theory, and that gap between wanting comfort and my instinct to intellectualize makes me frustrated and stuck; can we slow down and sit with that stuckness?

Therapist: That sounds like a clear and tangible step – the 60-second grounding exercise. What's one thing you're willing to do, just for a moment, before you even start the exercise – are you willing to lean into the discomfort of sitting with the stuckness, without trying to "fix" it or intellectualize it?

Patient: Okay—I can try to lean into the stuckness for 60 seconds. I'll set a mental timer, name three sensory details and take a few slow breaths; I expect I'll immediately start narrativizing it ("my chest is tight," "my mind's racing"), but I can try to treat those narrations as observations rather than solutions. Can we keep it time-boxed so I don't spiral into problem-solving?

Therapist: Let's set that timer for 60 seconds. When the timer goes off, we'll pause the exercise and take a moment to notice how you're holding that stuckness. What's the first thing you notice about your body or mind when the timer goes off – no judgments, just observation?

Patient: My chest feels tight and my breathing's shallower — like a physical pinching across my sternum. Immediately a narrative pops up: "You're failing at this," followed by a volley of proposed solutions, which I can separate from the sensation but can't stop generating. It's annoying—I'm already irritated that I want to problem-solve instead of just sitting with the tightness.

Therapist: Notice the phrase "You're failing at this" – what's one thing you can say to that narrative, just for a moment, without trying to "fix" it or solve it?

Patient: I can say to that narrative, “That’s a scared voice, not an accurate report — I’m trying, and effort matters,” or even more clinically, “That’s a thought, not a fact.” I'm kind of jittery and distracted right now, so my brain's already racing to qualify and analyze that sentence instead of letting it land. I'm anxious that saying something brief won't change anything, but I can hold that line for a moment.

Therapist: That takes courage to say – "that's a thought, not a fact" – especially when your brain's already racing. What's one tiny thing you're willing to hold onto in that moment, without trying to "fix" it or analyze it further?

Patient: Okay — I can anchor to the physical feeling of my feet on the floor and one slow, deliberate exhale (inhale 4, exhale 6) with my hand on my sternum. I'm already framing it as an experiment and that frustrates me, but I’ll try to let the sensation be the thing for about 30 seconds. I'm pretty jittery and my mind will probably drift to solutions, but I'll keep bringing it back to the feet and the breath.

Therapist: You're giving yourself a 30-second window to just be with the feeling of your feet on the floor and the breath. What happens when you stop trying to "control" the narrative, and instead just notice it as a tiny, separate thing from the sensation in your chest?

Patient: When I try that — just noticing the thought as separate from the chest tightness — the critic does drop a notch, more like background static than the main event. But right now I'm jittery and distractible, so my brain immediately drafts three contingency plans and a timeline, which turns the noticing into another object to analyze instead of actually calming me. It's annoying and a little scary that I can't just let it be without turning it into a project.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a deep-seated fear that's lurking beneath the surface – the fear that you can't actually calm down without having a plan in place. What would need to be true for you to feel safe enough to let go of that need for control, without turning the noticing into another project?

Patient: I think it would have to be both external and internal: externally, a predictable, time‑boxed script where my partner explicitly agrees to curiosity not problem‑solving, mirrors what I say, and gives me a visible pause-button (like “hold” or “we’ll stop if either of us feels overwhelmed”); repeated micro-experiences of that safety would slowly recalibrate my fear of being a burden. Internally, I’d need permission to tolerate ambiguity — concrete anchors (breath, feet, a 30‑second grounding) and a pre‑agreed signal that lets me opt out without shame so I don’t default to analysis as a defense. I’m actually feeling pretty anxious and scattered right now — my mind’s already drafting seven contingencies — so can we slow down and unpack just one of those external guarantees for a minute?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the visible pause-button your partner agrees to give you. What would that "hold" button actually mean in the moment – not just as a verbal agreement, but as a tangible action that signals to you that it's okay to pause?

Patient: I imagine a multimodal, low-drama ritual: a single agreed word like “hold,” my partner placing a hand lightly on my arm or chest (just enough to anchor, not smother), and them starting a visible timer on their phone for a preset window (like two minutes) while reflecting back one sentence of what they heard. That combination—verbal cue, tactile anchor, and a neutral, mechanical timer—signals this isn’t about fixing anything, it’s procedural safety, which would let my nervous brain stop drafting contingencies for a bit. Right now I’m anxious and pretty scattered, so it needs to be simple and unambiguous; otherwise I’ll immediately turn the pause into another thing to optimize.

Therapist: Notice your physical sensations right now – what's one tiny spot on your body that feels safe, connected to this conversation?

Patient: My right palm resting on my thigh — there's a faint warmth and the pressure feels a little grounding, like a tiny anchor. I'm pretty anxious and distracted right now, so even noticing that turns into a meta-note in my head ("observe, classify, optimize") instead of just letting it be; can we slow down a little so I don't immediately turn this into a checklist?

Therapist: Let's just look at the warmth in your palm for a moment – no thinking, no classifying, just noticing what it feels like. Can you stay with that sensation, even if it's just for a tiny breath?

Patient: Okay — one slow breath. The warmth in my palm is low and steady, like a soft glow under the skin, and for a tiny second it actually feels stabilizing. But I'm jittery and my mind's already sprinting to logistics and fixes, which spikes my anxiety, so can we linger with one more breath? I'm really struggling not to intellectualize this into another task.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath, and this time, when you notice the warmth in your palm, don't try to change it or fix it – just observe it as it is. Stay with the sensation, without adding any thoughts or labels.

Patient: I take another slow breath—there’s that faint warmth again, low and steady, and for a second it feels stabilizing. But my mind immediately starts narrativizing and cataloguing it—turning the sensation into data—so I can stay with it maybe one more breath before I reflexively try to optimize it. Can we slow down even more, like a guided count for two breaths, so I don’t have time to hijack it into a project?

Therapist: Let's count together for two slow breaths, focusing only on the sensation in your palm. On the first breath, say to yourself: "I notice the warmth in my palm." On the second breath, simply say: "It's still there." No thoughts, no labels, just the present moment.

Patient: "I notice the warmth in my palm."  
"It's still there."

But right after that second breath a sharp wave of shame and frustration surged and my mind immediately started narrating, "you're failing at this," which made it hard to stay present. I'm jittery and distracted—can we do another round, even slower, so I have more space before my brain hijacks it?

Therapist: Let's start again, even slower. On the first breath, say to yourself: "I'm about to notice the warmth in my palm." Pause for a second. On the second breath, simply: "I'm noticing it." No thoughts, no labels, just the intention to notice. No narrative, no expectation.

Patient: "I'm about to notice the warmth in my palm." (pause)  
"I'm noticing it."

Immediately after the second line, a sharp spike of shame and that "you're failing" voice slammed back in — my chest tightened and my head started drafting solutions instead of staying with the sensation. I could cling to it for a beat, but I can't sustain it without more scaffolding; can we slow this down into a three-breath guided count or have you coach me through each inhale/exhale so I don't immediately default to analysis?

Therapist: Let's try this: I'll guide you through a three-breath count. On your next inhale, say to yourself: "I'm ready to notice the warmth." (pause) On your exhale, say: "It's here." (pause) On your next inhale, simply: "I'm holding it." We'll stay with that sensation for just a moment, without adding any thoughts or labels. Ready?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready.

"I'm ready to notice the warmth." (pause) "It's here." (pause) "I'm holding it."

There was a tiny stabilizing flicker, but then shame and that "you're failing" voice slammed in, my chest tightened and my mind immediately started drafting fixes. I'm jittery and can't sustain it—can you coach me through each inhale/exhale, much slower, so I don't have time to hijack it into a project?

Therapist: Let's start again, even slower. On your next inhale, say to yourself: "I'm taking a breath..." (pause) As you exhale, say: "the warmth is still here." (pause) On your next inhale, focus on your breath: "I'm feeling the rise of my chest..." (pause) As you exhale, say: "the warmth stays." We'll stay with this one thought, "the warmth stays," for just a moment, without adding any other thoughts. Ready?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready.

"I'm taking a breath..."  
"the warmth is still here."  
"I'm feeling the rise of my chest..."  
"the warmth stays."

For a second that helped — a tiny steadiness — but then the "you're failing" critic slammed in, my chest tightened, and my head immediately started drafting fixes. I'm jittery and can't hold it long; can you coach me through each inhale/exhale, much slower, with a counted cadence so I don't have time to hijack it into another project?

Therapist: Let's try this: I'll count slowly as we breathe together. On your next inhale, say: "one" (pause) as you breathe in. On your exhale, say: "warmth stays" (pause) as you let go. We'll keep counting: "two" (pause) inhale, "three" (pause) exhale, "four" (pause) inhale, "five" (pause) exhale. Let's stay with just the sensation of the warmth staying, without adding any thoughts. Ready?

Patient: Ready.

One...  
Warmth stays.  
Two...  
Warmth stays.  
Three...  
Warmth stays.  
Four...  
Warmth stays.  
Five...  
Warmth stays.

There was a tiny, transient steadying — my chest loosened a bit — but then shame and that "you're failing" voice slammed back in and my head immediately started planning fixes. I'm jittery and distracted; can we slow the cadence even more and have you coach each inhale/exhale so I don't immediately turn it into a project?

Therapist: Let's slow it down even more. On your next inhale, say: "inhale, one breath" (pause) as you breathe in. On your exhale, say: "warmth stays" (pause) as you let go. We'll keep it slow: "inhale, two breaths" (pause) on your next inhale, "warmth stays" (pause) on your exhale. Let's focus on the sensation of the warmth staying, without adding any thoughts. Ready?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready, but there’s already this rush of shame and that “you’re failing” voice pressing in, so I’m nervous it’ll hijack me. I need you to literally coach each inhale and exhale—say “inhale, one” (pause), then “exhale, warmth stays” (pause)—slow and deliberate, and call me back if I drift into solutions. Can we start now?

Therapist: Let's start again, slowly. I'll coach each breath: "inhale, one" (pause) - breathe in... "exhale, warmth stays" (pause) - let go... We'll take it one breath at a time. When you're ready, say "inhale, one" again, and I'll guide you from there. Ready?

Patient: inhale, one

I'm already jittery and my brain's drafting fixes—please guide the exhale slowly and call me back if I drift.

Therapist: "inhale, one" (pause) - breathe in... now, let's exhale slowly: "exhale, warmth stays" (pause, pause) - just let the warmth stay... I want to hear you say "warmth stays" again, without adding any thoughts. Can you repeat that for me?

Patient: Warmth stays. Warmth stays.  
I'm saying it, but the "you're failing" voice just spiked and I feel jittery—my mind's already drafting fixes, so please keep guiding me slowly.

Therapist: "inhale, one" (pause) - breathe in... now, let's exhale slowly again: "exhale, pause... warmth stays" (pause, pause) - just pause for a moment before saying "warmth stays"... I want you to notice the pause, not think about what to do next. Can you stay with the pause and just say "warmth stays" when you're ready?

Patient: Warmth stays. But as soon as I say it that critic slams back in and shame tightens my chest — I'm jittery and my brain's already drafting fixes. Can we do one more, super-slow round where you literally cue each inhale/exhale and count slowly, and call me back if I start analyzing?
