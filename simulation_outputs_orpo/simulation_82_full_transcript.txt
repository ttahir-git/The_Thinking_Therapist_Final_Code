--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early fifties and back at school, and lately what's been on my mind is this intense anxiety in social settings. I keep avoiding gatherings with friends because I get really on edge, though my colleagues have been somewhat supportive. It's really uncomfortable to talk about, so I guess I might shut down or say "I don't know" if we get too close to it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the core emotion of intense anxiety in social settings ("on edge") and its impact on avoiding gatherings with friends. A specific theme that stands out is the avoidance behavior itself ("shutting down" or saying "I don't know"), which suggests a struggle with exploring the anxiety rather than addressing the underlying values that might be driving this avoidance. Goal: Explore the value behind avoiding these gatherings to identify a potential pivot.

Therapist Answer:
What's one value that matters to you when it comes to connecting with friends, even if it feels uncomfortable – like being able to show up fully and be yourself in those moments?

Patient: I guess authenticity — or really just feeling understood and accepted. I want to be able to show up as myself without having to perform, but talking about it makes me tense and I don't know how to explain it better.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your value of authenticity and feeling understood/accepted is clear, and the struggle to explain it without tensing up is a tangible barrier. A contradiction here is that you want to show up as yourself but avoid talking about it because it makes you tense. Goal: Connect this tension to a specific behavior (avoiding gatherings) and pivot towards exploring what happens when you try to approach the anxiety instead of avoiding it.

Therapist Answer:
That tension makes sense – when you think about being authentic, but talking about it feels like performing, it creates a paradox. What happens when you're at a gathering with friends and you start to feel that tension? What's the first thing that usually happens – do you start checking your phone, avoid eye contact, or something else?

Patient: I guess the first thing I do is grab my phone so I have something to focus on. My heart starts racing, I scan the room and avoid eye contact, and I find myself standing by the exit like I'm ready to leave. I don't know, it feels automatic and then I usually slip away early.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The behavior is automatic ("grabbing phone"), and it's followed by physical tension ("heart racing"), social avoidance ("avoid eye contact"), and a specific escape route ("standing by the exit"). This pattern is unworkable for you, as you mentioned earlier. Goal: Introduce a willingness pivot – explore what it might be like to stay with this physical tension, even if it's uncomfortable, and see if that changes the behavior.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your heart racing and your hands start to grab your phone, what's the first thought that comes up for you – is it "I need to get out of here" or something else?

Patient: I guess the first thought is “I need to get out of here,” and then it flips to “they can tell I’m anxious” or “I’m being awkward.” I don’t know, I worry they’ll judge me or that I’ll say something stupid. Sorry—it's just hard to pin down.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The thoughts are very self-critical ("they can tell I'm anxious", "I'm being awkward"), which suggests a strong need to avoid being judged or vulnerable. The value that's driving this avoidance is safety ("not wanting to be judged"). Goal: Connect this value to a specific action – what would happen if you made room for this anxiety without the judgmental thoughts?

Therapist Answer:
When you're standing by the exit, ready to leave, what would you have to do to actually leave the gathering – would you need to say goodbye to someone, or would you just need to step outside?

Patient: I guess usually I just step outside and slip away. If I feel I have to, I’ll mutter a quick “sorry, I have to go” to someone I know, but most times I drift off without a proper goodbye. I don't know, leaving feels easier than staying.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The behavior is still avoiding social interaction, but now it's slightly more specific – you're not just leaving, you're leaving in a way that's not fully present ("drifting off"). This still suggests that staying with the anxiety is unworkable for you, but it's a small step closer to exploring what happens when you're willing to be more present in the discomfort. Goal: Connect the willingness to leave with the value of safety – what's the underlying reason you're avoiding staying, even though leaving feels easier?

Therapist Answer:
You said leaving feels easier than staying. What's the part about staying that makes you want to leave – is it the thought of being judged, or something else entirely?

Patient: I guess it's mostly the fear of being judged — like I worry every little thing I say will come out wrong. Then I get this tightness in my chest and my mind goes blank, so I feel useless and exposed. I don't know, it's embarrassing to admit and I kind of want to change the subject.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The fear of being judged is a clear trigger for your avoidance, and it's linked to a physical sensation (tightness in the chest) and a mental response (mind going blank). This combination creates a perfect storm of anxiety that makes you want to change the subject. Goal: Introduce a willingness pivot – explore what would happen if you allowed the tightness to be there, without trying to change the subject or escape into judgmental thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that tightness in your chest and your mind goes blank, what's the first thing you're tempted to do – is it try to talk your way out of it, avoid the conversation, or change the subject?

Patient: I guess I mostly try to avoid or change the subject — I’ll steer the conversation away or make a joke. Sometimes I try to talk my way out, but my mind goes blank and I end up quiet or glued to my phone. I don't know, it feels automatic and like I can't control it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
This avoidance strategy is automatic ("steer the conversation away" or "make a joke"), and it's not working because it creates more tension ("glued to your phone"). The desire to control the situation is what's driving this behavior, but it's actually making things worse. Goal: Connect this automatic behavior to the underlying value of safety – what's the actual fear driving the need to avoid or change the subject?

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that tightness in your chest, what's the one thing you're afraid will happen if you don't change the subject – is it that you'll say something "wrong", that others will judge you, or something else?

Patient: I guess I'm afraid I'll say something stupid and everyone will notice how awkward I am. I worry they'll judge me or decide I'm not worth talking to, maybe even stop inviting me. I don't know — it just feels like everything would fall apart if I didn't change the subject.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The fear of saying something stupid and being judged or ostracized is a powerful driver of your avoidance behavior. This fear is linked to a deep-seated value of self-worth ("worth talking to" and "not being judged") and a fear of loss of connection ("stop inviting me"). Goal: Introduce a willingness pivot – explore what would happen if you let go of the need to control the conversation and just showed up with your presence, without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
If you allowed yourself to feel awkward or uncomfortable in the conversation, what's the one thing you might actually get to experience – is it a chance to connect with someone, learn something new, or simply be present with the moment?

Patient: I guess if I let myself feel awkward, maybe I could actually connect with someone — like they'd notice and reach out, and that would feel...relieving. Or maybe I'd realize it's not as catastrophic as I imagine and I wouldn't be judged so harshly. I don't know, saying that feels weird.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The idea of connecting with someone by being present and vulnerable is a beautiful one, and it's rooted in the value of connection and community. The willingness to let go of the need to control the conversation and just show up is a small step towards exploring what's possible. Goal: Connect this willingness to vulnerability with the physical sensation of awkwardness – what would it look like to actually feel the tightness in your chest without trying to escape it?

Therapist Answer:
When you imagine being present and vulnerable in the conversation, what would the physical sensation of your chest tightness look like – is it a knot, a squeeze, or a heaviness?

Patient: I guess it's like a knot — a tight, sinking squeeze right under my ribs, like someone's pressing in. My breath gets shallow, my shoulders hunch up, and my stomach flips. I don't know, I don't really like getting into the details, it makes me tense.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensation of the knot is a powerful reminder of the discomfort that drives your avoidance behavior. By acknowledging the specifics of what happens in your body ("shallow breath", "shoulders hunch", "stomach flips"), you're creating a vivid picture of what's happening when you try to escape into judgmental thoughts. Goal: Use this vividness to connect it to the value of connection – what's the actual cost of avoiding this knot in the moment?

Therapist Answer:
What happens in the moment when you let the knot be there, instead of trying to escape it – does it feel like you're shrinking away from the conversation, or does it actually create space for someone to notice you and connect with you?

Patient: I don't know... at first I just kind of shrink — my voice goes tiny and I fold in on myself like I want to disappear. But every so often if I stay, someone will notice and check in, and that actually loosens the knot a little. I guess it feels risky — like it could go either way — and getting into it like this already makes me more tense.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The willingness to stay with the knot, even though it feels risky, is a small step towards exploring what's possible. The fact that staying connected creates space for others to notice and check in is a powerful insight – it's not about avoiding the knot, but about creating opportunities for connection. Goal: Connect this insight to the value of vulnerability – what's the actual risk worth if it means creating space for connection?

Therapist Answer:
What's the one thing you value most about connecting with others, and is it worth risking feeling vulnerable (i.e., the knot) for just a moment to see what happens?

Patient: I guess what I value most is feeling accepted — like someone sees me and doesn't expect me to put on a show. Is it worth the knot? I don't know... part of me thinks yes, because the few times I stayed awkward someone reached out and it helped, but it still terrifies me and I don't really know how to push through without panicking.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The desire for acceptance is a fundamental human need, and it's what drives your willingness to risk feeling vulnerable. The fact that you've had experiences where staying awkward helped create space for connection is a powerful anchor – it's not just about feeling accepted, but about feeling seen. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible action to build confidence – what's one tiny step you can take to push through the knot without panicking?

Therapist Answer:
What would you do with just 30 seconds of physical comfort (e.g., deep breath, gentle shoulder roll, or a small stretch) before reaching out to someone in the conversation?

Patient: I guess I'd take one slow, deep breath, let my shoulders drop, and maybe roll them once while grounding my feet. Then I'd try something small and quiet — a soft "hi" or a simple question — but I don't know, it still feels hard.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The small action of taking a slow, deep breath, letting your shoulders drop, and rolling your feet is a tangible way to create physical comfort while staying present. The quiet, small action of saying "hi" or asking a simple question is a gentle way to test the waters without overwhelming yourself. Goal: Connect this small action to the value of acceptance – what would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the knot while taking this small step?

Therapist Answer:
As you take that slow, deep breath and say "hi" or ask a simple question, what's one thing you might notice about yourself – is it a tiny shift in your posture, a slight opening in your voice, or a glimmer of curiosity in your eyes?

Patient: I guess I'd notice my shoulders drop and my voice come out a bit steadier — like there's a tiny space to actually say something. I don't know, it still feels fragile.


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensation of your shoulders dropping and your voice steadying is a tangible sign that you're creating space for connection. The fact that you're acknowledging the fragility of the moment is also important – it shows that you're willing to hold the uncertainty, even if it's uncomfortable. Goal: Introduce a subtle pivot – what if instead of trying to "make it work" or "get it right", you simply allowed the moment to be what it was?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your shoulders dropping and your voice steadying, what would you do instead of trying to "make it work"? Would you say "yes" to the connection, even if it feels tentative, or would you try to "fix" it by saying something more "perfect"?

Patient: I guess I'd want to say yes to the connection, but my knee-jerk is to try to fix it — come up with something "right" to say. Then I get this wash of shame, like I already messed it up, and I end up pulling back. I don't know, it just feels frustrating and heavy.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The struggle to say "yes" to the connection while trying to "fix" it is a classic pattern of avoidance. The shame that washes over you is a clear sign that you're using self-criticism to try to control the outcome, rather than being present with the moment. Goal: Connect this pattern to the value of imperfection – what if you allowed yourself to be imperfect, not just in the words you say, but in the way you show up in the moment?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your knee-jerk to "fix" the moment, what's one small thing you could do instead of trying to control the outcome? Would you take one tiny breath before responding, or just pause for a moment to see what happens without trying to "make it right"?

Patient: I guess I could just take one slow breath and pause — maybe say something simple like "hmm" or "I'm thinking" instead of trying to fix it. But when I try that, this heavy shame comes over me, like I've already blown it, and then I clench up. I don't know, it still feels really hard.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The shame that comes over you when you try to pause or respond with something simple is a powerful sign that you're still trying to avoid being seen or judged. The heaviness you feel when you clench up is a physical manifestation of the emotional weight of that shame. Goal: Introduce a radical shift in focus – instead of trying to avoid shame, what if you noticed it as a physical sensation in your body, without judgment?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice that heavy shame rising up in your chest, what would you do with your body instead of trying to fight it? Would you notice the sensation of your heart rate slowing down, your muscles tensing up, or your breath getting shallow?

Patient: I guess I'd try to soften my shoulders and take a slow, deliberate breath, maybe rest a hand on my chest just to notice it. But usually that shame comes and I end up holding my breath, my chest tightens more, my jaw clenches, and I just want to disappear. I don't know — it feels heavy and kind of pointless to get into.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations you described (softening shoulders, slow breath, noticing chest) are all steps towards creating space for the shame to be present without judgment. The fact that it's still triggering a physical response (chest tightening, jaw clenching) is a sign that the shame is still a powerful trigger for you. Goal: Connect this physical response to the value of compassion – what if, instead of trying to "get through" the shame, you allowed it to be what it was, without trying to change it or fight it?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your chest tightening and your jaw clenching, what would you say to yourself instead of trying to "get through" the shame? Would you say "I see that I'm feeling this tightness" or "This is what happens when I feel this way"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "I notice this tightness in my chest,"—just naming it out loud. But then that shame comes up, I feel stupid, and I clamp up or go quiet, so I don't know if it actually helps.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Naming the physical sensation ("I notice this tightness in my chest") is a small but significant step towards creating space for the shame. However, the shame that comes up after that is a reminder that your inner critic is still very present. Goal: Introduce a tiny pivot – instead of trying to "get past" the shame, what if you simply allowed the shame to be what it was, without judgment, and then took one tiny physical step towards connection?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shame coming up after naming the physical sensation, what would you do just before responding to it (instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing")? Would you take one tiny breath, or roll your shoulders slightly, or look away for just a second?

Patient: I guess I'd try a tiny slow breath, roll my shoulders a bit, maybe rest a hand on my chest and ground my feet for a second. But then shame floods in and I clench up and go quiet, and I don't know if that pause actually helps — it just feels like I'm back where I started.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The tiny physical steps you're taking (breath, roll shoulders, rest hand on chest, ground feet) are actually helping to create space for the shame to be present. The fact that it's still flooding in and you're clenching up is a sign that you're still struggling with the shame. Goal: Connect this struggle with the value of acceptance – what if, instead of trying to "get past" the shame, you simply allowed it to be what it was, without judgment, and then did one tiny thing to connect with your body?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shame flooding in and you're clenching up, what's one tiny physical thing you could do to connect with your body, like touching your toes or stretching your neck, instead of trying to push it away?

Patient: I guess maybe a tiny neck stretch or rolling my shoulders, or pressing my feet into the floor and taking one slow breath. But even picturing that brings up this heavy, stupid shame and I clamp down, so I don't know if it would actually help.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations you're trying to create (neck stretch, shoulder roll, pressing feet into floor) are actually a way to connect with your body and ground yourself, which is exactly what you need when shame is flooding in. The fact that picturing it brings up shame and you're clamping down is a sign that you're still struggling with the shame. Goal: Introduce a radical shift in focus – instead of trying to "get past" the shame, what if you simply noticed the shame as a physical sensation in your body, without judgment, and then used it as an opportunity to breathe?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shame flooding in and you're clamping down, what would you say to yourself instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing"? Would you say "This shame feels like it's rising up in my chest" or "I'm feeling this tightness in my shoulders"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "This shame is here — my chest is tight and my jaw's clenched," out loud so it's not just in my head. But then I feel silly and the words kind of fizzle, and I don't know if it actually helps. It just feels heavy and I... I guess that's where I get stuck.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Naming the shame out loud is a powerful step towards creating space for it to be present without judgment. The fact that the words fizzle and you feel silly is a common pattern – it's like your inner critic is still trying to control the narrative. Goal: Introduce a small pivot – instead of trying to "make the shame go away" or "fix it", what if you simply allowed the words to be what they were, without judgment, and then took a tiny physical action to ground yourself?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shame still feeling heavy and you're getting stuck, what's one tiny physical thing you could do to ground yourself in the present moment, like taking one slow breath or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I guess I could press my feet into the floor and take one slow, deliberate breath — maybe roll my shoulders or rub my thumb along my palm to anchor myself. But even picturing that makes this heavy, stupid shame swell up and I clamp down, so I don't know if it would actually help — it just feels pointless sometimes.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations you're trying to create (pressing feet into floor, slow breath, rolling shoulders, rubbing thumb) are a way to anchor yourself in the present moment and create space for the shame to be present. The fact that picturing it makes the shame swell up and you clamp down is a sign that you're still struggling with the shame. Goal: Connect this struggle with the value of acceptance – what if, instead of trying to "make the shame go away" or "fix it", you simply allowed the shame to be what it was, without judgment, and then took a tiny action to ground yourself?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shame swirling up again, what would you say to yourself instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing"? Would you say "I'm feeling this shame right now" or "This shame is here, and I'm going to ground myself in my body"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "I'm feeling this shame right now," and then follow with something like, "This shame is here — I'm going to press my feet into the floor and take one slow breath." But saying that already feels kind of ridiculous and heavy, and I don't know… it just makes me want to clam up.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're catching yourself before you judge the thought as "ridiculous" or "heavy", which is great. That's a sign you're getting closer to acceptance. The fact that it still makes you want to clam up is a reminder that shame is still a powerful trigger for you. Goal: Introduce a tiny tweak – instead of trying to "make the thought work" or "make it feel better", what if you simply acknowledged the discomfort and then took the action anyway?

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the thought "I'm feeling this shame right now" and you're tempted to judge it as "ridiculous", what would you do instead of trying to "fix" the thought? Would you simply say "This thought feels uncomfortable" and then take one small physical action to ground yourself, like pressing your feet into the floor?

Patient: I guess I could try that — say out loud, "This thought feels uncomfortable," and press my feet into the floor and take one slow breath. But even thinking about saying it makes this hot shame rush up and I clam up, so I don't know if it would actually help.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still struggling with the thought itself feeling uncomfortable, which is a common pattern. Instead of trying to "make the thought work", what if you simply focused on the physical sensation of grounding yourself? The act of pressing your feet into the floor and taking a slow breath is a concrete way to create space for the shame to be present, without trying to change the thought.

Goal: Focus on the physical sensation of grounding, rather than trying to "make the thought work".

Therapist Answer:
Instead of saying "This thought feels uncomfortable", what would you say to yourself as you press your feet into the floor and take a slow breath? Would you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, or the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe?

Patient: I guess I'd just notice the weight of my feet on the floor and the slow rise and fall of my chest — name those simple sensations so there's something steady to focus on. But even saying that feels...embarrassing, like I'm admitting I can't handle it, so I don't know if I could actually do it without clamming up.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The act of naming simple sensations is a powerful way to create space for the shame to be present. The struggle to say it without feeling embarrassed is a common pattern, but it's actually a sign that you're willing to confront the discomfort. Goal: Connect the act of naming sensations to the value of curiosity, rather than judgment.

Therapist Answer:
What would you say to yourself if someone else was noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor or the rise and fall of your chest? Would you say "I'm feeling a bit tight in my chest" or "My feet feel heavy"? Notice how that sounds different from saying "This thought feels uncomfortable" – it's more about noticing the physical sensations, rather than judging them.

Patient: I guess I'd say something simple like "my feet feel heavy" or "my chest is tight" — it's less judging and more noticing. But even saying that makes this hot shame flare up, like I've already screwed it up, and I feel stupid admitting it. I don't know... can we not go deeper into that right now?
