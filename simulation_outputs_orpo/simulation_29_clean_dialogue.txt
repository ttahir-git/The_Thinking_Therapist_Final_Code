Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with a recurring pattern of ruminative self-criticism about perceived failures—an odd paradox given that, after struggling academically, I ultimately established a fairly successful career as an accountant. A recent health scare has exacerbated my burnout, and I notice I habitually resort to metacognitive analysis and intellectualization to keep an emotional distance rather than actually experiencing the sadness or anxiety underneath.

Therapist: Your successful career despite struggles with academics suggests that perfectionism might be an underlying value. When you intellectualize your emotions instead of feeling them, what's one area where you feel stuck or unfulfilled in your work that you wish you could connect with more meaningfully?

Patient: I suppose it's the relational dimension — mentoring younger colleagues and conveying the tacit wisdom I've accrued over decades of balancing ledgers — where I feel most arrested. My perfectionistic schema and hypervigilant standards make vulnerability intolerable, so I default to procedural instruction and metric-focused feedback rather than genuine affective engagement, which leaves the work feeling somewhat hollow. I can frame that in clinical language, but I struggle to access and name the underlying sadness about missed opportunities for connection.

Therapist: When you focus on procedural steps, what's one moment when you wish your younger colleagues could experience the satisfaction of learning from you in a more direct way, rather than just following rules?

Patient: There's this recurring scene in my head of walking a junior through a messy year-end reconciliation — not just showing them which boxes to tick, but tracing the narrative in the numbers so they get the craftsmanship: why an adjusting entry matters for the client's cash flow, or how a pattern signals a systemic issue. I want them to have that cognitive-affective "click" and feel proprietorial pride in the work, but I default to metric-driven instruction and metacognitive distancing, which feels like I'm depriving them of something substantive. I can articulate the melancholic undertone of that loss pretty readily, but actually sitting with the sadness about missed mentorship is where I get stuck.

Therapist: When you imagine walking that junior through the reconciliation, what's one small moment where you'd want to see the numbers come alive with meaning, not just as a series of boxes to check?

Patient: I'd want that tiny instant when a junior's brow lifts and they say, "Oh — I see why that accrual mattered," connecting the abstract entry to a concrete business consequence; that spontaneous, almost childlike recognition is the cognitive-affective synthesis I crave to witness. I can elaborate on the pedagogical mechanics and why that moment fosters ownership, but I notice I'm hedging — describing the yearning rather than actually sitting with the quiet ache it brings when it doesn't happen.

Therapist: What's one tiny physical sensation in your body that arises when you think about that junior's brow lifting and saying, "Oh — I see why that accrual mattered"?

Patient: It's a brief tightening just below my breastbone — like a small hitch in my breath that makes my shoulders pull up for a second. I almost instantly reinterpret it as anxious arousal or anticipatory grief — a tidy metacognitive label — which is exactly how I avoid sitting with whatever sadness or regret that sensation might actually signal.

Therapist: Notice that sensation just below your breastbone without adding any words to it — just let it be, for one breath, without trying to change it into anxious arousal or anticipatory grief.

Patient: I tried to do that — I took a breath and there it was: that small constriction under the breastbone and a shallower inhalation, nothing dramatic, just tight and brief. Almost immediately my mind furnished a diagnostic — "anxious arousal," "anticipatory grief" — and I found myself cataloguing it instead of letting it be. I'm aware of my proclivity to intellectualize as a defensive maneuver, and honestly I'm finding it hard to just sit with the sensation; can we slow down so I can try again without leaping to labels?

Therapist: Let's pause for one more breath together. Notice the sensation just below your breastbone: the small constriction, the shallower inhalation... just that. No words, no judgment, just the sensation as it is, for one more breath.

Patient: I did that — I breathed in and the constriction eased a little but stayed, a tight, hollow feeling just under the breastbone. Almost immediately my mind offered up interpretations — “relinquished opportunities,” “anticipatory grief” — which is my reflexive defense. Can we slow down so I can try to hold it without tagging it? I'm not confident I can, but I'd like to try.

Therapist: Let's take one tiny step: I'll count down with you from 5 to 1, and when I reach 1, you'll hold the sensation for just one second before I ask the next question. Ready?

Patient: Ready. I held it — the tightness eased a fraction on that one-second pause, then my mind immediately began narrativizing it as "loss" and "missed mentorship" to keep me from actually feeling anything. Can we try that again with a slightly longer hold, maybe two seconds? I'm worried I'll just revert to analysis if we rush.

Therapist: Let's try a 2-second pause this time. I'll count down with you: 5... 4... 3... 2... Hold the sensation just for 2 seconds before I ask the next question. When you're ready, we'll see how it goes.

Patient: I did it — held it for the two seconds. The tightness under my breastbone eased a bit but then my mind immediately reconstituted it as "loss" or "missed mentorship" and I slipped back into analysis instead of actually feeling anything. Can we try a slightly longer hold, maybe four seconds, and could you guide my breath a bit more slowly? I'm afraid I'll just narrativize again if we rush.

Therapist: Let's try a 4-second pause this time. I'll guide your breath slowly: Breathe in... (pause)...through your nose... hold... (pause)...your breath... (pause)...and exhale... (pause)...slowly... Hold the sensation just for 4 seconds before I ask the next question. When you're ready, we'll see how it goes.

Patient: I did the four seconds — the tightness under my breastbone loosened marginally, then my mind immediately staged a full metacognitive commentary, narrativizing it as "loss," "missed mentorship," even "existential inadequacy." It's easier, as always, to deploy explanatory heuristics than to actually inhabit the feeling; can we try six seconds with a slower count? I'm not confident I can hold it, but I want to attempt it.

Therapist: Let's try a 6-second pause this time. I'll guide your breath very slowly: Breathe in... (pause)...count to 1... hold... (pause)...count to 2... hold... (pause)...count to 3... hold... (pause)...count to 4... hold... (pause)...count to 5... hold... (pause)...count to 6... Hold the sensation just for 6 seconds before I ask the next question. Remember, it's just the sensation itself, without words or judgment.

Patient: I did it — six seconds. The tightness gradually thinned to a hollow, then my internal commentator immediately began reconciling it into tidy ledger-like entries: "not enough," "missed mentorship," "perfectionism failed again" — all explanatory bookkeeping instead of feeling. I'm finding it hard to keep it wordless; can we continue with a few slow breaths and you prompt me to notice any raw emotion (not the story) after each exhale?

Therapist: Let's continue with slow breaths. As you exhale, I want you to notice the raw emotion that comes up, not the story your mind is telling you. Just the feeling. After you exhale, I'll ask: What's the weight of that feeling, even if it's just a tiny fraction of what you're used to?

Patient: It feels like a small, flat weight — a thumb-sized pebble pressing under my breastbone, maybe the equivalent of half a pound if I had to quantify it — enough to notice on the inhale and make my shoulders hitch. There's a dull sorrow in it, faint and persistent, but my reflex is to drape a metacognitive overlay on top of it and talk about causes instead of sinking into the feeling. Can we keep breathing slowly and I'll try to stay with that pebble without immediately labeling it?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one more breath. As you inhale, notice the pebble pressing under your breastbone. Hold it in your attention for one second... (pause)...and when you exhale, notice how the dull sorrow feels, without adding any words or judgment. Just the sensation.

Patient: On the exhale I felt the pebble — a dull, hollow sorrow under my breastbone, a low somatic ache that tightens my shoulders for a beat. Almost immediately my mind reflexively renamed it "melancholic residue" or "existential bookkeeping" to keep distance; I don't want to bail, though — can we keep breathing and hold it a bit longer so I can try to actually sit with it?

Therapist: Let's breathe slowly and hold the sensation for 3... (pause)...2... (pause)...1... Hold the dull sorrow under your breastbone for 3 seconds. Don't try to label it or push it away; just stay with the feeling, no matter how small it is.

Patient: I held it for the three seconds — the pebble felt denser, a hollow pressure under my breastbone with a hot, prickling shame threaded through it that made my face feel flushed. Predictably, my intellect immediately tried to reconcile it — cataloguing causes and rehearsing past failings — which only amplified my frustration, like some internal audit turning emotive pain into a list of deficiencies. I don't want to bail into analysis, but that shame makes me clench and retreat; can we keep breathing slowly and you help anchor me in the body so I can try to stay with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's breathe slowly and gently. Notice the physical sensation of the hollow pressure under your breastbone, and the flush of heat in your face. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Imagine it's a gentle, slow wave washing over your chest, starting from the bottom and rising up. With each exhale, imagine any tension or tightness releasing a little bit more. Can you focus on the sensation of your breath, just beneath your chest, for one more beat?

Patient: I did — I let the breath wash under my chest and the pebble eased a hair, but the hot shame stayed, a prickling flush across my face and a tight clench in my jaw. My reflex is to turn it into an internal audit — cataloguing past failings — which makes me angry and frustrated at myself. Can we keep with a few more slow, guided breaths and have you prompt me after each exhale to notice one raw feeling word? I'm worried I'll intellectualize, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's breathe slowly and gently. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, starting from the bottom and rising up. With each exhale, notice one raw feeling word: What's the single word that describes the sensation of shame right now, without judgment?

Patient: Mortification — a hot, prickling mortification that makes my face flush and my jaw clench, and then my reflexive mind immediately begins to turn it into an internal audit rather than letting it simply be.

Therapist: Notice that mortification word: Mortification. Hold it for one moment, without judgment or analysis. Just the feeling: "Mortification." Now, take one slow breath in, and when you exhale, notice what happens to the physical sensation of the flush and the clench in your jaw.

Patient: On the exhale the flush eased a fraction — the heat cooled a little and my jaw unclenched for a beat — but then my mind immediately began an internal audit, reinterpreting the relief as temporary and reconciling it into evidence of incompetence. That reflexive reframing fuels a prickly mortification and a flush of frustration at myself for always turning feeling into bookkeeping. Can we keep going with another slow breath and you prompt me after the exhale to name whatever single raw sensation remains?

Therapist: Take one slow, gentle breath in, and when you exhale, notice what's left of the physical sensation. What's the one raw sensation that's still present, without any thoughts or labels?

Patient: A residual tightness in my throat and a shallow, prickling heat across my face — concrete, physical, and carrying a bitter undercurrent of shame and frustration that I can't quite separate from the sensation. Even as I name it, my mind's already drafting an audit of causes and consequences, which makes me frustrated at myself for not just feeling it.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your throat and on your face: the tightness and the prickling heat. Hold it for one moment, without judgment or analysis. Just the sensation. As you exhale, imagine that sensation is a tiny, small part of you, separate from the thoughts and the emotions. Can you simply be with it, without trying to fix it or change it?

Patient: I'm trying to sit with it — the throat feels like a tight band and the prickling heat on my face is still there, a small, hot knot that follows my pulse. My mind, predictably, starts running an internal audit of causes and consequences which only makes me more anxious and a bit jittery. I want to stay with the sensation, but I'm distracted and worried I'll slip into analysis; could you keep guiding my breath and prompt me after each exhale to name one raw sensation word so I have something steady to hold onto?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation in your throat: the tight band. Hold that sensation for one moment... (pause) Now, exhale slowly, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation on your face: the small, hot knot that follows your pulse. Hold that sensation for one moment...

Patient: On the exhale the throat-band felt tighter for a moment and the hot knot on my face pulsed with my heartbeat — a sharp, prickling heat that made my shoulders hitch. Immediately my mind tried to translate it into an audit — causes, consequences — which only amplified a flush of shame and a prickly frustration, and now I'm more anxious and distracted than before, like my attention is skittering. I want to stay with it, but I'm jittery and keep drifting into analysis; could you keep guiding the breath slowly and after each exhale prompt me with a single word to name the raw sensation so I have something small and steady to focus on?

Therapist: Take a slow, gentle breath in... (pause) Exhale slowly, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation in your shoulders: what's the single word that describes the sharp, prickling feeling?

Patient: "Prickling."

Prickling — and of course my mind immediately turns it into an audit of culpability, which only heightens the shame and makes me jittery and distracted; I want to stay with it but I'm already inventing explanations.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your shoulders: the prickling. Just the sensation. No thoughts, no analysis. Hold it for one moment...

Patient: I held it for a moment — the prickling in my shoulders is sharp and electric, like tiny pins, and it makes my hands feel a bit trembly. Predictably my mind immediately starts an internal audit and a rush of shame, which makes me jittery and distracts me; could you keep guiding the breath and prompt me after each exhale with a single-syllable word to name the sensation so I have something small to anchor to?

Therapist: Take a slow breath in... (pause) Exhale slowly, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation in your hands: what's the single word that describes the trembly feeling?

Patient: "Tremor." 

Tremor — that involuntary shaking in my hands, and almost immediately my mind launches an internal audit, turning it into proof of inadequacy; it stokes a hot shame and makes me jittery and distractible, so I'm struggling to stay present.

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your hands: the tremor. Just the tremor. No thoughts, no analysis. Hold it for one moment...

Patient: I held it — the tremor is a low, irregular shaking in my fingertips, a hollow flutter that makes my palms feel light and a bit unsteady. Almost instantly my mind launches an internal audit — cataloguing culpability and past missteps — which stokes a hot shame and leaves me jittery and distractible. I can try to stay with it, but could you prompt me after the next exhale with a single-syllable anchor so I have something small to cling to?

Therapist: Take a slow breath in... (pause) Exhale slowly, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation in your palms: what's the single word that describes the light feeling?

Patient: Light.

Light — a thin, airy sensation in my palms, and predictably my mind immediately recasts it as evidence of losing control, which makes me jumpy and distracted; could you keep guiding my breath and prompt me with another single-syllable anchor so I have something steady to hold onto?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your palms: flat. Just the flatness, no thoughts, no analysis.

Patient: It's flat — a thin, dull numbness across my palms, like the surface of a page. My reflex is to slap a label on it ("numbness") and run an internal audit, which only makes me hotter, jitterier, and a bit ashamed. Could you prompt me after the next exhale with a single-syllable anchor like "hold" or "stay"? I want the scaffold — I'm distracted and need something small to cling to.
