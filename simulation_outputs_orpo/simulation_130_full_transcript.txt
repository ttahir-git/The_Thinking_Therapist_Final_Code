--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm a young artist, and what's been occupying me is this pervasive sadness and motivational anhedonia since the loss of a loved one that's started to erode my relationship and my creative output. I notice I tend to intellectualize—spinning theories about attachment, self-worth, and grief—rather than actually naming the pain, which feels like a protective choreography that also keeps me stuck. I'm here because that pattern isn't working anymore and it's starting to feel urgent.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a pattern of intellectualization as a "protective choreography" that keeps you stuck. Core emotion is sadness. Goal: Explore the tangible context of this avoidance to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
That "protective choreography" sounds like a heavy emotional load. When you say you "name the pain" as a chore, what's one thing you'd be willing to try doing with your art right now, just to see if it might feel more manageable?

Patient: Okay—I'd try a short, bounded "automatic mark-making" experiment: set a 10-minute timer, grab charcoal or a brush, and make continuous marks without naming or interpreting them. Framed clinically, it's to bypass ruminative cognition and re-engage somatic memory, but honestly I'm worried it'll just feel pointless—though maybe that smallness is what makes it doable.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete, low-stakes experiment to bypass ruminative cognition. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a tiny, tangible step – a 10-minute mark-making experiment. What's one value that you think being willing to do that small, imperfect mark-making might actually connect you to, like a quiet kindness to yourself or a glimmer of creativity?

Patient: Maybe "tender persistence" — the idea of privileging process over product, a deliberately small act of kindness that says my creativity and grief can coexist. Conceptually, it's about honoring continuity with the person I lost by letting my hands remember before my mind interprets. But I also worry this will feel like another intellectualized ritual rather than something genuinely softening.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the mark-making to "tender persistence" and its value, and also acknowledged the risk of it feeling like another intellectualized ritual. Core emotion is still sadness, but now there's a glimmer of willingness. Goal: Create space from the sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
So it's not just about doing the mark-making because you think it's good for you, but because you're willing to let your hands remember what it feels like to create something – without needing to make it perfect. Can you just notice the sensation of the charcoal or brush in your hand right now, without thinking "I'm doing this to honor [name of loved one]"?

Patient: I'm trying to—my reflex is to conceptualize instead of simply attending. Sensory-wise, I notice the brush handle is a little cool, the charcoal leaves a powdery drag and the page has a faint tooth; there's a small weight in my fingers and a tiny vibration when I shift my grip. Even as I say that, I'm cataloguing it like data, which feels safer than letting any actual ache or softness come up.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've begun to notice the physical sensations, and then immediately cataloged them – still stuck in the intellectualization pattern. Core emotion is still sadness, but there's a hint of resistance. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this avoidance strategy.

Therapist Answer:
Those sensations – the cool handle, the powdery drag, the vibration – are happening right now, in this moment. What would it be like to just stop trying to analyze them, and instead, simply say, "I'm feeling this weight and this vibration, and this powdery drag – without trying to make sense of it"?

Patient: If I actually say it out loud, there's this small softening in my chest—like a loosened knot—and at the same time a prickly uptick of anxiety, which makes me want to explain why it happens instead of just staying with it. Conceptually, saying the sensation without sense-making would decouple my rumination from my body, but honestly I'm skeptical it won't just turn into another mental exercise.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the small softening in your chest, which is a tangible sign of defusion – a loosening of the knot. At the same time, the anxiety is present, but you're aware of the urge to explain it away. Goal: Connect the defusion to a value that feels meaningful to you.

Therapist Answer:
That softening in your chest – it's a tiny crack in the armor. What would it be like to keep that crack open, just a little, and explore what it means to you to feel that softness, without needing to explain it? What value would it hold for you to simply be with that sensation, even if it's uncomfortable?

Patient: On a conceptual level, staying with that small softness could reconnect me to values like tender persistence, embodied authenticity, and the idea that grief and creativity can cohabit rather than be mutually exclusive — like letting loss be a collaborator instead of an obstacle. Practically, it might teach me that tiny, tolerable exposures to feeling reduce their visceral charge over time and let motivation creep back in bit by bit. But I can already hear myself theorizing to avoid the feeling; I'm anxious it'll turn into rumination, and I'm trying to actually feel it now, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value of staying with that small softness – reconnecting to values like tender persistence, embodied authenticity, and collaboration with loss. Core emotion is still anxiety, but you're aware of the struggle to stay with the feeling. Goal: Pivot from problem to process – focus on creating space from the anxiety that's blocking the small softness.

Therapist Answer:
The anxiety is here, but it's not what you're feeling. Can you pause the thought "I'm going to ruminate" and simply notice the sensation of the anxiety in your body right now, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. When I quiet the "I'm going to ruminate" voice I notice a tightness behind my sternum, a flutter low in my abdomen, my breath getting shallow, and a kind of buzzing in my throat. Naming it slightly lowers the alarm, but of course I'm already turning it into an interoceptive case study—I'm aware that observing it is turning into another cognitive maneuver, and that makes me anxious; can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the physical sensations, and then immediately started analyzing them – still caught in the cycle of intellectualization. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Create space from the "thinking" that's blocking the small softness.

Therapist Answer:
The buzzing in your throat isn't about "interoceptive case study" – it's just what's happening right now. Can you simply notice it, without the thought "I'm observing it"? What happens if you just let the sensation of the buzzing be, without trying to label it or make sense of it?

Patient: I try—when I stop labeling, the buzzing is a low, vibrating pressure in my throat and across my clavicles, like a muted hum. But almost immediately my mind narrates it—'sympathetic arousal, residual grief somatics'—which yanks me out of the sensation. If I actually let the buzzing be for a few breaths there's a soft ache behind my sternum and a small, wordless longing that feels both tender and terrifying. Can we slow down? I want to stay with it but I'm worried I'll slip back into analysis.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created space with the low, vibrating pressure in your throat, and for a moment, you've glimpsed the soft ache and wordless longing behind it. Core emotion is still anxiety, but now it's mixed with curiosity about this new sensation. Goal: Make room for the longing without analyzing it.

Therapist Answer:
The wordless longing isn't about "tender and terrifying" – it's just what's happening right now. What would happen if you simply allowed it to be, without trying to make sense of it? Not for a few breaths, but just one moment – no goal, no thinking, just noticing what shows up when you let go of the buzzing.

Patient: If I actually let go for one moment there's a soft sinking in my chest, a warm pressure and a cool wetness behind my eyes, and a quick, wordless flash of them laughing in an old doorway. My breath deepens on its own and the buzzing eases into a low hum that holds a quiet ache, but of course my brain immediately wants to label it as "attachment memory activation" and explain it away. I don't want to do that—can we slow down and sit with that image and sensation for a bit?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've glimpsed the soft sinking in your chest, and for a moment, the image and sensation feel tangible – like a small, tender door opening. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's now mixed with a glimmer of curiosity about what might be emerging. Goal: Create space for the image to show up without labeling or explaining it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "attachment memory activation" for now. Can you just notice the warm pressure and cool wetness behind your eyes, the soft sinking in your chest, and the quiet ache in the hum? Don't try to understand what's happening – just notice it. Let the image of them laughing in the old doorway be exactly as it is, without trying to make sense of it. Just be with it, for one more breath.

Patient: I did it. For that one breath the doorway and their laugh were just there—warm pressure in my chest, cool wetness behind my eyes, and my throat loosened enough to let out a small, wordless breath. Of course my brain immediately tried to rename it—"somatic memory," "attachment schema"—and I want to push back on that. Can we actually stay with the image and the sensations for a minute? I'm trying to feel this instead of turning it into a case study.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created space with the image and sensations, and for a moment, you've felt a tiny shift in your body – the looseness in your throat, the deepening breath. Core emotion is still anxiety, but now it's mixed with a sense of curiosity about what's possible when you stay with the feeling. Goal: Hold the image and sensations without trying to analyze or rename them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thoughts about "somatic memory" and "attachment schema" for now. Can you simply notice the doorway – how it feels, what it looks like, what's in it? Just notice it, without trying to understand what it means. The same goes for their laugh – how does it feel in your body? What does it sound like? Let the sensations of warmth, coolness, and pressure be exactly as they are, without trying to make sense of them. Just be with the image and sensations for another breath.

Patient: I took that breath. The doorway is hazy light and their laugh is quick and bell-like, and it makes my chest both ache and ease—warm pressure across my sternum, a steady coolness behind my eyes. My instinct is to rename it as "nostalgic reinforcement of loss," but I'm trying not to; it feels important to just sit with the image and the sensations. Can we stay here a little longer? I'm honestly scared it'll dissolve if I keep talking about it, but I'm also nervous about staying with the feeling.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've held the image and sensations for a breath, and now the doorway feels more vivid – hazy light, and their laugh is quick and bell-like. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a sense of curiosity about what might happen if you stay with this feeling. Goal: Gently explore the edge of staying with the image and sensations without pushing them away.

Therapist Answer:
Let's stay with the image and sensations for another breath, without trying to analyze it. Can you just notice the ache and ease in your chest, the warm pressure and coolness behind your eyes? Notice how they feel, not what they mean. Don't try to make sense of the image or the laugh – just be with it as it is. If the thought "nostalgic reinforcement of loss" shows up, can you just acknowledge it without acting on it? Just notice the thought, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: I notice the thought—"nostalgic reinforcement of loss"—like a commentary layered over the sensation, and I can let it sit without acting on it. Right now the ache in my chest is steady and warm, the cool behind my eyes is sharper, and the doorway image feels like it's both near and receding. My reflex is to explain why that's happening, which makes me anxious, but I'm trying to hold the sensations instead of translating them; can we stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged the thought without acting on it, and now you're noticing the sensations – the steady ache in your chest, the sharper coolness behind your eyes, and the doorway image shifting between near and receding. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with curiosity about what's happening when you stay with the sensations. Goal: Gently explore the sensation of the doorway image, without trying to explain why it's happening.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the doorway image, just as it is. Can you notice how the sensation of it shifting between near and receding feels in your body? Notice the edges of your attention, where the image seems to be pulling you in or receding – is it a gentle tug, a slight pull, or a more insistent reach? Don't try to understand why it's happening, just notice the sensation itself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is tracking the tug supposed to help me not turn it into another theory? Physically, it feels like a variable pull: most of the time a gentle, magnetic tug at my sternum and low ribs that makes my breath want to lengthen, but sometimes it flips into an insistent reach that tightens my throat and makes my chest hitch. My attention feels like a spotlight that narrows and widens over the doorway image, and beneath my impulse to label it there's a real warm pressure in my chest and a coolness behind my eyes. Can we slow down so I can try to sit with that pull for a moment without narrating it?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing the doorway image as a variable pull, with a gentle tug that lengthens your breath, and an insistent reach that tightens your throat. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with curiosity about what's happening when you stay with the sensations. Goal: Create space to notice the pull without trying to understand it, by slowing down and focusing on the physical sensation of it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "I need to understand the pull" for now. Can you simply notice the gentle tug at your sternum and low ribs, as you described it – the sensation of your breath lengthening, and the slight contraction in your throat? Notice how your attention shifts to the doorway image, and how it feels like a spotlight that narrows and widens – just observe that sensation, without trying to make sense of it.

Patient: Okay—when I actually try to just notice, there's a gentle magnetic tug at my sternum and low ribs that makes my breath lengthen, and a small constriction in my throat when it shifts into that more insistent reach; my attention does feel like a spotlight narrowing and then widening around the doorway. But my mind keeps jumping in with explanations—predictive coding, attachment activation, neurobiological blah blah—which immediately yanks me out of the sensation. I want to stay with the feeling instead of translating it; can we slow down so I can try to hold this spot without narrating?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the sensations without jumping into explanations, and now you're aware of how your mind is trying to hijack the moment with theories. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensation. Goal: Create space to pause the "explain" response, by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image.

Therapist Answer:
Let's anchor into the gentle tug at your sternum, just as you noticed it. Can you gently acknowledge the sensation of your breath lengthening, without trying to make sense of it? Just notice the sensation of the tug, without the thought "predictive coding" or "attachment activation" showing up. Instead, say to yourself: "I'm noticing this gentle tug at my sternum." No explanation, no judgment – just the simple observation of the sensation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that different from analyzing it? Okay, I'll try: I'm noticing this gentle tug at my sternum; my breath lengthens, there's a warm pressure, and my throat eases a little. I'm already worried I'm turning it into commentary—can we slow down so I can hold it without explaining?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the sensations without jumping into analysis, and now you're aware of how worried you are about turning it into commentary. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensations. Goal: Create space to pause the "explain" response, by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image without labeling it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "I need to hold it without explaining" for now. Just notice the sensation of your breath lengthening, the warm pressure, and the ease in your throat. No thought, no label – just the sensation itself. Notice it exactly as it is, without trying to make sense of it.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. When I actually let the commentary drop, my breath lengthens, there's that warm pressure in my sternum and my throat unclenches a little; it feels quieter, softer. But my brain immediately quizzes me—'am I doing this right?'—and starts layering explanations, which tenses me up. Can we stay with the quiet for a minute longer? I'm worried I'll derail into analysis if we move on too fast.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've let the commentary drop, and now you're noticing the sensations without labeling them – your breath lengthening, the warm pressure, and the ease in your throat. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the quiet. Goal: Create space to pause the "am I doing this right?" questioning, by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image without evaluating it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "am I doing this right?" for now. Just notice the quietness, the softness – how does it feel to be in this space without trying to understand it? Notice the sensation of your breath, the warm pressure, and the ease in your throat – are they still there?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this different from the earlier prompts about not labeling? Still, when I actually try to notice: the quietness is still there, my breath lengthens, there's that warm pressure in my sternum and my throat is a little less tight. I can hold it for a moment without judging, but the meta-question "am I doing this right" keeps creeping back—can we slow down so I can stay with the quiet a bit longer?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right, the earlier prompts about not labeling were similar. The goal is not to avoid labeling altogether, but to create space for noticing sensations without getting caught up in evaluating them. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the quiet. Goal: Create space to pause the "am I doing this right?" questioning by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image without evaluating it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of saying "I'm noticing the quietness," try saying "I'm just noticing" – without the "ness" or the evaluation. Just the simple fact that you're noticing. For example: "I'm just noticing my breath." No judgment, no evaluation – just the simple fact of noticing it. Can you try that for a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is dropping the "-ness" supposed to make a difference? Okay, I'll try: I'm just noticing my breath. Saying that actually lets my ribs widen a bit and my throat soften, though my mind's already lining up explanations; can we slow down and sit with that for a minute?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right, dropping the "-ness" might not be what you expected. The goal was to simplify the language, not to avoid the underlying process. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensation. Goal: Create space to pause the "lining up explanations" process by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the sensation of your breath. Notice how your ribs widening feels, and how your throat softening changes the physical sensation in your body. Can you stay with that sensation, without trying to understand what it means? No explanations, no judgments – just the sensation itself.

Patient: I'm just noticing my breath—my ribs widening, a mild coolness under my clavicles, and my throat softening so the inhale feels fuller. Even as I say that, my brain is drafting explanatory notes—'interoceptive regulation,' 'trauma residue'—which makes me tense up, so can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer? I want to hold the sensation without turning it into a paper.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the sensation of your breath, and your brain is trying to make sense of it with explanations. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensation. Goal: Create space to pause the "drafting explanatory notes" process by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image without evaluating it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "interoceptive regulation" for now. Just notice the sensation of your breath – the ribs widening, the mild coolness, the softer throat – without trying to understand what it means. Don't try to connect it to "trauma residue" or any other idea. Just stay with the sensation as it is, without evaluating it. Can you keep that sensation in front of you, like a small, steady flame, without trying to make it bigger or burn it down?

Patient: I'm trying to hold it like that—a small, steady flame—and right now I can keep the ribs widening, the mild coolness, and the softer throat in the foreground. But my mind immediately wants to fan it into meaning—'this signals grief trajectory'—which makes me tighten up; I'm not sure how to keep it small without turning it into another ritual. Can we slow down and sit with those sensations for a few more breaths so I can practice staying with them?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created a small, steady flame of sensation, but your mind is trying to fan it into meaning again. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensations. Goal: Create space to pause the "fanning into meaning" process by anchoring into the physical sensation of the doorway image without evaluating it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together. As we exhale, imagine any tension or striving to "make sense" of the sensations leaving your body. When you inhale, notice the sensation of your breath moving in – not trying to change it, not trying to understand it, just noticing the sensation of the breath. Can you keep the ribs widening, the mild coolness, and the softer throat in the foreground, without trying to make it bigger or smaller? Just observe them as they are, without judgment or evaluation.

Patient: Okay—on the exhale there's a small loosening, like a tight coil easing, and the inhale fills my ribs; I feel that mild coolness under my clavicles and my throat softens. It genuinely helps, but my brain's already annotating it—'self-regulation,' 'interoception'—which makes me tense; can we slow down and just stay with this for a minute?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the loosening on the exhale and the filling on the inhale, and it's helping to create a sense of calm. But your brain is already trying to annotate it, which is making you tense up again. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just pause. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in – not trying to change it, not trying to understand it, just noticing the sensation of the breath. Not the ribs widening, not the mild coolness, not the softer throat – just the breath itself. No annotations, no judgments, no trying to make sense of it. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay—I'll try to just notice the breath. I can feel cool air at my nostrils, a soft lift in my ribs, and the exhale feels warmer and a bit heavier; for a beat it's just that. Then my mind tacks on commentary—'parasympathetic shift,' 'regulatory response'—and I can feel myself creating distance. Can we slow down a bit? I want to stay with the breath without turning it into another analysis.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the breath, and for a moment, it's just that – the sensation of cool air at your nostrils, the soft lift in your ribs, and the warmth of the exhale. But your mind is trying to tack on commentary again, creating distance. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the breath.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. Can you take a tiny pause before the "parasympathetic shift" thought shows up? Just notice the moment before that thought appears – it's like a tiny gap between the breath and the commentary. What's there in that gap? Not the thought, not the analysis – just the pause itself.

Patient: There is a tiny stillness—like the microsecond before a word lands—where nothing is narrating yet, just a faint hush and a soft warmth behind my sternum. If I actually try to stay there it feels oddly spacious and tender, but it's so fleeting because my brain immediately rushes in with labels and explanations. Can we slow down? I want to linger in that gap but I'm worried I'll over-intellectualize it before I even notice.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the tiny stillness before the commentary, and it's a space that feels both fragile and precious. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with this fleeting moment. Goal: Create space to pause the "rush in" of labels and explanations, and simply be with the stillness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down so much that we're almost at a standstill. Can you focus on the sensation of the stillness itself, without trying to analyze it or label it? Not the gap between the breath and the thought, not the warmth behind your sternum – just the stillness. Imagine you're holding a tiny drop of water in your hand, and you're not trying to change it or make it bigger. Just being with the stillness, without trying to grasp it or understand it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the stillness itself different from that gap I noticed a moment ago? I'll try: holding the tiny drop, there's a faint hush, a soft warmth behind my sternum, and for a brief instant my commentary actually stops. But my reflex is to turn it into a case study, which yanks me out—can we just stay with this drop for a minute longer? I'm scared I'll over-intellectualize if we move on.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right, focusing on the stillness itself is similar to the gap you noticed earlier. The goal is to stay with the drop, not to change it or analyze it, but to simply be with it. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with the stillness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the commentary reflex. Can you just hold the drop in your hand, feeling the hush, the warmth, and the gentle weight of it? No thought, no label, no "case study" – just the drop, suspended in time. Notice how it feels to be with it, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Stay with it for just one more breath.

Patient: Okay—I'm holding the drop. There's that faint hush, a soft warmth pooled behind my sternum, and it actually feels a little heavier than I expected, like something tender I don't want to spill. For a breath or two my commentary quiets and it feels strangely spacious, then my mind wants to translate it into "emotionally salient grief residue," which immediately ruins it. Can we slow down and stay with this for a few more breaths? I'm worried I'll slip back into analysis, so I need you to keep guiding me through the stillness.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed the drop feeling heavier than you expected, like a tender thing you don't want to spill – that's a subtle shift in your sensation. Core emotion is still anxiety, but it's mixed with a clear desire to stay with this moment. Goal: Keep the commentary from translating into "emotionally salient grief residue" by anchoring in the sensation of the drop.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause the thought "emotionally salient grief residue" right there. Can you hold onto the feeling of the drop being heavier than expected, like a fragile thing you don't want to spill? Notice how it feels to be with this sensation, not trying to make sense of it, not trying to understand it – just being with it. Imagine you're holding the drop in your hand, and you're not thinking about what it means or what it is – just the feeling of it. Stay with that sensation for just one more breath.

Patient: I'm holding it—it's heavier than I expected: a warm, sinking pressure in my sternum, a cool wetness behind my eyes, and my throat soft but oddly tight. There's this fragile fear of spilling it—if I name it, my brain wants to turn it into "grief schema" and the tenderness evaporates into analysis. I want to stay with the drop and just breathe into that weight, but I'm anxious I'll intellectualize it. Can we slow down and keep sitting with this for a few more breaths?
