Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — since the move it feels like my whole sense of self is just being a teacher and I don't know what else matters to me. It's made my anxiety worse, and I guess I don't know where to begin figuring that out.

Therapist: When you say you feel stuck as a teacher, what's one thing you used to enjoy about teaching that you've let go of since the move, or something you wish you had time for but can't fit in?

Patient: I used to run an after-school writing club — seeing the kids light up over their own stories felt really meaningful. I guess since the move I haven't had the time or energy to keep it up. I don't know, thinking about it makes me feel guilty and kind of stuck.

Therapist: So when you think about the kids' stories, what's the value that the writing club brought to them, beyond just the activity itself – what did it mean to them that you took the time to listen and support their writing?

Patient: I think it made them feel seen — like their words mattered and someone was paying attention. I guess it gave them a bit of confidence and a place to try things without being judged. I don't know, I feel awkward saying that out loud.

Therapist: It sounds like those moments with the kids mattered deeply to you. What if, instead of trying to revive the after-school club, you started small – could you write one of those kids a letter or send them a note with a favorite story from the club, just to remind them of that feeling of being seen?

Patient: I guess that could be nice, but I don't know — it feels awkward to reach out and I don't even have their addresses since the move. I'm worried it might seem performative or like I'm clinging to the past. I don't know, can we maybe talk about tiny ways to reconnect that don't feel like a big commitment?

Therapist: What if, instead of reaching out to the kids, you simply take a few minutes each day this week to write down one thing that felt meaningful about the writing club – a word, a memory, a feeling? Just writing it down, without needing to do anything else, would be a tiny act of connection to that experience.

Patient: I could try that. I guess it feels a bit awkward — I don't know if I'll stick with it or if it'll just feel forced. Maybe one word or a single short sentence each day would be doable. Could you help me think of a simple prompt so I don't overthink it?

Therapist: What if your daily prompt was just: "What one thing from the writing club made me feel most alive today?" – just one word, one sentence, no explanation needed.

Patient: I guess that sounds simple enough — one word or a short sentence each day could be doable. I don't know, I'm worried I'll overthink it or forget, but maybe if I do it first thing in the morning it won't feel like a big deal. Could we... could you help me pick a place to keep those notes so they don't get lost?

Therapist: What if you kept your daily notes on a small sticky note or in a tiny notebook that you already have with you, like a travel journal? That way, it's already in a place you don't need to think about, and you can just jot down your one word or sentence whenever you wake up.

Patient: That might actually work — I have a small spiral notebook I brought with me that’s mostly empty. I guess I could leave it on my bedside table so I see it first thing in the morning. I don't know, it still feels a bit awkward, but I'll try not to make it a big production.

Therapist: It's okay that it still feels a bit awkward – that's what's making it an act of kindness to show up to it anyway. When you leave the notebook on your bedside table tomorrow morning, what will you say to yourself as you pick it up?

Patient: I'll probably tell myself, "Just one word — that's enough, no pressure." I guess keeping it that simple might stop me from overthinking. I don't know, it still feels a bit awkward, but maybe that little phrase will help.

Therapist: That phrase – "Just one word" – feels like a small but powerful anchor. When you use it tomorrow morning, what will you do if your mind starts to wander or you feel resistance?

Patient: I guess I'd try to notice it and then take a breath and remind myself, "just one word" — and write the first thing that comes to mind, even if it feels silly. I don't know, if I keep drifting I might close the notebook and try again later in the day instead of forcing it. I'm worried I'll just avoid it, though, and that makes me feel… stuck.

Therapist: What if instead of trying to avoid it, you saw closing the notebook as a chance to come back to it when you're feeling more present – like after a short walk or a cup of coffee? Would that small pause give you the space to approach it with kindness, rather than forcing it?

Patient: I guess that could help — a short walk or coffee might make it feel less pressured. I don't know, I'm worried I'll just keep putting it off and tell myself I'm coming back later and then never do. Could we... think of a tiny, non-judgmental reminder I could use if that happens? I don't know what that would look like.

Therapist: What if when you think "I'll just come back later," you simply say to yourself: "That's okay, I'll try again later" – without adding any judgment or pressure? Just that simple acknowledgment that you're willing to try again, no matter what.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I guess saying "that's okay, I'll try again later" sounds comforting in theory, but I don't know, it just feels like another thing to fail at and then I'll feel worse. Maybe if I could actually let myself mean it, it might take some pressure off, but I don't know how to get to that place.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to make the phrase work for you, you actually tried it out as a tiny experiment – without expecting anything to change or "work"? Just say to yourself: "That's okay, I'll try again later" – without judgment, without expectation, without trying to "fix" it. What would happen in your body and mind if you let that one sentence just be, without trying to analyze it or make it mean something?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it feels a bit abstract. I guess if I actually let the sentence be, maybe my shoulders would drop a little and that tight knot in my chest might loosen, or maybe nothing would happen and I'd just notice the worry without beating myself up about it. I don't know, it still feels like one more thing I could fail at — how would I actually try that without turning it into another pressure?

Therapist: Let's try to anchor it in your physical tension – the knot in your chest. When you say "that's okay, I'll try again later", what physical sensation does that phrase trigger in your body right now? Is it a slight relaxation, a slight softening of the knot, or still the same tightness? Try to notice that exact sensation – without trying to change it or make it work – and let that be the only focus for 5 seconds.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow, but I'll try. When I focus on it for a few seconds it's a dull tightness — maybe a tiny softening, like something loosening just under my sternum. I guess if I just notice it without pushing, it eases a bit, but I can't hold it long before my mind drifts. Could you... guide me through it slowly? I don't know, it's hard to stay with.

Therapist: Let's start with just 5 seconds. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, notice it exactly – without trying to change it, without trying to breathe it away, just observe it. Say to yourself: "This is the tightness" – just one word, just one simple sentence. As you say it, notice how it feels to focus on that one word, just for a count of 1...

Patient: I tried it — only for a second. Saying "this is the tightness" felt like a tiny loosening under my sternum, maybe just a millimeter of space, but my mind jumped away almost immediately. I don't know, it's hard to stay with it — could you guide me through it more slowly?

Therapist: Let's try again, slowly. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, say to yourself: "This is the tightness." Just one word. Not "I have tightness," not "I'm feeling tight," just "this is the tightness." As you say it, pause for just a tiny moment... (pause) One second. Then, take another deep breath in...

Patient: Okay... I took another breath and said "this is the tightness" — it felt like a tiny loosening under my sternum, but my mind jumped away almost right away. I don't know, can we go even slower? I'm finding it hard to stay with it without drifting.

Therapist: Let's try again, even slower. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, take a tiny breath in... just a whisper of air. As you exhale, say to yourself: "This is the tightness." Not a question, not a statement, just "this is the tightness." Say it so softly it's almost a whisper. (pause) One tiny second. Just a pause. Then, take another tiny breath in...

Patient: Okay... I tried the tiny breath and whispered "this is the tightness." It eased a hair under my sternum, then my mind drifted away almost at once. I don't know — can we do that again, really slowly? Maybe you could count the second so I don't lose track.

Therapist: Let's try again, even slower. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, take a tiny, tiny breath in... (counting slowly) One... (pause) Two... As you exhale, whisper to yourself: "This is the tightness." (pause) One tiny second... (counting slowly) Three... (pause) Your focus is just on that tiny word, no other thought, no other sensation. Just the word. (pause) Four...

Patient: Okay... I tried to follow along. The counting actually helped a bit — I could hold the phrase for a few beats and felt a tiny softening under my sternum, but then my thoughts drifted. I don't know, I'm getting a bit worn out—could you keep counting slowly again, maybe even gentler this time? I guess one more round would help.

Therapist: Let's try again, slower than ever. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, take a tiny, tiny breath in... (counting at an even slower pace) One... (pause) Two... (pause) Three... As you exhale, whisper to yourself: "This is the tightness." (pause) One tiny second... (counting at an even slower pace) Four... (pause) Five... (pause) Your focus is just on that tiny word, no other thought, no other sensation. Just the word. (pause) Six...

Patient: Okay... I could hold it for a few beats with that slower counting. It felt like a tiny loosening under my sternum, then my mind wandered. I don't know — I'm getting a bit worn out, could you keep counting very slowly again? I guess one more gentle round might help.

Therapist: Let's try again, slower than ever. When you feel that dull tightness under your sternum, take a tiny, tiny breath in... (counting at an almost imperceptible pace) One... (pause) Two... (pause) Three... (pause) Four... (pause) Five... (pause) Six... (pause) Seven... As you exhale, whisper to yourself: "This is the tightness." (pause) One tiny second... (pause) Eight... (pause) Nine... (pause) Ten... Your focus is just on that tiny word, no other thought, no other sensation. Just the word.

Patient: I tried to follow — the long, slow counting actually helped for a second and I felt a tiny loosening, but now my mind's racing and my chest feels fluttery and I can't seem to hold it. I don't know, I guess I'm distracted and it's making me more anxious instead of calmer. Can we... I don't know, try something else or even just breathe together more slowly?

Therapist: Let's try something new. Instead of focusing on the tightness, let's focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Take a slow, deep breath in... (counting together) One... (pause) Two... (pause) Three... (pause) Four... and as you exhale, feel the air leave your body... (counting together) One... (pause) Two... (pause) Three... (pause) Four... Just notice the sensation of your breath, the rise and fall of your chest, the feeling of the air moving in and out.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to breathe with you. I'm taking a slow breath but it feels fluttery and my mind keeps jumping — I don't know if I can slow it much. Could you count just two slow breaths with me? I guess two might be doable.

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice the pause between the two breaths – no counting, no thinking, just the space. Take a moment to acknowledge the fact that your mind jumped away, and then gently bring your focus back to your breath.

Patient: I noticed my mind jumped away—my chest feels fluttery and I couldn't hold the focus. I tried to bring it back and there was a tiny relief, but it's hard to keep. I don't know, could you count two slow breaths with me again? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice that your chest is still feeling fluttery, but that's okay. It's not about fixing it or holding it – it's about being with the feeling as it is. Take a moment to gently say to yourself: "I'm here with this feeling, and it's okay."

Patient: Okay... I said it quietly — "I'm here with this feeling, and it's okay." It gave a tiny softening under my sternum, but my chest is still fluttery and my thoughts keep jumping away. I don't know, I feel kind of guilty and distracted by it. Could you... could you count two slow breaths with me again? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice that your chest is still feeling a bit fluttery, but that tiny softening is still there – it's not gone. Gently say to yourself: "I notice that softening under my sternum, and it's still here."

Patient: Okay... I said it quietly — "I notice that softening under my sternum, and it's still here." It helped a little, but my chest's still fluttery and my mind keeps leaping away. I don't know, could we count two slow breaths together again? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice that your chest is still fluttery, but you've acknowledged the softening again – that's a tiny step forward. Don't try to fix it or change it; just say to yourself: "It's okay. I've noticed it before. It's still here."

Patient: I said it quietly — "It's okay. I've noticed it before. It's still here." It helped a little, but my chest's still fluttery and my mind keeps jumping. I don't know, could we do two slow breaths together again? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice the fluttery feeling in your chest, and instead of trying to change it, say to yourself: "What's happening in my chest right now?"

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest feels fluttery, like it's skipping and a bit tight under my sternum, and my breaths are shallow. I feel kind of panicky and my mind keeps jumping away. Could we... could we do two slow breaths together again?

Therapist: Let's count together: One... (pause) One slow breath in... (pause) Two... (pause) One slow breath out... (pause) Three... (pause) Just notice that your chest is feeling tight and your breaths are shallow – that's a physical sensation. Instead of trying to fix it or change it, say to yourself: "I'm feeling a tightness in my chest right now. It's like my body is holding its breath."

Patient: "I'm feeling a tightness in my chest right now. It's like my body is holding its breath." Saying that out loud eased it a hair, but my mind keeps darting away and my chest still feels fluttery. I don't know — could we try two slow breaths together again? I'm finding it hard to stay with this without getting distracted.
