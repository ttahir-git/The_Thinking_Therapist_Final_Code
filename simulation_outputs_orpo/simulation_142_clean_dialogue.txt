Patient: Hi, I’m a student in my late twenties and after a recent health scare I’ve been dealing with adjustment disorder. Lately I catch myself intellectualizing everything—turning feelings into timelines, probabilities, or lists—so I don’t have to actually sit with the discomfort. I know that sounds like overthinking, but it’s become my way to numb the anxiety, and I’m not sure how to stop. I guess… I don’t know, it’s hard to talk about.

Therapist: That sounds really hard to admit, but it takes courage to acknowledge how you're using overthinking as a coping mechanism. What happens when you intellectuallyize your emotions right now – like, physically feels different from when you're sitting with them directly?

Patient: When I intellectualize, it's like my mind kicks into problem-solving mode so the ache gets pushed aside — my breathing gets a bit shallow but my head feels clearer, like I can manage it. If I try to actually sit with the feeling, my chest tightens, my stomach drops, and I get this hot flush and want to look away. I guess... I don't know, it's embarrassing to admit, but the thinking feels safer even though it leaves me drained.

Therapist: That sounds incredibly honest. When you intellectuallyize your emotions, it's like you're buying a temporary reprieve from the discomfort, even though it leaves you feeling drained. What's one small value that matters to you that you'd be willing to risk feeling that discomfort for – like, if you were really connected to your breath, what would it be worth for you to do it?

Patient: I guess a small value for me is being honest and actually present with the people I care about—like showing up for my partner without turning everything into a pros-and-cons list. If connecting to my breath could help, it would be worth trying to sit with the discomfort long enough to say, “I’m struggling,” instead of intellectualizing it away. But... I don't know, that still feels really exposed and I keep wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: That's a beautiful value to risk for. When you say you'd rather show up without turning everything into a list, it means you value being present with your partner – what happens to that desire to "show up" when you start to intellectualize it again? What would it mean to just let go of that mental escape and be willing to not do it (just for a moment)?

Patient: I guess... it would mean letting the automatic checklist fall away and actually feeling whatever's under it, which terrifies me a bit. My chest tightens and I feel like I might fumble or say something stupid, but maybe it could also let me be less exhausted and actually connect with my partner. I don't know how to begin—maybe just a few breaths or saying, "I'm struggling"—but I'm already wanting to change the subject because it feels too exposed.

Therapist: Let's start with something ridiculously small: as soon as you feel that urge to change the subject, pause and say, "I'm struggling to stay present right now." That's it – just those three words. What happens when you say that without trying to fix it or intellectualize it?

Patient: I guess if I actually said it out loud my chest would tighten and I'd feel exposed, and then my brain would start listing reasons or facts instead of staying with the feeling. Maybe there'd be a little relief after a beat, but honestly I already want to change the subject because it feels too uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: notice what happens in your body right now, just before you feel the urge to change the subject. Where does that tension start to show up – is it in your chest, shoulders, or hands? When you notice that physical sensation, pause without trying to change the subject.

Patient: I guess it starts in my chest and up into my throat, and my shoulders tense after that. When I notice it I immediately want to catalog why it's happening or change the subject, instead of just sitting with it. I don't know… it's really hard to pause without my brain jumping to solutions.

Therapist: Notice the tension in your chest and throat right now. What's one tiny value that matters to you about being present with your partner – like, what's at stake for you in staying with this feeling, even if it's just for a breath?

Patient: I guess it's about honesty and trust — I want my partner to actually know me so we don't drift apart. Staying with the feeling for even a breath might let me say, "I'm struggling," and maybe they'd be there, but... I don't know, it feels exposed and I'm already wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Let's try something: what would it take for you to say "I'm struggling" to your partner right now – even if it's just to breathe out loud – if it meant they might be there for you, and that value of honesty and trust matters to you?

Patient: I guess it would take something tiny and scripted—like my partner saying “it’s okay” first, or me sending a quick text that just says “I’m struggling” so I don’t have to say it face-to-face. I don’t know, saying it out loud feels really exposed and my chest tightens already. Okay, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this—can we slow down and maybe work on a one-line script I could actually manage?

Therapist: Let's focus on the text: what if you sent just one text right now – "I'm struggling" – and it didn't have to be a big deal? What would your partner do if they saw that text, and how would that feel for you?

Patient: I guess if I sent “I’m struggling” they'd probably reply “I’m here” or ask if I’m okay — that thought feels kind of relieving but also really scary. I don't know, part of me worries I’d be annoying or they'd think I'm overreacting. Can we actually make that one-line text now? I think having the words would help, but I'm already wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Let's make the one-line text concrete: what if you typed "I'm struggling" into your phone right now – just that one sentence – and nothing else?

Patient: Okay… I opened my phone and typed "I'm struggling" into the message box. I didn't send it — my thumb just hovered and my chest tightened, and my brain started listing reasons not to. I guess I could hit send, but I'm scared they'll think I'm dramatic or get annoyed. I don't know, this already feels exposed and I'm wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your chest right now – the tightness. What if you didn't try to change the subject or fix it? What if you just acknowledged the physical sensation of your chest tightening, without judgment?

Patient: I can feel it — a tight band across my chest, my breath getting shallow and my throat constricting. If I try to just notice it my brain immediately starts listing reasons or solutions and I don't know how to stay with the feeling; I already want to change the subject. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and do one guided breath or a really tiny step I can manage?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one breath together. I want you to notice the sensation in your chest right now, without trying to change it or solve anything. Just notice the tightness of the band – what's its texture, its size, its location? Can you touch it with your awareness?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I can try: it feels like a tight band across the upper chest, just under my collarbones, maybe the width of my palm but thinner, hot and constricted around my sternum and up into my throat. When I try to "touch" it with awareness my head immediately starts cataloging reasons and I lose it—I already want to change the subject. I don't know, I'm getting overwhelmed; can we do one guided breath together, like you tell me when to inhale and exhale?

Therapist: Let's do a 4-7-8 breathing exercise together. I'll guide you through it. When you're ready, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4...

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I breathed in for four and it felt like the air hit that tight band but didn't pass it — the exhale made it a tiny bit less tight. I don't know, my head's already starting to list things to fix; can you keep guiding me slowly?

Therapist: When you exhale again, I want you to hold the breath for a count of 7. Just feel the sensation in your chest, and don't think about fixing it. Hold it...

Patient: Okay... I'm holding it now. It feels really tight and hot under my collarbones and my head's already starting to list reasons to breathe out—I don't know if I can keep it for seven counts. I'm getting overwhelmed; can you count out loud for me or maybe shorten the hold? I guess... can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down the hold. Instead of 7 counts, I'll count down from 5: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. When you feel ready, exhale naturally, without trying to hold it. Just let it go.

Patient: I exhaled and it eased a bit, but then this hot shame and self-criticism washed over me and tightened up my chest again. I guess I feel really frustrated with myself — like I should be able to handle this but I keep spiraling and it's embarrassing. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we do a much shorter breath together, like inhale for 3, exhale for 4, and you count with me?

Therapist: Let's do the 3-4 breath count together. I'll count with you: inhale for 3... 1... 2... 3. Exhale for 4... 1... 2... 3... 4. Just focus on the counting, and don't try to think about the feeling or the shame.

Patient: I exhaled and it loosened a bit, but then shame and that wave of self-criticism came back and my chest tightened—like I failed at something and I don't know how to stop replaying it. Can we keep it tiny? Maybe you say the one-line text out loud with me—just "I'm struggling"—and I'll try to echo it so I can actually press send. I guess... I'm already nervous.

Therapist: Let's try it together. I'll say the text out loud with you: "I'm struggling." Can you echo it with me? Just repeat it back, like you're sending it: "I'm struggling"?

Patient: "I'm struggling." Okay... I said it, but my chest just spiked and my thumb's hovering over send. I don't know if I can actually hit send unless you say "I'm here" first or count me through one tiny breath.

Therapist: You said the text: "I'm struggling." Now, I'll say it back to you: "I'm here." That's just acknowledging that you're not alone. There's no need to hit send yet. Just take one tiny breath in...

Patient: I took a tiny breath… it loosened a bit, but I'm pretty drained and my thumb's still hovering. I guess hearing "I'm here" helped, but I'm scared they'll think I'm dramatic — can you count me through one very small breath and then count me when I hit send? I don't know, I feel shaky.

Therapist: Let's do it together. I'll count for you: 1... exhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... Now, when you're ready, hit send. I'll count for you: 1...

Patient: Okay... I hit send. It says delivered. My chest just spiked and my throat tightened and all these paranoid thoughts are rushing in—like, they’ll think I’m dramatic or I’m overreacting. I guess I wanted them to say “I’m here” first. I don’t know what to do if they don’t reply. Can we just stay here for a minute and maybe talk through what a normal reply might look like? I’m already wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Let's stay with the text for a minute. What's one specific thought that's coming up for you – like, "They'll think I'm dramatic"? Can you name it exactly?

Patient: I guess the exact thought is, "They'll think I'm dramatic or weak and get annoyed or pull away," like I'm overreacting and not worth their time. Saying it makes that hot shame rush back and my chest tighten. I don't know…I’m already wanting to change the subject—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say the thought out loud – "They'll think I'm dramatic or weak..." What's the physical sensation in your body when you say it?

Patient: When I say that out loud my chest clamps down and my throat tightens — like I can’t get a full breath. My face gets hot and I feel like shrinking, and my brain immediately starts listing reasons I’m being dramatic or how to fix it. I don't know, it's embarrassing and I'm already wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you didn't identify yourself as "dramatic" or "weak" – what if you just acknowledged the thought without judgment? What would the physical sensations be like if you didn't try to fix it or change it?

Patient: I guess if I didn't label myself dramatic or weak, the chest tightness would still be there but maybe more like a dull pressure instead of that sharp clamp, and my throat might relax a bit so breathing feels a little less blocked. My head would still want to jump in with solutions or reasons, though, and I'd feel exposed and shaky. I don't know… I'm already wanting to change the subject because this is getting intense.

Therapist: Notice what happens just before your head starts jumping in with solutions – what's the first word that comes up in your head?

Patient: I don't know — probably the word "what," like the start of "what if…" and then my brain zips into lists and fixes. Saying that makes the shame and frustration spike, and I'm feeling pretty wiped already and wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Notice the word "what" – just pause for a tiny breath before your head starts jumping into solutions. Take one deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth...

Patient: I took a breath like you said — it loosened for a second, but as I exhaled the "what if" popped in and my head started racing with fixes. I don't know, my chest tightened again and I feel kind of wiped out; I’m already wanting to change the subject. Can we just do one tiny counted breath together slowly?

Therapist: Let's do a slow, counted breath together. I'll count for you: 1... your chest is still tight... 2... your head is thinking about solutions... 3... your breath is steady... 4... your body is present... 5... your thoughts are slowing down...

Patient: It loosened a little — the band feels less sharp and my throat is a bit more open — but shame sneaks back in and I'm kind of drained. I don't know, my head's already reaching for fixes and I'm already wanting to change the subject. Could we just stay here for a minute and imagine what a likely reply from my partner might look like, so it doesn't feel so scary?

Therapist: Let's imagine what a likely reply from your partner might look like. What would they say if they were thinking about how you just sent them a message? What might they be feeling?

Patient: I guess they'd probably reply something like, "I’m here — do you want to talk? Do you need anything?" — worried and ready to help, maybe a bit surprised but mostly caring. That thought actually feels a bit relieving, but I also worry they'd get annoyed or think I'm being dramatic. I don't know… I'm already feeling shaky and wanting to change the subject, can we slow down?
