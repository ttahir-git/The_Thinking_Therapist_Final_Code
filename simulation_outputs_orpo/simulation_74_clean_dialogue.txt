Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — like my life is just nursing shifts and nothing else seems to matter. The health scare I had made it worse; it was supposed to be a wake-up call but I just feel... blank. I've tried talking about this before and it hasn't helped. So, how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That feeling of being blank and disconnected sounds really draining. When you say "nothing else seems to matter," what's one thing you used to enjoy or look forward to doing before your shifts and the health scare took over – even if it was just a small thing, like taking a walk after work?

Patient: I used to look forward to late-night runs — they'd clear my head and remind me I wasn't just a nurse. I tried getting back into them after the scare but it felt hollow and I couldn't stick with it. How is talking about that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those late-night runs felt like a lifeline, didn't they? What was it about running that made you feel like you weren't just a nurse – was it the sense of freedom, the exercise, or something else? If you were to commit to just one small step, like going for a 10-minute walk after your next shift, what would that look like for you, and how might that help you reconnect with that feeling of purpose?

Patient: Running used to be that rare time I felt like I existed outside of being a nurse — just air, movement, and my own headspace. A 10-minute walk after a shift would probably be me dragging myself down the block with music, trying to make space between work and home without overdoing it because of the health scare. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I’ve tried tiny things before and they just feel hollow or I quit after a week? What makes you think something that small would actually change how stuck I feel?

Therapist: It makes sense that tiny steps feel hollow when they're just a distraction from the problem. What is it about those 10 minutes of walking that you're already doing that feels like it's not making a dent in your stuckness? Is it that you're still thinking about work, or that you're just going through the motions? Would it be more helpful to ask yourself what's truly unworkable about waiting for a shift to end, or what's stopping you from doing something meaningful in those moments?

Patient: Honestly, what's unworkable is that I can't switch off — I'm replaying shifts, worrying about my health, and I'm just wiped, so those little rituals feel more like chores than relief. When I try to do something 'meaningful' it ends up feeling performative, like I'm proving to myself I'm more than a nurse, and then I bail. I get why you ask, but how is that supposed to help me actually stop feeling like work is the only thing that matters?

Therapist: Those rituals and meaningful activities do feel like you're trying to prove something, don't they? What if, instead of trying to do something "meaningful," you simply noticed what's happening when you're replaying shifts or worrying about your health? Could you pause for a moment and just say to yourself, "This thought is just a thought – it's not the truth about who you are"?

Patient: I've tried the "this thought is just a thought" thing before and it doesn't stick when I'm dead-tired — the scenes and the worry still loop in my head. It feels like a band-aid, not actually changing this core feeling of being only a nurse. How is noticing supposed to actually change anything — I don't want another coping trick, I want to figure out what matters to me beyond work.

Therapist: What if the "band-aid" noticing thought isn't meant to stop the loops, but to create space for you to ask yourself what's underneath the worry about being a nurse? When you're replaying shifts, what's the underlying value that's driving that worry – is it safety, identity, or something else? If you can identify that value, might you be able to start making small choices that connect to that value, even in the midst of work?

Patient: I think it's mostly about competence and being needed — I worry if I'm not constantly doing for others then I'm useless, and the health scare made me fear for my own safety. Maybe it's also about control and not letting things slip, and I'm exhausted from all the small tactics that feel like band-aids. But how is naming that supposed to help? Even if I admit it's about identity and safety, I don't see how that makes me any less stuck.

Therapist: You're right that naming the values doesn't directly solve the stuckness, but what if it did? What if, instead of trying to "be" a certain person (competent nurse), you started testing what it means to not be that person – what happens when you pause, breathe, and say, "I'm not in control of this moment, but I can observe it"? What small action might you take if you didn't need to prove your worth as a nurse to feel safe?

Patient: Maybe I'd do something deliberately non-nurse — like booking one evening a week for a ceramics class or actually meeting a friend for coffee and not talking about work. Or set a firm boundary after a shift — lock my phone for an hour and go for a walk without checking messages. But I'm skeptical: when I try not to prove myself I get panicky and useless-feeling — how is that supposed to actually help when my default is proving I'm needed?

Therapist: Those small actions sound like they'd be hard to sustain in the moment, but what if they weren't about proving yourself, but about creating space for something else? What if, when you book that ceramics class or meet your friend, you weren't thinking, "I need to show them I'm not a nurse"? Instead, what if you noticed the sensation of your body relaxing, or the pleasure of creating something with your hands? What would that feel like, and how might it shift the panic to curiosity?

Patient: I guess doing something like ceramics might feel weird at first — panicky, like I should be checking my phone — but then my hands and the texture of the clay could pull me into the moment and I might actually notice small, grounding details. For a bit it could flip panic into curiosity, like wondering what I can make instead of replaying shifts. But I'm skeptical — it still feels temporary and I'm worried I'll just go back to proving I'm needed; how is that supposed to actually change that habit when I get home and it's back to work?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to carry that moment of curiosity with you to work, you tried to notice what happens when you bring the process of ceramics into your work? What if, when you're feeling the urge to check your phone or replay shifts, you simply noticed the sensation of your hands moving, the feel of the tools in your hand, or the sound of the machines humming? What if that small act of noticing helped you connect the moment you're in (the work) to the value that ceramics represented for you (creativity, calmness)?

Patient: I get the idea — maybe tiny sensory things at work could be little anchors, like noticing the weight of a pen, the soap smell when I wash my hands, or one long breath between patients. But I'm skeptical: when I'm wiped or panicking it feels impossible to slow down and these things end up feeling performative. How is that supposed to actually change my pattern of proving I'm needed on autopilot? What would a realistic, low-effort practice look like that I could actually do on a chaotic shift?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to slow down or perform a specific act, you simply noticed the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Not the patient's chart, not the beeping machines, just the sensation of your feet on the ground? That's a tiny, immediate act that doesn't require effort, but it might help you connect to the fact that you're here, in this moment. What if, when you're feeling wiped, you simply noticed that sensation, without trying to change it or use it for something else?

Patient: I mean, noticing my feet sounds almost laughable, but maybe it's less performative than a breathing exercise. The problem is when I'm exhausted or panicking my brain just skips over it — I go on autopilot proving I'm needed. How is that supposed to actually break the habit of proving myself instead of just being another trick? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed talking about all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. What's one tiny thing you can do right now, without thinking, when you're feeling exhausted or panicking? Just one thing. It could be as simple as noticing the sound of your own voice saying "I'm here" to yourself. That's it. No effort, no thinking, just noticing.

Patient: Okay—I guess I can try whispering "I'm here" to myself and just notice how it sounds or feels in my throat. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I'm wiped and my brain just keeps looping? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down, and what exactly should I be paying attention to if the voice just feels flat?

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the sound of the voice, you simply notice the sensation of your throat or jaw when you whisper "I'm here"? What happens in your body when you make that small sound? Notice the physical sensation, not the thought or emotion behind it. Just observe what's happening in your body, without trying to change it or use it for anything else.

Patient: Okay, I tried whispering "I'm here" — my jaw and throat felt tight and my breathing stayed shallow, so nothing dramatic changed. It gave a tiny pause, maybe, but the loop was still there and it mostly just felt neutral. How is that supposed to actually change the autopilot of proving myself? I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down and be concrete about what to notice next when it feels flat?

Therapist: When you whispered "I'm here" and your jaw felt tight, what happened right after that? What was the first thing you noticed before your mind started looping again? Was there a tiny pause in your breathing, or a slight shift in your posture? Let's focus on that pause, not what it means or what you're trying to do with it. Just notice the pause itself, as a small moment of stillness in the midst of your autopilot.

Patient: Right after I whispered, there was this tiny hitch — like my breath caught and my shoulders dropped a millimeter, a brief blink of quiet before my mind snapped back to charts and what-ifs. It felt more like a permission to pause for a second than anything that actually changed the loop. How is noticing that millisecond supposed to make me stop proving myself on autopilot, and can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath catching – what does it feel like in your chest or throat? Is it a slight tightness, a pinch, or a heaviness? Let's focus on that physical sensation, not the thought "I'm pausing" or the action "I'm not proving myself." Just notice the sensation, as it is.

Patient: It's a tight, hollow pinch under my sternum — my throat closes a bit and the breaths get shallow, like I'm holding something down. My shoulders drop for a split second with that hitch, then my head snaps back to charts and what-ifs. How is noticing that actually going to change anything? I'm kinda wiped out doing this, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tight pinch under your sternum – what would happen if you simply allowed it to be there, without trying to push it away or make it smaller? What would your body do if you didn't try to "fix" it? You could try a tiny experiment: just notice the pinch for 1 second, without trying to change it, and then... just breathe.

Patient: I tried letting it sit for a second — the pinch stayed but my breath loosened a hair and my shoulders dropped, then the loop rushed back. It just felt like a tiny, boring blip, not a fix; how is that supposed to actually change anything when it always snaps back? This is getting heavy to keep doing—can we slow down and pick one simple thing I could realistically try on a shift instead of more noticing exercises?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. What's one tiny thing you could realistically do on a shift to connect to what you noticed? Instead of noticing the sensation, what if you simply took a deep breath and said "I'm here" to yourself, without thinking about it? Just one small phrase, one moment of connection.

Patient: Okay—maybe I could try one slow breath and whispering "I'm here" once between patients or right after handover, just stand in the break room for that one moment. I'm not sure I follow how that's really different from the other noticing stuff; when it's busy I just snap back to autopilot. I'll try it once this week, but honestly I doubt it'll stick—can you be concrete about exactly when to do it and what I should expect it to actually change instead of it being another tiny trick?

Therapist: Here's what I want you to try: On your next shift, during your morning handover, take a deep breath in for 2 seconds, and whisper "I'm here" to yourself, just once, without thinking about it. Noticing, not trying to change it. Just the phrase "I'm here". Then, after you've whispered it, take a deep breath out and focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just notice that sensation for 1 second. Don't try to change it or use it to stop the loop. Just be present with that sensation.

Patient: Alright — I can try that next shift during handover: two-second breath in, whisper "I'm here," exhale, notice my feet for a second. But honestly, when things are chaotic I probably won't remember — what's a realistic cue if handover's rushed or I'm already half on autopilot? And if it just feels flat like the other tricks, can we slow down and talk about what to do next?

Therapist: Let's talk about what to do next. If you find yourself forgetting the cue or feeling flat during the whisper, what would happen if you simply noticed the sensation of your feet without trying to change it? What if, when you're already on autopilot, you just paused for a micro-second to notice the feeling of your feet touching the ground? That tiny pause could be a pivot point. Instead of trying to change the thought or feeling, you could simply use the sensation of your feet to anchor yourself in the present moment. No thinking, no trying – just noticing.

Patient: I mean, maybe — if I actually remember it, noticing my feet could be less dumb than whispering. But I'm not sure I follow how a tiny micro-pause is supposed to undo years of autopilot and this need to prove myself — when I'm panicking I don't notice my feet, I just move. How is that supposed to help in the moment? 

Can we be concrete: give me one realistic cue I can use on a busy shift (like after I wash my hands, or when I badge in/out) and tell me what to do if it just feels flat so I don't spiral. I'm kind of wiped doing this, so can we slow down and pick one thing I can actually try once this week?

Therapist: Let's focus on a concrete cue: When you badge in/out after a shift, take a moment to notice the sensation of your hands touching the badge. Just for 1 second, notice the feeling of your fingers making contact with the metal. That's it. No thinking, no trying – just noticing. If it feels flat, don't worry about it. Simply acknowledge the pause, and then take a deep breath. Don't try to change anything – just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I can try the badge thing next shift: one-second notice of my fingers on the metal, then a breath. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the autopilot when I'm rushed and panicking? If I forget or it just feels flat, what's one simple backup I can do in the moment so I don't spiral? I'm kind of wiped doing this, so keep it concrete.

Therapist: Let's add a backup plan: If you forget the badge-in/out moment or it feels flat, take a quick glance at your watch and say to yourself, "I've got 5 more minutes." That's it. Just 5 more minutes. You can use that brief moment to pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts before moving on.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the badge cue and the "I've got 5 more minutes" backup, though I really doubt it'll stick. If that pause feels flat or I start spiraling, give me one single, concrete action I can do in under 30 seconds on a busy shift that actually breaks the panic (step outside for 30 seconds? splash cold water on my face? something else?). I'm wiped and it's a lot to sort through, so can we slow down and just pick one thing I can actually commit to this week?

Therapist: Let's commit to one thing: If you feel the panic rising and your mind starts looping, step outside the patient room or workspace and take 10 deep breaths at the water cooler or a designated spot. Just step outside. That's it. No thinking, no trying – just breathe.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try stepping outside next shift and doing those 10 deep breaths at the water cooler, once. But honestly, how is that supposed to actually stop the loop — and what’s a realistic backup if it’s too busy to step out (like a 20–30 second thing I can do in the hall)? I'm wiped just talking about this, so keep it concrete.

Therapist: Let's add a backup plan: If you can't step outside, pause for 10 seconds in the hallway and take a deep breath while keeping your back against the wall. That's it. Just the wall, just the breath. No thinking, no trying – just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the wall-and-10-breaths next shift. I'm skeptical it won't just feel like another tiny pause; when I'm panicking I usually keep moving. If after 10 seconds my chest's still tight, what exactly should I do next to actually stop the spiral — count, focus on my feet, or something else concrete? I'm wiped doing this, so can we slow down and pick one clear, doable plan?

Therapist: Let's commit to one clear plan: If your chest is still tight after 10 seconds, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the weight, the pressure, the texture – just the sensation of your feet. Don't try to change it, don't think about it – just notice.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the feet thing if my chest’s still tight. But honestly, how is noticing my feet supposed to change years of autopilot and proving myself? If that doesn’t work after another 10 seconds, what’s the one single next move I should do to stop spiraling — and please keep it really simple, I’m wiped and need to slow down.

Therapist: If your chest is still tight and you're noticing your feet, take one small action: Open your mouth and say "I'm here" to yourself. Just those two words. No thinking, no trying – just say it.

Patient: Okay — I can try saying "I'm here" out loud if my chest's still tight and I'm noticing my feet. It feels kind of ridiculous and flat already, and I'm low on energy, so I'm worried I'll just mouth it and nothing will change. If that still doesn't land, what's the single next move I should do in the moment so I don't keep spiraling?

Therapist: If you're feeling low on energy and saying "I'm here" feels flat, take one tiny breath in and then exhale through your nose while looking up at the ceiling. Just that small, physical act of looking up and exhaling.

Patient: Alright — I can try the look-up-and-exhale if saying "I'm here" feels flat. Imagining it now, my chest loosened a hair and then everything snapped back, so… how is this supposed to actually get me out of autopilot long-term? If that still doesn't land, I’ll step outside for the 10 breaths — is that the one move you want me to default to? Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: This technique isn't meant to be a magic bullet for long-term change, but rather a small, immediate step to help you break free from autopilot in the moment. If saying "I'm here" or looking up and exhaling doesn't stick, it's okay – that's exactly when to default to the 10 deep breaths at the water cooler. Stepping outside was the backup plan, but now that you've got the technique, let's see if it works for you.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that sequence next shift: badge-in touch, two-second breath and whisper “I’m here,” notice my feet, look up and exhale, and if none of that lands, step outside for the 10 breaths. I'm skeptical it’ll stick, but I’ll do it once; if it just feels flat or I forget, what’s a realistic way to adjust it so it’s not another band‑aid? Also, if after a week it’s still not helping and I’m snapping back to proving myself, what concrete next move should I try so this doesn’t just become another thing I quit?
