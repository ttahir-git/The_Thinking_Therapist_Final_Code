Patient: I've been having a lot of trouble with my temper since the move — little things set me off, especially dealing with neighbors or the landlord. I'm a construction guy, used to fixing things, but this whole move's worn me down and I guess I just snap more than I should. I don't know, it's hard to talk about.

Therapist: When you say "little things set me off," what's one specific situation or trigger that you've noticed lately that makes you feel like you're about to snap – something like yelling at a neighbor, slamming a door, or taking a step back?

Patient: Yeah — like a few days ago the landlord showed up unannounced to "check" the place while I was still unpacking, and I just blew up; I yelled, shoved a box, slammed the door. I don't know, it felt like he was stepping on the last bit of control I had after the move, I guess.

Therapist: It sounds like having the space to unpack and settle in was really important to you after the move, and having someone show up unannounced felt like an invasion of that space. What's one thing that matters to you about having control in this new place – is it feeling safe, having time to relax, or being able to create a sense of home?

Patient: I guess it's feeling safe — just having a place where I can unwind after a long day and not feel like someone's watching or telling me what to do. I don't know, when that gets taken away it just sets me off more than it should.

Therapist: Having a space to unwind after work sounds crucial to you. What's one small thing you could do right now, just for a few minutes, to create a tiny sense of safety and control in this new space – like lighting a candle, taking a few deep breaths, or putting on some calming music?

Patient: I guess I could start by locking the door and putting on some old rock or country — something that actually feels like mine. I don't know, sit down for five minutes, take a few slow breaths and maybe set a timer so I don't keep checking the doorway. It sounds dumb, but that might help me not snap at the next thing.

Therapist: That sounds like a great tiny experiment to start with – locking the door and creating some space for yourself. What if, instead of calling it "dumb," you said to yourself, "I'm choosing to create some space for myself right now, just for five minutes, because that's what matters to me"?

Patient: I guess I can try saying that to myself — sounds a little silly, but whatever. I don't know if it'll change much, but tonight I'll lock the door, put on some old country, set a five-minute timer, and see if I stop checking the hallway.

Therapist: Tonight, after you set the timer, when you check the hallway and catch yourself checking the door, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I'm here to listen to this music, not to answer the door." What's one small action you can take right now to commit to this tiny boundary – like putting down your phone, taking a seat, or making a cup of tea?

Patient: I guess I'll put my phone in the other room, make a cup of coffee and sit down on the couch, set that five-minute timer. I don't know, it sounds small and kinda silly, but it's something I can actually control right now.

Therapist: By putting your phone away, making a cup of coffee, and sitting down on the couch, you're creating a tangible space to breathe and relax – just for five minutes. What if, when the timer goes off, you don't immediately check the door, but instead notice how your body feels, and whether that feeling of calm has stayed with you?

Patient: Okay, I can try that — when the timer goes off I'll try to notice my shoulders, my breathing, and whether I'm actually calmer instead of jumping up to check. I guess it feels weird to sit with it, I don't know if it'll stick, but I'll give it a shot tonight.

Therapist: When you notice your shoulders relaxing, your breath slowing down, and your mind quieting, what's one thing that matters to you about feeling that calmness – is it being able to focus on a task, spend time with loved ones, or simply enjoy the moment?

Patient: I guess it's mostly so I don't blow up at my partner or anybody else — I want to be able to sit through dinner without snapping at a dumb comment. I don't know, I just miss being able to enjoy an evening without feeling wound up all the time.

Therapist: That's a beautiful reason to cultivate calmness. What if, from now on, you commit to yourself to show up fully in the moments that matter most – like dinner with your partner – even when the conversation gets tough?

Patient: I want to, I guess, but I don't know if I can promise to show up when I'm already wound tight — it feels uncomfortable just saying that. Maybe a more realistic plan is this: if I feel myself getting mad at dinner, I'll say, "I need a minute," and step outside or to the garage for five minutes to cool off. I can try that.

Therapist: By taking that minute to step away and breathe, you're not just avoiding the conversation, you're actually taking care of yourself so you can show up fully for your partner – that's a powerful act of kindness and love.

Patient: I can try that — tell them "I need a minute" and step out to the garage or hallway. I don't know, it feels awkward and kinda weak to say that, like I'm admitting I'm out of control. What if they push or follow me? I guess I'm also worried that stepping out becomes me avoiding things instead of dealing with them.

Therapist: It's natural to feel like saying "I need a minute" is admitting you're out of control, but what if you saw that moment as an opportunity to practice self-compassion and self-awareness – like saying, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, can we take a pause together?" Instead of avoiding the situation, stepping outside to collect your thoughts can actually help you come back to the conversation with more clarity and kindness.

Patient: I can try saying, "I need a minute," but I don't know — it feels weak, like I'm admitting I can't handle things. What if they follow me and push or start yelling? I guess I could lock myself in the garage for five minutes, but then I worry I'm just running away instead of dealing with it.

Therapist: What would happen to you if you didn't say "I need a minute" and stayed in the situation, even if it felt uncomfortable or like you were avoiding it? What's the value of staying in the moment, even if it means feeling overwhelmed or struggling to handle it?

Patient: I guess if I stayed, maybe I'd prove to myself I can handle the heat and not blow up — maybe I'd learn to sit with the suck and not make a scene. But I don't know, I'm scared it'll just simmer and then I'll snap and everyone'll see me as that guy again, and that thought makes me feel ashamed and pissed off at myself. It feels like choosing between proving I'm not a coward and not tearing the place apart, and I don't know which is worse.

Therapist: That struggle to choose between proving yourself and avoiding the scene is actually a tiny glimpse of what matters to you – the value of staying with the discomfort, even when it's hard, because that's where growth happens. The shame and anger you feel are just the body's way of saying, "Hey, that's a big deal to you." What if, instead of fighting that shame, you saw it as an invitation to explore what you're really trying to protect yourself from by avoiding the scene?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm trying to protect myself from looking weak or failing — from being that guy everyone remembers. When I even think about poking at it, I get this sour shame and get pissed off at myself, like whatever happened is staring right back and I just want to slam the lid down. I don't know how to dig into it without feeling like I'm inviting more of that.

Therapist: That sour shame and anger are actually signals that you're standing up for what matters to you – the value of not letting the past define you. Instead of slamming the lid down, what if you used that shame to fuel a tiny act of kindness towards yourself – like acknowledging that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and taking a deep breath, right in that moment, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... when you say that, this sour shame just wells up and I get pissed at myself — like I'm admitting I couldn't handle it before. I guess I could try one slow breath and tell myself it's okay, but it feels small and kinda pathetic after everything. I don't know if that'll do much, but I'll try it next time I feel that tightness.

Therapist: That one slow breath and "it's okay" might feel small, but it's actually a tiny act of courage – courage to be with the discomfort, to acknowledge it without judgment, and to choose kindness over shame. What if, when you next feel that tightness, you said to yourself, "I'm choosing to breathe with this tightness, not because I'm strong, but because that's what matters to me – being present with my partner, even when it's hard"?

Patient: I don't know... saying that sounds like admitting I wasn't enough before, and that just makes me mad at myself all over again. I guess I can try taking a slow breath and telling myself that line — that I'm staying for my partner, not to prove I'm tough — but I can't promise it'll fix anything. I'm worried the shame'll stick and I'll either freeze up or storm off, but I'll try it next time.

Therapist: That's a great start. Instead of promising it'll "fix anything," what if you committed to just showing up for 5 seconds, just for yourself, and doing that tiny act of kindness ("I'm staying for my partner, not to prove I'm tough") – without judgment, without expectation, and without any other goals?

Patient: I guess I can try those five seconds — say "I'm staying for my partner, not to prove I'm tough" and hold it for a few breaths. I don't know, that idea stings and makes that sour shame flare up, and I get mad at myself like I'm admitting I failed before. If that doesn't help, what's the next small thing I can do instead of exploding or running?

Therapist: That sour shame might feel like failure, but what if, instead of beating yourself up, you saw it as an opportunity to learn what you need to do differently next time? When you feel that shame flare up, what's one tiny thing you can do that doesn't involve judgment or explosion – like taking a deep breath, noticing your physical sensations, or noticing what's happening in the moment?

Patient: I guess I can try one slow, deliberate breath and actually name where I'm tight — jaw, chest, shoulders — and press my feet into the floor to ground myself. But honestly, when that shame flares I get so pissed at myself I can barely do it, I don't know if it'll help, but I'll try to notice my body before I explode.

Therapist: Notice that when you're tight, you're not just physically uncomfortable – you're also feeling the weight of shame and self-criticism. By grounding yourself in your physical body, you're creating space for a different value to show up – the value of being present, even when it's hard. What if, instead of fighting that shame, you saw it as a chance to ask yourself, "What would it take for me to feel safe enough to be with my partner, even in this moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd feel safer if my partner didn't push when I get tight — if they gave me a heads-up before bringing up something heavy and actually respected it when I say I need five minutes, without following me or making a scene. If they could say, "Take the minute, we'll come back when you're ready — I won't judge you," maybe I'd be able to stay. But I don't trust it'll work yet; thinking about it makes that sour shame flare up and I just get pissed at myself for needing it.

Therapist: That sour shame is actually a signal that what matters to you is being understood and respected by your partner – not just about you being strong or tough, but about feeling seen and valued. When you think about needing space, what if you saw that as a sign that you're worth taking care of, and that your partner's willingness to respect that is a fundamental part of what matters to you?

Patient: I guess that'd mean a lot — if they could actually respect my space, maybe I wouldn't feel like I'm about to lose it. But saying I need that out loud makes me feel weak and ashamed, and I get mad at myself all over again. I don't know how to even bring it up without sounding needy or like I'm begging; how do I say it without making it worse?

Therapist: What if, instead of saying "I need space," you asked your partner, "What would make this conversation work for you?" That way, you're not focusing on what you need, but on what they need – and that might help you connect with their value in a way that feels more collaborative.

Patient: I don't know... asking them "what would make it work" sounds sensible on paper, but I guess it also feels like I'm dodging my own needs. That sour shame kicks in and I get mad at myself for having to negotiate—like I'm begging for permission to be okay. Maybe a straighter, dumb-simple ask would be better: "If I say I need five minutes, will you give me that without following?" — I could try that, but I'm nervous it won't stick.

Therapist: That simplicity actually makes sense – you're not asking for permission to be okay, but for them to respect your boundaries. By framing it as "will you give me space without following," you're not trying to negotiate your worth, but rather your own need for space. What if, instead of worrying about whether it "won't stick," you saw that willingness to give space as a sign of what matters to your partner – their willingness to respect your autonomy?

Patient: Yeah, in theory that's what I'd want — them to actually respect my space when I ask for it. But I don't know, even thinking about asking makes that sour shame flare up and I get mad at myself because I've tried stuff before and it didn't stick, so I feel kinda stupid. I guess I could try a small test — bring it up when we're calm and ask them to agree to the one-line deal ("If I say five minutes, give it"), but I'm nervous it'll just blow up anyway.

Therapist: That small test is actually a great way to test the waters – you're not trying to "fix" the situation or prove yourself, but rather test whether your partner is willing to meet you halfway. What if, instead of seeing it as a risk that "will blow up," you saw it as an opportunity to learn what's possible?

Patient: I guess maybe I could try to see it that way — as a chance to learn — but I don't know, that sour shame kicks in and I get mad at myself like it's already failed. Maybe I'll bring up the one-line deal this weekend when we're calm and test it, or maybe I'll write it down first so I don't chicken out, but I can't promise I won't cave or get defensive.

Therapist: That's a great start – writing it down first might actually help you feel more prepared and less anxious. What if, instead of worrying about how you'll react, you simply commit to testing the one-line deal this weekend, no matter what? Just that small action – writing it down or saying it out loud – might be enough to shift the focus from "I'll fail" to "I'm taking a tiny step towards clarity".

Patient: I don't know... I want to try, I guess, but whenever I picture saying it that same shame hits me and I get mad at myself like I'm back to screwing up. Maybe I'll write the line down and practice saying it out loud in the truck before we sit down — hell, if I choke I can hand them the paper. I can't promise I won't cave, but I'll at least put it on paper and try to say it once.

Therapist: That's a great plan – writing it down and practicing it in the truck might actually help you feel more grounded before bringing it up. Instead of thinking "I'm going to fail" or "I'm so weak", what if you saw it as a tiny act of bravery – you're taking a risk by saying it out loud, and that's what matters?

Patient: I guess maybe it is brave, but I can't shake this feeling it'll just blow up and I'll look like an idiot — that thought makes me mad at myself. I'll write the line down and practice it in the truck, and if I choke I'll hand them the paper, but I don't know if that'll be enough.

Therapist: That's a great start – writing it down and practicing it in the truck shows you're willing to take small steps towards saying it out loud. When you think "I'll look like an idiot", what if you saw that thought as a sign that you're already being kind to yourself? You're not trying to prove anything to others; you're just taking care of your own need to express yourself.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I want to see it that way, but the second I imagine saying it out loud that sour shame pops up and I get pissed at myself like I'm admitting I screwed up. Putting it on paper feels safer — practice in the truck — because saying it makes me freeze. Can we go over a really simple wording I can use so it doesn't sound like I'm blaming them?

Therapist: That's a great idea to practice in the truck. What if you used a phrase like "When I say I need space, can we make a plan to respect that?" or "If I need to take a break, what can we do to support me?" This way, you're focusing on your own need for space, rather than blaming them for not giving you space. It's still simple, but it shifts the focus from "you did this" to "I need this".

Patient: Okay, maybe something blunt like, "If I say I need five minutes, will you give me that without following me?" — simple, no blame. I don't know, saying it out loud makes me feel ashamed and stupid, like I'm admitting I screwed up, so I guess I'll still practice it in the truck, but what if they laugh or just ignore it?
