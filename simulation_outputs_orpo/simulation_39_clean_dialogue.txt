Patient: I've been feeling oddly stuck and directionless lately — like my whole sense of self has collapsed into being the business owner, and I don't really know what else matters to me anymore. There's this overlay of OCD and the pressure of a demanding new program, but I tend to default to abstracting about cognitive patterns and existential frameworks instead of saying I'm actually scared or sad. Outwardly I'm gregarious and optimistic, but internally I get distracted by analysis — I talk about my feelings as if they're theories, which I think is a safety mechanism.

Therapist: When you say you're "stuck" and your whole sense of self is tied to the business, what's one thing that's not working for you – something small, like a conversation with a friend or a task at work – that feels impossible because you're so caught up in "being the business owner"?

Patient: Honestly, something as small as saying yes to a friend's coffee invite feels impossible — I immediately reframe it as market research or a networking touchpoint instead of a relaxed catch-up. I catch myself running a mental audit of brand impressions and follow-ups, which converts a simple social moment into a transactional obligation. Analytically, I'd call it identity-fusion with my role plus OCD-driven ritualization as a way to avoid vulnerability, though I don't want to flat-out admit I'm scared of being just... me.

Therapist: When you're getting caught up in that mental audit, what's the value you're trying to protect by turning that coffee invite into market research?

Patient: Mostly it's about protecting a sense of usefulness and control — if every interaction can be reframed as market research, it stays measurable and instrumental instead of messy and subjective. There's also a preservation of identity and self-worth: if I'm always the one who brings value as the business owner, I don't have to sit with the possibility that I might not be valuable outside that role. Largely it's a strategy to avoid ambiguity and vulnerability — converting unpredictability into data feels safer than just being present.

Therapist: What's the one thing that matters most to you when you're with that friend over coffee – something that has nothing to do with being the business owner or even the coffee itself – that would feel worth taking a small risk to be present for?

Patient: If I boil it down, what matters most is being genuinely seen — reciprocal recognition of me as a person, not as a brand or a utility. I'd risk saying something uncurated and small, like admitting I don't have an answer or that I'm exhausted, just to test whether the relationship can hold non-instrumental honesty and preserve some ontological continuity beyond my role.

Therapist: What would it take for you to take a deep breath, say "I'm exhausted," and mean it – not as a brand or utility, but just as that person sitting across from your friend – and see what happens next?

Patient: Practically, I think it would take a little staged behavioral experiment and an internal permission protocol — like rehearsing a 20–30 second line ("I'm exhausted, I don't have answers right now") in private, then trying it with a low-stakes friend, plus a quick grounding ritual so my OCD doesn't seize the moment. I'd also need to cultivate an internal narrative that my ontological worth isn't contingent on utility (a mantra or affirmation) and plan a safe aftercare—something small and predictable to reduce ambiguity. But to be blunt, even describing that feels like another analytic dodge; underneath it I'm afraid they'll devalue me if I stop performing, and that fear is what actually keeps me from saying it.

Therapist: When you say that fear of being devalued keeps you from saying "I'm exhausted," what's one tiny thing you can acknowledge about that fear that isn't about the outcome – like the physical sensation in your chest or the thought that runs through your head when you imagine it happening?

Patient: There's a low, hollow tightness under my sternum—like someone's slowly tightening a belt—and my breathing gets shallower when I imagine saying it. The thought that immediately loops is, "If I'm not producing value, I'm disposable," and almost reflexively I start drafting a strategic response instead of actually feeling the fear.

Therapist: Notice the tightness under your sternum right now – can you touch it, feel its edges, and just say "this tightness is here" without trying to do anything with it or chase the thought away?

Patient: Okay — I'm putting my hand there now. I can feel that low, hollow tightness under my sternum; this tightness is here. Even as I say it, my brain's already trying to classify it as an "interoceptive alarm" and draft a plan to fix it, which feels like the usual dodge. It actually feels a little exposing to just sit with it; can we slow down and stay with this for a bit? I'm willing to try, but I'm nervous about what happens if I don't turn it into a project.

Therapist: When you say you're nervous about what happens if you don't turn it into a project, what's the one thing you're holding onto that's keeping you from taking the tiny step of just sitting with the tightness – is it the thought "I have to fix this," or something else?

Patient: I think it's that imperative—"I have to fix this"—but more precisely a metacognitive rule that discomfort equals failure, so my reflex is to neutralize it immediately. I cling to classifying and problem-solving because if I don't, there's this raw fear that I'm not enough and that I'll be judged or discarded. I'm saying that in my usual analytical way, but I can also feel the fear again—my hands go a bit clammy—so I'd like to try staying with it, even though I'm anxious about not moving straight to a plan.

Therapist: What's the one thing that matters most to you right now, when you're feeling that raw fear of not being enough, that's not about avoiding the discomfort but about staying connected to that person – can you name it without trying to fix it or analyze it?

Patient: That I won't be abandoned if I stop performing — just to be seen and held as imperfect, not evaluated. Saying that feels acute right now; my chest tightens and my thoughts are skittering, so I'm trying not to turn it into a checklist or a theory, but it's hard.

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your chest right now, just before your thoughts start skittering – is it the tightness, the heaviness, or something else? Can you stay with that sensation, without trying to do anything with it or analyze it, just for one breath?

Patient: It's that narrow tightness again—like a band under my sternum with a jittery flutter above it—and my breath gets thin. I can try one slow breath with it: inhale… exhale… but my mind's already labeling it as "alarm" and plotting solutions, so I'm getting anxious and distracted. Can we just sit with that for a moment?

Therapist: When you say "my mind's labeling it as 'alarm' and plotting solutions," notice that you're not just identifying the thought – you're also noticing the effort it takes to push that thought away. What would happen if you just allowed that thought to be there, without trying to control it or change it?

Patient: Analytically, I know allowing the thought would probably reduce the secondary suffering from trying to suppress it — less mental energy spent on control. But right now, if I just let it be, it feels like the band under my sternum stays, and a wash of shame and jittery panic rises in my throat. 

Okay — I'm going to try: the thought "If I'm not producing value, I'm disposable" is here. Inhale… exhale… it's still present, but maybe a little less panicky when I don't immediately draft a solution; my mind is still skittering, though, and I'm anxious about losing control. Can we slow down and sit with that for a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the band under your sternum, still present, but what's the sensation just beneath that band – is it warmth, heaviness, or something else? Can you touch that sensation with your awareness, without trying to push the thought away or change it?

Patient: There's a warm, leaden hollow right under that band — like something pooling and pulling downward, with a little jittery flutter on top. I can try to put my attention there: when I do it softens a hair, but then my brain immediately calls it an "alarm signal" and starts drafting fixes, which makes me anxious and scattered. I'd like to stay with it longer because it does feel a bit less sharp when I do, but I'm nervous and my thoughts keep skittering to next steps — can we slow down and keep sitting with it?

Therapist: Notice the phrase "my brain immediately calls it an 'alarm signal' and starts drafting fixes" – what's the first word that comes to mind when you hear "drafting fixes"? Can you say it out loud, without judgment, and then just notice what happens to your physical sensations – is the band under your sternum still present, or has it shifted in any way?

Patient: "Compulsivity." Saying it feels oddly blunt — the band under my sternum is still there, maybe a hair less sharp but the hollow under it feels heavier, my breath's thin, and my attention keep drifting; I don't have the energy to keep corralling the thoughts right now.

Therapist: Notice the heaviness of that feeling, just beneath the band under your sternum – what would it take for you to hold that heaviness in your body, without trying to change it or fix it, just for one moment? Can you say "I will hold this heaviness" to yourself, and then gently notice what happens?

Patient: "I will hold this heaviness." 

I put my hand there — the warm, leaden hollow is still pooled under the band; it softens a hair when I notice it, my breath eases a little but stays thin, and my thoughts are still skittering around the edges. I don't have the energy to keep corralling or reclassifying it right now, so can we stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the thinness of your breath – is it just a physical sensation, or is it tied to a thought like "I need to calm down"? Can you say "the thinness is here" to yourself, without trying to do anything with it, just to see what happens?

Patient: It's both — there's the thinness as a bodily thing and the thought tagging it as "I need to calm down," which just makes me hold it more. The thinness is here.

Saying that out loud loosens it a bit, my breath lengthens by a hair, but my thoughts are still skittering; I don't really have the energy to chase them away right now. Can we keep sitting with this for a little longer?

Therapist: Notice the lengthening of your breath – what's the sensation of that lengthening, just as it is? Can you say "the length is here" to yourself, without trying to make it longer or shorter, just to see what happens?

Patient: "The length is here." 

It feels like a fragile extra half-second in my inhale and exhale, a small widening that eases the band a hair while the hollow under it lingers. My mind's already gearing up to name it and plan a fix, and I don't have the energy to keep corralling those thoughts right now—can we stay with this for a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the hollow under the band – what's its relationship to the lengthening of your breath? Is it still there, or has it shifted in some way? Can you say "the hollow is still here" to yourself, without trying to do anything with it, just to see what happens?

Patient: "The hollow is still here." It feels pooled and anchored beneath the band — it softens a sliver with that extra half-second of breath but mostly stays lodged, pulling downward. My brain wants to rename it and theorize (I even thought "existential deficit"), but my energy's thin and I can't keep corralling those impulses right now — can we stay with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the hollow pulling downward – what's its physical quality, just as it is? Is it heavy, light, tight, or loose? Can you touch that sensation with your awareness, without trying to push it or change it, just to see what happens?

Patient: It's heavy — like wet lead pooling and pulling down, tight at the rim and loose in the middle. When I touch it with attention it softens a little, but it also makes me more tired and jumpy; my brain's already itching to problem-solve and I don't have the energy, so I'm just holding it for now.

Therapist: Notice how holding onto the heaviness is making you feel – tired, jumpy, what else? Is it a physical sensation, or is it a thought or emotion that's arising from holding onto it? Can you say "this tiredness is here" to yourself, without trying to push it away, just to see what happens?

Patient: It's a dull, leaden tiredness — heavy in my limbs and foggy in my head — with a jittery edge like low-grade panic and a slow, resigned thought that I'm running out of reserve. "This tiredness is here." Saying that eases it a little, but my reflex is already to label it "allostatic load" and draft solutions, and I don't have the energy for that right now — can we just sit with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the thought "I'm running out of reserve" – what's its relationship to the heaviness and tiredness? Is it a prediction, a fear, or a fact? Can you say "this thought is here" to yourself, without trying to do anything with it, just to see what happens?

Patient: "This thought is here."

It feels like a fearful prediction — but my brain instantly treats it as an incontrovertible fact, which makes the band tighten and the hollow feel deeper and more draining. Saying it out loud loosens it a little, but I'm pretty spent and my mind is itching to draft solutions anyway, so can we just stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "this thought is a fact" – does the tension in your body change? Does the heaviness or tiredness shift? Can you just observe the thought itself, without labeling it, just to see what happens?

Patient: Saying "this thought is a fact" makes the band tighten and the hollow pull deeper — the thought becomes heavier, my breath gets shallower. If I just notice the sentence as a passing mental event instead of reifying it, it loses a bit of its power and my body eases a hair, but I'm too drained to keep catching and reframing it for long.

Therapist: Notice the thought itself, without labeling it as a fact or trying to change it – just observe its presence, its tone, its texture. What does it feel like to let go of the need to label it, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: When I try to let go of labeling, it opens a small quiet space — like being off-script — and that's oddly exposing; my chest softens a hair but a jittery panic edges into my throat. My brain immediately starts narrating it ("this is adaptive," "this is risky"), which pulls me back into analysis before I can really feel anything. I'm pretty worn out, so can we just linger in that quiet a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the quiet space in your chest, just as it is – without trying to push the jittery panic away or analyze it. What does it feel like to be in this space, without judgment or trying to change it? Can you simply be with the quiet, without labeling it as "exposure" or "anxiety"?

Patient: Okay — when I let it be, the quiet is like a thin cool hollow, a little pause in the static under the band. It softens things a bit, but it also feels exposed and there’s this tiny seep of panic at the edges; my brain immediately wants to label it and draft a fix, but I'm trying not to. I can stay with it for a breath or two, though I'm pretty drained and my attention keeps drifting — can we just linger here a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice how the panic shows up just as you're about to label it – what's the physical sensation of that panic, just before your mind starts to analyze it? Can you pause that moment, before the labeling happens, and just notice the panic as it is – without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: It's really hard to not turn it into a theory, but I'll try: right before the labeling, there's a hot, quick jolt behind my sternum, my breath almost catches, my throat tightens and my hands go a bit clammy. If I pause there, it's just that raw, jagged energy — no words, just a sting and a flutter — but my brain already wants to tag it "alarm" and fix it. I can hold it for a beat, though my attention's skittering and I'm jittery; can we stay with that for a moment?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of holding onto that hot, quick jolt behind your sternum – what's its texture, its size, its location? Can you simply be with it, without trying to push it away or analyze it, just for a breath? Don't try to make sense of it or change it – just be with the sensation of holding onto it.

Patient: Okay — when I hold that hot, quick jolt it's like a small, searing pebble lodged just behind my sternum, a bit to the left; texture is sharp and prickly with an electric buzz at the edges. It's about the size of a cherry pit, concentrated, and when I breathe into it for one slow inhale it flares briefly then softens a hair, like heat spreading and then cooling. My reflex is to name it and write a plan — "panic spike," "alarm" — but when I actually try to just be with the sensation it loses some of its jaggedness, though I'm shaky and my attention keeps wanting to skitter away. I don't have much energy, so can we stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice what happens to your body when you breathe into the sensation, just for one slow inhale – what's the physical sensation of that inhale, the movement of your chest, the expansion of your lungs? Can you stay with that sensation, just for a moment, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: When I breathe into it, my ribs widen a little and my diaphragm drops—the inhale is slow and surprisingly shallow, like a small lift under the sternum; that little searing pebble flares for a moment and then softens a hair as air fills the space. There's a thin warmth that trickles down and my throat loosens a bit, but my mind's already drafting a diagram of the response and I don't have the energy to chase it—can we just hold that inhale a bit longer?
