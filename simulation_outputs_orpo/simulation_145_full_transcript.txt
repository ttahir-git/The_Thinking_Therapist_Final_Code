Patient: I guess I've been using procrastination to numb a lot of uncomfortable stuff — mostly grief from a recent loss — and it's getting in the way of this demanding program I just started. I keep filling my days with small tasks and distractions instead of dealing with how awful it feels. I don't know, talking about it feels messy and kind of hard.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a classic avoidance strategy ("numbing"), which has become a coping mechanism for the intense emotional pain from your recent loss. The goal here is to gently expose this avoidance without pushing you away from the emotions. Specifically, I want to explore the tangible "messiness" of avoidance and its impact on your daily life.

Therapist Answer:
When you say "talking about it feels messy," what's the smallest, most tangible thing you avoid doing because of that feeling – like, what's the first thing you'd put off if you weren't already doing small tasks?

Patient: I guess it's opening the folder on my laptop with their photos and messages — there's a folder literally named with their name and I just don't click it. Even looking at one photo feels like it'll make it real, so I tidy or do busywork instead. I don't know, it just overwhelms me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The folder with their name is a tangible trigger, and you're avoiding it by doing busywork – a classic avoidance strategy. This avoidance is making it hard for you to engage with the program, and I want to explore the value behind opening that folder. Specifically, what's the one thing about looking at their photos that feels most overwhelming to you?

Therapist Answer:
What's the one photo that, if you looked at it, would be the smallest step towards remembering them, rather than avoiding them – just that one photo?

Patient: I guess it's that one of them laughing at the park, holding that ridiculous blue mug they always had. I don't know, even thinking about opening it makes my chest tighten like it'll force me to admit they're really gone.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The image of them laughing at the park with that blue mug is a powerful trigger – the laughter is a happy memory, but the mug is a tangible reminder of their presence. You're avoiding this moment because it feels like it will "force" you to acknowledge they're really gone, which is a huge value to protect – not wanting to feel that pain again.

Therapist Answer:
What's one tiny thing you could do with that photo – just one tiny thing – that wouldn't be avoiding it but still honoring their memory, like keeping it on your phone as a lock screen?

Patient: I guess I could set that photo as my phone lock screen for a day — like, just have them pop up every time I check my phone so I don't keep pretending they're not there. I don't know, it feels tiny enough to handle, but also like it could make me start crying in the middle of class and I hate that thought.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a tiny, manageable step that might make the photo more present in your daily life, but it's still rooted in avoidance – the fear of crying in class is a big value to protect. I want to pivot to exploring the value behind crying itself, rather than avoiding the photo. What would it be like if you allowed yourself to cry about that photo in class, without trying to hold it back – what might that actually mean for your connection to your grief?
