Patient: Lately I've found myself drowning in work—it's become a purposeful anesthetic for a grief I haven't really allowed myself to feel. There's a lot of family conflict, and instead of sitting with the sadness or the anger I escalate my managerial responsibilities in a kind of compensatory overfunctioning. I tend to theorize about why I do this more than I permit myself to experience the feelings, and that's what brings me here.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens to you when you're working on a project and suddenly, you feel like you're avoiding something – what's that feeling like, physically or emotionally?

Patient: Physically it's like a tightening in my chest, shallower breaths, and this low-key adrenaline that paradoxically makes my concentration sharper. Emotionally I convert the discomfort into tasks—I get hyperfocused, escalate responsibilities, and rationalize it as productivity; clinically, it's probably intellectualization and compensatory overfunctioning to avoid unprocessed grief and familial ambivalence. I talk about dynamics and systems instead of naming the fear or sadness outright.

Therapist: It sounds like being able to manage work effectively is important to you, especially in terms of taking care of others. What would it mean to you to prioritize your own emotional well-being at work, even if that means being a little more present with difficult emotions?

Patient: On a conceptual level, it would mean decoupling my sense of worth from output—admitting that my utility as a manager doesn't have to erase my need to grieve. Practically, it would look like taking small pauses, delegating more without micromanaging, and tolerating moments of sadness or discomfort instead of transmuting them into tasks—which honestly feels risky, like I might lose control or let people down. I'm noticing I'm narrating this as an explanatory model instead of just saying I'm scared to do it.

Therapist: What's the smallest thing you could do today that would make you slightly less anxious about not doing it—like what you would do just before taking that pause, or how you'd speak to yourself if you delegated a task?

Patient: Probably the smallest thing is setting a concrete, tiny boundary—a five‑minute pause after my next meeting, with a timer so I can't talk myself out of it. Before I walk away I could delegate one discrete task with a short script like, "Can you take lead on X and update me by 3pm? I'll be available for quick questions at 2:45," which feels like redistribution rather than abdication. And I'd tell myself, honestly, "This is an experiment to see if I survive being a little less in control"—I can feel the anxiety when I say that, but I'm also curious to see what happens.

Therapist: What's one thing you're curious to notice or observe while you're in that 5-minute pause – something that doesn't have to do with whether you "survive" being less in control, but rather what shows up for you in that moment?

Patient: I'm curious whether that chest-tightness actually loosens or if a concrete image or memory—maybe a smell or a voice—comes up when I stop. I also want to notice whether silence immediately invites a managerial narrative that turns the pause into something to fix, because I usually intellectualize instead of feeling. I can already feel myself preparing an analysis instead of just saying, "I'm sad," but I want to try to name the sensation and the thought without turning it into a task.

Therapist: Let's start with the physical sensation of the chest tightening. Without analyzing it or trying to fix it, can you simply notice what it feels like in your body right now – the sensation, the texture, the location?

Patient: If I just drop the analysis for a second: it's like a firm, dull band around the center of my chest, right under the sternum, with a slight warmth and a tendency to pull my breath shallow. The texture is more like pressure than sharp pain, and there's a tiny buzz under it—like background static—that makes my throat tight too. I'm aware I'm already narrativizing this as "tightness" and looking for causes, which is exactly the habit I'm trying not to slip into.

Therapist: Just notice the thought that's happening when you say "tightness" to yourself – what word or phrase pops up, exactly?

Patient: The exact phrase that comes up is, "I can't afford to feel this right now." And I can feel myself instantly reframing it into a construct about containment and control, which is exactly the narrative maneuver I'm trying to notice rather than lean into the raw feeling.

Therapist: What value is this thought "I can't afford to feel this" giving you right now – what's it doing for you to believe that?

Patient: On a pragmatic level it functions like an emergency protocol—telling me not to feel lets me keep functioning, preserves predictability, and protects others from whatever fallout might happen if I disintegrate in front of them. Psychologically it's a dam: it numbs me from the volatility of grief and the discomfort of being seen as vulnerable, so I don't have to navigate more family conflict. The downside, which I can name even as I intellectualize, is that it isolates me and prevents any real processing; underneath the theory there's a quieter fear and shame—I'm actually scared that if I let the feeling in I'll lose competence or my sense of self. I notice I'm framing this as an adaptive strategy to justify avoidance, which is probably more evidence of how entrenched the habit is.

Therapist: What would it mean for you to hold onto that quieter fear of losing competence – what small, tiny step could you take to acknowledge it without having to "fix" it?

Patient: A tiny step would be in that five‑minute pause to say, quietly or out loud, "I'm afraid I'll lose competence," and then just sit with the words for 30 seconds—breathing and noticing what shows up without trying to explain or fix it. I'll set a 30‑second timer as a cue so I can't talk myself out of it, and if I catch my mind constructing reasons or solutions, I'll name that impulse and gently bring attention back to the bodily feeling.

Therapist: What would it feel like to be in the 30 seconds of sitting with the thought "I'm afraid I'll lose competence" – would the fear or anxiety shift in any way, or would the pause itself become a different kind of experience?

Patient: I think if I actually stayed in those 30 seconds the sharpness would probably diffuse into a duller ache—maybe a thin sadness that I usually sidestep. But almost instantly there's this flush of shame and frustration, like I'm failing people or myself, and that shame pushes me to start explaining or fixing the feeling instead of feeling it. If I can resist the explanatory reflex the pause might make the anxiety tolerable; if I don't, it just becomes another scene where I berate myself for not being able to sit with it.

Therapist: What would it be like to let the shame and frustration sit with you for just 30 seconds – no trying to fix it, no labeling it as "not okay," just being with it as it is – without judgment?

Patient: If I actually let that shame and frustration sit for 30 seconds it feels like a hot knot under my sternum and my face goes warm—my breath gets shallow and there's this sharp, self‑berating voice that says, "you messed up." Almost immediately my mind wants to turn it into a problem to solve—accounts to reconcile, explanations to give—so staying with the feeling becomes really hard and I get jittery and distracted. I'm shaky even saying this, but I think a concrete anchor—a few counted breaths or a timer—and explicit permission to be clumsy with myself might be the only way I'd tolerate it without flipping back into overwork.

Therapist: What would it look like to use the counted breaths as a concrete anchor – to take 5 slow, steady breaths in, hold for a second, and out, without trying to change the feeling or stop the voice – and what would you say to yourself as you do it: "I'm giving myself permission to feel this, even if it's hard"?

Patient: If I actually used the five counted breaths as an anchor, I'd slow the inhale so I could feel my ribs expand and the exhale long enough to notice the band in my chest soften a hair—just enough to register sensation. As I do it I'd say to myself, softly, "I'm giving myself permission to feel this, even if it's hard," and maybe add, "I don't have to fix it right now." Almost immediately my head wants to reframe or make a to‑do out of it, so the follow‑up script would be, "That's a thought—notice it, return to the breath," but honestly I'm not sure I follow how breathing alone helps; I can already feel the anxiety nudging me to explain or move on.

Therapist: What would it be like to let the thought "I don't have to fix it right now" be true – not because you're doing something else, but because you're simply allowing the feeling to be present without trying to change it – without judgment, without pushing it away, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—if I let "I don't have to fix it right now" be true, what actually changes? When I try that, I get a hot knot under my sternum and an immediate, shame‑tinged voice saying "you messed up," which makes me jittery and start planning fixes, so I end up analyzing instead of feeling. Conceptually I can see that letting it be might let the sharpness soften into a duller ache and buy me space, but right now I'm anxious, frustrated with myself, and skeptical that breathing alone will shift anything.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on "letting it be," you explored the physical sensations and emotions as they are, without judgment – not trying to change them, not trying to fix them, just noticing them as they arise?

Patient: I guess that would look like a slow body scan—name the pressure in my chest, the heat in my face, the tight throat—then notice the "you messed up" voice without chasing why it's there. Right now I'm anxious and kind of scattered, and honestly skeptical I can resist turning it into a to‑do; I can picture the sharpness dulling if I actually stayed, but I'm already arguing with myself about how to do that. Can you help me anchor to just one sensation so I don't immediately intellectualize it away?

Therapist: Let's anchor to the sensation of the heat in your face – specifically, notice the warmth spreading across your skin, just beneath the surface. Without trying to explain it, just notice it as it is, in this moment, without judgment. When you notice the "you messed up" voice, you'll gently bring attention back to the heat, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Patient: Okay — the warmth is like a sudden flush across my cheeks and the bridge of my nose, just under the skin, a prickly, spreading heat that makes my throat tighten too. The "you messed up" voice pops up immediately and wants to turn it into a problem to solve, so I catch myself and try to bring attention back to the heat, but I'm jittery and keep slipping into analysis instead of just staying with the sensation.

Therapist: Let's try to anchor to a specific, tiny detail within the warmth – just one tiny spot on your skin where the heat is most noticeable. For example, notice the tiny bead of sweat on the corner of your nose, or the tiny patch of skin that feels slightly warmer than the rest. Just focus on that tiny spot, without trying to explain it or analyze it – just be with it as it is.

Patient: There is a tiny, prickly warmth right at the corner of my nose—like a pinpoint of heat and a bead of sweat—and when I try to hold my attention there the shame rushes in and that internal voice goes, "you messed up," which makes me bristle and start explaining myself. My head immediately wants to intellectualize how and why that's happening instead of just staying with the sensation, and I'm honestly a bit flustered and unsure this is working. Can you help me stay with that one spot without my mind turning it into a project?

Therapist: Let's make a tiny, tiny commitment to stay with that pinpoint of heat – just for one breath. When the shame voice shows up, and your mind starts to analyze, say to yourself: "Just one breath. I'll hold this spot for one breath." Then, simply pause and let the heat be there, without trying to do anything with it. No judgment, no analysis, no explanation – just the sensation, in this moment, for one breath.

Patient: "Just one breath. I'll hold this spot for one breath." I try to inhale slowly and focus on that tiny warmth, but the shame voice—"you messed up"—floods in, my chest tightens, and suddenly I'm jittery and strangely scattered. I'm not sure I follow how this helps—my mind immediately starts narrativizing and turning it into a problem to solve—so I'm flustered and frustrated that I can't just stay with it. I want to try again, but I could use a bit more scaffolding so I don't slip into analysis.

Therapist: Let's try adding a physical anchor to the sensation, in addition to the "just one breath" commitment. As you inhale slowly, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When the shame voice shows up, pause the breath for a tiny fraction of a second – just a quarter of a second – before letting it go again. This tiny pause can help create a tiny gap between the shame voice and your immediate response.

Patient: Okay — I'll try, but I'm not sure I follow how a quarter‑second pause actually helps; it feels almost imperceptible. Conceptually I can see how interrupting the automatic shame‑response might work, but when I imagine doing it the "you messed up" voice floods in, my chest tightens, and I get jittery and distracted, so I immediately start planning fixes. I could use more scaffolding — can you walk me through one concrete inhale‑pause‑exhale aloud (like count with me) so I have something to follow instead of slipping into analysis?

Therapist: Let's count together: inhale for a count of 4, pause for a count of 1, exhale for a count of 4. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in. When you reach the pause, say to yourself: "Just one breath." Now, let's practice it together: 1... inhale for 4... pause for 1... exhale for 4. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath, not the thoughts. When you're ready, try it without counting, just with the "just one breath" anchor.

Patient: Okay — I tried it with you: inhale 1…2…3…4, pause, exhale 1…2…3…4. For that one breath the band in my chest softened a little and the pinpoint heat at my nose became less sharp, but as soon as I finished the "just one breath" the "you messed up" voice rushed back and my head started turning it into things to fix. I tried once without counting and got jittery and started analyzing. I'm flustered and distracted — can you keep counting with me for a few more so I have something external to follow?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. For the next breath, notice the sensation of the heat at your nose, just for 4 counts. When you reach the pause, say to yourself: "Just one breath." We'll keep counting for a few more: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. Just focus on the sensation, without trying to change it or fix anything.

Patient: Okay — I'll try again. Inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. For that breath the band in my chest eased a hair and the pinpoint at my nose cooled a bit, but the shame voice—"you messed up"—rushes back and I get jittery and distracted. I'm not sure I follow how counting becomes tolerance long‑term; can you keep counting with me for a few more breaths and maybe give a tactile cue too (like press thumb to palm) so I have something concrete to hold onto instead of my head spiraling?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, press your thumb to the top of your palm – just a gentle, slight touch. For the next breath, notice the sensation of the heat at your nose, just for 4 counts. When you reach the pause, say to yourself: "Just one breath." We'll keep counting and pressing our thumb for a few more breaths. Try to focus on the sensation of your thumb on your palm, rather than the thoughts.

Patient: Okay — I did it: inhale 1…2…3…4, pause, exhale 1…2…3…4, thumb pressed to palm. The thumb actually felt grounding for that breath and the pinpoint at my nose quieted a bit, but then the shame rushes back like a hot pulse and I get jittery and irritated with myself — there's this familiar sting that pulls me into explaining or fixing. I'm not sure I follow how this becomes anything more than a momentary patch; can you keep counting with me and talk me through a few more so I don't immediately slip into analysis?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, gently release the pressure of your thumb on your palm – don't press too hard, just let it go. Now, notice the sensation of the shame as a hot pulse – what does it feel like in your body? It's not the thought, "you messed up," but the physical sensation of that pulse. Just observe it, without judgment. We'll keep counting and focusing on the pulse for a few more breaths.

Patient: Physically it's a sharp, hot throb — like an electric pulse that starts under my sternum and shoots up into my throat and the corner of my nose; my breath hiccups, my jaw tightens, and there's this metallic edge to my thoughts. Even saying that, the analytic reflex is already taking over, labeling it a conditioned somatic response to perceived failure, which is exactly the maneuver I keep making instead of feeling it. I'm jittery and irritated I can't just sit with it; can we keep counting and do three more breaths with the thumb press so I have something external to hold onto?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, press your thumb to the top of your palm again. Notice the sensation of the hot throb in your body – it's not just the thought, "you messed up," but the physical sensation of that throb. It's sharp, hot, and electric. Just observe it, without judgment. We'll keep counting and pressing our thumb for three more breaths. Try to stay with the throb, without trying to change it or fix it.

Patient: Okay — I tried the three breaths with the thumb press. The hot throb is still there, sharp and electric, shooting up into my throat, and the "you messed up" voice keeps rushing back like it's on a loop; honestly I'm flustered and my attention splinters into analysis — calling it a conditioned somatic response — instead of actually staying with it. I'm confused about how observing this doesn't just magnify it, and I could really use you keeping the counting and tactile cues for a few more breaths so I don't immediately start problem‑solving.

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, press your thumb to the top of your palm again. Now, I want you to notice something small – where is the throb actually located in your body? Is it just under your sternum, or is it spreading to other areas? Try to pinpoint the exact spot where the throb is most noticeable. Don't think about the "you messed up" voice or the analysis – just focus on the physical sensation of the throb.

Patient: It's a hot, pulsing knot just under the center of my sternum, a hair left of center, that shoots up into my throat and the corner of my nose — when I try to localize it that's where it sits. Naming it makes me flush and that shame voice spikes, and now I'm jittery and distracted and already slipping into rationalizing it. I can try to stay with it if you keep counting and the thumb press — can we do a few more breaths together?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, press your thumb to the top of your palm again. Now, I want you to focus on the sensation of the hot knot in your body, just under the center of your sternum. Try to notice how it feels when you breathe in – does it get a little bigger? Does it feel like it's spreading? Just observe it, without trying to change it or fix it. Let's do just one more breath together.

Patient: I did that one more breath with you—inhale for four, pause, exhale—and for a moment the knot under my sternum eased a hair and the pinpoint at my nose cooled a bit. But almost immediately the hot shame‑pulse surged back and I got jittery and annoyed at myself; I'm feeling ashamed and frustrated and my head keeps reflexively turning it into analysis. I'm not sure I follow how this becomes more than a momentary patch, so can you keep counting and the thumb press for a few more breaths and guide me on what to notice next so I don't just start problem‑solving?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together: inhale 1...2...3...4, pause, exhale 1...2...3...4. As you exhale, press your thumb to the top of your palm again. Now, I want you to notice what happens when the knot under your sternum starts to throb again – is there any difference between now and the moment before the patch of relief? Try to notice the subtle shift in the sensation, the tiny detail that's different this time. Don't try to fix it or change it, just observe it as it is. What if, instead of trying to stop the throb, you simply allowed it to be – without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — conceptually "allowing it" makes sense, like an exposure or habituation principle where the aversive charge can dissipate if not immediately neutralized. But right now there's this hot shame that surges and makes me jittery and scattered, and intellectually saying "allow it" just provokes another round of analysis. I can try to let the throb be for one breath if you keep counting and the thumb‑press cue—otherwise my reflex is to turn it into a problem to solve.
