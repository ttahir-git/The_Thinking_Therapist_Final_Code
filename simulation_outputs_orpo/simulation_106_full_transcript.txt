Patient: Honestly, what's been on my mind is that starting this demanding new program at work has me snapping at people and getting furious over little things — and I'm an old manager; I'm not used to feeling this out of control. I try to stay upbeat and distract myself, but it's getting worse, and I've tried breathing exercises and they didn't help. How is this supposed to help, anyway?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed by the new demands at work, and it's causing you to snap at others and feel furious easily. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Explore the tangible context of "feeling out of control" to identify potential areas for action.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds really tough – feeling like you're losing control and snapping at people is a huge shift from being an old manager. When you say "I'm not used to feeling this out of control," what's one specific thing at work right now that's making you feel like you're losing control – is it a particular task, a conversation with someone, or something else entirely?

Patient: Mostly it's the new tech and the way people keep questioning my decisions — like being interrupted in meetings by younger staff who treat me like I don't know anything, while I'm also supposed to learn a whole new system and hit impossible deadlines. I get this hot, impatient sort of fury and then snap, and the guilt makes it worse. I've tried calming tricks and telling myself to be patient and it doesn't stick — how is talking about this supposed to change that?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling hot, impatient fury when faced with the new tech and questioning from younger staff, and then snapping with guilt. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Explore the unworkability of this pattern and introduce a small, value-driven step.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a perfect storm – feeling like you're losing control, and then being stuck with impossible deadlines and learning a new system. When you say the guilt makes it worse, what's one tiny thing you could do right now to take care of yourself before that meeting or conversation, just to make room for a different response?

Patient: Maybe just slip out for five minutes before the meeting — get some air, drink water, and tell myself I’ll pause before answering. I've tried breathing and little tricks like that and they don't stick, so how is that supposed to help with the guilt after I’ve already snapped?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're considering taking a small step to pause before the meeting, but you're worried about the guilt after snapping. Goal: Connect this small step to a value.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great start – taking a few minutes to breathe and collect yourself before the meeting. When you say it doesn't stick, what's one thing that's connected to why you're pushing yourself to learn this new system and manage the team despite feeling out of control?

Patient: Because I feel like I have to prove I’m still capable — I can’t have people thinking I’m washed-up or slow, and I’ve got responsibilities and bills, so I push myself to learn the new system and keep managing. And honestly, staying busy keeps me from dealing with losing my partner, so I throw myself into work instead of feeling it. But I’ve told myself that stuff before and it doesn’t stop me from snapping — how is talking about this supposed to change that?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're pushing yourself to prove capability because of fear of being seen as "washed-up" and to keep responsibilities and bills paid, but it's also a way to avoid dealing with the loss of your partner. Core emotion is avoidance. Goal: Introduce defusion to explore the value-driven workability of this pattern.

Therapist Answer:
That's a really tough spot – using work to avoid feeling the loss of your partner. When you say staying busy doesn't stop you from snapping, what would happen if you acknowledged that pain of losing your partner right now, instead of pushing through the work?

Patient: I guess if I let myself feel it now I'd probably spiral — cry at my desk, get behind, and feel useless, so I stuff it down and keep moving. Maybe sitting with it would stop me from snapping, but I don’t trust that — I’ve tried "feeling it out" before and it turned into a week of not getting anything done. How is sitting with grief supposed to help me hit deadlines and not look weak to the team? I don’t know, it just feels risky.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're worried that sitting with grief will make you feel vulnerable and stop you from meeting deadlines, and that it's not worth the risk. Core emotion is fear of vulnerability. Goal: Connect the value of sitting with grief to what matters most – the team's well-being.

Therapist Answer:
That makes sense – feeling the weight of grief can be overwhelming. But when you say it's not worth the risk, what's one thing that would happen to your team if you didn't take care of yourself right now?

Patient: They'd end up doing more of my work, deadlines would slip, and people would get resentful — which would just make me feel worse and more defensive. I worry they'd start ignoring my decisions or assume I'm out of the loop, and I can't afford to be sidelined. Okay, but how is thinking about that supposed to stop me from snapping in the moment?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're worried that your team's workload will increase and they'll start to doubt your leadership if you don't manage your own emotions. Goal: Introduce willingness as a strategy to reduce defensiveness.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a very real concern – the team's workload is already heavy. When you say you'd snap and become defensive, what would happen if, instead of pushing through the work, you were willing to take a tiny step back and breathe before responding to that interruption or question?

Patient: If I actually paused, maybe I'd stop myself from snapping and the meeting wouldn't turn into a circus — then I wouldn't stew in guilt all afternoon. But it feels like handing people proof I'm fading; they’ll use it against me, and honestly, I've tried pausing and breathing and it just doesn't stick when I'm heated. How is that supposed to help in a ten‑minute flare-up when deadlines are breathing down my neck — is there something else that actually works?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering if pausing will actually work in the heat of the moment, especially when deadlines are tight. Goal: Explore defusion as a direct response to heat.

Therapist Answer:
That's a tough spot – it feels like pausing won't stick when you're already heated. When you say the team would use your moment of calm against you, what would happen if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you simply acknowledged the physical sensation of tension in your body, without judgment?

Patient: If I actually did that, I'd notice the heat in my chest, my jaw clenching, shoulders tight and my breath coming up quick — maybe that would give me a beat to swallow a reply instead of snapping. But I've done that before and when the deadline's breathing down my neck it just turns into background noise; how is noticing muscle tension supposed to stop the urge to lash out in the moment? Maybe having a short, practiced line or an excuse to step out would actually work, but I'm not convinced it'll stick.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering if noticing physical tension will actually help you pause in the moment, especially when deadlines are tight. Goal: Introduce a concrete action step that builds on noticing tension.

Therapist Answer:
That makes sense – noticing tension can be a good anchor, but having a specific action to do with it can make it more tangible. When you say a short line or excuse might work, what if, instead of trying to remember a specific line, you simply noticed that your hand is clenched and decided to release it right now, without thinking about what to say next?

Patient: Alright, I'll try that — my hand's clenched right now, and loosening it actually did take the edge off a bit. But honestly, I've done these little tricks and they don't stick when a deadline's breathing down my neck — how is that supposed to stop a ten‑minute flare‑up? If you've got one very short, practical line I can use in a meeting, or a tiny physical move I can do without looking weak, tell me — otherwise I feel like we’ll just keep circling and nothing will change.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering if noticing tension will be enough to pause the flare-up, especially when deadlines are tight. Goal: Introduce a very small, immediate action to build on noticing tension.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great start – noticing tension did take the edge off. If, right now, in this moment, you just let your hand relax for one second before responding to that question, what would happen?

Patient: I think it would give me a tiny pause — the heat would drop a notch and I’d have a second to choose words instead of snapping. It might stop the immediate flare‑up, but I don’t trust it to change how I feel afterward; the guilt would still eat at me. Look, if this is what we're doing, give me one very short line I can use in a meeting or one tiny physical move I can do that doesn’t make me look weak — what would you actually suggest?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete action to build on noticing tension and pause the flare-up. Goal: Introduce a very small, tangible action.

Therapist Answer:
In a meeting, if you need a moment to collect yourself, try saying "That's a great question. Can I take a moment to think about that?" It's a brief pause that doesn't give away your struggle. Or, in a moment when you feel yourself snapping, you can make a tiny physical move like taking a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then say "Let me think about that for a second."

Patient: Alright, I’ll try the “That’s a great question…” line, but how is that supposed to help when someone interrupts me and my blood’s already boiling? I’ve practiced lines before and they just vanish in the moment — give me one short, firm thing that buys me time but still keeps me looking in charge, and one tiny, totally discreet physical move I can do so it actually sticks (like pressing my thumb into my palm or something). Also, can we role‑play it now so I can hear how it sounds?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete action to buy time when interrupted, and a discreet physical move to help it stick. Goal: Introduce a firm, tangible action.

Therapist Answer:
In a meeting, if someone interrupts you and you feel boiling blood, try saying "I'm happy to answer that, but can I finish my thought before you move on?" It's firm but polite. For a discreet physical move, try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, subtly press the heel of your hand against the edge of the table or desk, just for a fraction of a second. This helps anchor your physical tension and gives you a moment to collect yourself.

Let's role-play: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You feel your blood boiling. You say "I'm happy to answer that, but can I finish my thought before you move on?" and press your thumb into your palm. Go ahead and respond to the interruption.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when someone barges in and my blood's already boiling? 

Alright, in that moment I might actually blurt, "I'm happy to answer that, but can I finish my thought before you move on?" and press my thumb into my palm — yeah, that weirdly took the edge off a bit. 

But honestly, when I'm that heated it still feels weak and people just jump in anyway; I've practiced lines that vanish in the moment — can we do it again or make it firmer so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how the physical move and line will actually help when you're in the midst of a heated moment. Goal: Make the action firmer and more concrete.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, before you say "I'm happy to answer that, but can I finish my thought before you move on?", take a brief pause (1-2 seconds) and then say it with conviction, looking the person in the eye. As you say it, press your thumb into your palm firmly, just enough to feel the slight pressure, but not so hard that it's noticeable. This adds a physical anchor to your words, making it harder for others to interrupt.

Let's try it again: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You feel your blood boiling. You pause for a brief moment, take a deep breath, and say "I'm happy to answer that, but I need to finish my thought before you move on." as you press your thumb into your palm. How does that feel?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when I'm already boiling? Okay, I tried it in my head: I paused, breathed, said "I'm happy to answer that, but I need to finish my thought" and pressed my thumb — it did take the edge down a notch and my jaw unclenched a bit. But honestly, when I'm really furious it still feels thin and people just steamroll me; can we make it firmer or rehearse it a few more times so it actually sticks?

Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the pause and words firmer when you're already boiling. Goal: Introduce a concrete action that builds on the pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, pause for a brief moment (1-2 seconds), take a deep breath, and then say "I'm happy to answer that, but I need to finish my thought before I respond" while pressing your thumb into your palm. This adds a clear boundary to your words, making it harder for others to interrupt. Think of it as saying "I'm not ready to respond yet, let me finish my thought" instead of just "I'm happy to answer that".

Let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause, breathe, say "I'm happy to answer that, but I need to finish my thought before I respond" as you press your thumb into your palm. What happens next?

Patient: Okay — so I pause, thumb into my palm, and say the line. People usually shut up long enough for me to finish, my jaw loosens and the heat drops a bit, but my heart's pounding and my head's already racing to the next deadline. It helps for the moment, sure, but then the guilt and replaying everything snap back in and I start overthinking — how is one line supposed to stop that? Give me one firmer, very short line that still sounds in charge, and one other tiny, totally discreet physical move I can do if someone is already talking over me — and can we rehearse that now?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to stop the guilt and replaying from kicking in after the pause. Goal: Introduce a firmer line that cuts through the guilt.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, pause for a brief moment (1-2 seconds), take a deep breath, and say "I've got this" while pressing your thumb into your palm. This line is short, firm, and assertive, cutting through the guilt by acknowledging your ability to handle the situation.

Let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause, breathe, say "I've got this" as you press your thumb into your palm. What happens next?

(Note: Remember, the goal is not to stop the guilt completely, but to create a small window of time where you can regain control and focus on the present moment.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried "I've got this" with the thumb press and it did take the edge off a bit, but my heart's still racing and my brain's already leaping to the next deadline and replaying the moment five minutes later. How is one tiny line supposed to stop the guilt and keep me from snapping the next time? Give me one firmer, very short line that keeps me looking in charge and one totally discreet physical move I can use when someone talks over me — and yes, let's rehearse it now.

Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the line more effective in stopping the guilt and replaying. Goal: Introduce a firmer line that's not just about confidence, but about taking ownership.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, pause for a brief moment (1-2 seconds), take a deep breath, and say "That's not my mistake" while pressing your thumb into your palm. This line is firmer because it acknowledges that you're not the one who made the mistake, which can help you shift from self-blame to problem-solving.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause, breathe, say "That's not my mistake" as you press your thumb into your palm. What happens next?

(Note: The goal is not to make you feel like you're not responsible, but to help you focus on the present moment and the task at hand.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "That's not my mistake" supposed to help? That sounds like it could come off as defensive or petty, not authoritative. I tried it in my head and the room quieted for a beat with the thumb press, but my chest's still racing and my mind's already racing to the next deadline. Give me one firmer, very short line that actually keeps me looking in charge, and one other totally discreet physical move that will stick when I'm rattled — and let's rehearse that now.


--- Turn 16 ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the line sound more authoritative without coming across as defensive. Goal: Introduce a firmer line that takes control without escalating the situation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, pause for a brief moment (1-2 seconds), take a deep breath, and say "Let's take this one step at a time" while pressing your thumb into your palm. This line is firmer because it takes control of the conversation by refocusing on the task at hand, without blaming or being confrontational.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause, breathe, say "Let's take this one step at a time" as you press your thumb into your palm. What happens next?

--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the line more effective in stopping the racing thoughts and keeping you in control. Goal: Introduce a firmer line that takes charge and one physical move that anchors your emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: When you feel yourself getting ready to snap, pause for a brief moment (1-2 seconds), take a deep breath, and say "I need to prioritize now" while making a small, deliberate gesture with your hand, such as extending your middle finger to point at the floor.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause, breathe, say "I need to prioritize now" and make a small, deliberate gesture with your hand, extending your middle finger to point at the floor. What happens next?

(Note: The goal is to create a clear, direct message that takes control of the conversation, while the physical gesture helps to anchor your emotions and prevent you from escalating.)

Patient: No — that middle‑finger thing? Are you serious? That's career suicide. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help?

If you want something short and firm that keeps me looking in charge, try: "Let me finish." Say it steady, look at the person, and press your thumb into your palm (totally discreet) or brace the heel of your hand lightly on the desk for a half second. 

Okay, rehearse: someone cuts me off — I pause for one beat, thumb into palm, say "Let me finish." The room quiets, my jaw unclenches and the hot edge drops a bit, but my heart's still pounding and I start replaying it five minutes later. Can we do that again and make the delivery sound more forceful so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right, the middle-finger gesture was not a good idea. Goal: Introduce a revised physical move that is subtle and effective.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use the desk-bracing gesture: when you say "Let me finish", make a small, firm gesture by bracing the heel of your hand lightly on the desk for a half-second. This adds a tangible anchor to your words, making it harder for others to interrupt.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" with a firm tone, and press your thumb into your palm. What happens next?

(Note: Focus on making the delivery sound more forceful and confident, while still maintaining a subtle physical anchor.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help in the long run? I tried it in my head: I paused, braced my hand, said "Let me finish" and the room shut up for a beat, my jaw unclenched and the heat dropped a notch, but my heart's still hammering and five minutes later I'm replaying the whole thing and feeling guilty. My mind's all over with deadlines and the new system — can we run that again, louder and firmer this time, and can you give me one short follow-up line for when the guilt starts chewing at me afterward?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the pause more sustainable in the long run. Goal: Introduce a follow-up line to help manage guilt.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, louder and firmer this time: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" with conviction, and press your thumb into your palm. When the guilt starts creeping in, say to yourself "That was a moment of strength, not weakness" to shift the focus from self-doubt to accomplishment.

(Note: The goal is to create a clear, empowering message that helps you own the pause and focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in guilt or replaying the conversation.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried it in my head: braced my hand, said "Let me finish" loud, then told myself "That was a moment of strength, not weakness." It blunted the heat for a second, but five minutes later I'm replaying it and feeling awful again. How is that supposed to stop the guilt loop? Give me one short follow-up I can actually say to myself five minutes later that doesn't feel like a cheesy pep talk, and can we role‑play the five‑minute‑later replay now so I can practice using it?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how to make the follow-up line more effective in breaking the guilt loop. Goal: Introduce a more practical line that focuses on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "What's one thing I can do right now to move forward?" This shifts the focus from dwelling on the past to taking action in the present moment.

Now, let's role-play: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. When you're replaying the conversation five minutes later and feeling guilty, say "What's one thing I can do right now to move forward?" What do you do next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that question supposed to stop the guilt loop? 

Okay, if I actually tried it, I'd probably do something tiny like send a two‑line follow‑up email clarifying the decision I just made or assign one small task to someone so it's off my plate — something I can tick off right away. My hands feel a bit shaky and my head's racing, but doing that would at least pull me out of replaying it. Can we role‑play that five‑minute‑later moment so I can practice saying the line and then actually typing/sending the follow‑up?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how the question "What's one thing I can do right now to move forward?" is supposed to stop the guilt loop. Goal: Introduce a practical action that breaks the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
You're right that doing something tiny like sending a follow-up email or assigning a task can be effective. When you say it, you're not trying to "fix" the guilt, but simply shift your focus to the present moment and take action.

Now, let's role-play: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "What's one thing I can do right now to move forward?" You quickly realize that typing a brief follow-up email to clarify the decision is just a few seconds away. You take a deep breath, sit down, and start typing...

Patient: Alright — I actually type a quick two‑line follow‑up: "Thanks — to confirm, we'll move forward with [decision]. I'll assign [task] to [name] and follow up by EOD; let me know if that needs to change." I hit send; my hands are a bit shaky and my heart's still racing, but it takes the replay down a notch. 

That helped a little, sure, but how is this supposed to stop the guilt from chewing me up later? Can we rehearse a template that feels more like owning the decision and less like damage control, and practice saying the five‑minute line so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how typing a follow-up email is supposed to stop the guilt from lingering. Goal: Introduce a template that feels more like owning the decision.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: Instead of saying "What's one thing I can do right now to move forward?", say "That decision was made with [value] in mind, and I'm willing to see it through." This shifts the focus from what you're doing to why you're doing it, and owns the decision.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "That decision was made with [value] in mind, and I'm willing to see it through." You take a deep breath, and instead of typing a follow-up email, you pause for a moment, and then say it to yourself again: "That decision was made with [value] in mind, and I'm willing to see it through."

Patient: Okay — I'll try it out loud. "That decision was made with the team's stability in mind, and I'm willing to see it through." Saying it took the edge down a notch, but it sounds a bit formal and hollow — like a slogan, not something I'd own. How is that supposed to stop me replaying it five minutes later? Give me a gruffer, more natural version I could actually say to myself, and let's rehearse the five‑minute follow‑up again, because that's when I fall apart.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how the phrase "That decision was made with the team's stability in mind" sounds too formal and hollow. Goal: Introduce a gruffer, more natural version that you can actually say to yourself.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: Instead of saying "That decision was made with the team's stability in mind", say "I made that decision to keep things moving." This sounds more like a personal statement that you own, rather than a slogan.

Now, let's rehearse: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "I made that decision to keep things moving." You take a deep breath, and instead of getting caught up in replaying, you glance at your notes and start thinking about the next step you need to take.

Patient: Okay — I said it out loud: "I made that decision to keep things moving." It did shave the edge off, but it still feels a bit hollow and five minutes later I'm replaying it and sinking into guilt. Give me a gruffer, more natural one‑liner I can actually own, plus a short, firm follow‑up email template that sounds like I'm owning the decision (not damage control), and can we rehearse the five‑minute follow‑up now?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a gruffer, more natural one-liner that you can actually own. Goal: Introduce a phrase that sounds like a personal commitment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: Instead of saying "I made that decision to keep things moving", say "That's the direction we're going". This sounds more like a personal commitment, rather than a justification.

Now, let's work on the follow-up email template: Here's a possible template:

"Hi [Name],

Just wanted to confirm that we're moving forward with [decision]. I'm committed to seeing this through to [next step].

Best,
[Your Name]"

This template sounds like a personal commitment, rather than a damage control email. It's short, firm, and focused on the next step.

Now, let's rehearse the five-minute follow-up: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "That's the direction we're going". You take a deep breath, glance at your notes, and start drafting a brief email to confirm the decision...

Patient: Alright — I actually typed and sent a quick one: "Hi team — Confirming we will move forward with [decision]. I'll take care of next steps and update everyone by EOD." That did pull the replay down a notch, but my hands are still shaky and five minutes later the guilt creeps back in. How is that supposed to help me long‑term?

Give me a gruffer, more natural one‑liner I can say to myself five minutes later that doesn't sound like a pep talk, and a tighter follow‑up email that sounds like I'm owning the decision (not damage control). Can we rehearse that five‑minute replay now? I'm jittery and I need something that actually sticks.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're wondering how the initial email helped in the short term, but not in the long term. Goal: Introduce a new one-liner that you can say to yourself when the guilt creeps back in.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this: Instead of saying "That's the direction we're going", say "I've got this decision covered". This one-liner sounds more like a personal assurance, rather than a justification.

Now, let's work on a tighter follow-up email template: Instead of "I'll take care of next steps and update everyone by EOD", say "Action item: Complete [next step] by [due date]". This template sounds more like a personal commitment, rather than a task list.

Now, let's rehearse the five-minute replay: You're in a meeting, and someone interrupts you mid-sentence. You pause for one beat, bracing the heel of your hand on the desk, say "Let me finish" loud, and press your thumb into your palm. Five minutes later, when you're replaying the conversation and feeling guilty, say to yourself "I've got this decision covered". You take a deep breath, glance at your notes, and start thinking about the next step you need to take...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is "I've got this decision covered" supposed to stop the replay?

Okay, I actually tried it in my head: paused, braced my hand, said "Let me finish," pressed my thumb, and five minutes later I told myself "I've got this decision covered." It took the edge down a notch, but my heart's still racing and my brain's already bouncing to the next deadline and the stupid new system. 

Give me a gruffer, more natural one‑liner I can say to myself five minutes later that doesn't sound like a pep talk, and a tighter one‑line follow‑up email that sounds like I'm owning the decision (not damage control). Can we run that role‑play again, and this time make the delivery louder and more forceful so it actually sticks?
