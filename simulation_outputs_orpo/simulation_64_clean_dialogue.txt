Patient: Lately I keep getting caught in these cycles of really harsh self-criticism — whenever I think I've messed up, I spiral and can't shake it. I guess it goes back to being bullied at school and it still messes with my confidence in social situations, especially now that I'm back in classes. I don't know, I just avoid talking about it because it feels... uncomfortable.

Therapist: When you think you've messed up, what's the one thing you wish you could say to yourself that would make a difference? For example, in a class discussion, you might say, "That's okay; I can learn from it," instead of getting caught up in self-criticism.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd want to tell myself, "It's okay to make mistakes — you're learning, not failing, and you still belong." But when it happens I just can't seem to actually say that to myself; I get stuck replaying the old stuff from school.

Therapist: What would happen if, right now, you simply acknowledged the old story from school, without judgment, and then said, "I'm here in this class to learn and connect with others, not to relive that?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying that could help a little, but it feels hollow when I try — like I'm pretending. When I'm in a discussion the old voice just takes over and I freeze before I can say the kinder thing. Can we... talk about small, practical ways to actually practice saying it? I feel kind of overwhelmed when this gets real.

Therapist: In the next 5 minutes, before your next class discussion, take one small breath and notice where you sit. Just observe that physical presence – what's your body doing? Now, as you're about to walk into class, say to yourself, "I'm here to learn and connect with others," without judgment or trying to make it perfect. That's it.

Patient: I tried — I took a breath and noticed my body, and I did tell myself, "I'm here to learn and connect," but it felt flat and the old voice started up right away. I don't know how to make it feel real instead of like I'm pretending. Can we try a very small, specific thing I can do in the moment during class so I don't freeze? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it.

Therapist: When you hear someone's voice interrupt you in class, before you react or freeze, pause for just 1 second and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. That's it. Just a tiny moment to connect with the physical sensation of being present.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that one-second pause. I don't know, I guess it could help — last time I did something similar I felt a tiny bit steadier, then the old voice still jumped back in and I froze. If that doesn't work, can we come up with another tiny anchor I can use in the moment? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed asking, but I want something specific.

Therapist: What if, just before you react or freeze, you touch the cuff of your sleeve with your finger? It's a tiny, automatic action that requires no thinking – just a small physical connection to the present moment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try touching my sleeve — I don't know, I guess doing something automatic might cut the freeze for a second. Last time an anchor faded fast, so if that doesn't work can we try another tiny thing, like a quick two-word phrase I can whisper under my breath? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed asking, but I want a few simple options.

Therapist: Let's try a simple phrase that's just two words: "I pause." You can whisper it under your breath whenever you feel the freeze coming on. It's short, easy to remember, and doesn't require any thinking – just a small physical act of speaking the words.

Patient: I don't know... I guess "I pause" sounds doable — it's short so maybe I can whisper it. But I'm nervous it'll still feel fake, so can we pick one more tiny backup, like tapping my pen twice or glancing at the edge of my desk? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed just thinking about doing this in front of people, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's try tapping your pen twice. It's a tiny, completely unconscious action that requires no thinking – just a small physical movement. You can do it while sitting, even if you're not holding a pen. It's a small anchor that might help you connect with your body in the moment, without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Okay, I'll try tapping my pen twice — I don't know, I guess that feels doable. I'm nervous it'll still feel silly or won't stop the old voice, so can you help me figure out how to practice it a bit before class so it feels more automatic? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed thinking about doing it in front of people, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's practice the tap in a low-stakes situation: right now. Take a minute to sit comfortably, find your pen (even if it's just a pen on your desk), and tap it twice. Just tap twice. No thinking, no trying to control it. Just the physical movement. When you're ready, try it again.

Patient: I did it — I found a pen and tapped twice. I don't know, I guess it felt a little grounding for a second, like my breath softened, but then the old voice started nagging again. I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed about doing it in class and it felt a bit silly practicing alone; can we try one more quick round where I tap then whisper "I pause" so it starts to feel more automatic?

Therapist: Let's do one more round. Tap your pen twice, and then whisper "I pause" just after the tap. That's it. Just the two actions: tap and whisper. Don't try to control the whisper, just let it happen naturally. Remember, this is just a tiny anchor to help you connect with your body in the moment.

Patient: I did it — tapped twice and whispered "I pause." I don't know, I guess it helped for a beat; my shoulders loosened but then that old voice piped up and I felt kind of ridiculous. I'm feeling overwhelmed about doing it in front of people — can we practice a quick script for what I might do if someone interrupts me or I go blank in class?

Therapist: Let's imagine a scenario: someone interrupts you in class, and you tap your pen twice, whisper "I pause," and then respond. Here's a simple script: "Excuse me, can you let me finish? I'm trying to answer that question." Practice saying it out loud, slowly, and then try it again with a friend or family member.

Patient: I tried saying it out loud once and… I don't know, it sounded too blunt and I worried I'd come off rude. I guess a softer line like "Sorry, I wasn't finished" or "Can I finish my thought?" might feel more natural. I'm feeling overwhelmed but could we role-play now — you interrupt and I'll try one of those?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll interrupt you in a gentle way, and you try responding with one of the softer lines. Remember, this is a safe space to practice – I'm not trying to catch you off guard. When you're ready, we'll start.

Patient: I don't know... Can I finish my thought? I guess I was trying to say I go blank in discussions and then feel ridiculous.

Therapist: That's a great way to start. When you said "Can I finish my thought?" I felt like you were taking a deep breath and giving yourself permission to speak up. That's exactly what you do in class – you're saying, "I'm not done yet, and I want to share my thought."

Patient: I don't know... I guess that made me feel a little steadier, but it still feels awkward. Can we do the interruption now? I might be slow—I'm feeling kind of worn out, so please go gently.

Therapist: Here's a gentle interruption: "Actually, I was going to ask you that too." Now, try responding with "Can I finish my thought?" Remember, I'm just simulating an interruption – you're in control of how you respond. Take your time, and breathe.

Patient: I don't know... "Can I finish my thought?" I was trying to say I go blank in discussions and then my mind just stops — I guess it makes me feel stupid and I can't get the words out. I'm feeling kind of worn out just doing this, so can we keep it slow?

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to share. It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure how to express yourself in those moments. Remember that your goal isn't to fix the situation right now – it's just to acknowledge your struggle and take a small step forward. You're already showing up and trying, which is something to be proud of. Take another deep breath, and let's keep going at your pace.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm trying, but this is wearing me out. Could we do one more really gentle interruption practice — and then give me one tiny, low-key thing I can try in class that won't make me feel like everyone's watching? Please go slow.

Therapist: Let's do one more gentle interruption practice. I'll say something that's just a gentle nudge: "You're really close to finishing that thought..." Now, take a moment to respond with "Can I finish my thought?" Remember, this is a tiny step – you're not trying to fix anything, just take a small breath.

After this, I want you to try something small in class. Here it is: When you feel that blank feeling, take a tiny pause – just 2 seconds – before responding. That's it. No thinking, no trying to control it – just a tiny pause. Can you try that in your next class discussion?

Patient: I don't know... I can try the two-second pause in my next class — I guess it sounds simple enough. I'm worried it'll still feel awkward and that old voice will hijack things, though. If that happens, can I fall back on tapping my pen twice or whispering "I pause"? I'm feeling pretty worn out just thinking about it, so can we keep it slow when we check back in?

Therapist: That's completely normal. It's natural to feel worried about trying something new, especially when it's related to something that's already felt uncomfortable for you. Remember that you've already practiced responding with "Can I finish my thought?" and tapping your pen twice – those were small steps that helped you build confidence. When you feel that old voice coming up again, you can always fall back on those strategies. The pause is just a tiny moment to catch your breath and connect with your body before speaking. Take another deep breath, and when you're ready, we'll check in again in a little while.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the two-second pause, but just thinking about doing it in class feels heavy and makes me want to hide. Can we make a tiny plan — you check in with me after my next class, and if I freeze I fall back on tapping my pen twice or whispering "I pause"? I'm feeling pretty drained, so can we keep that check-in really short and slow?

Therapist: Let's make a simple plan. I'll check in with you after your next class, and if you feel like you're struggling with the pause, you can fall back on tapping your pen twice or whispering "I pause". That's it. We'll keep the check-in short and slow – just a few minutes to breathe and connect. When you're ready, we can start with something even smaller, like a tiny question: "How are you feeling right now?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess pretty drained and kind of foggy — my words feel sticky. I'm feeling overwhelmed just thinking about the class, so can we keep this really short and slow?

Therapist: Just take one deep breath with me: inhale... exhale... okay? That's it. We're done. Take care of yourself today.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm not ready to be done yet — my head feels foggy and saying goodbye already makes me tense. Can you just remind me, really quickly, of the tiny fallback steps (the tap, the whisper, the two-second pause) and confirm you'll check in briefly after my next class? I'm feeling worn out, so keep it short and slow.

Therapist: Let's just review the tiny fallback steps: if you freeze, you can tap your pen twice, whisper "I pause", or take a 2-second pause. I'll check in with you after your next class, just to see how it went. That's all.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay. Just to be clear: tap the pen twice, whisper "I pause," or do a 2‑second pause — right? My head's still foggy and my words feel sticky, so please keep the check‑in really short. One more thing — if I totally freeze and can't do any of those, is it okay to just sit and breathe for a moment instead of forcing anything?

Therapist: Yes, that's right: tap, whisper "I pause", or 2-second pause. And if you freeze completely, it's totally okay to just sit there, breathe, and pause for a moment. No judgment. We'll check in soon.

Patient: I don't know... okay. So: tap pen twice, whisper "I pause," or take a 2‑second pause — and if I can't do any of that, just sit and breathe for a moment. I guess that's clear.

Can you just promise the check‑in will be really short? Like two or three minutes. I'm feeling foggy and my words are sticky, and I worry I'll freeze or that it'll all feel fake. If I say "I froze" when you check in, is that okay? I don't want you to make a big deal of it.

Therapist: I promise the check-in will be super short - just 2-3 minutes. If you say "I froze" when we check in, it's not about making a big deal of it - it's just about acknowledging what happened and how you're feeling. No judgment, no fuss. Just a gentle check-in to see how it went.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I guess that sounds manageable. My head's foggy and this is wearing me out. Can you just keep the check‑in to 2–3 minutes, ask "How'd it go?", and if I say "I froze" we just sit with a minute of quiet breathing? Is that okay?

Therapist: That's exactly right. We'll keep it to 2-3 minutes, and I'll just ask "How'd it go?" If you say "I froze", we'll sit together for a minute of quiet breathing. No need to explain or make a big deal of it. Just a gentle pause to acknowledge how you're feeling.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds manageable. I'm really worn out and fuzzy, so when you check in just ask "How'd it go?" and if I say "I froze" let's sit and breathe for a minute — no questions. Also, could you quietly remind me of the tap/whisper if I seem stuck? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed just saying this.

Therapist: That sounds perfect. When you check in, I'll just ask "How'd it go?" If you say "I froze", we'll sit in silence for a minute. If you seem stuck, I'll quietly remind you of the tap/whisper: "Just tap your pen twice, whisper 'I pause', or take a 2-second pause." No pressure, just a gentle nudge to help you move forward.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that plan feels a bit less scary. Can we do the check‑in after my 2pm class? And if I don't have a pen, is it okay to tap the edge of my desk instead? My words feel sticky, so please keep it short.

Therapist: That sounds good - we'll check in after your 2pm class. No problem if you don't have a pen - you can tap the edge of your desk instead. Just focus on the tap, whisper "I pause", or take that 2-second pause. We'll go from there.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay. I'll try tapping the desk or whispering "I pause" in my 2pm class — I'm feeling pretty wiped, so please keep the check‑in really short and gentle.

Therapist: That's it. You've got this. Just remember: tap your desk, whisper "I pause", or take 2 seconds. We'll check in after class.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm still kind of stuck and anxious about the 2pm class. My words feel really sticky—could you, really quickly, say the three fallback steps one more time? I'm too fuzzy to trust I'll remember them.
