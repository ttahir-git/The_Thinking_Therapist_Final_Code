Patient: I'm a middle-aged teacher and the job instability lately has left me overwhelmed with sadness and no motivation, and it's starting to hurt my relationship. I usually try to stay upbeat but I've tried things before and they haven't worked. How is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: When you say "nothing's worked before," it sounds like you're worried about trying again. What's the smallest thing you could do this time, without feeling like you're "failing," that might connect you to what matters to you in this teaching job?

Patient: Maybe the smallest thing is just ten minutes tonight to jot down three specific moments when teaching felt meaningful — like a kid finally getting it or a class laugh. I don't really see how that fixes the job stuff, and I've tried writing things down before and it never sticks, but maybe it's small enough I won't bail on it.

Therapist: Those small moments of connection – like a kid finally getting it or a class laugh – are what make teaching worth showing up for, aren't they? What would it take for you to notice and hold onto one of those moments like it's a tiny spark of hope, even if it doesn't immediately fix the job stuff?

Patient: Maybe I could set a stupidly small rule—right after class, write one sentence about one moment and one feeling, then drop the note in a jar or take a quick photo. How is that supposed to help? I forget things, bail on routines, and it feels pointless when bills and my partner's frustration are louder. But I guess I could try it for a week, even though I'm skeptical.

Therapist: When you're tempted to bail on the jar or phone photo, what's the one feeling that shows up in your body that would make you want to keep going with that tiny rule – like a tiny spark of curiosity or a small sense of relief?

Patient: There's this tiny fluttery warmth just under my sternum — like a curious little nudge — that makes me think, "maybe this could be worth a try." But more often I get this heavy sinking in my gut and a tense tightness across my shoulders that makes me want to bail. How is noticing those feelings supposed to help me actually keep doing the stupid jar thing?

Therapist: When you feel that warmth under your sternum (curiosity), what's one tiny step you can take right now to keep the jar going – like opening your notebook or taking a photo – that would honor that spark of curiosity?

Patient: Fine—right now I can open my phone and type one sentence: "Today a kid finally got the fraction thing and grinned." It feels stupid and like busywork—how is that supposed to help?—but I can do one sentence, and maybe set a 9pm alarm to remind me to drop it in the jar or take a photo.

Therapist: When you set that 9pm alarm, what's the one thing you'll do immediately after it goes off – like taking a photo or dropping the note in the jar – that will connect that small moment to what matters most to you in this teaching job?

Patient: I'll take the photo and immediately drop the one-sentence note into a "Teaching Sparks" album on my phone (or stick the paper in the jar if I'm near it). That way there's a tiny, visible reminder that those moments still happen and that's why I do this, even if nothing else changes. But seriously, how is that supposed to pay the bills or ease my partner's frustration? I'm already worried I'll bail after a few nights.

Therapist: What's one thing you can imagine doing with that photo or note in the jar that feels meaningful to you right now – not just a practical task, but a way to honor what matters most to you about teaching?

Patient: I guess I could make it into a tiny ritual—when I'm spiraling or once a week, I pull one photo/note and spend five minutes reminding myself why that moment mattered, maybe even say it out loud. It feels like a way to reconnect to the part of me that actually likes teaching instead of just the money panic and my partner's frustration. But seriously, how is that supposed to fix the bills or make my partner less annoyed? I'm skeptical it'll stick, but maybe it's something I can show them instead of snapping back.

Therapist: When you show your partner this ritual, what's one thing you'll say to them that connects it to your love for teaching, rather than just the financial or frustration aspects – like "This reminds me of why I love teaching, and that's what I'm fighting for"?

Patient: I'd probably say, "I made this little collection of moments so you can see why I teach — it's not just the paycheck, it's the kids and the tiny wins that keep me going." I don't know if that'll actually make them less annoyed, but I might try saying it anyway.

Therapist: That's a great start – you're willing to take the risk to show your partner the value behind your teaching. Now, when you say it to them, what's one small, non-defensive action you'll take after that conversation – like making them a cup of coffee or doing a small task together – to show you're committed to reconnecting with what matters to you both?

Patient: I'll make them a cup of coffee and sit with them for five minutes, actually listening and asking about their day without snapping into defense about bills. It feels a bit performative and I'm worried it'll just get dismissed, but maybe showing up small like that could help. How is that supposed to fix the bigger stuff long-term, though?

Therapist: That small act of making coffee and listening is exactly what's needed – not a solution to the bills or frustration, but a tiny step towards building connection. When you show up in that way, what's one thing you'll notice about your partner's response that might surprise you – like a glimmer of hope or a shift in their tone?

Patient: Maybe I'll notice their face soften — like a tiny lift at the corner of their mouth or them saying, "Oh, I didn't realize that," which would surprise me because I expect defensiveness. I doubt it will fix anything big, but if that happens, how do I not get my hopes up and then feel crushed again?

Therapist: When you notice that tiny lift in their face or their surprise, what's one thing you'll do with that sensation in your body – like taking a deep breath or noticing the physical ease of your shoulders? That's not about fixing the big stuff, but about learning to stay present with your own emotions, so you don't get swept up by hope or fear.

Patient: I'll take a slow, deliberate breath, feel my shoulders drop, and quietly label it "small ease" so I treat it as a data point instead of proof everything's fixed. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from getting my hopes up and then crashing? I guess practicing that a few times might help me notice the pattern instead of getting swept away.

Therapist: By labeling that small ease as "small ease" and treating it as a data point, you're already practicing a tiny act of self-compassion. What's one thing you can offer yourself in the moment, like "I'm exactly where I am, with this small ease – and that's okay"?

Patient: I can tell myself, "This small ease is real, and I can notice it without forcing it to mean more." Saying that once or twice with a slow breath might keep me from flipping straight back to panic. But honestly, how is that supposed to stick when I'm mid-spiral? Can we talk about what to do when I can't even find that small ease?

Therapist: When you're in the midst of a spiral and can't find that small ease, what's one thing you can offer yourself instead of trying to force it – like a tiny physical act, like taking a deep breath through your nose or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground? That's not about finding the ease, but about creating a tiny gap between your thoughts and your body.

Patient: Okay—when I'm spiraling, I could plant my feet on the floor, take three slow breaths through my nose, and name one thing I can feel, like the chair against my back. Maybe squeeze and release my fists or hold a mug so there's something physical to focus on. I know it sounds tiny—how is that supposed to help when my head's racing?—but I can try it next time and see if it buys me even a second of space. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about spiraling; can we slow down?

Therapist: That's a beautiful attempt to anchor yourself in the present – not trying to solve the racing thoughts, but simply creating space to notice your body. What's one thing you can say to yourself in that moment, like "I'm choosing to stay here, in this chair, with my feet on the floor"?

Patient: "I'm choosing to stay here — my feet are on the floor, I'm breathing, and this moment doesn't have to be fixed." I don't know if that will actually help when I'm spiraling; honestly I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now — can we slow down and talk about what to do if that doesn't work?

Therapist: That's okay to feel overwhelmed – it's normal. What if, instead of trying to force the phrase to work, we explored what would happen if you simply allowed yourself to sit with the feeling of overwhelm? What would your body do, your mind do, if you let go of trying to control it?

Patient: If I actually let myself sit with the overwhelm, my chest gets tight, my breath goes shallow, and my mind instantly jumps to worst-case scenarios — bills, my partner snapping, losing everything — and I get this urge to distract myself with my phone or busywork. Maybe if I stayed put for a minute or two I'd notice the breath slow a bit, the tightness loosen a hair, and the racing thoughts become less urgent, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when the real problems are still there? I'm willing to try it for a minute if you can just... guide me through it slowly, because I'm already feeling a bit swallowed by this and need someone to hold the space with me.

Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's start with your feet on the floor. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. It's okay if it's not a strong sensation – just notice it as you exhale, slowly...

Patient: Okay... I can feel my feet on the floor — kinda cool on the soles — and when I exhale my shoulders drop a tiny bit. My chest is still tight and my breath is shallow, and my mind's already nudging me toward the bills and my partner snapping. This is hard, and I keep thinking, "How is this supposed to change anything?" — but yeah, keep guiding me through another slow breath, please.

Therapist: Let's stay with your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. It's okay if it's not a strong sensation – just feel the sensation of the breath, as you exhale... notice where it touches your body, if at all.

Patient: I can feel the cool air at my nostrils and a tiny looseness when I exhale — my shoulders dropped a hair, but my chest is still tight and my mind's racing to bills and my partner snapping. I get that this is about noticing, but honestly, how is this supposed to change anything real? — keep guiding me through another slow breath, please.

Therapist: What's the one thing you can observe about your breath that's happening right now, without trying to change it? Not "should I relax," but just "what is happening with my breath"?

Patient: It's shallow and quick — mostly up in my chest — with cool air at my nostrils and a tiny looseness when I exhale. I still don't get how noticing this will stop the panic or fix anything real, but I can see it without trying to change it. Can we do another slow breath together? Keep guiding me.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body. Then, as you exhale, notice the tiny looseness that's happening with your chest...

Patient: Okay — I breathed in and felt the air at my nostrils, my chest rose a bit, and on the exhale there was a small looseness and my shoulders dropped. My mind's still yanking to bills and my partner snapping — I keep thinking, "How is this supposed to change anything real?" Can we do another really slow breath together, maybe count with me (four in, six out), and go even slower? I'm a little less frantic but still tense, so please keep guiding me.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. We'll count it together: four in, six out. As you inhale, notice the air moving into your body, just at your nostrils. Hold that sensation for a moment... then exhale, counting slowly: one, two, three, four, five, six... notice how your chest drops and your shoulders relax as you let go.

Patient: Okay — that actually helped a little: my shoulders dropped, my chest loosened a bit, and I felt less frantic for a second. But my mind still snaps to bills and my partner — how is that supposed to help when it comes back five minutes later? Can we do another slow round (four in, six out) and then talk about one quick action I can take if this breathing doesn't stick?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. We'll count it together: four in, six out. As you inhale, notice the air moving into your body, just at your nostrils. Hold that sensation for a moment... then exhale, counting slowly: one, two, three, four, five, six... notice how your chest drops and your shoulders relax as you let go.

Now, when you breathe in, what's one tiny thing you can bring to the moment – not trying to fix the panic, but just showing up – like noticing your feet on the floor or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: I can bring my attention to the weight of my feet on the floor — that grounded feeling. It helps a little, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the panic later? Can we do another slow breath and then figure out one quick action if this fades?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. We'll count it together: four in, six out. As you inhale, notice the air moving into your body, just at your nostrils. Hold that sensation for a moment... then exhale, counting slowly: one, two, three, four, five, six... notice how your chest drops and your shoulders relax as you let go.

Now, when you breathe out, what's one thing you can say to yourself that connects your ground to your values – like "I'm here because I care about my partner and our relationship"?

Patient: "I’m here because I care — about the kids and about our life together." It feels a little corny and I keep thinking, "How is that supposed to help?" but maybe saying it once on the out-breath slows me down a bit. I'm already feeling a bit drained, so can we do another slow breath together and then figure out what to do if that phrase doesn't stick?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. We'll count it together: four in, six out. As you inhale, notice the air moving into your body, just at your nostrils. Hold that sensation for a moment... then exhale, counting slowly: one, two, three, four, five, six... as you let go, say to yourself: "I'm here because I care — about the kids and about our life together." Notice what happens in your body when you say those words – do you feel a tiny shift, a bit more grounding, or something else?

(Note: We're not trying to make the phrase "work" or feel more authentic, but rather experiment with its effect on your body and breath.)

Patient: Saying the phrase on the out-breath actually made my shoulders drop a hair and that little warm nudge under my sternum showed up — it's tiny, like a flicker. I still think, "How is that supposed to help?" because my brain is already yanking to bills and my partner, but I can notice the shift. Can we do another slow round and then figure out one quick action I can use when that feeling fades?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. We'll count it together: four in, six out. As you inhale, notice the air moving into your body, just at your nostrils. Hold that sensation for a moment... then exhale, counting slowly: one, two, three, four, five, six... as you let go, say to yourself: "I'm here because I care — about the kids and about our life together." Now, notice what happens when that phrase fades away – what's the first thing you notice in your body or mind?

(Note: We're not trying to hold onto the shift or make it last, but rather notice what happens when it naturally fades.)

Patient: The first thing is a drop — my chest tightens, my gut knots, my breath gets shallow, and my mind immediately snaps to bills and my partner snapping; I get this urge to grab my phone and distract myself. Then that tiny warm nudge disappears and I'm left thinking, "How is that supposed to help?" I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and figure out one immediate move I can try the moment that drop happens?

Therapist: When that drop happens, notice the sensation in your body just before you reach for your phone – what's the tiny bit of hesitation, the tiny pause, before you grab it? That's the moment you can create a tiny space to choose what to do next. Take one deep breath in through your nose, and before you exhale, pause for just a second – notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. That pause is what will give you the chance to choose what to do next, not just grab your phone.

Patient: There’s this tiny half-second where my hand actually hovers over the phone, my heart ticks up, and my brain screams “do something now.” If I pause and notice my feet on the floor and the air on my skin I get a little looseness — like a second of not-drowning — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from spiraling or from just doom-scrolling until I feel worse? Can you guide me through practicing that pause now, and tell me one quick fallback I can use if I still grab the phone?

Therapist: Let's practice the pause together. When you feel that hesitation, take one deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, pause for just a second – notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. As you pause, repeat to yourself: "I've got this moment, and I can choose what to do next." If you still grab the phone, notice that your hand is still hovering – what's the first thing you do next? Take a small step away from the phone, or do something that doesn't involve looking at your phone for just 10 seconds – like taking a sip of water, stretching your arm, or making a small movement with your body. That small action gives you a tiny bit of space to recover and breathe again.

Patient: Okay — I tried that pause in my head just now: deep breath, felt my feet, said "I've got this moment," and my hand actually froze for a half-second and my shoulders loosened a little. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from doom-scrolling five minutes later when the panic spikes again? If I still grab the phone I can try the sip-of-water or a quick stand-and-stretch for ten seconds, but I'm already feeling a bit shaky — can we slow down and practice that pause one more time together?
