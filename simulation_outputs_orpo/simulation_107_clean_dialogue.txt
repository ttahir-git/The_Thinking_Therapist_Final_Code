Patient: I've been really anxious about going to social things lately — even with a few close friends I end up cancelling or hiding. It feels intense and kind of out of nowhere, and it's been messing with my work and family stuff. I don't know, it's hard to talk about, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: When you feel anxious about going to social events with friends, what's the first physical sensation or thought that hits you right before you start to feel overwhelmed? For example, do you feel your heart racing, or do you notice a specific phrase or worry that shows up in your head?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the first thing is a tightness in my chest and my stomach drops — my heart starts racing and my hands get clammy. Then this thought pops up, like, "What if I say something dumb or they think I'm boring?" I don't know, it just feels heavy and I get this urge to bail.

Therapist: You mentioned wanting to go to social events with friends, but the fear of saying something dumb or being boring is holding you back. What's one small thing you value about being with friends – like laughing together, sharing a meal, or just being present – that feels worth taking a chance on, even if you're afraid of messing up?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the small thing I value most is those stupid little laughs — when we're all just being dumb and it feels normal for a minute. It makes me feel seen and less alone, even if I'm anxious. I don't know, that's the part that feels like it might be worth risking the awkwardness for.

Therapist: When you're with friends and you feel that tightness in your chest, what would it take for you to make room for just one small laugh, even if it feels a little awkward – like taking a deep breath, or smiling at something ridiculous, or just letting out a tiny "hmm" of amusement?

Patient: I don't know, I guess taking a slow, deliberate breath and forcing a tiny smile might help — like giving myself permission to only try for one small laugh. Maybe I could have a little script or a joke ready, and tell myself I'll stay for just an hour so it doesn't feel like forever. I don't know, it still feels awkward and I get the urge to bolt, but having that plan might make it possible to crack a tiny smile.

Therapist: Instead of telling yourself you'll stay for an hour, what if you just commit to taking one small laugh – that tiny smile or tiny chuckle – no matter what happens next?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could try to force one tiny laugh — like a slow breath and a small smile — and then see what happens. But I'm worried it'll feel fake and I'll just want to run away. I don't know, I'm getting kind of overwhelmed just thinking about it.

Therapist: When you think "it'll feel fake," what's the physical sensation that shows up in your body? Can you notice it as a thought without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — when I think it'll feel fake my chest tightens and my throat kind of closes, and I get this hot flush in my face. It feels like I'm split in half, like I'm watching myself do it and it just won't land. I can notice that as a thought if I try, but mostly I want to look away or change the subject because it's uncomfortable. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed talking about it.

Therapist: Notice the thought "it'll feel fake" again, and this time, instead of trying to change it, simply say it out loud: "That's the thought that's showing up when I think it'll feel fake."

Patient: I don't know... "That's the thought that's showing up when I think it'll feel fake." Saying it out loud makes my chest tighten and I want to look away — it feels exposing and weird.

Therapist: When you feel the chest tightening, what's one tiny physical sensation that you could actually notice right now – like the feeling of your feet on the ground, or the sound of your breath moving in and out?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can feel the weight of my feet on the floor, like my heels pressing into the carpet. If I pay attention I can hear my breath — kind of a shallow whoosh at my nostrils — and my shoulders feel tight. I'm getting a little squirmy talking about it, though.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet pressing into the carpet, and the sound of your breath moving in and out – what if you just paused for a second, without trying to change anything, and noticed that sensation again?

Patient: I tried — I can feel my heels into the carpet and the shallow whoosh at my nostrils, my shoulders are tight and my chest is still kind of pinched but maybe a hair less intense. I don't know, it feels weird to just sit with it, like I'm waiting for something bad to happen. I guess I can try to stay with it a bit longer, but I'm already getting squirmy and want to change the subject.

Therapist: Notice the thought "I want to change the subject" – what's one tiny action you could take right now to stay with the sensation, without changing the subject? For example, could you take one slow breath, and then notice the sensation again without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could take one slow, deliberate breath right now, feel my heels on the carpet, and count to four — then check my shoulders and chest without trying to fix anything. I'm already getting antsy and want to switch topics, but I'll try to hold it for that one breath. Can we... just do it slowly?

Therapist: Let's take it one step at a time: notice the sensation of your feet on the carpet, and the sound of your breath moving in and out. When you're ready, bring your attention to the sensation of your chest – notice the physical feeling without trying to change it. Just notice.

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels tight, like a band squeezing across it, and there's this dull ache under my ribs. My breath is shallow and quick, and when I try to notice it I get this urge to look away or change the subject. I guess I can keep holding it for a bit, but I'm already getting antsy.

Therapist: Notice the thought "I want to look away" – what would happen if you just acknowledged it, without acting on it? Would your chest feel even tighter, or would it stay the same?

Patient: I don't know, I guess if I just say the thought out loud the chest squeeze eases a little—like it loosens by a hair. But then I feel exposed and stupid and get this big urge to look away or change the subject, and I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one moment. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I'm feeling really uncomfortable right now."

Patient: "I'm feeling really uncomfortable right now." I don't know, my chest's still tight and I feel like I want to look away—can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Take a tiny pause. Just notice the sensation of your chest being tight, and the thought that's showing up without trying to push it away.

Patient: I don't know... my chest is really tight, like a band, and the thought is "I need to get out" and "they'll notice I'm anxious." Saying that out loud loosens it a tiny bit, but it also makes me feel exposed and I want to change the subject. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice the thought "I need to get out" without adding any judgment to it – just see it as a thought, like "I'm thinking I need to get out."

Patient: I don't know, "I'm thinking I need to get out." Saying it that way makes the urge feel a little less urgent — my chest loosens a hair — but it also makes me feel stupid and exposed. I guess I can try to stay with it for another breath, but I'm getting antsy; can we slow down?

Therapist: Take another tiny pause. Notice the sensation of your chest being a little less tight, and the thought that's showing up again – just see it as a thought, like "I'm thinking I need to get out."

Patient: I don't know... my chest is a little less tight, like maybe a notch down, and the thought "I need to get out" is still there but quieter. Saying it like that helps a bit, but I still feel exposed and kind of stupid. I guess I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down or maybe shift to something a bit gentler for a minute?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – what's that feeling like? Is it heavy, light, warm, or cool?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it feels kind of heavy—my heels pressing into the carpet, a little warm from my socks. It actually feels a bit grounding, but I'm still restless and my shoulders are tight. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet pressing into the carpet, and then bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body – just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the air moving in my nose — cool going in, warmer coming out — and my chest rises kind of shallowly, my belly barely moves. It actually calms me a little, like a small pause where things don't spike, but my shoulders are still tight and I'm getting restless. Can we keep it slow? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your shoulders being tight, and say to yourself: "My shoulders feel tight right now."

Patient: "My shoulders feel tight right now." I don't know, they feel hunched up by my ears, like I'm holding my breath. Saying that makes me feel exposed and I want to look away—can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Take a tiny pause. Just notice the sensation of your shoulders being tight, without adding any judgment to it – just see it as a physical sensation, like "My shoulders feel tight."

Patient: I don't know... "My shoulders feel tight." They feel hunched up by my ears, like a knot in my neck, and my jaw's clenched too. Saying it out loud makes me feel exposed and I'm getting kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice that you're feeling overwhelmed right now, and that's okay. You can acknowledge that feeling without adding any judgment to it – just notice that it's there.

Patient: I don't know... I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and I guess noticing that feels... okay to say. My chest is tight, my breath is shallow, and my shoulders and jaw are clenched — saying it out loud helps a little but also makes me feel exposed and kind of stupid. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that it's okay to feel that way right now – it doesn't mean you're weak, it just means you're human.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that does help a little — makes the pressure feel smaller. But saying it out loud still makes me feel exposed and kind of stupid, and I'm getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Take a tiny pause. Close your eyes (if you feel comfortable doing so) and just breathe in deeply through your nose, and out through your mouth. Notice how your body feels as you breathe.

Patient: I closed my eyes and tried it — the air felt cool in and warmer out. I could feel my chest loosen a tiny bit and my feet grounded, but my jaw and shoulders are still tight and my mind's flicking between thoughts. I don't know, it helps a little but saying it out loud makes me feel exposed and kind of stupid — can we slow down or do something a bit gentler? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice the thoughts that are flickering in your mind, without trying to grab them or push them away. Just observe them as they pass – what do they look like, like colors or shapes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess they look like flickering neon warnings — quick red flashes like error messages, with some grey static in the background. Sometimes it's a tiny jittery clip of one embarrassing moment on loop, other times it's a low, dark cloud that swells up. Saying that makes me feel exposed and I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how those warnings make you feel in your body, right now. What's the physical sensation when those thoughts show up – is it tension, anxiety, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's mostly tension — like a band across my chest and this hollow drop in my stomach, my heart speeds up and my hands get clammy. My face heats up, my jaw clenches, and sometimes I feel kind of detached, like I'm watching myself. Saying that out loud makes me feel exposed and stupid — can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice that your body is already tense, your heart is racing, and your hands are clammy – those sensations are already there. No more adding to them. Just acknowledge them as they are, without judgment.

Patient: I don't know... yeah, they're there — my chest's tight, my heart's racing, my hands are clammy. Saying that out loud kind of loosens it a hair, but I still feel exposed and kinda stupid. Can we slow down or maybe do something a bit gentler for a minute? I'm getting overwhelmed.
