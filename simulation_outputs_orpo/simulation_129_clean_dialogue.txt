Patient: I'm an older social worker and lately I've been overwhelmed by sadness and a real lack of motivation because the financial strain just won't let up. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only spits out disasters — it keeps telling me the bills will pile up, we'll lose the house, my partner will leave, and I'll be utterly alone, and it feels like that's definitely what's going to happen. I know there might be other outcomes, but they seem unrealistic and I can't stop being hooked on that worst-case story.

Therapist: That fortune-telling machine sounds like it's really draining your energy. When you say "I know there might be other outcomes, but they seem unrealistic," what's one small thing you've done in the past that's actually worked when faced with uncertainty – something tiny, like checking the mail or making a phone call – that you wish you could tap into again right now?

Patient: I did once make a quick call to the utility company and got a payment plan set up, which felt like a tiny win, but I keep thinking it'll just be temporary — they'll change the terms, I'll miss a payment, collections will start, then the landlord will evict us and my partner will leave because of the shame, and I'll be completely ruined; that's definitely what will happen. I want to believe that making the call again could help, but those other outcomes feel unrealistic to me. I'm stuck wanting to try but terrified it'll only speed up the disaster.

Therapist: That shame and fear sound like they're holding you back from seeing the call as a tiny act of self-care. Instead of worrying about what might happen if you make the call, what would it feel like to take care of yourself right now – to make that call and know you're doing something to stay afloat, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: I think making the call would feel like a small weight lifting—like I'm finally doing something to keep us afloat—but the minute I imagine it I can already hear the fortune-telling voice: they'll tack on fees, I'll miss one payment, collections will come, the landlord will evict us, and my partner will leave me for the shame of it. I want to try, but I'm terrified it'll only speed up that chain, so I'm stuck and can't move. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment and notice the story you're telling yourself when you imagine making the call. What would it sound like if you simply said, "I'm imagining that worst-case scenario, but that's just a story – it's not a prediction"?

Patient: I can try to say that, but it feels hollow — the fortune-telling machine screams back that they'll tack on fees, I'll miss one payment, collections will start, we'll get evicted, my partner will leave, and I'll end up completely alone. Saying it's "just a story" feels like lying to myself, like denying what's obviously going to happen, so I'm stuck and honestly overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: That feeling of being stuck and overwhelmed is exhausting – it's like trying to hold onto a wave. What's one tiny thing you can do right now to take a small breath of space from that feeling, without changing the thought or trying to control it?

Patient: Okay—I can try something tiny: I'll sit up, put my feet flat on the floor, rest my hands in my lap, and take three slow, steady breaths, just noticing them without trying to push the thoughts away. Even as I do it, the fortune-telling voice is saying it's pointless and the bills and eviction are still coming, but... I'll try the breaths for now. I'm still feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the breath moving in and out of your body – it's not trying to push the thoughts away, just being present. What's one tiny willingness you can make to the breath right now, even though the voice is saying it's pointless?

Patient: Okay—I can be willing to follow my breath for one minute, counting each inhale and exhale, even though the fortune-telling machine is already yelling that it's pointless and that the bills, collections, eviction, and my partner leaving are still sure to happen. I'm still feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice where in your body the overwhelm is showing up right now – is it in your chest, shoulders, or stomach? As you breathe in, what's the sensation of that overwhelm in your body, like a wave or a heaviness?

Patient: It's mostly in my chest and upper stomach—a heavy knot that feels like it sinks deeper when I breathe in. Each inhale tightens it more, like a wave pressing down, and my fortune-telling machine turns that into a certainty that the bills will crush us and everything will fall apart. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the thought "the bills will crush us" as just a thought – what would it look like if you said it out loud, without judgment or action? Would you say it with a "yes, I agree" tone, a "no, I disagree" tone, or something else?

Patient: I'd say it in a flat, resigned "yes, I agree" tone — like I'm stating a fact. The fortune-telling machine makes it sound steady and inevitable, so saying it any other way feels naive or like lying to myself. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what's behind the "yes, I agree" tone – is it a desire to avoid the discomfort, a fear of being wrong, or something else? What would happen if you slightly tilted that tone, just a tiny bit, to ask "What's really going on here?"

Patient: I think it's mostly fear — a fear of being wrong and a way to avoid the pain of hoping, like if I act resigned I won't have to be disappointed. If I tried to tilt it to ask "What's really going on here?" the fortune-telling machine yells that that's naive and the only realistic future is fees, missed payments, collections, eviction, and my partner leaving, so the question feels like lying to myself. I can try to say it, but it already feels false and I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you allowed the fear to be there for one more breath, without trying to push it away or label it as "naive"? What would the fear look like if you gave it a tiny bit of space – just for one heartbeat?

Patient: If I let the fear sit for one more breath it feels like that heavy knot spreads into a gray cloud behind my eyes — a looping film of fees piling up, missed payments, collectors banging at the door, the landlord evicting us, and my partner leaving me for the shame of it. I'll try to hold that image for one heartbeat without pushing it away, but the fortune-telling machine is already narrating the next catastrophe like it's fact, and I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the gray cloud as a thought, not as reality – what would it look like if you said to the gray cloud, "This thought is just a thought"? Try saying it with an open, non-judgmental tone, like "This thought is just a thought" – without adding any action or emotion.

Patient: I can try: "This thought is just a thought," but saying it feels hollow — shame and a familiar, burning frustration flare up like I'm failing all over again. As soon as I say it the fortune-telling machine starts screaming fees, missed payments, eviction, my partner leaving, so I'm still really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you allowed the shame to be there for one more heartbeat, without trying to push it away or label it as "hollow"? What would the shame look like if you gave it a tiny bit of kindness – just for one heartbeat?

Patient: If I let the shame sit for one more heartbeat and try a tiny kindness, it feels like a hot, raw spot in my chest that softens just a little—like I'm cradling something fragile instead of trying to crush it. Right away that old, burning frustration from that past failure surges up — I won't say what it is — and I start hating myself for not being stronger, and the fortune-telling machine immediately turns that into certainty that fees, eviction, and being left alone are coming. Trying the kindness feels possible for a breath, but then the machine screams it's pointless and I'm overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you met the self-hatred with a tiny bit of kindness, not to the failure itself, but to the tiny voice that says "I'm not strong enough"? What would that voice sound like if you said to it, "I see you're trying to tell me I'm not strong enough"? Try saying it with a gentle, curious tone, like "I see you're trying to tell me..."

Patient: Okay, I can try that: "I see you're trying to tell me I'm not strong enough." Saying it gently makes shame and that familiar, burning frustration flare up — I start hating myself for not being stronger, and the fortune-telling machine immediately turns it into the same disaster story: fees, missed payments, eviction, my partner leaving. Trying kindness feels possible for a breath, but I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you changed the phrase just slightly? Instead of "I'm not strong enough," what if you said "I'm struggling with this"? It's a tiny tweak, but it changes the tone from self-hatred to acknowledgment of challenge. Try saying it again: "I see you're trying to tell me I'm struggling with this."

Patient: "I see you're trying to tell me I'm struggling with this." I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Saying it loosens the shame a little, but then the fortune-telling machine kicks in and screams about fees, missed payments, collectors, eviction, and my partner leaving like it's already decided, and I just feel furious and defeated all over again; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what's happening when the machine starts screaming about fees and eviction? What's the physical sensation in your body when you hear that story? Is it tightness, tension, or something else? Try to anchor that sensation in your body, without judgment – just notice it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when the machine screams about fees and eviction I get a tight, sinking knot in my chest and upper stomach, my breath goes shallow, my shoulders clamp up and my hands tremble, like everything's being squeezed inward, and the fortune-telling voice just ramps that up. Shame heats my face and makes me feel frozen; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tightness in your chest and upper stomach right now, without trying to push it away or change it. Just observe it – it's like a physical anchor in your body. What would happen if you slowly, quietly, and gently allowed that tightness to stay in your body, without trying to push it away or change it, but just... noticed it?

Patient: If I just let the tightness sit it feels like the knot spreads—my breath gets tinier, my chest feels heavier, my hands go cold, and that old hot shame flares up, like I'm failing again. The fortune-telling machine grabs that as proof: the bills will crush us, collections will come, we'll lose the place, and my partner will leave — it's like the tightness is evidence, not just a feeling. I'm not sure I follow how noticing it helps; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how your body feels when you try to push the tightness away or change the story – what's the sensation in your body when you're trying to "fix" the knot? Is it still clamping up, or has it shifted at all? Try to identify the subtle difference in the physical sensation when you're trying to change it, versus when you're just noticing it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when I try to fix it everything clamps down harder: my breath gets shallow, my chest feels like a fist, my hands tremble, and that hot shame and frustration surges up behind my eyes. When I just notice it it's heavy and aching but a bit steadier; when I try to change it the fortune-telling machine goes into overdrive and I feel panicky, like the disaster story is being proven. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens just before you try to change the tightness – what's the tiny moment before your body starts clamping down? Is there a pause, a hesitation, or a slight shift in the physical sensation? Try to anchor that moment – not the tightness, not the story, just the tiny pause.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — there's this tiny hitch right before I clamp down, like a quick catch in my breath and a little drop in my stomach, a half-second where everything freezes. Shame and that hot frustration surge over that pause, and the fortune-telling machine immediately treats it like proof the disaster is already happening, so I shut down. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what would happen if you let that tiny hitch be exactly as it is – without judgment, without trying to change it, and without pushing the tightness away? What would happen if you just allowed the pause to be, without trying to "fix" it or move on to the story?

Patient: If I let that tiny hitch be, there's this weird little flicker of space — for a breath the knot loosens a hair — but then shame and that old failure surge up and the fortune-telling machine screams that the pause is just the calm before the storm: fees, missed payments, eviction, my partner leaving. I'm really overwhelmed and not sure I follow how just sitting with the pause would help; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what the fortune-telling machine is saying – "the pause is just the calm before the storm." What would happen if you looked at that story, just as it is, without judgment or trying to change it? Would you say "yes" to that story, or would you simply notice it, like "I see that's what the machine is saying"?

Patient: I can try to say, "I see that's what the machine is saying," but the second I do that old shame and the sting of that past failure flare up and it feels like I'm just agreeing the pause proves the storm is coming. I don't really buy that just noticing will help—my mind immediately turns it into fees, missed payments, eviction, my partner leaving, and I freeze. I'm not sure I follow how that helps; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the pause again – the tiny hitch in your breath, the drop in your stomach. What is it, exactly, that's happening in that moment, without trying to change it or push the shame away? Is it a physical sensation, a thought, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — in that pause there's a tiny catch, like my breath hits a wall and my stomach drops a beat, my heart twinges and my hands tighten. It's mostly a physical hitch but it's instantly wrapped in a thought that this proves the disaster, and shame and that old frustration flare up behind my eyes. I don't see how just staying with it helps; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the thought that says "this proves the disaster" – what is it, exactly? Is it a word, a phrase, a story you're telling yourself? Try to see it as a thought, not a truth. What would happen if you looked at it like that, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it's less a single word and more a looping story: "one missed payment and it's all over." When I even try to see it as a thought, that refrain feels like proof, and shame and that familiar, burning frustration rush back like I'm failing again. I can try to notice it as a thought, but the fortune-telling machine immediately turns it into fees, eviction, my partner leaving, and I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to label the story as a thought – "this is a thought" – right before the machine starts spinning it into the disaster narrative. What's the tiny moment before it takes off? Is there a pause, a hesitation, or a slight shift in your body? Try to anchor that moment, just for a breath.

Patient: There's this tiny half-second hitch — a catch in my throat, a quick drop in my stomach, my hands tighten — like everything freezes for a beat. If I anchor there the knot loosens a hair, but shame and that familiar burning frustration slam back in and the fortune-telling machine immediately starts narrating fees, missed payments, eviction, and my partner leaving. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that pause helps; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to "anchor" the pause – you said it loosens the knot, but then shame comes back. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the pause, you simply... let it be? What if you didn't try to change it or push it away, but just allowed it to be, without judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — letting the pause be for a beat does make the knot loosen a hair, like there's a tiny crack of space, but then shame and that familiar burning frustration rush back and the fortune-telling machine starts shrieking fees, missed payments, eviction, and my partner leaving like it's already happening. I want to try letting it be, but I'm confused and terrified it's just the calm before the storm, and that old shame makes me feel like I'm failing all over again. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you think "it's the calm before the storm" – that thought is already telling you it's going to happen, and that's what's making you scared. What if, instead of thinking that, you simply noticed the pause as... what is it? Is it a sensation, a thought, or just a moment? Try to see it without judgment, without trying to control it – just observe it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to just observe it it's a tiny hollow beat, a catch in my breath and a slight easing of the knot in my chest. But the fortune-telling machine instantly fills that space with the "calm before the storm" story — fees, missed payments, eviction, my partner leaving — and shame and that old frustration slam back in. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens when the fortune-telling machine starts spinning the story – what's the physical sensation in your body? Is it tightening, tensing, or some other response? Try to anchor that sensation, just for a breath, without judgment. What would happen if you didn't try to push the story away, but instead... let it be?

Patient: When the machine starts spinning my chest clamps tight, my upper stomach drops, my breath goes thin, my hands tremble and my jaw clenches—shame heats my face and that familiar surge of failure rushes up like proof I'm worthless. If I try to anchor it and just breathe there's a tiny loosening, maybe a hair of space, but the machine immediately fills it back in with fees, missed payments, eviction, and my partner leaving, and I freeze. I'm not sure I follow how "letting it be" helps—honestly it feels like sitting on a bomb—and I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?
