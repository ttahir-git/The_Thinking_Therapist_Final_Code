Patient: I'm in my early fifties and back at school, and lately what's been on my mind is this intense anxiety in social settings. I keep avoiding gatherings with friends because I get really on edge, though my colleagues have been somewhat supportive. It's really uncomfortable to talk about, so I guess I might shut down or say "I don't know" if we get too close to it.

Therapist: What's one value that matters to you when it comes to connecting with friends, even if it feels uncomfortable – like being able to show up fully and be yourself in those moments?

Patient: I guess authenticity — or really just feeling understood and accepted. I want to be able to show up as myself without having to perform, but talking about it makes me tense and I don't know how to explain it better.

Therapist: That tension makes sense – when you think about being authentic, but talking about it feels like performing, it creates a paradox. What happens when you're at a gathering with friends and you start to feel that tension? What's the first thing that usually happens – do you start checking your phone, avoid eye contact, or something else?

Patient: I guess the first thing I do is grab my phone so I have something to focus on. My heart starts racing, I scan the room and avoid eye contact, and I find myself standing by the exit like I'm ready to leave. I don't know, it feels automatic and then I usually slip away early.

Therapist: When you notice your heart racing and your hands start to grab your phone, what's the first thought that comes up for you – is it "I need to get out of here" or something else?

Patient: I guess the first thought is “I need to get out of here,” and then it flips to “they can tell I’m anxious” or “I’m being awkward.” I don’t know, I worry they’ll judge me or that I’ll say something stupid. Sorry—it's just hard to pin down.

Therapist: When you're standing by the exit, ready to leave, what would you have to do to actually leave the gathering – would you need to say goodbye to someone, or would you just need to step outside?

Patient: I guess usually I just step outside and slip away. If I feel I have to, I’ll mutter a quick “sorry, I have to go” to someone I know, but most times I drift off without a proper goodbye. I don't know, leaving feels easier than staying.

Therapist: You said leaving feels easier than staying. What's the part about staying that makes you want to leave – is it the thought of being judged, or something else entirely?

Patient: I guess it's mostly the fear of being judged — like I worry every little thing I say will come out wrong. Then I get this tightness in my chest and my mind goes blank, so I feel useless and exposed. I don't know, it's embarrassing to admit and I kind of want to change the subject.

Therapist: When you feel that tightness in your chest and your mind goes blank, what's the first thing you're tempted to do – is it try to talk your way out of it, avoid the conversation, or change the subject?

Patient: I guess I mostly try to avoid or change the subject — I’ll steer the conversation away or make a joke. Sometimes I try to talk my way out, but my mind goes blank and I end up quiet or glued to my phone. I don't know, it feels automatic and like I can't control it.

Therapist: When you feel that tightness in your chest, what's the one thing you're afraid will happen if you don't change the subject – is it that you'll say something "wrong", that others will judge you, or something else?

Patient: I guess I'm afraid I'll say something stupid and everyone will notice how awkward I am. I worry they'll judge me or decide I'm not worth talking to, maybe even stop inviting me. I don't know — it just feels like everything would fall apart if I didn't change the subject.

Therapist: If you allowed yourself to feel awkward or uncomfortable in the conversation, what's the one thing you might actually get to experience – is it a chance to connect with someone, learn something new, or simply be present with the moment?

Patient: I guess if I let myself feel awkward, maybe I could actually connect with someone — like they'd notice and reach out, and that would feel...relieving. Or maybe I'd realize it's not as catastrophic as I imagine and I wouldn't be judged so harshly. I don't know, saying that feels weird.

Therapist: When you imagine being present and vulnerable in the conversation, what would the physical sensation of your chest tightness look like – is it a knot, a squeeze, or a heaviness?

Patient: I guess it's like a knot — a tight, sinking squeeze right under my ribs, like someone's pressing in. My breath gets shallow, my shoulders hunch up, and my stomach flips. I don't know, I don't really like getting into the details, it makes me tense.

Therapist: What happens in the moment when you let the knot be there, instead of trying to escape it – does it feel like you're shrinking away from the conversation, or does it actually create space for someone to notice you and connect with you?

Patient: I don't know... at first I just kind of shrink — my voice goes tiny and I fold in on myself like I want to disappear. But every so often if I stay, someone will notice and check in, and that actually loosens the knot a little. I guess it feels risky — like it could go either way — and getting into it like this already makes me more tense.

Therapist: What's the one thing you value most about connecting with others, and is it worth risking feeling vulnerable (i.e., the knot) for just a moment to see what happens?

Patient: I guess what I value most is feeling accepted — like someone sees me and doesn't expect me to put on a show. Is it worth the knot? I don't know... part of me thinks yes, because the few times I stayed awkward someone reached out and it helped, but it still terrifies me and I don't really know how to push through without panicking.

Therapist: What would you do with just 30 seconds of physical comfort (e.g., deep breath, gentle shoulder roll, or a small stretch) before reaching out to someone in the conversation?

Patient: I guess I'd take one slow, deep breath, let my shoulders drop, and maybe roll them once while grounding my feet. Then I'd try something small and quiet — a soft "hi" or a simple question — but I don't know, it still feels hard.

Therapist: As you take that slow, deep breath and say "hi" or ask a simple question, what's one thing you might notice about yourself – is it a tiny shift in your posture, a slight opening in your voice, or a glimmer of curiosity in your eyes?

Patient: I guess I'd notice my shoulders drop and my voice come out a bit steadier — like there's a tiny space to actually say something. I don't know, it still feels fragile.

Therapist: When you notice your shoulders dropping and your voice steadying, what would you do instead of trying to "make it work"? Would you say "yes" to the connection, even if it feels tentative, or would you try to "fix" it by saying something more "perfect"?

Patient: I guess I'd want to say yes to the connection, but my knee-jerk is to try to fix it — come up with something "right" to say. Then I get this wash of shame, like I already messed it up, and I end up pulling back. I don't know, it just feels frustrating and heavy.

Therapist: When you notice your knee-jerk to "fix" the moment, what's one small thing you could do instead of trying to control the outcome? Would you take one tiny breath before responding, or just pause for a moment to see what happens without trying to "make it right"?

Patient: I guess I could just take one slow breath and pause — maybe say something simple like "hmm" or "I'm thinking" instead of trying to fix it. But when I try that, this heavy shame comes over me, like I've already blown it, and then I clench up. I don't know, it still feels really hard.

Therapist: When you notice that heavy shame rising up in your chest, what would you do with your body instead of trying to fight it? Would you notice the sensation of your heart rate slowing down, your muscles tensing up, or your breath getting shallow?

Patient: I guess I'd try to soften my shoulders and take a slow, deliberate breath, maybe rest a hand on my chest just to notice it. But usually that shame comes and I end up holding my breath, my chest tightens more, my jaw clenches, and I just want to disappear. I don't know — it feels heavy and kind of pointless to get into.

Therapist: When you notice your chest tightening and your jaw clenching, what would you say to yourself instead of trying to "get through" the shame? Would you say "I see that I'm feeling this tightness" or "This is what happens when I feel this way"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "I notice this tightness in my chest,"—just naming it out loud. But then that shame comes up, I feel stupid, and I clamp up or go quiet, so I don't know if it actually helps.

Therapist: When you notice the shame coming up after naming the physical sensation, what would you do just before responding to it (instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing")? Would you take one tiny breath, or roll your shoulders slightly, or look away for just a second?

Patient: I guess I'd try a tiny slow breath, roll my shoulders a bit, maybe rest a hand on my chest and ground my feet for a second. But then shame floods in and I clench up and go quiet, and I don't know if that pause actually helps — it just feels like I'm back where I started.

Therapist: When you notice the shame flooding in and you're clenching up, what's one tiny physical thing you could do to connect with your body, like touching your toes or stretching your neck, instead of trying to push it away?

Patient: I guess maybe a tiny neck stretch or rolling my shoulders, or pressing my feet into the floor and taking one slow breath. But even picturing that brings up this heavy, stupid shame and I clamp down, so I don't know if it would actually help.

Therapist: When you notice the shame flooding in and you're clamping down, what would you say to yourself instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing"? Would you say "This shame feels like it's rising up in my chest" or "I'm feeling this tightness in my shoulders"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "This shame is here — my chest is tight and my jaw's clenched," out loud so it's not just in my head. But then I feel silly and the words kind of fizzle, and I don't know if it actually helps. It just feels heavy and I... I guess that's where I get stuck.

Therapist: When you notice the shame still feeling heavy and you're getting stuck, what's one tiny physical thing you could do to ground yourself in the present moment, like taking one slow breath or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I guess I could press my feet into the floor and take one slow, deliberate breath — maybe roll my shoulders or rub my thumb along my palm to anchor myself. But even picturing that makes this heavy, stupid shame swell up and I clamp down, so I don't know if it would actually help — it just feels pointless sometimes.

Therapist: When you notice the shame swirling up again, what would you say to yourself instead of "I'm stupid" or "I'm failing"? Would you say "I'm feeling this shame right now" or "This shame is here, and I'm going to ground myself in my body"?

Patient: I guess I'd try saying, "I'm feeling this shame right now," and then follow with something like, "This shame is here — I'm going to press my feet into the floor and take one slow breath." But saying that already feels kind of ridiculous and heavy, and I don't know… it just makes me want to clam up.

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I'm feeling this shame right now" and you're tempted to judge it as "ridiculous", what would you do instead of trying to "fix" the thought? Would you simply say "This thought feels uncomfortable" and then take one small physical action to ground yourself, like pressing your feet into the floor?

Patient: I guess I could try that — say out loud, "This thought feels uncomfortable," and press my feet into the floor and take one slow breath. But even thinking about saying it makes this hot shame rush up and I clam up, so I don't know if it would actually help.

Therapist: Instead of saying "This thought feels uncomfortable", what would you say to yourself as you press your feet into the floor and take a slow breath? Would you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, or the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe?

Patient: I guess I'd just notice the weight of my feet on the floor and the slow rise and fall of my chest — name those simple sensations so there's something steady to focus on. But even saying that feels...embarrassing, like I'm admitting I can't handle it, so I don't know if I could actually do it without clamming up.

Therapist: What would you say to yourself if someone else was noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor or the rise and fall of your chest? Would you say "I'm feeling a bit tight in my chest" or "My feet feel heavy"? Notice how that sounds different from saying "This thought feels uncomfortable" – it's more about noticing the physical sensations, rather than judging them.

Patient: I guess I'd say something simple like "my feet feel heavy" or "my chest is tight" — it's less judging and more noticing. But even saying that makes this hot shame flare up, like I've already screwed it up, and I feel stupid admitting it. I don't know... can we not go deeper into that right now?
