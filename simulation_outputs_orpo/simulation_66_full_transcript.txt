Patient: Lately I've been stuck worrying nonstop about how I'd perform when I go back to work, even though I'm unemployed right now — those images of failing just freeze me and I end up procrastinating. The health scare and my PTSD make it worse; I can't seem to get past the anxiety to actually do anything. I've tried things before and it didn't help, so how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a pattern of stuckness fueled by worry about performance, amplified by anxiety and PTSD. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the "stuck" workability of this worry to identify an unworkable strategy.

Therapist Answer:
That cycle of worry about work performance when you're unemployed sounds really crippling. When you say those images of failure "freeze" you, what would happen in your body if you allowed that image to stay just for a second, without trying to "fix" it or push it away?

Patient: If I let that image sit for a second my chest gets tight, my breath shortens and my hands go a bit numb — my head goes foggy like I can't think straight. I feel this clammy, wired-then-paralyzed thing where I want to move but can't, and then I start looking for any excuse to avoid it. How is that supposed to help to just notice it? I've tried paying attention before and it just spirals into more panic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've vividly described the physical sensations and paralysis that follow the worry image. Goal: Introduce willingness to an alternative to struggle (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Those sensations you mentioned – the tightness, short breath, numbness, and foggy thinking – feel like a physical response to the worry. When you say you want to avoid it, what's one tiny, tiny thing you could do with your body that wouldn't involve trying to push the worry away or escape it, just to make space for that physical sensation to exist without judgment?

Patient: I guess I could rest my hand on my chest and try one slow, deliberate breath, maybe count to three as I exhale. But I've done breathing like that before and it just makes the panic louder — how is that supposed to help? Even if I get that one breath, my mind's already racing to ways to avoid the feeling, so I don't see how it changes anything.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've chosen a small, concrete action to try defusion, but it's clear the pattern of struggle is still present. Goal: Connect willingness to this action despite its unworkability.

Therapist Answer:
You're right that the breathing exercise might not magically change the panic – but what's interesting is that you're already considering it as a "way to avoid" the feeling, rather than trying to "make room" for it. What if, instead of labeling that as "avoidance," you simply noticed the thought "I don't want to breathe that way" arise – without judgment?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice the thought “I don’t want to breathe that way,” but when I do it just gets louder—like a siren—and my heart races more. I’ve tried labeling thoughts before and it turns into an argument in my head that ends with me avoiding whatever I was supposed to do. How is noticing it supposed to actually stop the panic or the procrastination?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried labeling thoughts before and it led to an argument – that's a clear pattern of struggle. Goal: Introduce the value of defusion as a process, not a solution.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought "I don't want to breathe that way" is actually creating more anxiety, rather than making space for the physical sensation. What if, instead of trying to "change" the thought or "make it go away," you simply asked yourself: What's the purpose of trying to "fix" this thought? What value would it serve if you weren't trying to avoid the panic?

Patient: I guess the purpose of trying to fix the thought is to feel safe and in control — to stop the shame and the fear of looking incompetent if I go back to work. If I don't try to fix it I feel exposed and like I'm just waiting to be judged, which makes the panic worse and sends me straight into avoiding whatever needs doing. How is asking me about the “purpose” supposed to help when it just feels like another thing I can’t do right?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the purpose of the thought to a deep value: safety and control. Goal: Pivot to an ACT process that connects this value to action.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought "I need to fix this" is actually a cry for safety in the face of shame and fear. When you say that avoiding the task makes the panic worse, what would happen if, instead of trying to "fix" the thought, you simply made room for the physical sensation of panic to be present – without trying to "change" it or avoid it? What value would that actually serve for you in this moment, connected to your desire for safety and control?

Patient: Maybe if I let the panic be there it would show me it's temporary and I wouldn't waste so much energy fighting it — then I might actually start the job stuff — but I'm really not sure. How is that supposed to help with the exposure and shame? Letting it sit feels like leaving a door open for judgment, and that scares me and makes me want to run. I'm tired of trying things that don't stick, but I can try one breath or rest my hand on my chest if you want me to, though I doubt it'll change much.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're hesitant because letting the panic sit feels like leaving a door open for judgment – a fear tied to shame. Goal: Introduce a small, concrete step that connects value to action without needing to "fix" the thought.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the value of letting the panic sit is to avoid wasting energy fighting it, and that's a small step you're willing to try. What if, instead of "trying" to make the panic go away, you simply made a tiny commitment to yourself – just for 10 seconds – to rest your hand on your chest without judgment? That's not about changing the panic, but about making space for it to be present. What's the smallest value-driven action you could take in that 10 seconds, connected to your goal of starting the job stuff?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing would be to rest my hand on my chest, breathe out once, and click open my laptop — or even just type one single word in a draft cover letter, like "Hello." It's a tiny step toward the work and it feels doable without committing to anything big. But honestly, I've tried tiny steps before and they fizzle — how is one word or one click really supposed to get me past the shame and the panic?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right that tiny steps have fizzled out before, but this feels different because it's tied to a specific value (starting work) and a tangible action (typing one word). Goal: Connect the tiny step to a larger value.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the tiny step of typing "Hello" is connected to your value of taking action on work, and it's tangible enough that you can see it as a small win. What if, instead of just focusing on the tiny step itself, you looked at what it would mean to type "Hello" in the context of your goal – what would that mean for your anxiety, shame, and sense of control? What would it take to keep going after that initial word, when the panic comes up?

Patient: Typing "Hello" would feel like finally moving — a tiny proof that the freeze doesn't get the final say, even if it barely chips the panic. I don't expect it to erase the shame; maybe it just chips at it a millimeter and that could be enough to push to a second word. To keep going I'd need concrete scaffolding — a 5‑minute rule, a simple next step already written down, or a short plan for when the panic spikes — but honestly I'm skeptical; usually the shame yanks me back as soon as I try. How is one word and a timer really supposed to break the whole loop when I've tried similar tricks and they fell apart?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for concrete scaffolding to support the tiny step, and acknowledging that shame often yanks you back. Goal: Introduce a specific scaffolding tool that's not about "fixing" the shame, but about making space for action.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is a powerful force that pulls you back, and you're right to question whether one word and a timer are enough to break the loop. What if, instead of relying on a timer, you used a simple "bridge" – a physical object that represents the work itself, like a pen or a sticky note with a single word or phrase that you can glance at whenever the panic spikes? That way, you can create a tangible connection between the shame and the work, without trying to "change" the shame itself.

Patient: A sticky note could be less threatening than a timer — I could put one on my laptop that just says "Hello" or "One word" as a bridge. But how is glancing at a pen or note supposed to get me past the shame when I already have a dozen things I ignore? I'm tired of these little props that turn into wallpaper, so I'll try it once tomorrow — but only if we agree on a concrete next step for when the panic hits, because otherwise it'll just fizzle.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the value of the bridge if it becomes a distraction, and you're willing to try it only if it's connected to a concrete next step. Goal: Introduce a specific next step that's not about "fixing" the shame, but about making space for action.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're ready to try the bridge, and you want a clear next step to anchor it. What if, when the panic spikes, you simply looked at the sticky note and said, "That's the word I chose to start with – what's the next step I can take to make progress on the work, even if it's just one tiny action?" That way, the focus is on what you can do next, not on "fighting" the shame or avoiding it.

Patient: Alright — I'll put a sticky note on the laptop that just says "Hello" and try this: when the panic spikes I'll rest my hand on my chest, do one slow exhale, glance at the note, open the draft and type that one word, then force myself to keep going for just five minutes or at least write the next tiny step. It sounds simple, but I need that concrete fallback written down so I don't just freeze — otherwise it usually fizzles. Still, how is that actually supposed to get me past the shame when it usually yanks me right back out?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete next step, but the shame is still a powerful force that pulls you back. Goal: Introduce a subtle shift in the focus to make room for the tiny step.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that the shame will yank you back, but what if, instead of trying to "fight" the shame, you simply acknowledged its presence in the moment – without judgment? When you glance at the sticky note and type that one word, you could say to yourself, "Ah, the shame is here. Okay, now what's the tiny step I can take to keep moving forward?" That way, you're not trying to "fix" the shame, but making space for the next action, even if it's just a tiny one.

Patient: I can try saying to myself, "Ah, the shame is here," but every time I name it it feels like I feed it — it gets louder and I want to curl up and stop. Still, okay—I’ll practice the script: hand on chest, one slow exhale, glance at the "Hello" note, type the word, then ask myself "what's the next tiny step?" — but if it swells and yanks me back, what concrete fallback would you actually expect me to do in that moment?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right that naming the shame can feel like feeding it, and you want a concrete fallback that doesn't escalate the situation. Goal: Introduce a gentle anchor to help you stay present.

Therapist Answer:
If the shame swells and yanks you back, I'd expect you to pause for a moment and do a small, gentle physical action that doesn't engage with the shame – like unclogging your throat or taking a tiny sip of water. That way, you're not trying to "fix" the shame, but creating a small gap between yourself and the panic. This tiny action helps you stay present and gives you a chance to breathe, without getting caught up in the shame story.

Patient: Okay — I can try the sip-of-water or clear-my-throat move; it's small and doesn't feel like I'm battling the shame. But how is that really supposed to stop the shame from yanking me back? If the sip doesn't work, my concrete fallback is to stand up, walk to the kitchen, set a 60‑second timer, and come back — at least that gives me a real break instead of freezing in place.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right that the sip of water isn't a magic solution, but it's a small step that helps you stay present. Your concrete fallback of standing up and walking away is a good one, but it's not the goal – it's the avoidance behavior. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that connects to the original goal of working on the task.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of trying to "get past" the shame with a sip of water, what if you simply acknowledged that the shame is present, took a deep breath, and got up to do the 60-second timer work because that's what you committed to – because it helps you make progress on the task? You're not trying to "fight" the shame, but honoring the work commitment you made to yourself. This way, you're not avoiding the shame, but using it as a signal to refocus on the action that matters.

Patient: I hear you — using the shame as a signal to refocus makes sense in theory, but I'm worried the "refocus" just becomes another way to avoid the actual hard part. How am I supposed to tell the difference in the moment between taking a helpful 60‑second break and just letting myself bail? I'm tired of tricks that turn into avoidance, so can you give me a really concrete rule I can actually follow when the shame spikes — something that stops the loop instead of letting it slide into another excuse?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the difference between a helpful break and avoidance. Goal: Introduce a concrete rule that's specific, objective, and serves as a non-negotiable anchor.

Therapist Answer:
When the shame spikes, and you feel the urge to bail, I want you to do this: look at your breath. Not your work, not your shame, but your breath. Simply notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. If your mind wanders to work or shame, gently bring it back to the breath without judgment. Then, and only then, commit to doing one small action towards your work – like typing the next word, making a phone call, or sending an email. This rule is not about "getting past" the shame; it's about acknowledging the physical sensation of discomfort and taking a tangible step towards the work that matters.

Patient: Alright — I can try looking at my breath first, but I need specifics because this is where it usually goes sideways for me. Does "notice the breath" mean three slow breaths and then action, or keep watching until I feel calmer? Focusing on my breath sometimes makes the panic louder, so what do I do if it spirals instead of settling? I'll try a plan: three counted breaths, then type one word, but honestly — how is that actually supposed to stop the loop when these things usually fizzle?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to want specifics and to address the spiral when focusing on breath. Goal: Introduce a concrete anchor that connects to the physical sensation of discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the breath, I want you to focus on the sensation of your body in the present moment – not on the breath itself, but on the physical feeling of the discomfort. Imagine it as a weight or a tension in your body. When you notice this weight, commit to taking one small action towards your work, no matter how tiny. This doesn't mean you'll be "calm" or "focused," but you'll be taking a tangible step towards the work. The goal is not to "fix" the panic or make it go away, but to create a small gap between yourself and the discomfort. Think of it like a tiny "doorway" to the work – you're not trying to "open" it, but you are taking a small step towards it.

Patient: Okay, I can try that: notice the weight/tension in my body and use it as the signal to take one tiny step toward the work. But honestly — how is that supposed to stop the spiral? When I focus on the feeling it often gets louder and I end up bailing; I'm tired of these little techniques that fizzle. If it does spike, my concrete fallback will be to stand, fill a glass of water, set a 60‑second timer, then come back and force myself to type at least one word — can we treat that as part of the plan?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question how this technique will stop the spiral. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that acknowledges the fizzle and sets a clear next step.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to be honest about the fizzle. Instead of trying to "fix" the panic with the breath technique, what if we acknowledge that it might not work this time? When you notice the weight/tension in your body, commit to taking one small action towards your work, but also acknowledge that it's okay if you can't do that right now. Then, without judgment, say to yourself: "Okay, I tried that. Now what?" And then, as you mentioned, fill a glass of water, set a 60-second timer, and commit to typing at least one word when you come back. This way, you're not trying to "fix" the panic, but you're setting a clear next step that you can take when you're ready.

Patient: Alright. I'll try the breath → one tiny action, and if it spikes I'll do the water + 60‑second timer and then type at least one word when I come back. How is that supposed to help when these cycles usually just lead to more shame? If after the 60 seconds I still can't type one word, what's the concrete next move — repeat it, or do something else? I need a clear, nonjudgmental if‑then rule I can actually follow in the moment so I don't just argue myself into bailing; I'm tired saying this, but I want something that won't just fizzle.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question how this plan will help with shame, and you want a clear next step. Goal: Introduce a concrete if-then rule that's non-judgmental and sets a clear action.

Therapist Answer:
When you come back after the 60 seconds, if you still can't type one word, I want you to do this: notice the physical sensation of your body, including any tension or discomfort, and say to yourself: "I am feeling stuck. What is one tiny physical action I can take right now that doesn't involve my work?" For example, you might take a sip of water, stretch your arm, or press your feet on the floor. This action is not about "fixing" the shame, but about creating a small gap between yourself and the discomfort. Then, after taking that physical action, commit to typing one word on your work. If you still can't, that's okay – you can do that action again, or try something else. The goal is not to "get past" the shame, but to create a small cycle of action and willingness.

Patient: Alright — that plan makes sense on paper, but when that flash of failure hits it floods me with shame and I go rigid: my hands go numb, my chest tightens, and I start arguing with myself until I can't move. I can try the sip/stretch/press-feet move and then force myself to type one word, and if I still can't I’ll repeat it — but I'm really skeptical it won't just become another loop of small distractions. So what do you want me to do after, say, three repeats and I'm still frozen — keep repeating, or is there another concrete step that actually interrupts the shame instead of letting it stew?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question whether repeating the same action will break the loop. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that interrupts the shame cycle by changing the environment.

Therapist Answer:
When you've repeated the sip/stretch/press-feet action three times and you're still frozen, I want you to do this: take a break from your work and go outside for a short walk. Even if it's just 10-15 feet, get out of the room and into natural light or fresh air. This isn't about "fixing" the shame, but about creating a physical shift in your environment that can interrupt the shame cycle. When you come back, you can re-evaluate what's holding you back and try again. The goal is to break the cycle of shame by changing the context, not by repeating the same action.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is stepping outside supposed to help when that feeling hits? When that flash comes over me I go rigid: chest tight, hands numb, I feel exposed and ridiculous, and a "walk" often just feels like another way to bail. Do you mean literally step outside every time, even at night or when I'm too scared to leave the house? If I do go out and it still doesn't help, what exactly do you want me to do next that actually interrupts the shame instead of becoming another excuse?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the practicality of stepping outside every time. Goal: Introduce a concrete strategy that interrupts the shame cycle without requiring physical action.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am here." That's it. Just that simple phrase. It's not about "fixing" the shame, but about acknowledging that you are present in the moment, regardless of how you're feeling. This phrase is not meant to be a "coping mechanism" but rather a small anchor that interrupts the shame cycle by bringing your attention to the present moment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try that it just drags up that awful, humiliating feeling and my chest tightens and my hands go numb. How is saying "I am here" supposed to be different from all the mantras I've tried that just turn into an argument in my head? Do you mean say it out loud once after a breath or keep repeating it — and if it doesn't help, what's the concrete next move you expect me to do right then?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of the phrase "I am here" given its previous impact. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates physical action to interrupt the shame cycle.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: take a small physical action immediately, like stretching your arm up towards the ceiling, or tapping your foot on the floor. Not "I am here," but this small, concrete action. Then, after taking that action, say to yourself: "That's it. I'm taking a breath." This small action is meant to interrupt the shame cycle by providing a tangible, non-judgmental moment in the present, rather than getting caught up in thoughts or mantras.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a one-second stretch supposed to stop that flash of shame from taking over? When I try stuff like this it usually just makes the shame louder and the little phrase turns into an argument in my head. If the stretch plus "that's it" doesn't break it, what's the exact next move you expect me to do — repeat it a set number of times, go outside, or something concrete I can actually follow?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of the stretch and phrase combination. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates a clear, concrete action that can interrupt the shame cycle.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: immediately reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or phone number of someone who can offer a brief, non-judgmental conversation (e.g., a therapist, support group, or crisis line). This action is meant to interrupt the shame cycle by providing a tangible connection to someone who can offer a different perspective, without judgment. The goal is not to "fix" the shame, but to create a small gap between yourself and the discomfort by connecting with someone who can offer a different vantage point.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is reaching out supposed to help when that rush hits? It just makes my chest tighten and I feel ridiculous, like I'm burdening someone; I've tried calling friends before and it didn't help, so I don't see how this is different. If I can't bring myself to call or the person doesn't answer, what exactly do you want me to do in that moment — call a crisis line, send a prewritten text, or something concrete that actually interrupts the shame instead of just giving me another way to bail?

Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of reaching out when the rush hits. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates a clear, concrete action that can interrupt the shame cycle without relying on external resources.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: stop whatever you're doing, take a deep breath, and notice what you can do with your body right now. This is not about "fixing" the shame, but about using your physical presence to interrupt the cycle. Specifically, I want you to notice where you are sitting or standing – notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of your seat on the chair, or the sensation of the air on your skin. Just notice that physical sensation without judgment. This simple act of noticing your body can help interrupt the shame cycle by bringing your attention to the present moment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my feet supposed to help when that awful flash hits? Usually I go rigid, my hands go numb and I can't even feel my feet, and trying to "notice" just turns into me arguing with myself and freezing more. If I really can't feel them, do you want me to stomp, press my feet into the floor, or stand and walk a few steps — and if that still doesn't break it after three tries, what's the exact next move you expect me to do? I'm tired of these little tricks that fizzle, so I need something concrete that actually interrupts it — how is this supposed to help?

You're right to question the effectiveness of noticing your feet when the flash hits. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates a clear, concrete action that can interrupt the shame cycle by using physical discomfort to shift attention.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: make a loud, awkward sound with your mouth, like clearing your throat or making a small, grunting noise. This might feel embarrassing or uncomfortable, but it's meant to disrupt the cycle of shame by creating a physical tension that shifts your attention away from the discomfort. Try to make a sound that's not a typical "work" sound, but something that feels more like a bodily response. If you're still stuck, try making a small, intentional movement with your face, like pursing your lips or sticking out your tongue. The goal is to create a small, physical disruption that interrupts the shame cycle.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — making a loud, awkward noise just feels humiliating and like it would draw attention to me, not take it away. How is that supposed to help? I can feel my chest tighten and my hands go numb just thinking about doing it; it seems like it would amplify the shame. If I tried it and it didn't break the flash, what exactly do you want me to do next — repeat it a set number of times, go outside, or something concrete I can actually follow?

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: freeze in place for exactly 5 seconds. Yes, just 5 seconds. I want you to stop whatever you're doing, stop thinking, and simply freeze. Don't try to move, don't try to breathe, just freeze. Then, slowly, deliberately, start to move your body in a tiny, tiny way – like rolling your shoulders, or shifting your weight, or blinking once. This tiny movement is meant to interrupt the cycle of shame by creating a small, physical contrast to the frozen feeling. If you're still stuck, try to move your feet slightly, or stretch one finger. The goal is to create a small, physical shift in your body that interrupts the shame cycle.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — freeze and "don't try to breathe"? How is that supposed to help? That instruction actually makes the shame spike and my chest tighten; I go more rigid and feel like I can't even hold still. Can I at least breathe normally while I freeze for 5 seconds, and if three tries don't help, what's the exact next move you want me to do (stand and go outside, set a timer, call someone)?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of freezing and not breathing. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates a clear, concrete action that can interrupt the shame cycle while allowing for natural bodily functions.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, make a tiny, gentle physical movement with your body – like rolling your shoulders, stretching one finger, or tilting your head slightly to one side. This movement is meant to interrupt the cycle of shame by creating a small, physical contrast to the frozen feeling. Try to make the movement as subtle as possible, and don't worry about "doing it right" – just focus on making a tiny movement. If you're still stuck, try to breathe normally while you make the movement. If three tries don't help, we can try a different strategy – standing outside, setting a timer, or calling someone.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — just reading that makes my chest tighten and that awful rush comes back and I go rigid. I can try a slow breath and a tiny shoulder roll or finger stretch, but I need very concrete rules: is one breath + one tiny movement one "try," or do you mean a series of breaths? How long between tries? And if three tries don't help, do you want me to immediately go outside, set the 60‑second timer, or call someone — exactly which one and in what order? 

Also—honestly—how is this supposed to stop the shame when those tiny moves usually just make it louder? If the movement worsens the feeling, can I skip straight to the water + 60‑second plan, or would you have a different interrupt to use instead?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of the movement-based strategy, and I appreciate your willingness to explore alternative approaches. Goal: Introduce a new strategy that incorporates concrete rules and a clear next step.

Therapist Answer:
When the flash of shame hits, I want you to do this: take one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and immediately make a tiny, physical movement with your body – like rolling your shoulders, stretching one finger, or tilting your head slightly to one side. This is one "try." After one try, take another slow, deep breath in, and immediately make another tiny movement with your body. We'll repeat this process for three tries. If three tries don't help, we'll move to the next strategy.

As for the shame intensifying with the movement, I understand that it can be a challenge. If the movement worsens the feeling, we can try a different interrupt – in this case, the water + 60-second timer plan. However, if you're willing to try a new strategy, I'd like to introduce a brief pause before moving to the timer. When the shame spikes and you feel rigid, I want you to pause for exactly 2 seconds before taking your next breath. This brief pause can help create a small gap between the shame and your physical response.

If you're still not comfortable with this, we can move directly to the water + 60-second timer plan.

Patient: Okay — I'm skeptical, but let's be concrete: so the sequence is notice the flash → pause exactly 2 seconds → do the breath + tiny movement (that's one try) → repeat that two more times → if I'm still stuck, go straight to the water + 60‑second timer, correct? How is that 2‑second pause actually different from all the other pauses I've tried? When I'm flooded it feels like an eternity and my shame just yells louder. I'll try it, but I want it clear that after the 60 seconds I have to type at least one word — no negotiating — and if I still can't, we need a different, specific next step because I will freeze otherwise.
