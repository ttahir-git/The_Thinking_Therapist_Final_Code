Patient: I guess I've been using procrastination to numb a lot of uncomfortable stuff — mostly grief from a recent loss — and it's getting in the way of this demanding program I just started. I keep filling my days with small tasks and distractions instead of dealing with how awful it feels. I don't know, talking about it feels messy and kind of hard.

Therapist: When you say "talking about it feels messy," what's the smallest, most tangible thing you avoid doing because of that feeling – like, what's the first thing you'd put off if you weren't already doing small tasks?

Patient: I guess it's opening the folder on my laptop with their photos and messages — there's a folder literally named with their name and I just don't click it. Even looking at one photo feels like it'll make it real, so I tidy or do busywork instead. I don't know, it just overwhelms me.

Therapist: What's the one photo that, if you looked at it, would be the smallest step towards remembering them, rather than avoiding them – just that one photo?

Patient: I guess it's that one of them laughing at the park, holding that ridiculous blue mug they always had. I don't know, even thinking about opening it makes my chest tighten like it'll force me to admit they're really gone.

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you could do with that photo – just one tiny thing – that wouldn't be avoiding it but still honoring their memory, like keeping it on your phone as a lock screen?

Patient: I guess I could set that photo as my phone lock screen for a day — like, just have them pop up every time I check my phone so I don't keep pretending they're not there. I don't know, it feels tiny enough to handle, but also like it could make me start crying in the middle of class and I hate that thought.
