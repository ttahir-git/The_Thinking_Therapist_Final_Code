Patient: I've been avoiding any sort of social gathering lately because the anxiety feels unbearable. Since my health scare this year, my mind turns into this fortune-telling machine—I picture myself having a panic or even another medical episode in front of friends, everyone panics, word spreads, my reputation and business collapse, and I'll end up completely alone. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't shake those predictions; they feel inevitable.

Therapist: Those predictions must be incredibly painful. What's one thing about your business or reputation that's truly important to you, and how showing up in a social gathering even once might help you connect to that value?

Patient: What's most important to me is being seen as trustworthy and steady — my business hangs on people believing I can be counted on. In theory, going to one gathering could remind people I'm still me, keep relationships warm, and quiet those worried murmurs. But honestly, my mind immediately says I'll have a panic or another health scare there, everyone will gossip, clients will back away, and that'll be the start of everything falling apart—other outcomes just don't feel realistic to me.

Therapist: When your mind says "I'll have a panic and everything falls apart," what happens to the part of you that values being trustworthy and steady in that moment? Can you see that value as separate from the thought, even if it's scary?

Patient: When that prediction kicks in, the part of me that wants to be steady just gets smothered — it's a tiny, tired voice and the fortune-telling machine is shouting so loud I can't hear it. I try to tell myself they're separate, but it doesn't feel real; the disaster-story feels like the only thing that will happen, and the steady, trustworthy me feels like it's already been buried.

Therapist: Notice how that tiny voice is still present, even when the disaster story is loud. What if, instead of trying to make the disaster story louder, you made room for that tiny voice to whisper its value – just for a breath?

Patient: I want to, I really do, but the fortune-telling machine kicks in the moment I try — I'll panic, have another health scare, people will see me fall, they'll gossip, clients will pull out, my business will collapse. For a single breath I can hear that steady voice saying "you're still you," but it's drowned out so fast I don't know how to keep it alive. It just feels impossible most of the time.

Therapist: When that tiny voice says "you're still you," what's one tiny, tiny thing you could do in the next 5 minutes to keep showing up, even if it feels like just a tiny crack in the disaster story?

Patient: I could send one quick text to a single trusted friend right now — just "thinking of you" or "hi" and nothing more. But my fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I do, they'll call or want to meet, I'll panic in front of them, people will talk, and my business will start crumbling — I know that sounds over the top, but I'm already feeling shaky just imagining it.

Therapist: Let's make a tiny bet with your fortune-telling machine: what if you send that text, and instead of the worst-case scenario unfolding, you notice just that one tiny moment of silence – or a tiny shift in your body – before the thoughts kick in?

Patient: I can almost feel that tiny pause — like a small loosening in my chest — but the moment I even think about sending the text the fortune-telling machine yells that they'll call, I'll panic, they'll see me fall apart, gossip will spread, clients will pull away, and everything will start falling apart. It feels like a tease; that little shift barely happens before the disaster-story takes over, so I can't really trust it.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control the outcome (send the text or not), you simply allowed yourself to be willing to send the text, even if the fortune-telling machine tries to hijack it? No promise that it will work, no expectation of a specific outcome – just the willingness to move towards it, despite the anxiety.

Patient: I can try to be willing — I can feel that tiny loosening in my chest and I want to hold it for a minute — but the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I send the text they'll call, I'll panic in front of them, have another health scare, it'll become gossip, clients will pull away, and my business will collapse. Saying I'm willing already makes me shaky; I don't know how to keep that willingness when the disaster-story takes over.

Therapist: Notice what the fortune-telling machine is trying to do when it screams about the worst-case scenario. What role is it playing – is it trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, or is it trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I think it's trying to protect me — shouting disaster so I won't have to feel vulnerable in front of others. But it's also about control: if it scares me into staying home, then it "prevents" the catastrophe it predicts. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't seem to see any other outcome as real.

Therapist: That thought is actually working to keep you from showing up in a way that matters to you – being trustworthy and steady for your business. What value is at stake if you don't send that text, and what would it mean for that value to be lost?

Patient: The value at stake is being seen as trustworthy and steady — that's how my business survives and how I keep some dignity. If I don't send the text, my mind immediately spins that it all unravels: people drift away, clients doubt me, deals fall through, gossip starts, the business collapses, and I'm left alone and humiliated. I can feel that old sting of shame and frustration rising just thinking about it, and that makes me freeze up even more.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you think about that sting of shame and frustration – it's not just the thought itself, but the physical sensation it creates in your body. What would it take for that physical sensation to shift, even if the thought itself stays the same?

Patient: Maybe if I did something really physical—slow deep breaths, feeling my feet on the floor, or pressing my thumb against my palm to ground myself—I might get a small shift in the body even while the thought stays. But the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that the breath won't be enough, my chest will clamp down harder, I'll look weak, people will notice, gossip will start, clients will pull away, and everything will unravel. I can feel that old sting of humiliation already and it makes me doubt any of those tiny anchors will actually help.

Therapist: Notice that the thought about your chest clamping down is actually happening right now, even while you're trying to breathe. What if, for just a tiny moment, you allowed that sensation to be exactly as it is – without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can try to let it be—I feel the tight clamp in my chest and that familiar sting of shame—but the moment I pay attention the fortune-telling machine yells that by noticing I'll give everyone a reason to see me fall and that will start everything collapsing. I could hold the breath for one slow count, but I'm jumpy and distracted and I already feel like I'm walking into a trap, so I don't know how to stay with it.

Therapist: Notice what the fortune-telling machine is trying to do when it says "you'll give everyone a reason to see you fall" – it's trying to make you avoid noticing the thought itself. What if, for just a tiny moment, you looked at that thought as if it was a stranger, not a part of you?

Patient: I can try to picture it as a stranger, but the moment I do the fortune-telling machine screams that the stranger will step up, point at me, everyone will notice I'm shaking, they'll whisper, clients will pull away, and my business will start to crumble. I can feel that old shame flaring—my hands go cold and my head spins—and it makes me want to freeze and hide because I just don't see any other outcome as real.

Therapist: What is the core value that's being threatened when you think about your business "crumbling" – is it a desire to be seen as competent, or to be liked by others, or something else?

Patient: It's mostly about being seen as competent and steady — that people can rely on me so my business and a little bit of dignity keep going. Saying it out loud brings that old shame and frustration up; I can feel my chest tighten thinking everyone will see me as weak and I'll end up alone. I'm jittery just talking about it and my fortune-telling mind immediately insists there's no other realistic outcome — gossip, clients leaving, everything collapsing — so being liked feels secondary to not being humiliated.

Therapist: Notice the phrase "being seen as weak" – what does that actually feel like for you, in your body? Is it a tightness, a heaviness, a numbness? Can you imagine a different sensation, one that's not associated with shame, when you're being seen as competent and steady?

Patient: It's a vise in my chest and a cold sinking in my stomach, my hands go numb and my face prickles like I'm already burned by it—my body acts like the humiliation's happened. I can try to picture a steady, warm feeling of competence, but the fortune-telling machine immediately yells that even if that feeling shows up for a beat it'll be ripped away: I'll panic, people will notice, gossip will spread, clients will pull out, and the business will start collapsing. That old sting of shame and frustration flares up and I get jumpy and can't keep my attention on anything else.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now – the weight of your body, the pressure of your feet on the floor. What would it take for you to focus on that sensation for just one more breath, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I can feel my feet—flat on the floor, a bit of pressure under my heels, the weight of my legs—if I take one slow breath and count to three maybe I could stay with it. But the fortune-telling machine is already shouting that the moment I calm someone will notice I'm trembling, they'll think I'm weak, gossip will start, clients will pull away and my business will start falling apart. My chest tightens and that old shame is burning up again, so I can't tell how to keep my attention on my feet for even that one more breath.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you think "the moment I calm someone will notice I'm trembling" – you're actually using that thought to fuel the very anxiety you're trying to avoid. What if, for just a tiny moment, you looked at that thought as if it was a stranger, not a part of you – what would that look like?

Patient: I tried picturing the thought as a stranger, but the moment I do the fortune-telling machine screams that the stranger will step forward, point at me, everyone will see I'm trembling, gossip will start, clients will pull away, and my business will begin to crumble. My chest tightens and that old shame and frustration flood me so fast my hands go numb, and I can't hold the image of the stranger for more than a breath. I'm feeling jumpy and distracted just saying this—like everything's closing in—and I don't know how to actually keep that distance from the thought.

Therapist: Notice that you're using the word "screams" – that's a judgmental word. What if, instead, you simply acknowledged the thought as it is, without judgment? Can you say to yourself, "The thought 'the stranger will step forward' is here"?

Patient: Okay—"The thought 'the stranger will step forward' is here." Saying it out loud sharpens that old shame and my chest clamps; the fortune-telling machine immediately starts screaming everyone will notice, gossip will spread, clients will pull away, and I feel exposed and stupid. I'm already jumpy and distracted—my hands go numb and I can't seem to keep the label there for more than a breath.

Therapist: Notice that you've said the thought out loud again – what would it take for you to pause for just one tiny moment, one breath, before the fortune-telling machine starts screaming? Can you imagine a tiny pause between the thought and the reaction, like a small gap in the water?

Patient: I try to picture that tiny pause, but shame and that old sting flood me and my chest clenches so I can't hold still. Before I can even breathe the fortune-telling machine's already shouting that the pause will be noticed, I'll tremble, people will whisper, clients will pull out, and my business will start to fall apart. Maybe I can catch a half-second of space, but it feels like stepping into a trap and I'm too jumpy and distracted to stay there.

Therapist: Notice that the fortune-telling machine is using the phrase "the pause will be noticed" – what if you looked at that phrase like it was a warning label, not a prediction? Can you say to yourself, "The phrase 'the pause will be noticed' is warning me that I'm making progress"?

Patient: Okay — "The phrase 'the pause will be noticed' is warning me that I'm making progress." But the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I let myself believe that, someone will see me as weak, gossip will spread, clients will pull away, and that's the beginning of everything falling apart. I can feel the shame flaring now—my chest tightens and my hands go numb—and it makes me doubt even calling it progress.

Therapist: Notice that the fortune-telling machine is warning you about "letting yourself believe" – what is that "letting yourself believe" actually protecting you from? Is it the value of being seen as competent and steady, or something else?

Patient: I think it's trying to protect me from being exposed as weak — from that humiliation that, in my head, will immediately turn into gossip, clients pulling out, and everything unraveling. So yes, it's about being seen as competent and steady, but bigger than that it's trying to stop the panic of feeling out of control or shamed. Saying that brings the sting back—my chest tightens and I'm jumpy—so I can't seem to trust any softer possibility; the fortune-teller just keeps insisting the worst is guaranteed.

Therapist: Notice that when you say "being seen as weak" is what the fortune-telling machine is trying to protect you from, what would it take for you to be willing to feel that weakness, not as a failure, but as a small, tiny part of being human? Can you imagine being willing to feel that vulnerability, just for a tiny moment, without it triggering the panic?

Patient: I could try to be willing for a single breath—I want to—but the fortune-telling machine instantly yells that that tiny moment of vulnerability will be visible, I'll panic, people will whisper, clients will pull away, and the business will start to crumble. My chest tightens and that old sting of shame lights up so fast my hands go numb and I can't trust that willingness will hold. I don't know how to actually stay with it without the panic swallowing it whole.

Therapist: Notice that you're using the phrase "the panic swallowing it whole" – that's a judgmental phrase. What if, instead, you simply observed the sensation of the panic without judgment? Can you say to yourself, "The sensation of panic is here, right now, without trying to change it"?

Patient: "The sensation of panic is here, right now, without trying to change it." But the instant I notice it the fortune-telling machine starts screaming that if anyone sees this I’ll panic, they’ll gossip, clients will pull out, and my business will start to crumble — like it’s already happened. Saying that brings up this hot shame and frustration; I’m jumpy and distracted and I don’t know how to keep that neutral noticing for even one breath.

Therapist: Notice that the fortune-telling machine is saying "if anyone sees this" – what if you looked at that phrase like a "label" on the thought, rather than the thought itself? Can you say to yourself, "The thought 'if anyone sees this' is showing up now"?

Patient: "The thought 'if anyone sees this' is showing up now." I can say it, but the instant I do the fortune-telling machine is yelling that people will see me trembling, they'll start gossiping, clients will pull out, and my business will begin to collapse. That old shame slams into my chest, my hands go numb, and I'm jumpy and distracted—labeling it barely lasts a breath before the disaster-story drowns it out, so it feels almost useless.

Therapist: Notice that when the fortune-telling machine starts yelling, what physical sensations show up in your body? Can you anchor yourself to those sensations, just for a tiny moment, without trying to change them? For example, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: My chest tightens, my stomach drops cold, my hands go numb, and I can feel the weight of my feet on the floor like a tiny thing to hold onto. I try to focus on that pressure and a slow breath for a beat, but the fortune-telling machine instantly screams that the calm won't last — people will see me tremble, gossip will spread, clients will pull away, and everything will collapse — and that shame flames up so fast I lose the anchor. I'm jumpy and distracted right now and I don't know how to keep that small focus when the disaster-story grabs me.

Therapist: Notice that you're willing to try to focus on the pressure of your feet for just one more breath – what would it take for you to make a tiny commitment to stay with that sensation, even if it feels like just 1/100th of a second? Can you say to yourself, "I'll just hold onto this sensation of my feet for one more breath"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. I'll just hold onto the pressure of my feet for one more slow breath. But the fortune-telling machine's already screaming that the moment I pause everyone will see me trembling, gossip will spread, clients will pull away, and my business will start to crumble; that old sting of shame flares, my chest clamps, my hands go numb, and I'm too jumpy and distracted to stay with it.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when the fortune-telling machine starts screaming again – what would it take for you to simply ask yourself, "What's happening when I think 'everyone will see me trembling'?" Can you explore that thought without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: I try to ask myself that—what's happening when I think "everyone will see me trembling"—and the first thing I notice is my chest clamping and my hands going numb. But the fortune-telling machine immediately starts shouting that they'll notice, gossip will start, clients will pull away and my business will collapse, and that hot shame and panic wash over me so fast I can't stay curious—I'm too jumpy and distracted to really explore it.
