Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism—every little perceived failure just gets amplified into proof that I'm somehow inadequate. I can trace a lot of it back to being bullied in school, and now my social confidence is shot and job instability just amplifies the anxiety. I tend to intellectualize it—mapping the cycles and theorizing about causes—because actually sitting with the sadness or fear feels unsafe.

Therapist: That intellectualizing cycle sounds like it's been a lifesaver when you need it, but what's the cost when it comes to feeling those painful emotions like sadness or fear? What happens to your body when you're stuck in that thought loop instead of noticing what's actually happening right now?

Patient: If I frame it clinically, my intellectualizing acts like an avoidance strategy—keeps me in the prefrontal cortex narrative so the limbic stuff doesn't have to register. Physically, what shows up is chest tightness, shallow/rapid breathing, a knot in my stomach, jaw and shoulder tension, headaches, and this draining fatigue, but I usually note it as "stress response" instead of feeling it. Then I convert those sensations into theories—"hypervigilance," "fight/flight activation"—which lets me sidestep saying, like, "I'm scared" or "I'm sad." I'm trying to actually notice it now and I keep defaulting to analysis, which is exhausting and makes me feel stuck.

Therapist: Those physical sensations feel really stuck right now—chest tightness, jaw tension, fatigue. Before you try to analyze them, notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out. Can you just be with the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or explain it, for one small inhale?

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to take that inhale, and I can notice a little movement in my chest and a slight ease in my shoulders. But almost immediately my brain starts narrating it—"that's shallow, you're doing it wrong"—so I turn the sensation into criticism instead of just experiencing it. It feels uncomfortable to stay with it; that urge to analyze actually tightens my jaw and shortens my breath.

Therapist: When you notice that narrative "that's shallow" showing up, what's its job in your body? What would happen if you didn't follow that voice for one moment?

Patient: It feels like a defensive supervisor in my head—its job is to translate weird bodily signals into something I can control, like criticism, so I don't have to feel vulnerable. In my body it tightens everything up: my jaw clamps, my breath shortens, my shoulders hike, and my heart picks up the pace so I stay on alert. If I didn't follow it for a moment, I think I'd get hit with raw stuff—panic, shame, maybe crying—and I'd feel exposed and kind of wobbly, but there might also be a tiny drop in tension, like a possible unclenching. I'm curious about that unclenching but also honestly scared of what comes after, and I keep wanting to analyze instead of sitting with that fear.

Therapist: What value might allowing that raw feeling to show up (even if it feels scary) be connected to, if you were to let it happen without trying to control it?

Patient: I can see a real value: letting the raw feeling in would act like an epistemic reset—lower the brain's “error alarm,” recalibrate threat valuation, and let authentic affect (sadness, fear) surface, which could actually foster self-compassion, repair social relatedness, and loosen that chronic self-critical loop. 

Honestly, though, I'm scared—I imagine crying or feeling shaky and exposed, and that vulnerability feels risky, so my default is to intellectualize to stay safe, even though I can picture a lightness or relief if I actually let myself unclench.

Therapist: When you imagine what might happen if you let that raw feeling show up (without trying to control it), what's one tiny thing you could do in this moment to take that risk?

Patient: Okay—one tiny thing I could try is a somatic micro-experiment: put my hand over my chest, soften my jaw, and do three slow, unforced exhales while silently labeling the sensation as “tightness” without launching into critique. Saying it like that makes me feel both a little hopeful and awkward—my brain already wants to convert it into data, but I’m curious whether the musculature actually loosens if I don’t narrate. Can we try that now?

Therapist: Let's do that tiny step now: put your hand over your chest, soften your jaw, and take one slow, unforced exhale. As you exhale, say the sensation out loud to yourself, just as you said it would be labeled: "Tightness."

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest, softened my jaw, and let out one slow, unforced exhale, saying "Tightness" out loud. There was a tiny unclenching around my sternum and my shoulders dropped a bit, but almost instantly my brain started critiquing the breath and turning it into commentary instead of letting the feeling sit. It felt exposing—like crying might be close—and that made me embarrassed, though there's also a little curiosity about what would happen if I stayed with it. Can we do another one, or how long should I try to hold that label without turning it into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try it again, but this time, when you say "Tightness," pause after just the word. Don't add the critique or commentary. Just let the word sit there for a beat.

Patient: I did it — hand on my chest, softened jaw, one slow exhale and I said "Tightness" and paused. For that half-second my chest loosened and my shoulders dropped, and then my eyes got a little stingy like I might cry, which instantly triggered the impulse to rationalize it away. Holding the pause felt awkward but actually reduced the knot a bit; I'm trying not to turn it into commentary, but my brain keeps itching to explain why it happened. How long should I try to hold that quiet after the word before I notice what comes next?

Therapist: Try to hold the pause after "Tightness" for another 1-2 seconds before noticing what comes next. When you feel the urge to rationalize (like your brain starts making excuses), notice the thought without acting on it. What happens to the sensation in your chest?

Patient: When I held the pause for that second, there was a brief, almost imperceptible loosening in my chest—like the knot unclipped a hair—but then my anxiety spiked: my heart picked up, breath got shallow again, and my mind started ricocheting through explanations and worst-case scenarios. Noticing the thoughts without following them did seem to let the tightness ebb a little, but I kept getting distracted by intrusive commentary and this jittery, restless feeling in my stomach and hands. I'm trying to stay with it but it's hard—I feel shaky and embarrassed that I'm not doing it "right." Can we try another brief one together, or is there a way to anchor me when my attention darts like this?

Therapist: When you notice the thoughts starting to ricochet, let's add a tiny anchor to help you stay with the physical sensation: notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, even just for a heartbeat. This simple anchor can help stabilize your attention from getting caught in thoughts.

Patient: I planted my feet on the floor like you said and, for a split second, my brain registered that stability—there was a tiny drop in the jittery climb of my heart. But then my anxiety surged again and my attention skittered: stomach flipped, hands restless, and my mind started running through worst-case scenarios instead of staying put. I can analytically endorse grounding—it's obviously adaptive—but in vivo my cognition just keeps hijacking the moment and I feel embarrassed like I'm failing at something simple. Can you guide me through another brief round — say, three anchored breaths — so I can follow along instead of getting pulled into commentary?

Therapist: Let's do three more anchored breaths together. When you feel your mind starting to pull away, gently notice the sensation of your feet on the ground again. Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. As you exhale, say to yourself: "I am here."

Patient: I did the three anchored breaths — feet grounded, inhaled, and on each slow exhale I said "I am here" — and there were tiny, transient drops in the tension. But my anxiety kept surging between breaths: heart racing, stomach flip, hands restless, and my attention kept ricocheting to worst-case scenarios, so it was hard to sustain the anchor. I keep wanting to turn it into an explanatory narrative — like "temporary sympathetic downregulation" — instead of just saying I'm scared and jittery; can we slow it down more or try another very short, guided anchor because I'm worried I'm doing it wrong?

Therapist: Let's try a tiny anchor for just one heartbeat. When you feel your heart racing, take one tiny inhale, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I'm here" – just that one word, no elaboration. No analysis, no explanation. Just "I'm here".

Patient: I did it — one tiny inhale, then "I'm here" on the exhale. There was a micro-drop in my heart rate, like a fraction of relief, but my attention snapped to anxious scenarios and my hands started fidgeting again. I keep narrativizing the relief into stuff like "temporary parasympathetic shift" instead of just admitting I'm shaky and embarrassed and worried I'm doing it wrong. Can we try another brief one together, or do a very slow 10-second exhale so I have something to follow?

Therapist: Let's do a 10-second exhale together. As you inhale, prepare for it. When you exhale, count down from 10 slowly: "10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1." Keep going until you reach 1, and say to yourself: "I'm here."

Patient: I did the countdown exhale and said "I'm here" at the end, and for the first several seconds my chest loosened and my heart rate dipped a bit — but then around halfway through a spike of anxiety slammed back in: breath clipped, hands fidgety, stomach dropping, and this embarrassed jittery feeling. Of course my brain immediately labeled it a "parasympathetic rebound" instead of letting me just be shaky, so the moment felt half-lived and half-analyzed. Can we try another very brief guided one or a different anchor? I keep losing the thread and it's making me feel like I'm failing at something simple.

Therapist: Let's try a "5-4-3-2-1" anchor. As you inhale, notice five things you can see around you. When you exhale, notice four things you can touch. Then, notice three things you can hear. Next, notice two things you can smell. Finally, notice one thing you can taste. This anchor focuses on sensory experience, bypassing thought.

Patient: Okay—I did it, though my attention kept skittering. Five things I see: laptop screen, a mug, a poster on the wall, a stack of papers, a lamp. Four I can touch: the fabric of my jeans, the wood edge of the desk, the ring on my finger, the floor under my foot. Three I hear: distant traffic, the hum of an appliance, my breathing. Two I smell: stale coffee and soap. One I taste: a faint metallic aftertaste.

It helped a hair—there was a tiny drop in the chest tightness—but then my heart started racing again and my mind jumped to worst-case scenarios. I can theorize why grounding interrupts rumination, but in vivo I feel jittery and embarrassed that I keep losing the thread; can we try another very brief round or a different anchor to help my attention stick?

Therapist: Let's try a simple drawing. When you're ready, draw a small dot in the center of a piece of paper. Just one dot. Don't think about it, just put the pen to paper. When you're done, say to yourself: "I'm here."

Patient: I did it — I put a tiny dot in the center of the page. My hand kind of hovered before I made it, and saying "I'm here" felt clumsy and thin; there was a micro-drop in the chest tightness, then the anxiety ricocheted back—heart racing, stomach flipping, fingers fidgeting. Of course my mind immediately started analyzing the gesture's symbolism instead of just feeling it, which makes me embarrassed. Can we try another tiny variation — like slowly tracing a circle around the dot while I keep my hand on my chest — so I have a paced action to follow?

Therapist: Let's try slowly tracing a circle around the dot while keeping your hand on your chest. Focus on the sensation of the pen moving across the paper, rather than the thought of drawing a circle. Just move your hand, one slow stroke at a time, without thinking about the outcome. Say to yourself: "I'm here" as you breathe out.

Patient: I traced a slow circle with my hand on my chest and tried to feel the pen moving—there was a small unclenching, my shoulders dropped and the sternum eased a hair when I exhaled “I’m here.” Almost immediately my cognition intruded, cataloguing the motor pattern and narrativizing the gesture’s symbolism, so the micro-relief evaporated and my heart started racing again; I feel jitterier and more distracted now. I’m embarrassed and annoyed that I can’t just stay with it—can we do another slow round together or try something to keep my attention anchored longer?

Therapist: Let's try a "pause-and-look" together. As you finish tracing the circle, pause for a brief moment (just 2-3 seconds) and look at the dot on your paper. Just look at it, without thinking about it. Say to yourself: "I see the dot."

Patient: I paused for about two seconds, looked at the dot, and said out loud, "I see the dot." For that split-second my chest loosened and my shoulders dropped, but then my anxiety shot up—heart racing, hands fidgeting, attention skittering—and my brain immediately started translating the moment into analysis instead of letting it land. I feel embarrassed and shaky, like I'm failing at something simple, and that makes me want to speed up or explain rather than stay with it. Can we try it again more slowly, or with a counted pause, because I'm having trouble keeping my attention steady?

Therapist: Let's try a counted pause together. As you finish tracing the circle, pause for 5 seconds, counting to 5 slowly: "One... two... three... four... five." Just focus on counting, without thinking about the dot or anything else. When you reach 5, say to yourself: "I see the dot."

Patient: One... two... three... four... five — I said "I see the dot." For the first two counts there was a tiny unclench, like my chest softened, but then almost immediately my heart shot up, my breath got shallow, and my hands started to jitter. My mind flooded with explanations and worst-case thoughts about what this means and whether I'm doing it "right," which made me feel embarrassed and frustrated. I want to keep going but I'm getting overwhelmed and distracted — can you guide me more slowly through another timed pause, or give me something very concrete to anchor to so I don't lose it?

Therapist: Let's try a super-concrete anchor together. As you finish tracing the circle, look at the tip of your finger. Just look at the tip, without thinking about it. Say to yourself: "I see the tip of my finger." Focus on the tiny shape of the finger tip. Notice the color, the shape, the size. Just be with the finger tip for 5 seconds, counting to 5 slowly: "One... two... three... four... five."

Patient: I looked at the tip of my finger and counted one... two... three... four... five, then said, "I see the tip of my finger." There was a millisecond where my chest softened and my shoulders dropped, then anxiety slammed back—heart racing, breath shallow, hands fidgety, and my attention just skittered. Predictably, my brain immediately turned it into an analysis about proprioception and attentional gating instead of letting the sensation land, which makes me feel embarrassed and more jittery; can you cue the counts out loud for me next time so I have something external to follow?

Therapist: Let's try it again with the counts out loud. As you finish tracing the circle, I'll say "One" and you'll start counting. When you say "five", you'll pause and look at the tip of your finger. Just look at the tip, without thinking about it. Say to yourself: "I see the tip of my finger". I'll say the counts out loud: "One... two... three... four... FIVE!"

Patient: Hearing you count out loud actually helped at first—my attention landed on the numbers and my chest unclenched a little—but when you hit that loud "FIVE!" it startled me and my anxiety immediately spiked: heart racing, breath shallow, hands jittery, stomach dropping. I'm already tempted to label it clinically as a startle/hypervigilant rebound instead of just saying I'm scared and embarrassed that I couldn't hold it. Can we try that again more quietly and evenly, or maybe end on a softer tone so I don't get startled? I want to keep going but I'm jittery and need a gentler anchor.

Therapist: Let's try again with a softer tone. As you finish tracing the circle, I'll say "One... two... three... four... five" in a gentle voice, just barely above a whisper. When you reach the "five", you'll pause and look at the tip of your finger. Say to yourself: "I see the tip of my finger". I'll say the counts in a soft voice: "One... two... three... four... five".

Patient: Okay—your softer counts helped a little; the gentleness cut the startle reflex, but I'm still jittery and my attention keeps fragmenting into worst-case loops. My brain is already narrativizing it as a "startle/hypervigilant rebound," which is its way of avoiding admitting I'm shaky and embarrassed. Can we try three very slow, soft breaths together where you quietly say "one... two... three," and on each exhale I whisper "I'm here," and then stay with me for a beat after the third so I don't immediately get pulled into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try three slow, soft breaths together. As we breathe in, I'll say "one... two... three" softly. When we exhale, you'll whisper "I'm here" to yourself, just barely above a whisper. I'll stay with you for a beat after the third breath, without saying a word. Just breathe together, slowly, and stay with the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I did the three slow, soft breaths with you and whispered "I'm here" on each exhale. For the first two breaths there was a small unclenching in my chest and my shoulders eased, but after the third my heart shot up, my hands started fidgeting, and my mind ricocheted into worst‑case scenarios. I'm noticing an immediate urge to label it clinically — "parasympathetic rebound" — instead of just admitting that I'm scared and embarrassed and distracted. I want you to stay silent the extra beat like you said, but I'm also anxious that the silence will let my thoughts run; could you maybe hold a very low, steady tone for five seconds after the next round, or guide me to a concrete anchor (feet on the floor) while we breathe so I don't immediately get pulled into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try again with the same slow, soft breaths. As we breathe in, I'll say "one... two... three" softly. When we exhale, you'll whisper "I'm here" to yourself, just barely above a whisper. This time, I'll hold a very low, steady tone for five seconds after the third breath, just to give you a sense of calm before you're ready to breathe out again.

Patient: I did it — the low, steady tone after the third breath helped blunt the startle reflex and created a tiny holding space: my chest eased a fraction and my shoulders dropped for a beat. But almost immediately my attention fragmented—heart rate jumped, hands fidgeted, and my mind ricocheted into catastrophic loops; of course I mentally re-labeled it as a “parasympathetic rebound” instead of just admitting I'm shaky and embarrassed. I'm feeling more anxious and distracted right now and I want help staying with it instead of explaining it away—could we try one more round where you hold the tone for maybe ten seconds and I press my feet firmly into the floor the whole time, or where you softly count down a ten‑second exhale so I have an external rhythm to follow?

Therapist: Let's try again with the slow, soft breaths. As we breathe in, I'll say "one... two... three" softly. When we exhale, you'll whisper "I'm here" to yourself, just barely above a whisper. This time, I'll hold the low, steady tone for ten seconds after the third breath. Or, we could try a different approach: I'll softly count down a ten-second exhale, guiding you to breathe out slowly and deliberately. "Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one."

Patient: I think the ten‑second countdown would help — an external rhythm feels easier for me to follow when my attention's skittering. I'm pretty jumpy and distracted right now, so could you quietly count down "ten... nine..." and I'll press my feet into the floor and try to breathe out with you? My brain's already trying to turn this into an analysis, so I might need a very gentle, steady pace.

Therapist: Let's try it. I'll quietly count down "ten... nine..." while you press your feet firmly into the floor. Take a slow, deep breath in with me: "one...". Then exhale with me: "ten... nine...". Just focus on the sound of my voice and the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Patient: I'm pressing my feet into the floor like you said — I inhaled with you on "one" and exhaled on "ten... nine..." and there was a tiny loosening, then my heart spiked and my stomach fluttered. My brain's already narrativizing it as sympathetic activation/parasympathetic rebound instead of just admitting I'm jittery and embarrassed, which is the usual avoidance move. Can you keep counting the rest of the way down slowly while I keep my hand on my chest and my feet planted? A soft steady voice the whole time would help me not get pulled into analysis.

Therapist: I'll keep counting down slowly: "eight... seven... six...". Just focus on the sound of my voice and the sensation of your feet on the floor. Keep your hand on your chest, and try to breathe naturally. Don't try to control your thoughts, just be with the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I'm pressing my feet and keeping my hand on my chest. Your voice grounds me for a beat, but my attention's ricocheting: heart pounding, breath shallow, stomach flipping. I can already narrativize it as "sympathetic arousal with parasympathetic rebound," but honestly it just feels panicky and kind of embarrassing. Can you keep counting down slowly through five to one and then hold a soft, steady tone for about ten seconds so I have something to latch onto?
