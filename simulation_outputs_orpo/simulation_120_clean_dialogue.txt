Patient: I'm in my early sixties and work as an accountant. Lately I keep calling or talking to family and friends whenever that hollow, anxious feeling hits since the kids moved out — it's my go-to way to avoid actually sitting with it. How is talking here supposed to help? I've tried that with people and it doesn't work.

Therapist: When that hollow feeling hits, what's the one thing you're trying to fill or distract yourself from – is it the silence, the uncertainty, or something else?

Patient: I think it's more than just the quiet — it's like my place in the family has shrunk and I'm suddenly... unnecessary. Calling people gives me that quick hit of being needed or noticed, even if it's fake. Okay, but seriously, how talking about that here is supposed to help when it didn't with them?

Therapist: Can you think of a small moment, just a tiny one, where you noticed what it was like to feel "unnoticed" by your family while they were still living together? Maybe it was a tiny detail, like not being asked about your day – would that tiny moment be different if you sat with it, rather than trying to fill it with a phone call?

Patient: Yeah — last week after dinner I found myself stacking plates while everyone else was upstairs and nobody even asked how my day went. If I didn't grab the phone then, I think I'd just stand there feeling exposed and kind of panicky, like all the air's gone out of the room. I've told people about this and it didn't change anything, so how is sitting with that feeling here supposed to help?

Therapist: What's the one thing you'd do differently with that stack of plates if you didn't have the phone nearby?

Patient: I'd probably just leave the plates and sit down — maybe at the table or by the window — and try to breathe through the feeling instead of grabbing the phone. But honestly, when I've tried to "sit with it" before it turns into this spiral and I end up calling someone within ten minutes, so how is that supposed to help? I don't know, it's just hard to trust that doing nothing won't make it worse.

Therapist: What would it mean for you, in this moment, if you chose to leave the plates and sit with the feeling of being unnecessary, rather than reaching for the phone?

Patient: I guess it would mean admitting to myself that this shift actually matters — that I do feel smaller or less useful now — and that I can tolerate that discomfort without immediately patching it with someone else's voice. It might feel like facing the panic head-on instead of papering over it, which is terrifying because it could make me feel even more useless for a while. But I'm skeptical — how is sitting with that actually supposed to make the hollow go away instead of just making it louder?

Therapist: What if, in that moment of sitting with the feeling of being smaller, you didn't try to change it or make it go away – what if you just allowed it to be, without judgment?

Patient: I guess it would mean not scrambling to fix it and just noticing the hollow instead of covering it up—but when I've tried that it just snowballs and I end up calling someone. How am I actually supposed to "allow" it without spiraling? Tell me something practical to do in those first couple minutes when it hits.

Therapist: When that hollow feeling hits, what's one tiny physical action you can do with your body to create space for it – like taking a deep breath, rolling your shoulders, or noticing where your feet are on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I could try planting my feet flat, feeling the floor, and taking three slow, deliberate breaths while keeping my hands on my thighs to notice the contact. Maybe press my palms together for ten seconds to ground myself. But I've done breathing and grounding tricks before and they usually just stall the call for a few minutes — how is that supposed to stop the spiral for good?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the spiral, you focused on the sensation of the hands pressing together for ten seconds? What happens when you notice the pressure, the weight, the texture of your palms meeting – does that feel different from the rest of the feeling?

Patient: When I press my palms together I do notice the pressure and a little warmth, my breathing slows for a moment and the room doesn't feel as tight. It feels like a tiny gap in the panic — helpful for maybe twenty or thirty seconds — but then the urge to call comes back like clockwork. How is that short break supposed to keep me from dialing when the feeling hits again? What do I actually do in those twenty seconds that makes a difference?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the gap, instead of trying to hold onto it or push the urge away, you simply acknowledge it – "Ah, the urge to call is coming back" – without judgment or resistance?

Patient: I could try that — quietly note to myself, "Ah, the urge to call is coming back," and not judge it. It still feels like pushing a heavy blanket off for a moment; it eases for a few breaths and then the pull to dial returns. How is just naming it supposed to stop me from picking up the phone when that pull's so loud?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the urge to call, instead of focusing on "not picking up the phone," you ask yourself: "What's the value of calling this time – would it actually make me feel better, or just temporarily distract from the underlying feeling?"

Patient: I can try asking that, but my knee‑jerk answer is always, "It'll make me feel better for a bit," and that's usually enough to pick up the phone. Maybe naming it as "just a distraction" could help, but I don't have the energy to keep arguing with the urge — it just feels louder. How is that actually supposed to change what I end up doing in the moment?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the urge to call, you didn't try to argue with it or label it as "just a distraction" – but instead, you simply paused to notice the physical sensation of your body leaning toward the phone?

Patient: I suppose I could try noticing the little lean — the weight shift, my fingers twitching toward the phone — and just sit with that sensation for a moment. Maybe it makes it feel less automatic, like there's a tiny gap. But usually that gap is only a breath or two before the urge wins, and I don't see how noticing it actually changes the outcome. What do I do in that pause that actually stops me from dialing?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the physical sensation of leaning toward the phone, you didn't try to resist it or push back – but instead, you simply noticed the sensation itself, without judgment or action, for just one tiny beat?

Patient: I could try that — just notice the little lean for one quick beat and not move. It might make the urge feel less automatic, but it feels so tiny and never actually stops me from calling—how is that supposed to keep me from dialing right after?

Therapist: What if, after noticing the tiny lean for just one beat, you didn't try to change anything – no effort to resist, no pushback – but instead, you simply turned your attention to your breath, without judgment or distraction, for just one more beat?

Patient: Okay — I can try that: notice the lean one beat, then the breath one beat. When I do it, there's a tiny loosening, like a window cracked open for a second, but it always feels fleeting and then the pull to call comes back. If that one beat only helps for a moment, what do I actually do next when the urge returns? I don't have the energy to keep doing little pauses if they don't change what I end up doing.

Therapist: What if, when the urge to call returns, you didn't try to add another pause or another technique – but instead, you simply acknowledged the return of the urge with kindness, without judgment, and said to yourself: "That's what's next. I'll get to it when I'm ready."

Patient: I could try that — tell myself “that’s next, I’ll get to it when I’m ready.” It sounds kinder than fighting, but honestly it feels like permission to postpone the feeling, and then I just call anyway. How is that actually supposed to help me when the gentleness just turns into an excuse to avoid the panic?

Therapist: What if, instead of using kindness to acknowledge the return of the urge, you simply noticed the sensation of the urge as it returned, without judgment or attachment – not to the thought, not to the feeling, but simply to the sensation itself?

Patient: I can do that — when it comes back I notice a hollow in my chest, a tight throat, my fingers start to twitch toward the phone; it's kind of a dull, nagging buzz. Noticing it does quiet things for a breath or two, but then the pull's right back. How does simply sensing that actually change what I do next? What practical step follows the noticing, because noticing alone hasn't stopped me.

Therapist: What if, when you notice the sensation of your fingers twitching toward the phone, you didn't try to push against it or resist it – but instead, you simply noticed the physical sensation of your hand moving toward the phone, without judgment or effort, and instead of letting it happen, you made a tiny, tiny movement of your hand back to the table or your lap, so that your hand isn't in motion?

Patient: I can try that—pull my hand back to my lap so it isn't moving. It gives a tiny break and my breathing eases a bit, but my chest still tightens and my head's already saying "call," so it feels like a brief stall rather than a solution. What do I actually do in that next beat that stops me from just dialing anyway?

Therapist: What if, when your chest tightens and your head starts to push back, instead of trying to control the thoughts or push against the physical sensations, you simply looked up at the clock – not to see the time, but to acknowledge the fact that you're sitting there, not moving, with your hand back in your lap – and said to yourself: "I've been sitting here for a few seconds."

Patient: I can try that — look up, notice I’ve been sitting here for a few seconds. It loosens things for a breath, then the chest tightens and the head says “call” and that’s usually it; how does saying that actually change what I do next?

Therapist: What if, when you say "I've been sitting here for a few seconds," instead of just acknowledging the time, you looked at the sensation in your hand – the one that was pulled toward the phone – and asked yourself: "What would it be like to let this sensation be, without trying to push it or pull it away?"

Patient: I could try letting the tightness sit there—notice the hollow, the pull in my fingers—without doing anything. It feels heavy and flat, like I can watch it for a breath or two, then the noise in my head starts up again. I want to try this, but seriously—what comes after that one beat so it doesn't just become another delay before I dial? I don't have the energy for things that only stall it.

Therapist: What if, when you let the tightness sit without doing anything, you didn't wait for the head's noise to come back – but instead, you simply noticed the sensation of your body being heavy and flat, and you asked yourself: "What would it be like to be present with this heaviness, without trying to move or change it?"

Patient: It's like being stuck in wet cement — heavy, dull, and everything slows down. I can notice it for a breath or two, and it softens a tiny bit, but then the chest tightens and my head's already pushing "call" again. How does simply being with that actually get me to the next step instead of just postponing the call — what do I do after that one beat, because I don't have the energy for stuff that only stalls it?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the chest tightening and the head's noise coming back, instead of trying to push against it, you simply said to yourself: "That's what I'm doing – I'm moving my body to make space for the phone."

Patient: I guess I could say to myself, “that’s what I’m doing — I’m moving my body to make space for the phone.” It sometimes snaps me out of the automatic move for a breath, but more often it just feels like I’ve admitted the avoidance and the urge still wins. How is naming that supposed to stop the next step — what do I actually do after I say it?

Therapist: What if, after saying "That's what I'm doing – I'm moving my body to make space for the phone," you actually took a tiny, tiny action – not to the phone, but to the sensation in your body – by slowly, deliberately taking a deep breath in through your nose, and holding it for just one second, without thinking about the phone?

Patient: I try that — breathe in, hold for a second — and there's this tiny loosened spot, then my chest tightens again and my head's already saying "call." How does that one-second hold actually turn into not dialing — what do I do in the next beat so it doesn't just slip back into the same thing?

Therapist: What if, when you feel the chest tighten again, instead of trying to push against it, you simply noticed the sensation of your fingers touching the table – the sensation of your skin on the wood, the feeling of your weight distributed on your hand?

Patient: I can feel the wood under my fingers — the grain, a little warmth — and it eases for a breath or two. But then my mind's already whispering "call," and I don't see how noticing the table actually changes that next move. What do I do in that one beat that actually stops me from picking up the phone?

Therapist: What if, when you feel the mind's whispering "call", instead of trying to push against it or notice it, you simply made a tiny, tiny decision – not about the phone, but about what you're going to do with your body – by letting your hand rest on the table, with your fingers curled around the wood, and your wrist relaxed?

Patient: Alright — I can let my hand rest on the table, fingers curled, wrist relaxed. It eases things for a breath, but then the voice still says "call" and I end up reaching anyway. So what do I actually do in that next beat to stop myself — I don't have the energy for stuff that only stalls it.

Therapist: What if, when you feel the voice saying "call", instead of trying to resist or notice it, you simply looked up at your own face – not to see the expression, but to notice the fact that you're looking at yourself?

Patient: I can try that—look up and notice I'm looking at myself. It gives a tiny bit of distance, like a flicker of "hang on" for a second, but the voice still wins. How is that supposed to lead to anything different—what comes after that flicker that actually stops me, because I don't have the energy for tricks that only delay it?

Therapist: What if, when you notice looking at yourself, instead of trying to do anything else, you simply noticed what your mouth is doing right now – the movement of your lips, the position of your tongue, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Noticing my mouth does pull me out for a beat — I feel the lips, the tongue, the breath — and it loosens the tightness for a second. But it's always a second; my head's already pushing "call" again, and I don't have the energy for little tricks that just delay it. What actually follows that noticing that makes a real difference instead of buying me thirty seconds?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the mouth moving, you didn't try to change it – you simply acknowledged the movement, and then you noticed the sensation of your body sitting in the chair, with your feet on the floor, and your weight distributed evenly?

Patient: I can try that — notice my mouth, then feel my body in the chair, feet on the floor, weight settled. It loosens things for a breath, but then the restlessness creeps back and my chest tightens and my thoughts scatter; I'm already feeling jumpy. How is that supposed to stop me from picking up the phone after that one beat?
