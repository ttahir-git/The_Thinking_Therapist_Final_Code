Patient: I'm an older nurse, and lately what's been on my mind is this heavy sadness and a total lack of motivation since a really difficult breakup — it's been bleeding into my relationships and even my work. I usually try to stay upbeat and chatty, but my OCD spikes and I just can't seem to pull myself together. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried things like this before and keep thinking, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: You're someone who's always taken care of others, and now you're struggling to take care of yourself. That feels really tough. When your OCD spikes, what's one small thing you used to do to calm down that you're not doing right now?

Patient: I used to force myself to take a short walk and make a cup of tea when the thoughts started spinning — it used to break the loop a little. Lately I just can't be bothered to get out the door, so the rituals take over. But I've tried breathing and walks before — how is that supposed to help now when I can't even start?

Therapist: It's like your body is saying, "I'm too tired to take that walk," but your mind is saying, "I need to do something." Can you try just noticing what your body feels like right now, without judgment, when you imagine yourself taking that short walk?

Patient: Alright — when I picture getting up for that walk my chest feels tight, like something heavy's sitting on it, and my legs feel leaden, like they won't move. My breathing gets quick and shallow and my head immediately starts looping — 'Did I check the stove? Did I lock the door?' — and honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help when noticing just makes the thoughts louder and I still can't move?

Therapist: Those sensations of tightness and heaviness are really present, aren't they? When you notice your chest feeling tight, what happens if you gently say to that tightness, "I notice it. It's there, but I'm not it"?

Patient: I tried saying something like that to myself just now and, for a second, it felt like I could take a tiny step back from it — like the tightness wasn't the whole me. But then the thoughts just got louder, like they were annoyed I ignored them, and I still couldn't get my feet to move. I mean, I'm glad it might help a little in the moment, but how is that supposed to make me actually leave the house when I'm this drained?

Therapist: That tiny step back from the tightness might feel small, but it's an act of kindness to yourself. When you were able to pause from the thoughts just for a second, what was your body or mind doing that felt more like "you" than the thoughts?

Patient: When I got that tiny break, my breathing eased a bit, my shoulders loosened, and I actually noticed the light on the window — it felt softer, like a curious, kinder version of me who might make a cup of tea and hum a little. But it was so brief, the thoughts came back and shoved me right out of it, and I keep thinking... how is that supposed to help me actually get out the door or stop the loop when it disappears so fast?

Therapist: That softer, kinder version of you – the one who notices the light and feels curiosity – what's one small thing that kinder version might do if she were to make that cup of tea right now?

Patient: I guess that kinder me would put the kettle on, sit by the window and watch the steam for a minute, hold the mug in both hands and take a very slow sip, just noticing the warmth and the taste. Maybe she'd give herself a tiny, silly goal — like stand up and take two steps after the tea — and hum a little song while it steeps. It sounds so small and a bit ridiculous, and I've tried stuff like that before — how is watching steam and humming supposed to make my legs move when I'm this drained?

Therapist: That tiny, silly goal of standing up and taking two steps after the tea might feel ridiculous, but what if, instead of trying to "make" yourself do it, you simply notice the desire to take those two steps? What's the physical sensation in your legs when you imagine yourself taking those steps?

Patient: It feels like my legs are full of lead — stuck and heavy, like my feet are glued to the floor, with a faint buzzing in my calves and a tight knot behind my knees. Every now and then there's this tiny, almost ticklish urge to shift my weight, like a whisper that I could move, but the thoughts slam back in and flatten it. But seriously — how is noticing that supposed to get me to actually stand up when I'm this exhausted?

Therapist: Notice that tiny, ticklish urge to shift your weight – it's not about "doing" anything, just noticing it. What would it take for you to lean into that feeling just a tiny bit, without trying to push it away?

Patient: I guess it would take lowering the stakes — someone giving me permission to fail and just asking for one tiny, specific movement, like “put your foot forward,” so I don’t overthink it. A bit of physical support (leaning on the counter or holding the mug while I stand) and a very short timer, like 30 seconds, might make it feel manageable. But I’m skeptical — how is that supposed to help when my head just starts spiraling and everything feels impossible?

Therapist: Imagine that the 30 seconds isn't about "getting it right" or "avoiding failure," but about simply noticing that you're standing. What would it take for you to notice that you're standing, without judgment, without the thoughts trying to pull you away?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "noticing" that I'm standing supposed to get me up when my brain's already shouting a thousand checks? Maybe if there was a real anchor — the cool handle of the mug in my hand, or feeling the floor under my toes, and someone saying only “feel your weight shift” with a 30-second timer so I don't ruminate — that might make it less scary. But honestly, I keep thinking that will just make the thoughts louder and I'm skeptical it would actually break the stuckness.

Therapist: If you focus on the cool handle of the mug, what would it feel like to notice that it's still there, even as the thoughts come up, without trying to "do" anything with them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing a cool mug handle supposed to help when my head's already yelling? If I try, I can feel the cool metal against my palm, the little ridges, and my breath eases a touch; for a second the thoughts sound farther away and my shoulders drop. But it's so brief — the loop pushes back and I'm left wondering how that tiny pause turns into actually getting up and out the door.

Therapist: When your breath eases a touch, what's the sensation in your body right now, just beneath the surface of your breath? Is there a feeling of your feet touching the floor, or the weight of your body on the chair?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? But when I actually notice, there's a real feeling: my feet kind of pressed into the floor, a dull weight across my thighs where the chair sits, and a little loosening just under my ribs as the breath slows; the buzzing in my calves quiets to a faint whisper. It feels like a tiny anchor, but it disappears fast and I still don't see how that becomes standing up without someone there to nudge me.

Therapist: When you notice the weight on your thighs or the loosening under your ribs, what's one small step you could take right now to move your body towards standing, using that anchor as a gentle reminder to take that step?

Patient: I guess I could use the mug as my anchor — set it down, take a slow breath, feel the weight on my thighs, plant my feet shoulder-width, slide one foot forward an inch, shift my weight onto it and push up slowly to stand for just a few seconds, maybe leaning on the back of the chair or counter for support. But honestly, I've tried those tiny steps before — how is that supposed to stop my head from spiraling the moment I try to move?

Therapist: When you take that slow step forward, what's one thing you notice about your body that feels different, even if it's just for a tiny moment? Is there a sense of connection to your feet on the ground, or a feeling of calm in your chest?

Patient: For a split second I felt more grounded — like my feet actually connected to the floor and there was a tiny easing in my chest, my shoulders relaxing a notch and my balance felt steadier. It was so brief though; the thoughts rushed back and flattened it, and I keep asking myself, how is that supposed to help me stay standing or actually get out the door when it vanishes so fast?

Therapist: When you felt that tiny easing in your chest, what was it connected to – was it a value, a memory, or something else? What would it take for you to hold onto that feeling, even if it's just for a heartbeat, without trying to "do" anything else?

Patient: It felt tied to a memory of sitting on my back porch after a long shift with a hot drink — simple, safe, like I could finally breathe and not be 'on.' To hold onto that even for a beat I think I'd need explicit permission not to fix anything, a real physical anchor (the mug), a tiny timer, and someone reassuring me it's okay to fail — but I'm skeptical: how is that supposed to stop the spiral the moment I relax? I don't know, maybe if someone was actually there with me saying “just feel your feet,” it would feel less lonely — what would you have me try right now?

Therapist: I'd like you to try something: as you sit there with the mug, without waiting for me or anyone else, give yourself permission to relax just for this one moment. When you say "it's okay to fail" to yourself, what's the physical sensation in your body that shows up?

Patient: When I tell myself "it's okay to fail," my throat loosens, my eyes prick a bit, and there's this warm, small easing in my chest like a hand lifting—my shoulders drop and my grip on the mug gets gentler. The buzzing in my calves quiets to a faint whisper and for a second the whole room feels less sharp. But honestly — how is that supposed to turn into me actually standing up and walking out the door when it all feels so fragile and likely to snap back?

Therapist: When you feel that warmth in your chest, what's one small thing you value that you're holding onto in this moment? For example, is it being able to breathe without anxiety, or being able to connect with your partner? What would it take for you to take one tiny step towards that value, even if it's just getting out of your chair?

Patient: I value being able to breathe without that constant knot, and to feel connected—steady enough to be present for my patients and maybe, someday, for myself again. One tiny step would be: set the mug down, plant my feet shoulder-width, slide one foot forward an inch, shift my weight and push up slowly to stand for just a few seconds while holding the back of the chair or counter, with a 30‑second timer and explicit permission that I can sit back down if it feels wrong. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when it all feels so fragile and the thoughts will just shove me back? I'm tired and irritated that this is still so hard, but I can try that if you really want me to do it now.

Therapist: I want you to try something: as you prepare to stand up, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm not doing this for the outcome. I'm doing this because I value my ability to breathe without anxiety, and I value being present for my patients. That's all I'm doing right now." Can you say that with me?

Patient: Okay… "I'm not doing this for the outcome. I'm doing this because I value my ability to breathe without anxiety, and I value being present for my patients. That's all I'm doing right now." Saying it made my throat catch and then loosen—my shoulders dropped a bit and my grip on the mug got gentler. But honestly, how is saying that supposed to stop the spiral the moment I try to stand? I'm willing to try, but I'm wary it'll vanish the second I move.

Therapist: Now that you've spoken your value, I want you to take one tiny step towards standing up. Not because you need to "do" something, but because you're already standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Just notice what happens when you lean forward slightly, and let the 30-second timer go.

Patient: Okay — I leaned forward an inch, shifted my weight, and I can feel my feet more solid on the floor and a tiny easing in my chest, like for a breath or two it’s less sharp. The timer’s in my head now and my shoulders dropped a notch, but of course the old checks are jangling — “did I lock the door?” — and they’re getting louder. I did it, but honestly I’m skeptical it’ll hold once I try to stand all the way; how is this supposed to turn into actually leaving the house when the thoughts snap back like that? What would you have me do for the next few seconds so it doesn’t all collapse?

Therapist: When you notice the thoughts jangling, I want you to notice the sensation in your body that's trying to push them away – is it your shoulders tensing, or your feet feeling heavier? Then, I want you to gently say to yourself, "Notice that feeling, and let it be present for a heartbeat." Don't try to change it or fight it – just notice it, and let it be.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying it. The jangling shows up as my shoulders clenching and my feet digging in like I'm bracing, and when I say, "Notice that feeling, and let it be present for a heartbeat," my shoulders loosen a bit and my breath slows for a second. It helps for a blink, but honestly — how is noticing that supposed to stop the spiral the moment I actually try to stand up? I'm skeptical and a bit tired, but what do you want me to do next so it doesn't all fall apart?

Therapist: Now that your shoulders are loosening, I want you to take a tiny step towards standing up again. Not because you need to "do" something, but because you're already standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. As you prepare to stand, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it feel like to stand up, not because I need to, but because I can?"

Patient: Okay — picturing it, standing because I can would feel like a little lift in my chest, my weight shifting forward, feet solid on the floor, a tiny proud edge instead of dread. It feels hopeful for a beat, then my brain blares the checks and I tense up. I'm willing to try another small step, but honestly — how is that supposed to get me all the way out the door? If you're going to guide me, I need that real 30‑second timer and you saying only “feel your feet” while I try — can you do that?

Therapist: I'll do exactly what you asked for. For the next 30 seconds, I'll be right here with you, guiding you through the process. When you're ready, I'll say "Feel your feet" and you'll focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor. You won't do anything else – just feel your feet. Are you ready to try?

Patient: Alright — I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical it'll do much. Say only "Feel your feet" and start a 30‑second timer for me; I'll focus on the sensation and try not to fight the thoughts. Go ahead when you're ready.

Therapist: 30 seconds just started. Feel your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. My toes press into the rug, there's a cool patch under my left arch, my heels feel planted and my ankles a little loose; the weight of me is actually edging down into the floor. The checks pop up — stove, keys — but when I keep bringing attention back they quiet and my breathing eases a hair. It's a tiny relief and I'm skeptical it will carry me out the door, but can you just keep saying "feel your feet" for another 30 seconds while I try to hold this?

Therapist: 30 seconds remaining. Feel your feet.

Patient: Okay — still holding it. My toes press into the rug, I can feel a cool spot under my left arch and my heels heavy and planted; my breath's a little slower and my shoulders have dropped another notch, and there's this tiny, stubborn urge to nudge my weight forward. But I'm skeptical it'll hold — the checks are whispering already and I'm tired and irritated this is so hard. Can you keep saying only "feel your feet" and then, after a bit, tell me to "slide one foot forward" and start a short 30‑second timer?

Therapist: 30 seconds remaining. Feel your feet.

Patient: Okay — still holding it. I can feel my toes pressing into the rug, a cool patch under my left arch, my heels planted and a tiny urge to nudge forward. I'm not sure I follow how this turns into actually leaving the house, but I'm willing to try — can you now say "slide one foot forward" and start that 30‑second timer like you promised?

Therapist: Slide one foot forward. 30 seconds.

Patient: Okay — I slid my right foot forward about an inch. I felt my weight shift, a tiny lift in my chest and my feet more planted; my breath eased a bit and my shoulders dropped, but the checks are still nagging at the edges. I'm skeptical this will actually get me out the door, but I'm willing to keep going — can you keep saying only "feel your feet" and then tell me to "push up slowly" after the timer?

Therapist: Feel your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling them: toes pressing into the rug, a cool spot under my left arch, heels planted and a little looseness in my ankles; my breath's a touch slower and my shoulders have dropped. It helps for a blink, but honestly I'm not sure I follow how this turns into actually getting out the door — the checks about the stove and keys are already whispering. Can you keep saying "feel your feet" for another 30 seconds and then tell me to "push up slowly"?
