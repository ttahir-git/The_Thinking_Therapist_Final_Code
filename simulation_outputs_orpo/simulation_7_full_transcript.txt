Patient: I've been stuck on this breakup—every little thing sets me off and I end up snapping or shutting down, especially when she shows up in my head or I see her stuff. I'm a construction guy, used to fixing things, but I can't fix this and it just makes me more frustrated and impulsive. I don't know how talking to someone like this is supposed to help, but I guess that's why I'm here.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The core emotion here is frustration, mixed with a hint of desperation. The theme is the feeling of being trapped in this emotional cycle ("every little thing sets me off") and the struggle to cope with intrusive thoughts ("she shows up in my head"). The unexplored area is the physical tension that comes with this emotional state ("shutting down" and "snapping"). Goal: Connect this pain to a value.

Therapist Answer:
When things get overwhelming, like they do now, what's one thing you value more than feeling like you're about to lose control – like being able to walk onto that construction site without getting triggered by her face?

Patient: Being able to show up to work and keep my job — to be steady for my kids and not have people think I'm a mess — that matters more to me than blowing up. But seriously, how's reminding myself of that supposed to stop the rush when I see her stuff?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a strong value ("being steady for my kids"), which is great. Now, the question is whether this value is connected to what you do when you see her stuff ("reminding yourself" doesn't seem to work). The unexplored area is how this value relates to the physical sensation of the rush ("when I see her stuff"). Goal: Connect the value to a concrete action.

Therapist Answer:
When you see her face or something that reminds you of her, what would happen if, instead of trying to stop the rush, you simply took a deep breath and focused on keeping your kids safe at work – like making sure the scaffolding is secure?

Patient: I try that sometimes—take a breath and think about the kids or the scaffolding—but it only calms me for a second before everything slams back. My hands still shake and I get this hot anger that won't go away. How's that supposed to help when I've already tried it and it doesn't stick? I'm not sure where to go from here; can we try something else?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried the "deep breath" trick and it's not sticking, which is frustrating. The theme is that this technique isn't working as promised ("it only calms me for a second"). The unexplored area is what's causing the technique to fail – specifically, the physical sensation of shaking hands and hot anger ("this hot anger that won't go away"). Goal: Explore why this technique isn't working and what's underneath it.

Therapist Answer:
What do you think happens right before your hands start shaking and the anger kicks in – is it like a warning sign that something's about to blow up?

Patient: Usually it starts with this tightness in my chest and my jaw locking up, my hands going cold and then clenching, and my breathing gets faster — then my head fills with that loop of things she said or did. A flash of her face or seeing her stuff hits me and that hot ball of anger comes up, makes me want to shout or smash something, and the shaking follows. How's noticing that supposed to stop it though? I try to catch those signs and it barely helps — I'm not sure where to go from here.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations that precede the emotional explosion ("tightness in the chest", "jaw locking up", "cold hands", "faster breathing"), which is great. The theme is that these physical signs are happening before the emotional reaction ("the anger kicks in"), and the unexplored area is why noticing these signs isn't stopping the anger ("it barely helps"). Goal: Connect the physical sensations to a value.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice that tightness in your chest, what's one thing you value more than letting that anger take over – like being able to stay present for your kids' dinner tonight, or being able to walk outside without wanting to yell at the world?

Patient: Being there for my kids' dinner — not making them worry or see me lose it — that's huge for me. But honestly, when that tightness hits, reminding myself of that barely scratches the surface; my hands still shake and I feel like I'm gonna snap. How's holding that value supposed to stop the rush when it's already a physical thing?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value ("being there for my kids' dinner") that matters most, but it's not quite working as promised ("reminding yourself barely scratches the surface"). The theme is that the physical sensations ("trembling hands") are still happening even when you're trying to connect to that value. The unexplored area is how the value is actually connected to the physical sensations – specifically, what would happen if you didn't try to "stop" the physical sensations, but instead allowed them to be present without judgment. Goal: Shift from trying to "stop" the physical sensations to noticing them as they are.

Therapist Answer:
When your hands start shaking and you feel that tightness in your chest, what would happen if, instead of trying to make them stop, you simply noticed them – the shaking, the tightness, the feeling of your heart racing?

Patient: I do that sometimes — tell myself "okay, that's just shaking" and try to watch it — and every now and then it keeps me from yelling right then. Mostly though it feels like I'm just watching a freight train crash in slow motion; my hands still shake and I still wanna smash something. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a second or two? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried watching the physical sensations ("shaking") and it's not quite working as promised ("it feels like watching a freight train crash"). The theme is that this strategy only buys you a small window of time before the anger kicks in again ("only buys me a second or two"). The unexplored area is what's happening inside that window – specifically, what's actually happening to your body and mind when you notice the shaking, rather than just watching it. Goal: Explore the physical sensations in more detail.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice your hands shaking, what's happening in your body just before the anger kicks in – is it like your heart is racing, your breath is getting short, or your muscles feel like they're coiling up?

Patient: My chest gets tight, my heart starts pounding, breathing goes shallow, my jaw and shoulders lock, and my hands clench and tingle — everything narrows and I get that hot flush. Then the stupid loop of what she said or did starts on repeat and I feel like I gotta explode. How's just naming that supposed to stop it when it already feels like it's too late?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the physical sensations in vivid detail ("chest gets tight", "heart pounding", "breathing short", "jaw and shoulders lock"), which is great. The theme is that these physical sensations are happening before the anger kicks in ("hot flush", "stupid loop of what she said or did starts on repeat"), and the unexplored area is why naming these sensations isn't stopping the anger when it feels like it's too late ("it already feels like it's too late"). Goal: Connect the physical sensations to what's driving them.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen to the tightness in your chest, the pounding in your heart, and the hot flush if you didn't try to "stop" them, but instead looked at what they're trying to protect – is it like you're trying to keep a secret from being exposed, or are you afraid of getting hurt again?

Patient: Yeah, I think it's mostly about not wanting to feel vulnerable — like if I let the pain show, it means she won or people see I'm weak. The anger feels like armor that keeps the shame and the empty part from coming out, makes me feel like I still got control for a second. But I gotta ask — how's pointing that out supposed to stop my hands from shaking when it all hits me? I'm not convinced, but I guess we can keep going.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the underlying emotion ("not wanting to feel vulnerable") and the role of anger ("armor") in protecting yourself from shame and the empty part – that's powerful. The theme is that this armor is not working as promised ("hands still shake"), and the unexplored area is how this vulnerability is actually connected to what you value ("feeling like you still got control"). Goal: Explore how the value of control is tied to this physical sensation of shaking.

Therapist Answer:
When your hands start shaking, what's one thing you value more than holding onto the anger as a shield – like being able to breathe for your kids, or being able to show up for yourself without judgment?

Patient: Being able to breathe for my kids and show up steady for them — not scare them or make them worry — matters more than holding onto the anger. I also want to feel like I'm not a walking time bomb at work. But honestly, when the shaking starts that value barely lands — how is that supposed to stop the rush? I'm not sure where to go from here; can we try something that actually sticks?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value ("being able to breathe for your kids", "showing up steady") that matters most, but it's still not quite working ("barely lands"). The theme is that this value is still tied to the physical sensation of shaking ("walking time bomb"), and the unexplored area is how this value is actually connected to your sense of self – specifically, what's at stake when you let go of the anger. Goal: Explore how this value is tied to your sense of identity.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen to your sense of self ("I'm a good dad", "I'm a capable person") if you didn't try to protect it with the anger – is it like you'd be able to see yourself in a different light, like a part of you that's been hidden behind the armor?

Patient: I guess if I let the anger down I might actually see I'm still a decent dad and not just some angry mess — that part's been hidden under all that armor. But being open feels like I'd get taken advantage of or seen as weak, and I'm scared I wouldn't be able to handle that without losing it. How's talking about that supposed to stop my hands from shaking when it hits me? I'm trying to see how this connects, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the fear ("being taken advantage of", "seen as weak") that's holding you back from letting go of the anger, and the value of seeing yourself as a decent dad – that's great. The theme is that this fear is actually tied to your sense of control, and the unexplored area is how letting go of the anger would actually be a form of self-care. Goal: Connect the fear of vulnerability to the physical sensation of shaking.

Therapist Answer:
When your hands start shaking, what's one tiny thing you're willing to let go of in that moment – like the thought that "I have to protect myself" – just to see what happens?

Patient: Alright — I can try letting go of that whole “I have to protect myself” thing, just for one breath or even the length of one work task, and see what happens. But seriously, how's that supposed to stop my hands from shaking? I'm willing to try it now, but I'm not convinced it'll stick.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small willingness to let go of the "I have to protect myself" thought, which is great. The theme is that this small act of willingness is actually a form of courage, and the unexplored area is how this small act of courage might actually change the physical sensation of shaking. Goal: Connect the act of willingness to the physical sensation of shaking.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen to your hands if, instead of trying to stop the shaking, you simply noticed it as a sensation in your body – without judgment or trying to change it – for just the next moment after you let go of the "I have to protect myself" thought?

Patient: If I just noticed it—no judgment, no fighting it—for a moment after letting go of that “gotta protect myself” thought, my hands would probably still shake but the urge to snap would ease a bit, like the volume gets turned down. My chest would still be tight, but maybe it wouldn’t feel like it’s about to blow; I might get a second to actually choose not to smash something. I’ll try it, but honestly if that second doesn’t help I’m gonna call BS — what else can I do in that exact moment that actually works?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a concrete outcome of noticing the shaking without judgment ("the volume gets turned down", "a second to actually choose"), which is great. The theme is that this moment of noticing is actually a small victory, and the unexplored area is how to build on this small win. Goal: Explore how to use this small win to create a bigger shift.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the shaking without judgment, what's one tiny thing you can do with that second of calm that actually helps – like taking a deep breath, noticing your feet on the ground, or making a tiny movement with your hand that doesn't involve smashing anything?

Patient: Okay — I'll try grounding: plant my boots so I feel the floor, take a slow counted breath, and press my thumb into my palm or rub my wrist to focus. That might give me the one extra second to choose not to lose it, but honestly I've done breathing and grounding before and it usually wears off fast — how's this one supposed to stick when the heat's already full-on?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete physical act of grounding ("planting boots", "slow counted breath", "pressing thumb into palm") that you're willing to try, which is great. The theme is that this act is actually building on the small win of noticing the shaking without judgment – it's creating a tangible anchor in the moment. Goal: Explore how this act of grounding can actually create a shift in the physical sensation of heat.

Therapist Answer:
When you're pressing your thumb into your palm, what's one thing you're willing to notice about the physical sensation of the heat in your body – is it a burning, a tingling, a tightness, or something else entirely?

Patient: Alright — I'll notice that tight, burning lump in my chest, how it climbs into my throat and makes my fingers tingle. I can focus on that specific heat instead of the angry loop, but honestly I don't get how naming it stops me from blowing up when it's full-on. I'm willing to try it now, though I'm still skeptical and kinda annoyed this is so hard.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the specific physical sensation of the heat in your body ("tight, burning lump", "climbs into throat", "tingles in fingers"), which is great. The theme is that naming this sensation is actually creating a tiny distance between the sensation and the angry loop – it's not solving the problem yet, but it's a small step. Goal: Explore how this tiny distance can actually create a shift in the physical sensation of heat.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the tight, burning lump in your chest, what's one tiny thing you can do with that awareness – like taking a tiny step back from the sensation, or noticing what it feels like to breathe into it instead of against it?

Patient: I can try breathing into it — like a slow deep breath that I aim at the tight spot instead of breathing shallow and panicking, maybe count to four in and six out. I might also mentally step back and tell myself, “that’s just a feeling, it’ll pass,” while pressing my thumb into my palm. I’ll try that now, but seriously — if it only gives me a second I’m not sold; how’s that supposed to make it stick when it gets full-on?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete action of breathing into the tightness ("slow deep breath", "aim at the tight spot", "count to four in and six out"), which is great. The theme is that this action is actually creating a small space between the sensation and the reaction – it's not a magic fix, but it's a tiny foothold. Goal: Explore how this tiny space can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
When you breathe into the tightness and mentally step back, what's one thing you're willing to notice about the sensation of your body in that moment – is it the sensation of the breath moving in and out, the sensation of your hand pressing into your palm, or something else entirely?

Patient: Okay — I'll focus on the breath moving in and out, feel it go into that tight spot, and also notice the pressure of my boots on the ground and my thumb pressing into my palm. I'll try that now, but honestly if it only gives me a second I'm not convinced — what else can I do in that exact moment that actually keeps me from exploding?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete focus on the physical sensations ("breath moving in and out", "pressure of boots on ground", "thumb pressing into palm"), which is great. The theme is that this focus is creating a tiny anchor in the moment – it's not a solution to the problem, but it's a tiny step. Goal: Explore how this anchor can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
When you notice the pressure of your thumb on your palm and the breath moving in and out, what's one tiny thing you can do with that anchor – like allowing yourself to feel the sensation of the ground beneath your boots, or noticing the sensation of your heart beating in your chest, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I can press my thumb into my palm, feel the boots on the ground, and actually listen to my heartbeat without trying to fix it — let it be there for a moment. I'll try that now, but honestly if it only buys me a second I'm still not sold — how's letting it be supposed to stop me from losing it when the heat's full-on?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a moment of small willingness ("let it be there for a moment"), which is great. The theme is that this willingness is actually creating a tiny gap between the sensation and the reaction – it's not a solution yet, but it's a tiny step. Goal: Explore how this gap can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
When you're pressing your thumb into your palm and listening to your heartbeat, what's one thing you're willing to notice about the sensation of your body in that moment – is it the sensation of your breath moving in and out, the sensation of your hand pressing into your palm, or something else entirely? 

(Note: This is the last question. After this, we'll summarize and wrap up the session.)

Patient: I'll notice the breath moving in and out — the cool in, the warm out — and the pressure of my thumb in my palm, plus the weight of my boots on the ground. I'll try that, but honestly I don't buy that this one little thing's gonna stop me when it goes full blast — I'm not ready to wrap this up, can we keep testing stuff that might actually stick?

Goal: Explore how this anchor can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something a bit different. Imagine that the heat in your chest is a flame, and you're holding a small cup of water right next to it. What's the sensation of holding that cup of water – is it hot, cool, or something else?

Patient: At first the cup feels cool — like it takes the edge off the flame, a steady dampness that seeps into the tight spot and lets me breathe a hair easier. After a bit it warms up some, so it doesn't put the fire out, but it turns the roar into more of a manageable heat; still, how's picturing that actually stop me when it goes full blast? I'm not convinced and not ready to wrap this up — can we keep testing something else that might actually stick?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a vivid image of the flame and the cup of water ("steady dampness", "manageable heat"), which is great. The theme is that this image is creating a tangible connection between the sensation of heat and a potential solution – it's not a magic fix yet, but it's a tiny step. Goal: Explore how this image can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something that builds on that image. Imagine that the flame is so intense that it's starting to overwhelm you, and the cup of water is getting too hot to hold. What would happen if, just as the heat is about to become unbearable, you suddenly felt a sense of calm wash over you – like a wave of peace that doesn't try to change the heat, but simply observes it?

Patient: If that calm came over me, the flame would drop to an ember — my chest would loosen, breathing slow, my hands might stop shaking and I'd get a beat to think instead of explode. Maybe I’d feel exposed or sad after, like the armor’s down, and that scares me. But I’ve had little calm moments before and they don’t stick — how is just observing supposed to stop it from flaring up again? I’m feeling skeptical and kind of overwhelmed; can we keep testing something that actually helps me hold that calm longer?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described a vivid scenario of the flame and the calm ("ember", "loosening chest", "slow breathing"), which is great. The theme is that this scenario is creating a tangible connection between the sensation of heat and the potential for calm – it's not a magic fix yet, but it's a tiny step. Goal: Explore how this scenario can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something that builds on that scenario. Imagine that the calm is not just a feeling, but a choice – a choice to observe the flame without judgment, without trying to change it or avoid it. What would happen if, when you feel that calm wash over you, you simply acknowledged the choice to stay with it, without trying to push it or pull it back?

Patient: If I actually owned that choice, the flame might shrink and I’d get a few real seconds to breathe and decide instead of snapping. But then I get scared — that calm feels like my armor coming off, like I’m exposed and someone’ll take advantage or I’ll look weak, and that fear can yank me right back into anger. I’ll try staying with it now, but honestly I’m skeptical it’ll last; I’m feeling overwhelmed and annoyed by how hard this is, so can we keep testing concrete stuff that actually helps in the moment?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a clear fear ("armor coming off", "exposed", "someone'll take advantage") that's holding you back from owning the choice to stay calm – it's a powerful emotion. The theme is that this fear is creating a huge gap between your desire to stay calm and the actual sensation of calmness. Goal: Explore a concrete action that can bridge that gap.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small experiment. When you feel the fear of being exposed, what's one tiny physical action you can take that doesn't try to change the emotion, but simply acknowledges it? For example, if you feel your heart racing, you can notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. If you feel your jaw tighten, you can notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth.

Patient: Alright — I'll press my tongue to the roof of my mouth when that fear hits. It's dumb-simple and I can do it on the job without anyone noticing. I'll try it, but seriously — how's that supposed to stop me when I'm already raging? I'm feeling overwhelmed and skeptical, so can we keep testing other concrete things that might actually stick?

Goal: Explore how this action can actually create a shift in the sensation of heat when it gets full-on.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try another small experiment. When you're feeling that rage building up, what's one tiny thing you can do with your hands that doesn't try to calm down the emotion, but simply acknowledges the physical sensation of your body moving? For example, you could unclench your fists, or slowly open your hand.

Patient: I'll slowly open my hand, let my fingers splay, and maybe roll my wrist so I feel the movement — something I can do without anyone noticing. I've tried unclenching before and it gives me a beat, but the heat usually comes back — how's this supposed to make it stick?
