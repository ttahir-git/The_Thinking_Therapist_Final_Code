Patient: I've been stuck obsessing about my performance at work—I'm a data scientist and every time I need to start a task I just tell myself I'm going to mess it up. My mind immediately jumps to the worst: a small mistake becomes a failed deployment, clients lose trust, my boss puts me on a performance plan, I'll definitely get fired, and at my age I won't find another job so we'll lose the house. Because of that I keep procrastinating more and more and I can't seem to break the cycle.

Therapist: When you say "I'm going to mess it up," what's one specific task you've been putting off that you wish you could tackle right now? For example, what's the first line of code you've been hesitant to write, or the data visualization you've been too afraid to create?

Patient: It's the new feature in the preprocessing script I'm dreading—literally the first line I'd type is something like df['customer_risk'] = ... and I can't make myself write it. I just know that one wrong transformation will bias the model, the deployment will silently roll it out, decisions will go sideways, clients will complain, my boss will put me on a performance plan, I'll be fired, and at my age I won't find another job so we'll lose the house. I keep replaying that exact chain and that's why I procrastinate—it's like my brain won't let me consider anything else.

Therapist: That anxiety about getting it "wrong" seems really connected to the value of "keeping our clients safe and confident in our work." Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of getting stuck on this one line of code, you took just one tiny step towards making that value a reality, even if it felt scary or imperfect?

Patient: I can kind of imagine taking one tiny step, but the minute I do—say I write that df['customer_risk'] line—I’m convinced it’ll introduce a bias that slips past tests, go to production, decisions will be wrong, clients will complain, my boss will start a performance plan, I’ll get fired, and at my age I won’t find another job so we lose the house. It just feels inevitable to me; I can’t see how incremental checks or code review would realistically stop that chain.

Therapist: When you say "I'm convinced it'll introduce a bias," what exactly is that thought saying to you? Is it literally predicting an outcome, or is it more like a warning label (" Warning: this might happen")? Can you give me the exact phrase that shows up when you're worried about getting it "wrong"?

Patient: The exact thought that pops up is something like: "If you write that df['customer_risk'] line it will bias the model, the test won't catch it, it will go to production, clients will pull out, your boss will put you on a performance plan, you'll get fired, and we'll lose the house."  
It's not a maybe or a warning to me — it feels like a definite, unfolding script that will happen if I start. I can't seem to imagine any other ending.

Therapist: Can you look at that thought, "If you write that df['customer_risk'] line it will bias the model...," and simply say to it, "Thank you for showing up. You're here to help me prepare for what might happen"? What would you do with that thought right now, if it just showed up in front of you, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I can say it — "Thank you for showing up. You're here to help me prepare" — but honestly that already feels hollow. If the thought showed up I'd try to label it and thank it, and then it just keeps narrating the inevitable disaster and I get sucked into rehearsing every horrible step; I can't seem to just let it be.

Therapist: When that thought shows up and starts narrating the disaster, notice what you're doing with it. What's the function of that story? Is it trying to protect you from getting anxious about writing that line of code, or is it actually causing more anxiety? What would happen if you allowed the story to be just that – a story – without trying to control or change it?

Patient: I think the story's pretending to protect me—it's this warning that if I start I'll fail and be ruined, so the safe move is to avoid the task. But it actually fuels more anxiety and paralysis, because I keep replaying that exact "bias → production → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house" chain and can't get anything done. If I tried to let it be just a story maybe I'd be a bit less reactive, but honestly I can't picture that working—I can already hear the script starting and it pulls me right back into hiding.

Therapist: You mentioned you can't picture letting the story be just that – a story – without getting pulled back in. What if, instead of trying to control the story, you simply acknowledged its presence? What would happen if you said, "Okay, the story is here. It's showing up as 'bias → production →...' – and you didn't try to change it or push it away"? Would that tiny act of acknowledgment create just a tiny bit of space between you and the story?

Patient: Maybe for a second I can say it — "Okay, the story is here" — and there’s a tiny sliver of distance where I can breathe. But almost immediately the fortune-telling voice gets louder and replays that whole script: df['customer_risk'] wrong → bias → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → boss starts a performance plan → I get fired → we lose the house, and that space disappears. It doesn't feel like just a story to me; it feels like a chain that's already unfolding and I'm stuck watching it.

Therapist: When the story replays that script, notice where you're looking at it – where's the gaze? Is it on the story itself, or is it on the thought that's saying "I'll fail"? Try this: as you're watching that script replay, gently ask yourself, "What's the mirror showing right now?" What's the lens that's holding that story up for you to see?

Patient: The mirror's showing that fortune-telling lens — it's focused on the whole disaster-script itself: "bias → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house." That lens treats worst-case as proof, pulling past slips in as evidence, so I'm not really looking at the thought, I'm staring at the inevitable movie my brain insists will happen. I honestly can't picture any other ending; any alternative just feels unrealistic.

Therapist: When you say "I'm staring at the inevitable movie my brain insists will happen," notice what that "insists" reveals – you're not seeing the thought itself, but the story it's telling you. What if, instead of trying to change the story, you simply "unplugged" it from your emotional investment? What would happen if you allowed that story to be just a story, without the "must-happen" label that's driving it?

Patient: I try to let it be a story, but it barely lasts — maybe one breath — then the fortune-teller voice cranks up and it's back: df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → boss starts a performance plan → I'm fired → we lose the house. Calling it "just a story" feels like pretending everything's fine while a real catastrophe is marching toward me, so I end up more anxious and frozen. I don't know how to unplug it — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the fortune-teller voice kicks in, notice what physical sensations come up in your body. Where do you feel the tension, the tightness, the heaviness? What's the first thing you notice when the story replays? Is it your breath, your heartbeat, your muscles? Take one of those sensations and say it out loud: "My chest feels tight when..." or "My jaw clenches when..." This tiny act of noticing the physical reality can create space from the story's emotional charge.

Patient: My chest feels tight and my breath gets shallow the moment that disaster script starts — my jaw clenches, my shoulders hunch, and my hands go a bit numb like they're waiting for a verdict. My heart races and I can taste that cold, awful certainty as if it's already happening. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the breath that's coming up when you feel overwhelmed. Is it shallow, like you said, or is it quick? What happens if you pause that breath for just one second? Try it: "One second... pause..." or "I'll hold this breath for just a beat..." This tiny pause can give you a small window to notice the story without getting pulled into it. What do you see when you pause on that breath?

Patient: When I pause that breath for a beat, there's a tiny flicker — the tightness loosens a hair and I can see the disaster-script as images instead of reality. But almost immediately the fortune-teller voice kicks back in and narrates it all as definite again—df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house—and my chest clamps down. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we actually slow down?

Therapist: Notice the pause itself, the tiny moment when you stepped away from the story. That's what matters, not the story's content. Ask the pause a gentle question: "Is this pause happening?" or "Is my breath holding for a second?" This tiny inquiry creates space without trying to change the narrative. What happens when you keep asking this question, just once, then pause again?

Patient: If I ask "Is this pause happening?" and actually pause once, there's this tiny crack in the narration — I can see the images as images and my chest eases for a breath or two. But almost immediately the fortune-teller voice revs up louder and replays the whole df['customer_risk'] wrong → bias → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house movie, and the space slams shut. I can stretch that pause for a breath or three, maybe twice, but I can't hold it — it still feels impossible that the disaster wouldn't happen. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that you're struggling to hold onto the pause because you think it needs to change the outcome. Instead, try this: "I'm okay with this pause happening, no matter what happens next." Say it out loud, and then pause again. What happens when you let go of the need for the pause to "work" or "change" anything?

Patient: I said it out loud — "I'm okay with this pause happening, no matter what happens next" — and for a single breath my chest loosened and the images felt like images instead of destiny. But almost immediately the fortune-teller voice yells the whole script again — df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house — and the space vanishes. I'm trying to do the pause, but I'm overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your body when the fortune-teller voice is yelling the script. What is the sensation of your chest, shoulders, or breath? Try to anchor on that sensation, rather than the story. Ask yourself: "Where do I feel the weight in my body right now?" or "What's the sensation of my breath when the voice gets loud?" Focus on the physical reality, not the story.

Patient: My chest feels like a tight band and my breath gets shallow and fast; my jaw clamps and my hands go a bit numb. If I really focus on that pressure it eases a hair and the disaster feels like images instead of truth, but the fortune-teller voice immediately yells the whole df['customer_risk'] → bias → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house script and steals the space back. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tiny hair of space you created when you focused on the pressure in your chest. That's a tiny crack in the narrative. Try to anchor on that tiny crack by asking yourself: "What would happen if I just held this tiny space for one more second?" or "What would it feel like to just breathe for one more beat without trying to change the story?" Focus on the tiny space, not the story.

Patient: I try to hold that tiny space for one more beat — my chest loosens, the hands stop tingling, and for a split second the code looks like code instead of a catastrophe. But almost immediately the fortune-teller voice screams the whole script again — df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house — and the space snaps shut. I'm really overwhelmed; can we actually slow down?

Therapist: Notice the desperation in your breath when the fortune-teller voice screams the script again. What if that scream wasn't about "losing" the story, but about holding onto it? Try this: "What if I wasn't trying to stop the script from happening, but just watched it happen, without judgment or reaction?" Say it out loud, and pause. What happens when you let go of the need to "change" the story, and simply observe it?

Patient: I tried saying "I'll watch without reacting," and for one breath it actually worked—the images were just images and my chest loosened. But the fortune-teller voice immediately yells that df['customer_risk'] line will bias the model, tests will miss it, deployment will wreck things, clients pull out, my boss starts a performance plan, I get fired, and we lose the house, and I'm right back to tightness and paralysis. Trying to observe without judgment feels like it should help, but it just makes me more anxious because the story feels like a real timeline that needs stopping, not something I can calmly watch. I'm overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of your breath when you're overwhelmed by the fortune-teller voice. What's happening to your breath? Is it getting short, tight, or slow? Try to anchor on that sensation, rather than the story. Ask yourself: "What's happening in my body right now, without trying to change anything?" Focus on the physical reality, not the story.

Patient: My breath gets shallow and quick—like I'm holding it without meaning to—and it feels like a tight weight in my chest. Focusing on that lets a tiny bit of space open up, but almost immediately the fortune-teller starts the whole df['customer_risk'] → bias → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house script and it all clamps back down. I'm really overwhelmed right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath getting shallow and quick. What would happen to your breath if you simply allowed it to be that way, without trying to change it? Try this: "What would it feel like if my breath was just this way, without trying to make it any different?" Say it out loud, and pause. What happens when you let go of the need to control your breath?

Patient: I said out loud, "Okay, my breath can just be this way," and for one beat the tightness loosened and the code looked like code instead of catastrophe. But then the fortune-teller voice revved up and the whole script was back — df['customer_risk'] wrong → bias → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house — and my breath snapped shallow again. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the moment just before the fortune-teller voice starts screaming the script again. What happens to your breath, your chest, or your body right before the voice starts? Try to anchor on that tiny moment of transition. Say to yourself: "What's happening just before the voice starts?" or "What's the moment right before the script kicks in?"

Patient: Right before it starts my breath shortens and there's this small, hollow ache under my sternum—like a flicker of dread. I get a micro-urge to look away from the code and a snap thought, "Don't do it," and that physical twitch flips the switch and the movie of the worst-case chain starts rolling. I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the hollow ache under your sternum, the micro-urge to look away, and the snap thought "Don't do it." These are all tiny signs that your body is trying to protect you from the story. Try this: "I see this moment, this ache, this urge to look away – and I'm okay with it." Say it out loud, and pause. What happens when you accept this moment, without trying to change it?

Patient: I said it—"I see this moment, this ache, this urge to look away—and I'm okay with it"—and for a hair of a second the ache loosened and my breath slowed. But then the fortune-teller voice jumped back in: df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house, and the space vanished. I'm really overwhelmed—can we actually slow down?

Therapist: Notice the moment you tried to accept the ache, the breath slowed, and the space opened up. What happened just before the fortune-teller voice kicked in again? What was the first thing you noticed when you tried to hold onto that tiny space? Ask yourself: "What was I trying to avoid when I let go of the space?"

Patient: The first thing I noticed was that tiny spike of shame and the image of my boss's email—like a red flag—right before the space closed. I realize I was trying to avoid that humiliation and the whole cascade: the biased model, angry clients, a performance plan, getting fired, and losing the house. It feels impossible to imagine anything else; any calmer outcome just sounds naive. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the spike of shame and the image of your boss's email. What is that shame actually trying to protect you from? Is it fear of being judged, failing, or losing control? Ask yourself: "What would happen if I let go of this shame, without trying to avoid the story?" Try to anchor on the physical sensation of that shame, rather than the story itself.

Patient: I think the shame is trying to stop me from being judged or humiliated — like if I don't feel ashamed I might be exposed as incompetent and then that whole df['customer_risk'] → bias → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house chain will happen. Physically it's a hot flush in my face, a hollow drop in my stomach and a tight throat; when I try to let the shame go I feel naked and sure the disaster will follow, so I clamp up — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations when you try to let go of shame: the hot flush, hollow drop, and tight throat. What happens to your body when you try to hold onto those sensations? Do you feel more anxious, more numb, or more trapped? Try this: "What would happen if I gently explored that physical sensation, without trying to change it?"

Patient: If I actually lean in, I notice the hot flush in my face, the hollow drop in my stomach, and the throat tightening—it's almost like poking a sleeping animal. For a couple of breaths that curiosity softens the knot and the worst-case movie blurs into images instead of facts, but then the fortune-teller voice sneers that the momentary ease means I'm about to let the bias slip through and the whole df['customer_risk'] → bias → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house chain starts again. It helps for a second, but I get pulled back fast and I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to lean in and explore the physical sensations of shame, but then the fortune-teller voice kicks in again. What's the difference between the physical sensations when you're trying to avoid them (clamping up) and when you're actually exploring them (leaning in)? Ask yourself: "What's happening to my body when I'm not trying to avoid the knot in my throat?"

Patient: When I'm not avoiding it, the knot in my throat loosens a little, my breath deepens for a beat, and my shoulders drop — for a moment the code just looks like code instead of a catastrophe. But that tiny openness feels naked and the fortune-teller voice immediately screams the whole df['customer_risk'] → bias → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → performance plan → fired → lose the house movie, and I clamp back shut. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice that when you experience that tiny openness, it feels...exposed? Vulnerable? Like you're not wearing armor anymore? What if, instead of trying to push that openness away, you simply asked yourself: "What would happen if I allowed that vulnerability to stay for just one more breath?"

Patient: I tried letting that vulnerability stay for one more breath and, for a split second, my chest loosened and the code looked like code instead of a catastrophe. But the fortune-teller voice instantly yells that if I let that openness stay I'll write df['customer_risk'] wrong → bias the model → tests won't catch it → it goes to production → clients pull out → my boss puts me on a performance plan → I'm fired → we lose the house. It just feels naive to think a breath would stop that—I'm overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to predict the outcome of letting that vulnerability stay (the fortune-teller voice screaming the catastrophic chain). What's the physical sensation in your body when you're trying to predict this outcome? Is it tension, anxiety, or something else? Ask yourself: "What would happen if I actually stopped trying to predict the outcome for just one moment?"

Patient: If I actually stopped predicting for a moment my chest would unclench and I'd get a tiny flash of relief, but it never lasts — the fortune-teller voice just kicks in louder and the images rush back. My breath snaps shallow, my hands go numb, and I feel that cold certainty: df['customer_risk'] wrong → biased model → tests miss it → deployment → clients pull out → boss starts a performance plan → I'm fired → we lose the house. Letting go even briefly feels like a waste because I can't imagine it not happening; I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?
