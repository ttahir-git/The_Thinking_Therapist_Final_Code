Patient: I'm a senior artist, and lately I've been worrying nonstop about my performance—everything feels like a test and that anxiety just makes me procrastinate until I'm scrambling. I lost some steady gigs and the instability just makes it worse. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about, but that's mainly what's been on my mind.

Therapist: When you say everything feels like a test, what's the smallest thing that happens when you feel like you're not meeting those expectations? Is it a physical sensation, a thought, or a specific action that stops you from working?

Patient: I don't know—usually it starts as this tight knot in my stomach and a little voice saying it's going to be terrible. Then I either freeze or do something pointless—check emails, tidy the studio, scroll through old sketches—anything to avoid the piece. I guess it feels safer than risking it not being good, even though it makes everything worse later.

Therapist: When that knot shows up, what's one thing you value about creating art that's worth risking not meeting your expectations?

Patient: I guess what I value most is that making something still feels like proof that I’m here — it gives me purpose and this weird little joy that nothing else does. It calms me down and sometimes feels like the only honest part of my day. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about—can we maybe slow down a bit?

Therapist: That feeling of purpose and joy sounds like a precious anchor for you. When the knot shows up, what would happen if you paused with it for just a breath before reaching for something else?

Patient: I don't know—if I just paused, the knot would probably get louder and I'd start picturing everything going wrong. I guess I'd either sit there feeling useless and then end up distracting myself, or maybe, if I did it a few times, it might get a bit less scary. Can we... maybe talk about small things other artists do to actually try that? I don't know, I'm kind of nervous about digging into it.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to avoid the knot, you simply made space for it to be there - like taking a few deep breaths right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try one breath—inhale, exhale. I guess it softened the knot a bit but my brain immediately started saying it's pointless and I'd just be wasting time. Can we talk about tiny, concrete habits other artists use to actually start work? I'm kind of nervous about going deeper right now.

Therapist: What tiny, concrete habit have you noticed other artists use to start work when they're feeling stuck?

Patient: I don't know—I've noticed a few tiny things that seem to help: a five‑minute warm‑up sketch or a "shitty first draft" rule where you only commit to 10–15 minutes, setting a short timer (like Pomodoro), or doing a small ritual—tea, a playlist, clearing one corner of the studio. I guess the common thread is making the start ridiculously low‑stakes. Can we try picking one that sounds least scary and see if that might work for me?

Therapist: Let's try the "shitty first draft" rule: just commit to writing something for 10 minutes without stopping, no matter how bad it looks. What would you need to make that tiny act feel accessible for you?

Patient: I don't know—maybe if it felt really tiny and obvious: set a 10‑minute timer, put my phone in another room, make a cup of tea, and give myself permission that it's okay if it looks awful. I'd need a single, super‑small task—like one sketch or one color study—and a note that says "no editing" so I don't get hung up. I guess having someone expect a quick check‑in or me texting a friend when I'm done would keep me honest. I'm kind of nervous about actually doing it—can we pick which tiny task to try first?

Therapist: Let's choose one color study as your tiny task. When you put that 10-minute timer down, what's the one thing you'll say to yourself to make that tiny act feel okay?

Patient: I don't know—maybe I'll tell myself, "It's only ten minutes; it's just a study, not a performance, you can stop when the timer rings." I guess that permission might make it feel less like a test, though I'm kind of nervous about actually starting.

Therapist: Let's do it. When you feel the knot showing up, take a deep breath, and whisper that phrase to yourself: "It's just a study, not a performance."

Patient: I did the breath and whispered it—"It's just a study, not a performance." I don't know, it did soften the knot a bit, but the worry's still there and my brain's already telling me it's pointless. I guess I could try the ten‑minute study, but I'm nervous I'll bail—could we make an even smaller first step, like just setting out the materials for one minute, and then I'll check in with you after that?

Therapist: Let's do the smallest step possible: just set out the materials for one minute. Don't worry about creating anything, just place the materials within reach of your desk. What's the one thing you need to take care of before you start?

Patient: I don't know—probably put my phone in another room so I won't keep reaching for it. Maybe clear that one corner of the desk so there's actually a spot to put the paper and paints. I guess making a quick cup of tea would help, but phone-away feels like the main thing.

Therapist: Let's commit to putting your phone in another room for just one minute. What happens right now when you take your phone away and put it in another room?

Patient: I don't know — it actually feels a little lighter, like that knot loosened a bit and there's less frantic noise in my head. I still get this itch to do something safe instead — tidy, make tea, wander the studio — but it's quieter, and I guess that makes reaching for the materials feel a touch more possible. I'm nervous about starting, but I can try setting the materials out now if you want.

Therapist: Let's set the materials out for just 30 seconds. What's the first small step you'll take to place the paper and paints on your desk?

Patient: I don't know—I'll shove the mail off that corner and lay one sheet of paper down, then put three paint tubes and a brush next to it. I'll set a 30‑second timer and only do that. I'm kind of nervous, but I can try.

Therapist: You're setting the timer for 30 seconds. When it goes off, what will you do immediately without thinking about what to create next?

Patient: I don't know — when it goes off I'll pick up the brush and make one single mark on the paper, just one stroke, then put the brush down. I guess doing that tiny, non‑judged action might be enough to keep me from bailing, though I'm kind of nervous about what happens after.

Therapist: You've committed to making one single mark. As you put the brush down, notice what happens without judgment - what physical sensations arise, what thoughts come up, or what emotions are present?

Patient: I don't know — after that one mark I felt a tiny loosening in my chest, like the knot eased a bit. My hand tingled and then my brain immediately said, "That wasn't bad," and then, "Will it ever be enough?" I guess I'm both a little relieved and suddenly anxious, and it's kind of awkward talking about it — can we maybe talk about what to do next if I freeze after that first mark?

Therapist: What happens when you freeze after that first mark - is it a physical sensation, a thought, or an emotion? Try to observe it without judgment, like a neutral witness.

Patient: I don't know—when I freeze it's mostly a tight chest and shallow breathing, my hands feel a bit numb like they don't belong to me. Then the thoughts show up: "you can't do this," or "this will prove you're a failure," and I feel anxious and ashamed. I guess if I try to notice it like an observer it eases a little, but it's hard—can we maybe pick a tiny next step for when that happens?

Therapist: When you notice the thoughts "you can't do this" or "this will prove you're a failure", what's one tiny physical action you can take to gently interrupt that thought loop?

Patient: I don't know—maybe the simplest is to take three really slow breaths while planting my feet on the floor, or stand up and stretch my shoulders for a few seconds. I guess another tiny thing is to press my palm on the paper (something physical and neutral) or take a quick sip of water to break the loop. It's awkward to say out loud, but those feel doable.

Therapist: Let's commit to pressing your palm on the paper when those thoughts arise. When you feel that loop coming up, what happens right now when you press your palm on the paper?

Patient: I don't know—when I press my palm on the paper it feels oddly grounding, like a little anchor under all that noise. My breathing slows a bit and the tightness eases, though the thoughts are still there whispering it's not enough. I guess it gives me a tiny pause to choose the next small step, but I'm nervous about what that step should be.

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you've noticed you've been wanting to do in the studio that feels safe or interesting to you? Not something big, just something small - a color, a shape, a texture?

Patient: I don't know—maybe just a quick wash of ultramarine across the paper, or a small scraped ochre circle with a palette knife. I guess that thick, tactile texture of knife strokes feels safer than trying to render anything perfect.

Therapist: Let's commit to the scraped ochre circle with a palette knife. When you pick up the knife, what's the first small, physical action you'll take before making that circle - is it wiping the knife clean, dipping it into the ochre, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — I'll probably wipe a bit of paint onto the palette, lightly load the knife, and do a quick test stroke on a scrap first before I try the circle. I guess doing that tiny test makes it feel less like a performance, though I'm nervous about actually making the mark.

Therapist: You've identified the test stroke as a crucial step. As you make that first test stroke, what's one thing you'll notice about the mark - is it the color, the texture, the size, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — probably the texture, how thick the ochre sits and the ridges the knife leaves; I guess those little irregularities will tell me more than the color or size. Noticing that might make it feel less like a test and more like information, though I'm kind of nervous about actually doing the circle.

Therapist: You've decided to make the test stroke on the scrap, and now you're ready to make the circle. As you start the circle, bring your attention to the sensation of the knife moving across the paper - notice the weight of the knife, the pressure of your hand, and the sound of the strokes.

Patient: I don't know — as I drag the knife the weight feels real in my hand and I can hear that soft scrape, and the ochre builds up into little ridges. My chest loosens a bit when I focus on that texture, but then this thought sneaks in: "Is that even any good?" and I feel my hand want to stop. I guess noticing the sound and the pressure helped a little — can we figure out a tiny next step for when that doubt hits?

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you could do with your hand when you feel that thought "Is that even any good?" - is it to simply release the knife and put it down, or to take a very small, gentle stroke to continue the circle?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd try one very small, gentle stroke to nudge the circle along, not to finish it but just to keep moving. If that still makes me panic, I'll put the knife down and press my palm on the paper to ground myself, then decide the next tiny step.

Therapist: You've committed to taking one small, gentle stroke to nudge the circle along. As you make that stroke, notice what happens - is your hand relaxing, the thought "Is that even any good?" still there, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — my hand did relax a little, the stroke felt automatic more than deliberate, and the "Is that even any good?" thought was still there but quieter. I guess that tiny movement made me want to try another one, though I'm nervous I'll freeze again. Can we pick the smallest next move if that happens?

Therapist: What's the smallest thing you could do if your hand freezes again - is it to simply look at the circle, or to take one tiny twitch of the finger to keep it moving?

Patient: I don't know — maybe the tiniest thing is just to look at the circle and breathe, like give myself permission to pause without needing to do more. I guess if that feels okay I might try a tiny twitch of the finger after a beat, but I'm kind of nervous about committing to even that.

Therapist: You've decided to look at the circle and breathe, and that feels okay. As you take a breath, notice how your body feels - is your hand relaxed, your chest calm, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — my hand's a bit looser, not fully relaxed but less like a claw, and my chest feels a little calmer though there's still this low, nervous buzz. I guess my shoulders dropped a touch and my breathing's steadier, but I'm kind of worried about what to do next.

Therapist: Notice the steady breath moving in and out of your body, feeling the rise and fall of your chest. As you exhale, imagine any nervousness or tension leaving your body - what does it feel like when you exhale?

Patient: I don't know — when I exhale it feels like a little whoosh and the tightness loosens for a beat, my shoulders sink and the buzz quiets a bit. Then my brain almost immediately wonders if that mattered and the nervousness hangs around, and I feel kind of awkward saying that. I guess it helps a little, but can we maybe keep it simple and pick the tiniest next step—another gentle stroke or just sitting with the circle for a minute?
