Patient: Lately I've been getting really anxious in social settings — I usually end up avoiding gatherings with friends even though I want to go and my partner is supportive. I also have OCD and ongoing financial stress that's been making things worse. I don't know, I guess I'm just worried I'm missing out and it feels really uncomfortable to talk about.

Therapist: What's the physical sensation like in your body when you're in a social setting and you start to feel anxious - is it a knot in your stomach, tightness in your chest, or something else?

Patient: Mostly a tightness in my chest and my heart starts racing — my hands get sweaty and my stomach ties itself in knots. I guess I also get lightheaded and like my throat closes up, so talking feels harder. I don't know, I'm trying to describe it but it feels weird to go into.

Therapist: That tightness in your chest makes sense when you're worried about what others might think. What's the value of connecting with your friends that's worth feeling anxious about? For example, what would it mean to them (and to you) if you showed up to a gathering, even if it felt uncomfortable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess being with friends would make me feel less alone and more like myself, not just defined by my anxiety or OCD. It would mean I'm still part of their lives and maybe they'd see I'm trying, which feels important. But honestly, I don't know how to bridge the gap between wanting that and actually going.

Therapist: So, being part of their lives and feeling seen for your efforts means a lot to you. What's one tiny thing you could do this week to connect with your friends, even if it's just sending a text or making a phone call - not about fixing your anxiety, but about showing up with kindness and curiosity?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could just send one friend a short, casual text like "hey, thinking of you — how's your week?" instead of committing to go out. It feels awkward to reach out, but that seems manageable and less scary than showing up in person.

Therapist: Instead of focusing on what you hope the text will achieve (e.g., fixing your anxiety), what's the physical sensation like in your body right now as you imagine sending that text - does it feel like your chest tightens or your hands sweat?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest gets a little tight and my hands go clammy, like a small knot in my stomach. It's way less intense than actually being there, but even imagining it makes my throat feel weird, so I sort of want to bail.

Therapist: That knot in your stomach is actually a sign that you're showing up with care, even if it feels small. When you imagine sending that text, what's one tiny thing you're doing with your body that feels like you're being kind to yourself - is it taking a breath, placing your phone on your lap, or just sitting with the thought?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd take a slow breath before typing and rest my phone on my lap so it doesn't feel so in-your-face. Just sitting with it for a few seconds feels like a tiny kindness, even though my throat still gets tight.

Therapist: That slow breath and resting your phone on your lap feels like a tiny act of kindness to yourself, even if your throat still gets tight. What happens if, instead of trying to "fix" that tightness, you just acknowledge it and keep sending that text - can you imagine your friend receiving it and feeling seen, even if you don't feel calm right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can imagine them feeling seen, like they'd know I'm still around and that would feel nice. But even picturing it makes my throat tighten and I worry it'll sound weird or like I'm being needy. Can we maybe talk about what a really small, casual text could actually say? That feels less exposing than the feelings themselves.

Therapist: Let's try to craft a super small, casual text that feels like a tiny act of kindness - like "hey, just saw that new restaurant downtown and thought of you" or "how's your week going so far?" What's one thing you could say that feels like a genuine, low-stakes connection to your friend, without trying to fix or talk about your anxiety?

Patient: I don't know... I guess something super simple like, "Hey — how's your week going?" feels safest. Or maybe, "Saw this and thought of you — how've you been?" I worry they might sound weird though, can you help me pick which one feels less needy?

Therapist: Both texts feel like small kindnesses, but the first one ("Hey — how's your week going?") might come across as slightly more direct or attention-seeking. The second one ("Saw this and thought of you — how've you been?") uses a more casual, observational phrase ("Saw this") that feels less like a personal inquiry. Which one feels more like a genuine connection to your friend, without trying to "fix" or ask for something?

Patient: I don't know... I guess "Saw this and thought of you — how've you been?" feels less needy and more casual, so I'd probably pick that. It still makes me nervous though — I worry it might come off forced or weird.

Therapist: That text feels like a genuine connection to your friend, even if it's a tiny act of kindness. When you imagine sending it, what's one thing you could do to help you feel more like you're showing up with kindness, rather than trying to "make it perfect"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could remind myself it's just a tiny, kind check-in—not a performance. Maybe take a slow breath, type it out and leave it for 10 minutes, then hit send if it still feels okay, and tell myself it's enough no matter how it lands.

Therapist: That's exactly right - it's just a tiny, kind check-in, and it's okay if it lands however it does. When you send that text, what's one thing you're committing to yourself, right now, that feels connected to your value of feeling less alone?

Patient: I guess I'm committing to actually send that "saw this" text this week and be okay with whatever response, even if it's nothing. I don't know, it feels small but like proof I'm trying—not disappearing and choosing connection over hiding. Can we talk about what I'd do if they don't reply? That part makes me really anxious.

Therapist: What if the silence doesn't feel like a failure, but rather an honest reflection of their own busy-ness or focus? What would happen to your sense of connection and worth if you knew they weren't checking their phone at that exact moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I knew they weren't checking their phone I'd feel a little less like it's about me, but my chest still tightens and I start spiraling — replaying the message and worrying I sounded weird or needy. It might help logically to remind myself people are busy, but emotionally that doesn't stick. What do I do when I catch myself checking my phone a million times and can't stop replaying it?

Therapist: When you catch yourself replaying the message, what's one tiny physical sensation you can notice in your body that signals you're getting stuck - is it a tightness in your chest, a flutter in your hands, or a knot in your stomach? When you notice that physical sensation, what's one tiny thing you can do to gently bring your attention back to the present moment, without trying to "fix" the thought?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's that tightness in my chest and clammy hands and this loop in my head. When I notice it, one tiny thing I can do is take three slow, deep breaths and really feel my feet on the floor — maybe put my phone down — just to anchor me back to the room. It helps a little, but I still get kind of edgy and want to bail.

Therapist: That's exactly right - taking those three deep breaths and feeling your feet on the floor is a powerful anchor to bring you back to the present moment. When you notice that tightness in your chest and clammy hands, what's one thing you're committing to yourself, right now, that feels connected to your value of feeling less alone?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm committing to actually send that little "saw this" text this week, then put my phone face down and do three slow breaths and feel my feet on the floor whenever I start replaying it. But I'm already getting kind of edgy and want to bail—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: What's one tiny thing that's making you want to bail right now, when you think about sending that text and anchoring yourself in the present moment? Is it fear of rejection, fear of embarrassment, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's mostly fear of rejection and embarrassment — like if they don't reply it'll feel like proof I'm being needy or annoying. I'm also suddenly really distracted and my chest is tight and my head's racing, so I just want to bail and avoid feeling that. Can we maybe slow down and go over exactly what the text would say again?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and look at the text again. What exactly does it say?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the text would be: "Saw this and thought of you — how've you been?" But I'm already freaking out that it sounds dumb or needy and my chest's tight—can we tweak it so it feels less weird?

Therapist: What specifically is making you think that the text sounds "dumb" or "neediness"? Is it the phrase "how've you been", or the way you're thinking about it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's more the way I'm thinking about it — it feels so vulnerable, like I'm asking for attention or permission to exist, not just saying hi. My chest tightens and I start replaying every possible reaction, so the words feel loaded even if they're not. Maybe make it even more casual/no-question so it doesn't feel like I'm putting something out there to be judged?

Therapist: Instead of trying to make the text more casual or no-question, what if you focused on the physical sensation of your chest tightening when you think about it? What would that sensation be if you didn't try to "fix" the words, but instead just noticed it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a heavy pressure across my chest, like someone's squeezing and my breaths get shallow and quick. If I just notice it without fixing the words, it kind of sits there like a buzzy alarm and my brain wants to grab my phone or move away from the feeling. I'm getting kind of edgy talking about it—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and imagine that you're about to send the text, and the heavy pressure in your chest is still there. What's one tiny thing you could do with your body that would help you actually send the text, without getting caught up in the anxiety?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could take a slow, deep breath, rest the phone on my lap so it doesn't feel in my face, and press send on the exhale — like one deliberate movement tied to my breath. My chest's already tight and my hands feel shaky though, so I'm getting kind of edgy — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to imagine that you've just sent the text. What's one tiny thing you could notice about your body or your surroundings that would show you that you've actually taken the action?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd notice my phone face-down on my lap and my shoulders dropping a tiny bit, like one less thing up in the air. My chest is still tight and my hands are shaky though, and I'm already feeling kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: What's one tiny thought that comes up for you when you notice your shoulders dropping and the phone face-down on your lap?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the tiny thought is kind of two things at once: "Okay, I actually did it," and then immediately "what if they don't reply or think it's weird." My chest tightens when that second thought shows up — I'm getting a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down and sit with that for a moment?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and just notice the thought, "Okay, I actually did it," without trying to analyze it or push it away. What's the sensation of that thought in your body, right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like my shoulders drop a little and there's this tiny loosening, like a brief relief. But my chest is still tight and my stomach's knotted, and my hands feel clammy — my head immediately starts pinging with "what if they don't reply" so I get kind of edgy and want to check my phone. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and just notice the physical sensations of the "okay, I did it" thought, without trying to push away the "what if" thoughts. What would happen to your body if you stayed with that feeling of shoulders dropping and loosening for just one more second?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I stayed with it another second my shoulders might drop a bit more and my breathing slow, and there'd be this tiny space where the tightness eases — but the pressure in my chest would still be there. My hands might unclench a little, but I'd also feel this urge to check my phone or get out of the moment, and I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and just notice the tension in your chest, exactly as it is, without trying to change it. What would happen to your body if you allowed that tension to be present, without trying to push it away or replace it with something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let the tension be, it kind of just sits there — this heavy pressure in my chest and my breaths stay shallow, but after a few seconds my shoulders might drop a little and my breathing could ease a bit. My hands stay clammy and my brain starts pinging with "what if" thoughts, so I get jumpy and want to check my phone or leave the room. I'm already feeling kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and just notice one of those "what if" thoughts as it comes up - the one that's making you want to check your phone or leave the room. What would happen to your body if you simply acknowledged that thought, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I just acknowledged it my chest would spike tighter for a second and my hands would clench, and then maybe my shoulders would drop a little after. But I instantly get this urge to check my phone or make the feeling go away — it's really hard to just sit with it. Can we slow down? I'm already getting jumpy.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and imagine a tiny gap between the urge to check your phone and the physical sensations of the "what if" thought - just one tiny second. What would happen to your body if you allowed that gap to exist, without trying to fill it with checking your phone or escaping the feeling?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let that tiny gap be, my chest jumps tight for a beat and then maybe loosens a little, my breath slows a notch and my shoulders drop a bit. My hands are still clammy and there's this loud urge to check my phone, and my head starts racing. It's really hard to hold it—I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down and actually try a pause together?
