Patient: Hi, I'm an older artist and I just started a really demanding program, and it's stirred up a lot of anger and frustration I don't know how to handle. I snap at people in meetings or when critiques come up, then I feel ashamed and want to hide. I guess I'm worried it'll ruin this chance and I don't really know what to do.

Therapist: When you feel that anger and frustration building, what's one thing you'd be willing to draw or write about right now, even if it's just for 30 seconds, to physically express what's going on?

Patient: I guess I'd draw a clenched fist turning into a paintbrush, all jagged lines and angry red smears around it. I don't know, maybe just furious, fast strokes for 30 seconds to get the heat out.

Therapist: That jagged, angry drawing sounds like a powerful way to release tension. As you draw, notice what's driving your need to control the outcome in meetings and critiques – is it really about your art, or about proving yourself? What would it be like to approach those moments with curiosity, like "What can I learn from this feedback?" instead of getting stuck on being "right"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's more about proving myself than the art — like I'm terrified they'll see I'm not actually any good after all these years. Trying to be curious about feedback feels really hard; I worry asking questions will make me look weak and then I get defensive. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? How would I actually ask for feedback without sounding like I'm just defending myself?

Therapist: When you feel like you're about to get defensive, pause for a deep breath. What's one tiny thing you could say in response to feedback that wouldn't be a question – like "That's really interesting, I didn't think of it that way"?

Patient: I guess I could try something simple like, "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks." But I don't know, it might feel fake and I'll probably still want to snap. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe try a quick role-play so I can practice it once?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play: Imagine you're in a meeting and someone gives you feedback. Right before they speak, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I'm here to learn." Then, respond to their comment with that simple phrase: "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks." What's one small thing that could happen if you say that without adding a question?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one small thing is they might keep talking and give more specific, useful feedback instead of me immediately snapping. Or they might just move on, and even that would be okay because I'd probably feel a little calmer and less like exploding. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we try the role-play now so I can practice saying it once?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play: I'll be the person giving you feedback, and you can respond with just one sentence: "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks." Go ahead and say it to me.

Patient: That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks.

Therapist: When you respond like that, what's one small thing you could learn from that person's feedback – something that might help you grow as an artist?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one small thing might be a new compositional idea or a different way to use color or negative space that I hadn't considered. But talking about it makes me kind of jumpy — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down? Maybe we could do another quick role-play where you give a short bit of feedback and I try to respond again.

Therapist: Let's do another quick role-play: I'll give you a short piece of feedback, and you try responding with that simple phrase: "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks." Here's a brief comment: "I love the way you used warm colors in that piece, it feels really inviting."

Patient: That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks. 

I don't know, saying it felt… quieter, like it took some heat out of me. I'm kind of jumpy though — can we try another short one, maybe with something a bit tougher so I can practice not snapping?

Therapist: Let's try another short piece of feedback: "I think you're pushing too hard on the edges of that piece, it's starting to feel overwhelming." Can you respond with that simple phrase, "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks."

Patient: That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks. 

I don't know... that eased it a little, but it still feels heavy and I'm kind of sluggish right now — can we try another one?

Therapist: Let's try another one: "I'm not sure what happened with the texture in that piece, it looks like it got lost in the background." Can you respond with that simple phrase, "That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks."

Patient: That's interesting — I hadn't thought of that, thanks.

I don't know... I'm not sure I follow how that's supposed to help — it feels kind of flat and hard to focus, and I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: When you feel like the feedback is "flat" and hard to focus on, what's one tiny thing your body might do if you let that feeling be – like a small tension in your jaw or a slight shift in your posture?

Patient: I don't know... maybe my jaw just clenches and my shoulders creep up, like I'm bracing. It makes my breath shallow and everything goes a bit fuzzy — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, just for a moment, and notice where that physical tension is in your body. Can you bring your attention to that clenching jaw and those creeping shoulders, without trying to change it or push it away? Just notice it, slowly...

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice it my jaw's tight and my shoulders are up, and my breath gets tiny and stuck. It's hard to just sit with that without wanting to move—I'm feeling a bit weighed down and overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: What would it be like if you simply allowed that tight jaw and upturned shoulders to be there, without trying to "fix" it or push it away? What might you notice about your body if you just sat with that feeling, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... if I just let it be, my jaw stays clenched and my shoulders feel like they're trying to touch my ears, and my breath gets tiny. My chest feels tight and there's this buzzy restlessness in my hands, like I want to move or snap at something. It's awkward to sit with — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Imagine a gentle warmth spreading from the soles of your feet, up through your legs, and into your body. As you exhale, allow that warmth to fill any areas of tension, starting with your jaw and shoulders.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — that's actually... kind of grounding. The warmth moves up a little, I guess my shoulders feel a touch looser and my jaw is slightly less clenched, but it's still pretty stuck. I'm feeling drained and a bit jumpy; can we stay with that a moment and maybe try it again, slower?

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath in together... and as we exhale, gently bring your attention to the jaw, without trying to change it. Imagine a small, tiny thread of awareness connecting to the jaw, just for a moment. What's the sensation of that thread touching the jaw, without trying to pull it away or push it in?

Patient: I don't know... it feels like a faint, weird pressure — like a tiny pebble or a brush on my jaw, a little ache. It's making me want to pull away — I'm feeling jumpy and kind of drained, can we take another slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's take another slow, deep breath in together... and as we exhale, gently say to yourself, "That pressure is there, on my jaw, without trying to change it." Just acknowledge the sensation, without judgment or reaction.

Patient: I don't know... it feels like a dull pebble pressed into my jaw, a low, nagging ache, and my breath is still shallow. It's making me want to pull away — I'm feeling jumpy and kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down and stay with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the shallow breath. What would happen if you simply allowed that breath to be there, without trying to push it deeper or hold it? What might your body feel if you just sat with that breath, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... maybe the breath would just stay small and quiet, and my shoulders might drop a little and the chest tightness ease a bit. I'm kind of wiped out and jumpy — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take one final, slow breath together... and as we exhale, gently say to yourself, "I am here, with this breath, in this moment, without trying to change it." Just acknowledge the breath, your body, and your surroundings, without judgment or reaction.

Patient: I don't know... I said it quietly to myself — "I'm here with this breath" — but it felt thin, like it barely reached anything. My jaw's still clenched and my shoulders are a bit looser, breath still small; it helped a little but I'm kind of drained and jumpy. Can we try another slow one, maybe quieter so I can actually feel it? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's try another slow breath together... this time, whisper it to yourself: "I'm here... with this breath... feeling..." Start with just "feeling" and see what sensation comes up in your body.

Patient: I don't know... I whispered "feeling" and there's this hollow in my chest, like a weight, and my hands feel buzzy and restless. My jaw's still tight and a small panicky flutter shows up, but it's a bit quieter. Can we do another one, even slower? I guess I need more practice.

Therapist: Let's take another slow, tiny breath together... just "in"... and as you exhale, whisper: "That weight in my chest... feels heavy." Notice the sensation of that weight, without trying to push it away or change it.

Patient: I don't know... I whispered it and the weight in my chest felt like a flat stone, dull and heavy, and my hands are still buzzy. Saying it helped a little but it also makes me want to look away — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer? I guess one more slow, tiny breath together might help, if that's okay.

Therapist: Let's take one more tiny breath together... and as you exhale, gently say to yourself: "I look away... from the weight... and I'm here." Notice how your body feels when you look away from the sensation, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: I don't know... when I look away from the weight it kind of thins — my shoulders sink a bit and my breath loosens a touch. But then my head fills with deadlines and I feel guilty, like I should be tougher about this. I'm pretty wiped and jumpy; can we stay with this a little longer and do another tiny breath together?

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath together... and as you exhale, gently say to yourself: "That guilt... feels like a familiar story." Notice how the story feels in your body, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: I don't know... when I say that, the guilt just sits heavy in my chest like a blanket, my shoulders hunch and my jaw tightens. It feels stupidly familiar—like being told not to take up space when I was a kid. I'm kind of jumpy and wiped out; can we slow down and just breathe with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together... and as you exhale, notice what happens in your body when you imagine letting go of that blanket of guilt. Where does the heaviness settle? Is there any tension in your shoulders, jaw, or chest?

Patient: I don't know... when I imagine letting the guilt go, the heaviness doesn't leave — it sort of sinks down into my ribs and low belly. My shoulders ease a bit but my jaw's still tight and my hands feel buzzy. I'm kind of wiped and jumpy — can we slow down and do another tiny breath together? I guess I need more practice.

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath together... and as you inhale, notice what happens to the heaviness in your body. Does it feel like it's being pulled down into your breath, or does it stay separate? Try to anchor that sensation to your breath without trying to change it.

Patient: I don't know... when I inhale it doesn't really lift the heaviness — it stays low, dense in my belly like a stone. If I try to anchor it to my breath there's a tiny loosening, but it's faint and I'm still pretty drained and jumpy. Can we do another tiny breath together? I guess I need more practice.

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath together... and as you exhale, imagine your breath is a container that can hold this heaviness without changing it. Notice what happens to your body when you think of your breath as a container – does the heaviness feel like it's being held in it, or does it shift in any way?

Patient: I don't know... when I imagine my breath as a container the heaviness kind of sits in it, like it's being held but not changing — it sinks a little lower into my belly but it's still dense. I'm a bit calmer but my jaw's still tight and my hands buzz; can we stay with this and do another tiny breath together?

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath together... and as you exhale, notice what happens when you say to yourself, "I breathe." What does that sound like in your body? Is it a steady hum, a quiet pause, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... it’s more like a faint, steady hum — a quiet pause that barely reaches anything. My chest feels thin and my hands are still buzzy; I'm kind of wiped and a bit confused. Can we do another tiny breath together, slower?
