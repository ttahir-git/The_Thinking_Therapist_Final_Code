Patient: Um, lately it's been this anger and frustration that I can't seem to control, mostly tied to the empty-nest stuff and the big life changes. It flares up in conversations about the kids leaving or when people ask about work, and I don't know what to do with it. I guess I'm just overwhelmed and it's really uncomfortable to talk about.

Therapist: That anger and frustration sound really intense right now. What's one thing you feel like you can't control or talk about when you're feeling like that? Is it always related to the kids leaving, or does it happen in other situations too?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the thing I can't control is this emptiness — like my purpose or usefulness disappeared when the kids left, and talking about it makes me flare up. It's not always just them; it happens when people ask about work or make small talk and act like everything's fine. I don't know, it's hard to explain without getting defensive.

Therapist: That emptiness and feeling like your purpose disappeared is a really tough spot to be in. When you're avoiding conversations about it, what happens in your body when someone asks about work or makes small talk and you feel like they're not getting it? Does your heart rate go up, or do you feel like you're just going through the motions?

Patient: I don't know... my heart starts pounding and there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe as easily. Sometimes I snap and say something I don't mean, other times I just go quiet and stare at the floor. I guess it feels like either I'm about to explode or I want to disappear, and talking about it only makes me more on edge.

Therapist: Those physical sensations are really tangible and intense. What if, instead of avoiding conversations about your emptiness, you tried taking one tiny step – just one word – when someone asks about work or makes small talk? Like, what's the smallest word you could say to acknowledge their question without having to open up about everything?

Patient: I don't know... maybe just "busy." I guess "trying" or "hanging on" could work too, but "busy" feels safest so I can dodge the rest. It's getting kind of tense talking about it, though—I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: That "busy" feels like a good starting point. What's the underlying value that's driving your need to avoid talking about your emptiness? Is it that you don't want to be seen as struggling, or that you're worried about being judged?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I don't want people to see me as failing or useless — like admitting it would make them think I'm lazy or broken. I worry about being judged, and that makes me shut down or get defensive. I'm getting kind of on edge talking about this, so I don't really know what else to say.

Therapist: That fear of being judged as failing or useless is really painful. What would happen in that moment if you let go of the need to avoid it, and instead allowed yourself to say, "I'm struggling with this emptiness"? What's one value that's connected to this struggle – like being honest with yourself or being true to your own heart – and how might saying that truth feel, even if it's scary?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if I said "I'm struggling" I'd just feel exposed, like everyone would see me as a failure. I guess the value is honesty or wanting to be real with myself, but saying it might feel both like a relief and like opening myself up to being judged — which makes me snap or shut down. I'm getting kind of tense talking about this, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm struggling" feels like a tightrope walk for you. What if, instead of trying to say it, you simply acknowledge the physical tension in your body when someone asks about work or makes small talk? What's one small thing you can notice about that tension, like the way your shoulders feel?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my shoulders hunch up and feel heavy, and my jaw gets tight like I'm holding my breath. My hands curl into little fists sometimes and my breathing gets shallow. It's kind of uncomfortable to focus on it—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take just one of those sensations – the heaviness in your shoulders. Can you simply notice that sensation right now, without trying to do anything with it? Just observe the weight in your shoulders, without judgment.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. My shoulders feel like there's a heavy weight pressing down, like I can't lift them, and my breath's shallow when I notice it. I don't know if this is helpful — it's making me a bit on edge, can we slow down?

Therapist: That heavy feeling in your shoulders is really present. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly roll your shoulders down, just a little bit. Don't try to move anything, just let them relax.

Patient: Okay... I tried. I guess my shoulders dropped a little and it feels a bit lighter, but my chest's still tight and my breathing's weird. I don't know if this is helping — focusing on it makes me anxious, so can we slow down?

Therapist: The tightness in your chest is still there, and your breathing feels weird. That's okay. It's normal to feel anxious when we're trying to focus on something new. Just notice the tightness in your chest without trying to change it – just observe it.

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels like a tight band and my breath is kind of shallow, and my mind's jumping to a bunch of things so it's hard to just watch it. I guess I'm feeling more on edge than before and it's making me distracted—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: The tightness in your chest is still there, and your mind's jumping around. That's okay. It's like your body's saying, "Hey, we need a minute to notice this tightness again." Take one tiny breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – just that. No thoughts, no worries.

Patient: I tried, but my head won't stop racing — I'm more on edge and my chest actually feels tighter now. I can sort of notice the heels of my feet on the floor, like a dull pressure, but it's hard to stay with it because my mind keeps jumping. I don't know if this is helping — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, and even noticing the heels of your feet is getting hard. That's okay. It's okay that this exercise isn't working for you right now. Just notice the effort you're making to try – that's what matters. You're showing up, even when it feels hard.

Patient: I guess I hear you, but I'm still really on edge and distracted—my chest's tighter and my head won't stop racing. I don't know if I'm even doing this right; I'm trying but it feels like I might snap or just check out. Can we slow down a lot? Maybe talk about something a bit less intense for a minute.

Therapist: You're doing exactly what matters – showing up, even when it feels hard. It's okay to feel like you're on edge right now. Would you like to talk about something else for a minute? Like... what's your favorite way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon?

Patient: I don't know... I guess on a lazy Sunday I like puttering in the garden or making a strong cup of tea and watching old movies — something quiet where I don't have to talk. Lately my mind's been racing though, so even that feels half-finished and I get on edge. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like gardening, tea, and old movies are your happy places – quiet, calming moments that feel like a pause from the world. Even when your mind's racing now, that doesn't mean the memory of those moments isn't still there, does it?

Patient: I guess those things are still my go-to — gardening, a strong tea, and an old movie — but right now they feel kind of out of reach because my head’s racing. I don't know how to settle into them when I'm this on edge. Can we slow down and maybe... talk about something a little lighter for a bit?

Therapist: What's something you've always loved, but haven't done in a while because you're too busy or stressed? Like, if you could pick one thing, what would it be?

Patient: I don't know... I used to love watercolor painting but haven't touched a brush in years. I guess I'd like to try again, but just thinking about starting makes my chest tighten and my head race, like I'm already failing at it. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Just noticing that your chest tightens when you think about painting again – what if that tightness wasn't about "failing," but about how hard it is to breathe when you're nervous about trying again?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that's probably it — the tightness feels less about failing and more like my chest closes up and I can't breathe when I'm nervous about starting. Then my head fills up with every little reason I'll mess it up, and I shut down instead of even trying. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge what's happening in your body and mind when you're nervous about trying again. That's already a small step, and it's okay that it's hard. Would you say to yourself right now, "I'm feeling nervous, and that's okay"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll say it: "I'm feeling nervous, and that's okay." But saying that actually makes me more anxious—my chest tightens and my head starts racing. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what happens in your body when you say "I'm feeling nervous, and that's okay" – like you said, your chest tightens and your head starts racing. What's happening just before that happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess right before it happens there's this quick, panicky thought — like "they're going to see I'm failing" or "I have to explain myself." My stomach drops and my face gets hot, and then the chest clamps up and my head starts racing. I'm getting kind of on edge talking about this, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Just notice your stomach dropping and your face getting hot right before the thought "they're going to see I'm failing" shows up – what's physically happening in your body just before that thought starts racing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I don't know — maybe it's like a sudden drop or flutter in my stomach, my face gets hot and my heart starts pounding, and my hands feel a bit clammy. There's this split second of confusion like my mind blanks, and then the "you're failing" thoughts rush in. I'm feeling more on edge and distracted right now, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause right before the thought shows up – when your stomach drops, your face gets hot, and your hands feel clammy. Just notice that sensation in your body for a moment, without trying to change it or think about what's happening.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I can kind of feel the drop in my stomach and my face getting hot, my hands go clammy, and then my mind just blanks before those "you're failing" thoughts hit. When I try to just notice it, I don't know how to do that without spiraling—it's making me really on edge, so can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It's okay to feel like you're spiraling, because that's exactly what's happening when you're trying to notice the sensations without changing them. You're already taking a huge step by noticing your stomach drop, hot face, clammy hands, and the blanking of your mind - that's all you need to do right now. Let's just pause there.

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to pause but it just makes my chest tighter and my mind goes totally blank — I'm kind of confused about how pausing helps. My hands are clammy and I'm really on edge; can we slow down a lot? I guess — could you give me one concrete, tiny thing to do right now so I don't start spiraling?

Therapist: Here's something tiny you can do right now: notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just that. Don't try to think about anything else, just notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor.

Patient: I tried — I can feel the heels of my feet and a dull pressure, but my chest's tighter and my head won't stop racing, so it's hard to stay with it. I don't know if this is doing anything helpful; focusing just makes me more on edge. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now so I don't start spiraling.

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller: notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils right now. Just that. Don't try to think about anything else, just notice the feeling of the air moving in and out of your nose.

Patient: I tried — I can kind of feel cool air going in at the tip of my nose and it warms coming out, but my chest's tighter and my head's racing so it's hard to stay with it. I don't know if I'm doing it right; focusing just makes me more on edge. Can we slow down a lot? Maybe give me one tiny thing to do so I don't start spiraling.

Therapist: Just notice one thing: the sensation of your hand touching the table right now. Don't try to think about anything else, just notice the feeling of your hand touching the table.

Patient: I tried — I can feel my palm on the table, the grain under my fingers and a cool patch by my wrist, but it's kind of fuzzy. My chest's tighter and my hands are clammy and my mind's racing, so it's hard to stay with it. I don't know if this is helping — can we slow down a lot? Maybe give me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now so I don't start spiraling.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your mouth touching the roof of your mouth right now. Just that. Notice the feeling of your tongue touching your teeth.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of feel my tongue against the roof of my mouth and the tip touching my teeth, but focusing on it just makes my chest tighten more. It's making me jumpy and my head's racing — can we slow down a lot? Maybe something a little less intense for a minute.

Therapist: Let's just be with your body right now. Just notice that you're sitting. You're sitting in a chair, and your body is in a certain position. That's all you need to notice. No thinking, no focusing. Just being.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm sitting — my back against the chair and my feet on the floor — but my chest's still tight and my mind won't stop racing. It's really hard to just be without my thoughts dragging me away. Can we slow down a lot? Maybe talk about something a bit less intense for a minute.
