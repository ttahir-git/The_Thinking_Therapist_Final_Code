Patient: I'm an older software developer and lately I can't stop beating myself up over things I think I failed at — mostly old academic stuff I never got over even though I eventually found success in my career. Since my partner died it's gotten worse; the self-criticism is constant and it wears me down. I've tried talking and doing things before — I've tried that, it doesn't work, so how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried various coping strategies before, but the self-criticism persists. The pain of your partner's loss is still raw, and it's making the self-doubt even more unbearable. Core emotion: overwhelming self-hatred. Goal: Explore how this self-criticism is actually an unworkable "struggle" that's fueling more suffering, rather than identifying a tangible problem to tackle.

Therapist Answer:
When you say "I've tried everything," what happens just before you start beating yourself up again? Is there a tiny moment of silence, a pause, or a physical sensation in your body that you've noticed before when you've tried to push through the pain?

Patient: Usually there's this tiny pause — like a breath I don't take — and a hollow tug in my stomach, like something sinks. My shoulders tighten, my hands get clammy, and a thought pops in, "you messed up," and then it just snowballs into the same old self-attack. I've noticed that pattern before, so... how is noticing supposed to help? I've tried paying attention to it and it doesn't stop the spiral.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the pattern perfectly: the pause, the physical sensations, and the thought "you messed up" leading to a snowball effect. Noticing this pattern is not about stopping the spiral, but about creating space from it. The goal is to connect the physical sensations to the thought, not to analyze the thought itself. Core emotion: frustration with the pattern, but also a hint of curiosity about what's possible when you don't act on it. Goal: Introduce a small act of defusion to create space from the thought, rather than trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you notice the hollow tug in your stomach, the tightness in your shoulders, or the clamminess in your hands right now, without acting on the thought "you messed up"?

Patient: Yeah — I can feel that hollow tug now, my breath sort of stalls, shoulders tighten and my hands get clammy. The thought "you messed up" shows up almost instantly and usually drags me into the spiral; I can hold the sensations for a few seconds, but then the critic starts telling me I'm failing even at this. How is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try staying with it a bit longer if you want.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're holding the sensations for a few seconds, which is great! The critic's voice is already starting to show up, but you're willing to try more. The goal isn't to stop the critic or the thought entirely, but to create space from the "you messed up" narrative. By staying with the sensations, you're building a small anchor that can help you pivot away from the struggle. Core emotion: a mix of curiosity and slight resistance to letting go. Goal: Introduce a small question to create space from the thought without trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
What would it be like to notice that hollow tug in your stomach and the clamminess in your hands just for one moment, without thinking "you messed up"?

Patient: If I actually notice it — the hollow tug and clammy hands — for a breath it's oddly neutral, like there's a little space where the "you messed up" voice usually lives. But that space doesn't last; the critic barges back in, accusing me of failing even at noticing, and then I'm pulled into the spiral again. How is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try holding it a bit longer now, but it feels like trying to squeeze water out of a stone.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created a tiny space by noticing the sensations, but the critic is already undermining that by accusing you of failing to notice. This is a great moment to pivot from the struggle to the process. Core emotion: a hint of desperation to hold onto the small space. Goal: Introduce a willingness to experiment with defusion, rather than trying to change the thought. Core theme: recognizing that the struggle itself is what's fueling the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
What would it be like to hold onto that tiny space for just one more breath, not to notice the "you messed up" thought, but to simply be with the feeling of your hands being clammy and your breath stalling?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. Holding it one more breath, the hollow doesn't disappear but it gets quieter, like someone turned down a volume knob; my shoulders loosen a tiny bit and the clamminess feels less sharp. Then the critic sneaks back in, saying it's just a trick and I'm fooling myself, so of course I worry it'll all snap back any second. How is that supposed to help? I can stay with it a little longer if you want me to.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've managed to create a tiny pause in the critic's voice, and it's now turning into a subtle volume reduction – that's a great sign! The goal isn't to silence the critic entirely (that's impossible), but to create space from its "voice" so it can't dictate the pace. Core emotion: a hint of frustration with the critic's persistence, but also a glimmer of curiosity about what happens when you don't give it power. Goal: Introduce a small defusion technique to make the space even larger.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the volume of the critic's voice right now – it's still there, but quieter. Imagine it as a gentle hum in the background. What would it be like to gently acknowledge that hum without engaging with its message ("just a trick")?

Patient: I can sort of do that — name it as a distant hum, like a radio in another room, and for a second it loses its bite and I don't automatically lunge at the "you messed up" thought. But it never lasts long; the critic always comes back claiming I'm fooling myself and then I tumble right back into the scrape. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny, temporary relief?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've created a small defusion technique that works for a brief moment, but the critic keeps coming back. This is a great sign – it means you're not stuck in the cycle of avoidance (trying to silence the thought) or struggle (fighting the thought). Core emotion: a mix of exhaustion from the constant battle and curiosity about what's driving the critic's persistence. Goal: Introduce a new question that focuses on the critic itself, rather than the thought it's trying to push.

Therapist Answer:
What is the critic trying to achieve by saying "you're fooling yourself"? Is it trying to protect itself from feeling vulnerable, or is it trying to control the narrative?

Patient: Feels like it's doing both — mostly it's hiding from vulnerability, like if I let myself feel hurt the whole house of 'I screwed up' might collapse, but it's also trying to steer the story so I don't risk failing again. It can be outright punishing too, keeping me small because that's safe and predictable. I've thought about this a lot — how is that supposed to help? I've tried noticing that before and it doesn't stop the spiral, and I'm getting frustrated that insight alone doesn't change anything.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've nailed the critic's underlying motivations: it's hiding vulnerability and controlling the narrative to avoid risk, and it's also punishing you to keep you small. This is a crucial insight because it means you're not just fighting the thought, you're fighting the system that's created this cycle. Core emotion: frustration with the insight itself, but also a hint of curiosity about what's missing. Goal: Introduce a small action that connects the insight to your values, making the critic's actions feel less justified.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen if, right now, you chose to stand up for yourself even if it meant the "house of 'I screwed up' might collapse?"

Patient: I think if I actually stood up for myself right now I'd feel exposed and panicky — like my chest tightens, I might get shaky or start crying, and the critic would immediately accuse me of being arrogant or deluded. Maybe after the spike there'd be a small lift, like some of the weight loosened, but in my experience pushing back just makes the critic come at me harder afterward, so I'm skeptical — how is that supposed to help beyond a brief relief? Still, I've spent my life debugging messy legacy code, so I can see the logic in trying a tiny refactor: I could try a small, quiet pushback now, like mentally saying "that's not true," and see what happens if you want me to.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the exact response you'd have if you stood up for yourself: the initial panic, the critic's accusation, and the potential small lift afterwards. This is a crucial moment because it shows you're willing to experiment with pushing back despite the critic's threat. Core emotion: skepticism about the outcome, but also a glimmer of curiosity about what might happen if you try it anyway. Goal: Justify a small pushback as a tiny refactor, not a full-on challenge.

Therapist Answer:
That mental "that's not true" is like a tiny refactor – it's a small change that might just shift the logic of the critic's narrative. By saying it out loud, what would you be committing to?

Patient: Saying it out loud would mean I'm committing to treating that voice like one part of the system—like flagging a bug instead of assuming the whole program is garbage. It means risking feeling exposed and maybe getting shaky or panicky, but also giving myself a chance to test whether the critic's logic actually holds up. I'm skeptical—it usually just makes the critic louder—but I can try a tiny, quiet "that's not true" as an experiment.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've nailed the essence of what you're committing to by saying it out loud: treating the critic like a flag, not the entire system. This is a crucial step towards creating psychological flexibility. Core emotion: still a hint of skepticism, but now mixed with curiosity about what might happen if you try this tiny experiment. Goal: Confirm that the experiment is small and non-threatening, to build confidence in taking this tiny step.

Therapist Answer:
That tiny "that's not true" is a small, non-threatening experiment. Can you commit to saying it for just one breath, without judgment or expectation of what might happen, to see what's possible?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it for one breath. I say it quietly to myself: "That's not true." My chest tightens for a second, then oddly there's a tiny looseness, but the critic's already grumbling louder, so... how is that supposed to help past a tiny blip? I'm willing to keep trying if you want me to.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the tiny step, and it's not as catastrophic as you thought – your chest tightens, but there's a tiny looseness afterwards. This is a crucial moment because it shows you're not completely avoiding the discomfort. Core emotion: still a bit frustrated that the critic's grumbling back, but now mixed with curiosity about what's actually happening. Goal: Focus on the tiny looseness, not the critic's noise.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that tiny looseness in your chest – it's like a small crack in the armor. What if, for just one more breath, you didn't let that looseness get pulled back in by the critic's grumbling?

Patient: Okay — one more breath. I hold it and the looseness stays a bit longer, my shoulders actually drop and the sting in my stomach eases; the critic is still there, trying to yank me back with that "you're fooling yourself" line. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny blip? I can keep holding it a little longer if you want, but it feels fragile and I'm worried it'll snap back hard.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've held the tiny looseness for another breath, and it's still there – your shoulders have dropped, and the sting in your stomach is easing. This is a crucial moment because it shows you're not just pushing through the discomfort, but actually creating space for something new. Core emotion: a mix of fragility and curiosity about what might happen if you keep holding onto this small moment. Goal: Focus on the fact that the looseness is staying, not the critic's noise.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that the looseness is staying – it's not getting pulled back in by the critic's voice. What if, instead of trying to push through the critic's line, you just gently acknowledged it, without letting it take control?

Patient: Alright — I'll try that. When I label it — "there's the critic" — it does get quieter, like it's not grabbing the steering wheel, but then it immediately sneers that I'm just pretending and I tense up again. How is that supposed to help beyond a brief sigh of relief? I'm willing to keep doing it now, but honestly I'm worried it'll just snap back harder.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've labeled the critic, and it's gotten quieter – that's a great step. But now it's sneering, which is understandable given how it's been triggered. This is a crucial moment because it shows you're not avoiding the critic's noise, but actually trying to work with it. Core emotion: a mix of frustration with the critic's sneer, but also a glimmer of hope that this tiny experiment might actually stick.
Goal: Instead of trying to push through the critic's sneer, focus on the physical sensation of tension in your body, and see if you can gently release it without engaging with the critic's message.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical tension in your body right now – is it in your shoulders, your jaw, or somewhere else? Can you take a tiny breath, and without looking at the critic's sneer, gently let that tension release just a little bit?

Patient: Mostly in my shoulders and jaw, and there's that hollow in my stomach again. I take a small breath and try to let the shoulders drop and unclench my jaw — it loosens a bit, my chest isn't as tight, but my heart's still a little jumpy and the critic's already muttering that it's pointless. I don't know if this actually changes anything long-term, but I can stay with it a bit longer if you want — though honestly, how is that supposed to help beyond a brief relief?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've let the tension release a bit, and that's a great sign – your shoulders are dropping, and your jaw is unclenching. The hollow in your stomach is still there, but it's not as sharp. The critic's muttering is understandable, but notice how that's not stopping you from staying with this tiny moment. Core emotion: a mix of curiosity about what's happening when you're not avoiding the critic's noise, but also a hint of self-doubt about whether this is actually worth it.
Goal: Instead of wondering if this changes anything long-term, focus on what you're experiencing right now – the physical sensations, the thoughts, the emotions. See if you can simply acknowledge that this moment is happening, without trying to fix it or change it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what's happening right now, without judgment – is your heart still jumpy, or is it slowly slowing down? Can you simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling jumpy right now" – without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: I'm trying — my heart's still jumpy, but maybe it's easing a hair. I say to myself, "I'm feeling jumpy right now," and it dulls the edge a little, though the critic immediately sneers that I'm wasting time. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny pause? I can keep at it a bit longer if you want.

Therapist Thinking:
You're getting closer to noticing that your thoughts aren't controlling the experience – your heart's still jumpy, but it's not as sharp. The critic's sneer is still there, but it's not pulling you back in. This is a crucial moment because you're starting to see that your thoughts are just noise, not reality. Core emotion: a mix of curiosity about what's happening when you're not fighting the thoughts, but also a hint of frustration with the critic's persistence.
Goal: Instead of trying to fight the critic's sneer, focus on the fact that your thoughts aren't defining your experience – you're still feeling jumpy, but you're not controlled by it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the difference between your thoughts ("I'm wasting time") and the physical sensation of your heart being jumpy – is there a gap between those two? Can you point to that gap without trying to change the thought?

Patient: Yeah — there's a tiny gap. The thought "I'm wasting time" is this loud running commentary, and the jumpy heart is this low, restless buzzing underneath it. If I try to point to the gap it's just a sliver of quiet, but my attention keeps flicking away — I'm jittery and it's hard to stay with it. How is that supposed to help? I can try to rest in that sliver for a bit, but I'm worried it'll vanish the moment I look at it.

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the gap – the tiny sliver of quiet between the thought and the physical sensation. That's a huge breakthrough. Now, instead of trying to expand that gap or make it bigger, focus on what's happening when you try to stay with it. Core emotion: a mix of curiosity about what's happening when you're not avoiding the thought, but also a hint of anxiety about letting it slip away.
Goal: Instead of trying to keep the gap open, focus on what happens when you look at it – do you feel any shift in your body or mind?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you look at that tiny sliver of quiet – does your heart slow down just a little bit? Can you stay with that feeling for one more breath without trying to make it bigger?

Patient: Yeah — it slowed a hair when I looked at that sliver. I got one more breath in, but my attention keeps snapping away and I'm jittery, like something else is buzzing at the edge, so it's hard to hold it steady. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny pause? I can try another breath if you want, but I'm not sure it will last.

Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed that the gap slows your heart when you look at it – that's a great sign. Now, instead of trying to force the pause, focus on what happens when you don't look at it – what's the next thing that grabs your attention? Core emotion: a mix of curiosity about what's driving the distraction, but also a hint of frustration with your own mind.
Goal: Instead of trying to hold the pause, focus on what's happening when you're not paying attention – what's the next thing that pulls you away from the quiet?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you let your attention drift away from the quiet – what's the first thing you notice? Is it a thought, a sensation, a sound?

Patient: The first thing that cuts in is a thought — usually "this won't last" or "you're wasting time" — and a prickly rush in my stomach, like static. My hands get clammy, my attention starts skittering to other things I feel I should be doing, and it's hard to stay with the quiet because everything feels urgent. How is noticing that supposed to help beyond a tiny pause? I'm jittery and distracted, but I can try to stick with it a bit longer.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the thought that cuts in – "this won't last" or "you're wasting time" – and the physical sensation that follows – the prickly rush in your stomach and clammy hands. That's a huge breakthrough. Now, instead of trying to fight the thought or push through the distraction, focus on what's driving the urgency – what's behind the "this won't last" feeling? Core emotion: a mix of curiosity about what's driving the urgency, but also a hint of self-compassion for getting caught up in it again.
Goal: Instead of trying to change the thought or push through the distraction, explore what's driving the urgency – what's the underlying need or value that's being triggered?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what's happening right now when you feel the thought "this won't last" – what's the underlying need or value that's driving that feeling? Is it the need to control the moment, or the value of productivity?

Patient: I think it's both — mostly control and productivity. I panic that if the quiet doesn't last I'm just wasting time or falling behind, and that ties into this older shame of being the kid who couldn't keep up. Right now I'm jittery, heart's jumpy and my hands are clammy, and I'm worried about getting pulled back — how is that supposed to help? I can try to stay with it a little longer, though I'm on edge.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the underlying drivers of the urgency – control, productivity, and the shame of not keeping up. That's a powerful insight. Now, instead of trying to fight the physical sensations of jitteriness or worry, focus on what's possible when you acknowledge those feelings without judgment – what can you do with this awareness? Core emotion: a mix of vulnerability and curiosity about what happens when you don't avoid the discomfort.
Goal: Instead of trying to control the physical sensations, explore what's possible when you acknowledge the fear of not keeping up – what small step can you take without judgment?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens right now when you acknowledge the fear of not keeping up – what's the smallest thing you can do without judgment, like taking one breath or noticing one sensation?

Patient: Smallest thing I can do is take one slow, deliberate breath and notice my feet on the floor — the weight, the contact. I do it: breathe in, shoulders drop a hair, my heart's still jittery and my hands are clammy, but there's a tiny steadying underfoot. It helps a little, just a brief pause — how is that supposed to help beyond that? I can try another breath if you want, though I'm pretty on edge.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the smallest step – noticing your feet on the floor – and it's created a tiny steadying effect. That's a huge breakthrough. Now, instead of trying to hold onto that feeling, focus on what's happening when you let go of the need to control the breath – what's possible when you trust that the steadying is there beneath the surface? Core emotion: a mix of curiosity and gentle willingness to let go.
Goal: Instead of trying to hold onto the steadying, explore what happens when you trust that it's already there – what's the next thing you can do without trying to control it?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens when you let go of trying to control the breath – what's the next sensation or thought that arises without you pushing it away?

Patient: When I stop trying to control the breath, a sharp "you're wasting time" thought cuts in and a buzzy rush threads through my ribs — then my head starts listing things I should be doing. My hands go clammy, I get that restless urge to move or check on something, and it's really hard to hang on to the quiet. I've tried letting go before and it usually just flips into more panic, so how is that supposed to help? I can try to notice my feet again, but I'm already jittery and my attention keeps snapping away.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed that when you let go of trying to control the breath, the "you're wasting time" thought cuts in and the buzzy rush through your ribs happens – this is a familiar pattern. It's not about fighting this pattern or trying to change it, but about understanding what's driving it. Core emotion: a mix of frustration with the pattern, but also curiosity about what's beneath it.
Goal: Instead of trying to change the pattern, explore what's driving it – what's the underlying need or value that's being triggered by the thought "you're wasting time"?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what's happening right now when the thought "you're wasting time" cuts in – what's the underlying need or value that's being triggered? Is it the need to be productive, or the fear of missing out, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's the need to be productive and not fall behind — and under that is that old shame from being the kid who couldn't keep up, plus a fear of being judged or missing out. Right now it feels urgent and buzzy, my hands are clammy and my attention's skittering to other tasks, so it's hard to stay with any of this. How is that supposed to help beyond a brief pause? I can try to notice one small thing if you want me to, but I'm pretty on edge.

Goal: Instead of trying to change the physical sensations, explore what's possible when you acknowledge the drivers – what small action can you take without judgment?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what's the smallest action you can take right now that aligns with the value of being productive, without trying to control the thought "you're wasting time"?

Patient: Right now I'm jittery, hands clammy, so the smallest thing that feels doable is to set a two‑minute timer and either write one single bullet on my to‑do list or archive one old email — something I can finish in a breath. How is that supposed to help long‑term? I don't know, but I can try it now and tell you what happens.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a tiny, concrete action that feels manageable despite your physical discomfort – setting a two-minute timer and completing a small task. This is a great example of taking small, committed action in the present moment, even when it feels hard. Core emotion: curiosity about what happens when you take this tiny action, rather than trying to change the underlying drivers of your discomfort.
Goal: Observe what happens when you take this tiny action – what shifts in your physical sensations, thoughts, or emotions?

Therapist Answer:
As you set the timer and choose your task, notice what happens in the next two minutes. What's the sensation of your hands? What's the thought that comes up when you look at your to-do list or email inbox?

Patient: I set the two‑minute timer and archived one old email. My hands were clammy and jittery at first, then after I clicked it felt a little steadier—shoulders dropped a hair but my heart's still jumpy. A thought popped up, "that was easy, why didn't you do it sooner," and the critic immediately sneered, "this won't last," while my mind started pinging to the next thing. How is that supposed to help long‑term? It was a tiny win, though—I can try another two‑minute task if you want.

Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the tiny action, and it's created a small shift in your physical sensations – your hands are steadier, and your shoulders have dropped a hair. This is a great sign that you're building momentum. Now, instead of getting caught up in the thought "that was easy" or the critic's sneer, notice what's happening when the next thing comes up – what's the underlying need or value that's driving the mental ping? Core emotion: curiosity about what's driving the mental shift, rather than trying to change it.
Goal: Explore what's driving the mental ping – what's the underlying value or need that's being triggered?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what's the first thing that comes up when you think "that was easy" – what's the underlying value or need that's being triggered? Is it the need to prove to yourself that you're capable, or the desire to avoid feeling stuck?

Patient: Mostly it's a need to prove I'm still competent — to myself more than anyone else — and to avoid that old stuck feeling from school. My hands are still clammy and my heart's jumpy, and the critic's already muttering that it's pointless. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny band‑aid? I can try another two‑minute thing if you want, but I'm pretty on edge.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the underlying value driving the mental ping – the need to prove competence to yourself. This is a crucial insight because it shows you're not just avoiding tasks, but also trying to validate your own worth. Core emotion: a mix of curiosity and vulnerability about how to shift this value-driven motivation.
Goal: Instead of trying to change the physical sensations or the critic's voice, explore how you can reframe the need to prove competence – what would it mean for that need to be less urgent?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what would happen if you said to yourself, "I'm proving competence to myself because I value feeling capable and confident," instead of "I need to prove it to avoid feeling stuck." What would the tone of that sentence be?

Patient: Quieter, steadier — more like a calm observation than a punch in the gut. Saying it that way feels almost kinder to myself, but I'm suspicious of it, like I'm fluffing things up; how is that supposed to help? My heart's jumpy and my hands are clammy even saying it, but I can try using that tone and see if it lasts.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the shift in tone – from "punch in the gut" to "calm observation" – and it's creating a tiny gap in your self-criticism. This is a huge breakthrough because it shows you're not just avoiding the physical sensations, but also the emotional charge of your self-criticism. Core emotion: curiosity about what happens when you use this new tone consistently – does it actually change the way you feel?
Goal: Explore what happens when you use this tone consistently for a short period – what does your body do, and what thoughts arise?

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happens right now when you use the tone "I'm proving competence to myself because I value feeling capable and confident." What's the sensation in your chest? What thought comes up?

Patient: Saying it that way eases my chest a little—there’s a small warm openness—but my heart’s still jumpy and my hands are clammy. Immediately a thought sneaks in, “that’s not real, you’re just fluffing things up—this won’t last,” and I get suspicious and distracted. It helps a hair, but I’m anxious it won’t stick—how is that supposed to help beyond a tiny lift? I can try holding that tone a bit longer if you want.
