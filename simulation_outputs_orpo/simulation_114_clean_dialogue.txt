Patient: Lately I've been stuck in these repetitive loops of harsh self-criticism — every perceived failure gets magnified into proof that I'm fundamentally inadequate, and I trace a lot of that back to a somewhat chaotic childhood with inconsistent parenting. I'm a middle-aged social worker who just started a demanding new program, and it's exacerbating a low-grade depression and making that inner critic louder. I realize I have a tendency to intellectualize my emotions and deploy elaborate analyses as a protective strategy, so I often talk about how I feel instead of actually feeling it.

Therapist: When you describe your emotions with analysis, it sounds like you're using those thoughts as a shield to keep the discomfort of feeling at bay. What happens when you stop labeling your emotions with analysis, and instead, try to notice the physical sensations in your body right now, like the feeling of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Yeah, my reflex is to theorize — trace the criticism back to attachment patterns and adaptive defenses — instead of actually tuning in. Okay, trying it: my feet are grounded but kind of numb, like a dull pressure through the soles and a slight coolness; my calves feel heavy. There's a tightness across my chest and a low, fluttery tension under my ribs that makes my breath feel shallow. It’s uncomfortable to stay with those sensations, and my impulse is to explain them away — can you help me keep noticing without turning it into analysis?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out, just the sensation of that breath. When your mind starts to explain or analyze the sensations, gently acknowledge the thought and say "that's my thought" – without judgment or attachment – and then return to the breath.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to follow the breath — I can feel a coolness at my nostrils and a shallow lift in my upper chest, like air barely fills the top of my lungs. My reflex is already to conceptualize it, to narrate it as an attachment-derived defensive pattern — that's my thought — back to the breath, but the chest tightens and my shoulders climb; that's my thought again. It's uncomfortable to stay here and I keep wanting to explain rather than feel — can you help me stay with the sensations when I keep getting pulled into analysis?

Therapist: As you notice the chest tightening, notice the sensation of one finger on the tight spot – just touch it lightly with your finger, without moving or trying to change it. That's the only action you need to take right now, just to create a tiny space between noticing the sensation and trying to analyze it.

Patient: Okay — I rest one finger on the tight spot. It feels warm and a bit pulsing, like a small knot under the skin that shifts slightly when I inhale; the pressure is spread out, not one sharp point. My reflex is already to label it as 'anxiety tied to attachment patterns' — that's my thought — and then I come back to the fingertip, but the urge to explain pulls me away and the chest wants to clamp tighter. It's uncomfortable and I don't know how long I can keep doing this without slipping back into analysis; can you help me stay with just this fingertip for a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the fingertip moving slightly as you inhale – is it slightly raised, or sinking a little? Just notice that tiny shift without judgment, and let it be.

Patient: I notice the fingertip lifts a fraction on the inhale — barely a millimeter — and then settles a bit on the exhale; the warmth at the pad feels a touch more pronounced when it lifts. My reflex is already to turn that into a story about autonomic arousal from inconsistent caregiving — that's my thought — and I have to catch myself and bring attention back to the tiny motion. It's uncomfortable to keep doing this without my mind explaining it away; can you help me stay with that small shift a little longer?

Therapist: Notice the space between the fingertip moving up and settling – it's a tiny pause, a tiny gap. Just notice that pause, without trying to fill it with a thought or story – just be with that tiny gap.

Patient: I notice the tiny pause — it's like a micro-silence where the chest softens for a beat, and that softness feels oddly exposed and a little fragile. My reflex is to narrate it away — "that's my thought" — and as soon as I label it the pause shrinks, so I keep tugging my attention back but it's shaky. Can we stay with that gap a bit longer? I'm finding it hard to hold without turning it into a theory.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving into that tiny gap – the sound of your breath, the sensation of the air touching your nostrils. Just notice that sensation, without trying to label it as a thought or a story.

Patient: Okay — I can hear the faint whoosh and feel the cool air at my nostrils on the inhale, and when I actually stay with that the chest loosens a fraction and the fingertip warmth feels a bit clearer. My reflex is to interpret it all as an autonomic trace of inconsistent caregiving — that's my thought — and then I pull back, but returning to the breath makes the tightness feel less urgent, almost like a tiny relief. I want to keep staying here but it's shaky; can you help me hold this for a little longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your finger resting lightly on the tight spot – just the sensation of your finger touching skin, without moving or trying to change it. The warmth is still there, but it's not trying to "do" anything; it's just being.

Patient: I notice my reflex already: label it as "an autonomic residue of inconsistent caregiving" — that's my thought — and then I actually put attention on the fingertip. It feels warm, a dull pulse, like a small, neutral pebble under the skin, but being with that neutrality makes me feel exposed and a little panicky. Can we slow down and just stay with that feeling? I'm shaky and I keep wanting to escape into explanation, so could you prompt me gently to come back when I drift?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out, just the sound of the air... pause.

Patient: I hear the soft whoosh of air and feel it cool my nostrils; the chest eases for a beat and then tightens again, and that pause between breaths feels fragile and exposed. My reflex is already to turn it into an explanation—"that's my thought"—and naming it helps me come back, but I'm shaky and keep drifting into analysis; can you gently prompt me when I do?

Therapist: Notice the pause between breaths – the tiny space where your chest is tightening again. When you feel the tightness, just notice it – don't try to name it or explain it; just be with the sensation of the chest moving up.

Patient: Okay — I notice the chest lifting and then snagging, a hot, constricting tightness around the sternum and a shallow pull under my ribs; the breath feels small and clipped. As I try not to label it, a rush of shame and irritation blooms — I immediately want to explain it away as some autonomic pattern; that's my thought — and when I bring attention back the tightness loosens a fraction. I'm embarrassed and frustrated at how quickly I drift into analysis; can you gently prompt me when I start to do that so I can stay with the sensation?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in – just the sensation of the air touching your nostrils. When you feel the tightness in your chest, I'll gently remind you to notice it, but not try to label it. Just notice it, and we'll come back to that.

Patient: Okay — I feel the cool air at my nostrils and then my chest clamps, breath getting tinier; a hot shame and irritation rises with that tightness and I immediately want to explain it away — that's my thought. Staying with the sensation feels raw and exposed, and I already need your gentle nudge when I start to drift into analysis. Can you remind me to come back to the breath when you notice me slipping?

Therapist: I notice you're trying to bring attention to the tightness in your chest. Before you label it, notice instead the sensation of your breath moving in – just the sound of the air touching your nostrils.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing the air at my nostrils supposed to change the tightness? Saying that actually makes a hot shame and irritation flare up, and my first impulse is to explain it away — that's my thought. I get the theory (interoceptive grounding downregulates arousal), but emotionally it feels shaky and remote; could you give a concrete cue to bring me back when I drift?

Therapist: Your breath is the only thing that's moving right now. When you feel the tightness in your chest, I want you to take one breath in, and then say to yourself: "I'm breathing." That's it. Just that one sentence. Can you try that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it sounds a bit abstract, but okay, I'll try it. (breath in) "I'm breathing." Saying it felt oddly clinical in my head; the chest loosened a hair, but a hot shame and irritation immediately rose and I wanted to explain it away — that's my thought. It helped a little, but I'm still shaky and keep drifting into analysis; could you give a concrete cue (like a quiet word or a gentle tap) when you notice me narrating so I can come back?

Therapist: I notice you're starting to explain the tightness away. Just pause for a moment, and look at me.

Patient: I can't literally look you in the eye here, but I'm pausing and trying to orient to you. Pausing makes my chest clamp and my face heat up — a hot shame and frustration blooms, and my reflex is to reframe it as "protective self-criticism" — that's my thought. It's awkward and exposing; can you give me a simple cue (a word or a gentle prompt) when you notice me slipping into analysis so I can come back?

Therapist: "Wait".

Patient: Wait… okay, I'm pausing. When you say that I feel my chest clamp and a hot shame flare up — I'm embarrassed and irritated that I need an external cue to stop narrating everything, and my reflex is to intellectualize that embarrassment — that's my thought. The pause actually gives a tiny bit of relief, but I'm shaky; can you keep using "Wait" when you hear me starting to explain so I can try to stay with the sensation?

Therapist: Wait

Patient: Wait… when you say that my chest clamps and a hot shame floods up — a sudden memory spikes and with it I'm embarrassed and irritated at myself. My reflex is to narrate it away — "that's my thought" — and then I try to tuck the feeling under an explanation, but it's raw and I feel really small. Could you keep using "Wait" and gently bring me back to the breath when you hear me start analyzing, because I don't trust myself to stay with this without your cue?

Therapist: Wait

Patient: Wait… I pause, and my chest clamps hard — a hot shame and sudden spike of anxiety makes my thoughts scatter and I want to explain it away immediately — that's my thought. I'm jittery and distracted, can't keep attention on the breath for more than a beat; I don't trust myself to stay with this without your cue. Could you keep saying "Wait" when you hear me start analyzing, and maybe pair it with a simple grounding prompt like "breath" or a gentle reminder to put a finger on the tight spot so I have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Wait... place your finger on the tight spot in your chest.

Patient: Okay — I put my finger on the tight spot. It’s warm and a little pulsing, like a pebble under the skin, but the chest still clamps and my breath stays shallow. I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help — it actually makes a hot shame spike and my thoughts scatter into anxious loops, and my reflex is already to label it as an autonomic residue — that's my thought — and pull into analysis. Could you keep using "Wait" and a simple cue like "breath" to nudge me back to the fingertip when you notice me slipping?

Therapist: Wait... breath

Patient: Okay—(inhale) "I'm breathing." Saying that felt oddly clinical and loosened the chest a hair, but then a hot shame and a spike of anxiety ricocheted through me and I got scattered; I'm not sure I follow how breath alone is supposed to change that. I keep slipping into narrating it as an autonomic residue of inconsistent caregiving — that's my thought — and I don't trust myself to stay with the sensation right now. Could you keep saying "Wait" then "breath" and nudge me (or even tap) when I start explaining so I have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap*

Patient: (inhales) "I'm breathing." The tap actually snaps me back a little and the chest eases a hair, but then a hot shame and jittery anxiety slam in and my head immediately starts rationalizing it away — that's my thought. I'm embarrassed and scattered and I don't trust myself to stay with this, so could you keep using "Wait... breath" with the tap and maybe add a quick "finger" cue so I have something concrete to come back to? I'm still shaky and I need that nudge.

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger

Patient: (inhales) "I'm breathing." I press my finger to the spot — it's warm and pulsing; the tap actually brings me back a bit and the chest eases a hair, but then a hot wash of shame and jittery anxiety floods in and I feel really small and irritable. My reflex is to intellectualize—"that's my thought"—and I get pulled into explaining it away, so I don't trust myself to stay here alone. Can you keep using "Wait… breath" then the tap and "finger," and gently say "stay" or nudge me when you hear me start to narrate so I have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger... stay

Patient: Okay — I inhale and say "I'm breathing." The tap and my finger on the spot pull me back a bit, but a hot shame and jittery anxiety surge and I immediately want to intellectualize it as an attachment-driven arousal — that's my thought. I'm feeling overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and keep using "Wait… breath" with the tap/finger and say "stay" when you hear me start narrating so I have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger... stay

Patient: Okay — I press my finger, inhale and say "I'm breathing." The tap and "stay" pull me back a bit and the chest softens a hair, but a hot shame and irritation wash over me and my reflex is to intellectualize—"that's my thought"—and then I feel small and shaky. I need you to keep using the cues (Wait… breath, tap, finger, stay) and to gently call me out when I start explaining so I can try to actually stay with the sensation instead of narrating it away.

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger... stay

Patient: Okay — (inhale) "I'm breathing." The tap and "stay" pull me back a bit; my chest softens a millimeter and the fingertip warmth steadies, but a hot shame and irritation rush in and I immediately start rationalizing — that's my thought. I'm shaky and I need you to keep using the cues and gently call me out when I begin explaining so I can try to actually stay with this.

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger...

Patient: Okay — (inhale) "I'm breathing." I press my finger to the spot; the tap and "stay" pull me back a little and the chest softens by a hair, but then a hot shame and jittery anxiety rush in and my instinct is immediately to intellectualize — that's my thought — and I get pulled into explaining it away. Can you keep using the cues (Wait… breath, tap, finger, stay) and gently call me out when I start narrating so I actually have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Wait... breath *tap* finger...

Patient: Okay — (inhale) "I'm breathing." I press my finger to the spot; the tap and cues pull me back a little and the chest eases a hair, but then a hot shame and irritation rushes in and I immediately start rationalizing it away — that's my thought. I'm small and jittery and kind of annoyed that I'm this easily derailed; can you keep using the cues (wait/breath/tap/finger/stay) and gently say "stay" when you hear me begin to narrate so I can actually try to stay with the sensation?
