Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this cycle where I tear myself down over every little screw-up — it's wearing me out, especially after the breakup and with burnout at work. I keep getting pulled back to stuff from school where I got bullied, and it messes with my confidence around people. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about this supposed to change anything? I've tried stuff before and it didn't work.

Therapist: Those moments of tearing yourself down after every small mistake are like a weight holding you back at work and making it hard to connect with others, aren't they? What's one thing you wish you could do differently when that voice starts up, just to make those moments a little more manageable?

Patient: I'd want to be able to hit pause on that voice — maybe take a breath, step outside for a minute, or tell myself one realistic thing like "this was one mistake, not who I am." But honestly, I've tried breathing and those little mantras and they feel empty, like slapping a bandage on something that keeps bleeding. How is that supposed to actually change how I feel in the moment? I'm skeptical it won't.

Therapist: Those bandages might not be enough when you're trying to stop the bleeding. What if, instead of trying to stop the voice entirely, you started noticing it as just a voice? Can you experiment with seeing that critical self-talk as a physical sensation in your body, like a tightness or a buzzing, rather than believing the words themselves?

Patient: Yeah — when that voice shows up I get this tightness in my chest and a buzzing in my throat, like my stomach drops. I can try to treat it as just a sensation instead of the whole truth, but honestly I’ve named it before and it barely slows the spiral, especially during a service rush or when I’m trying to talk to someone new. If we’re doing this, show me what comes next — how does noticing actually change what I do in the moment?

Therapist: When that tightness in your chest and buzzing in your throat start up, notice the sensation in your body for just one breath – no trying to push it away or name it as "self-doubt." Then, without changing anything else, what's one small thing you could do with that breath – like taking a deep inhale, or letting your hand rest on your leg?

Patient: I guess I'd take that one slow breath and then press my palms flat on the stainless counter and say one simple, factual line out loud like "that was one mistake." If I can step outside for 30 seconds I will, but more often I need something I can do in the line — that palm-on-counter thing helps me finish the plate. Honestly, I've tried similar stuff before and it usually doesn't stop the spiral — how is that supposed to make the voice quieter over time?

Therapist: When you press your palms flat on the counter and say "that was one mistake" out loud, what's one thing you notice about the tone of that phrase – is it firmer, softer, more hesitant, or something else?

Patient: It usually comes out hesitant and kind of flat, like I'm trying to convince myself. Sometimes I can push it to sound firmer, but that feels forced and fake. Honestly, how is changing the tone supposed to make the spiral stop when everything else is screaming at me?

Therapist: When you press your palms flat on the counter and say "that was one mistake" out loud, what's one thing you could do with that phrase that feels connected to serving the customer or doing your job well – like taking a moment to adjust the plate or wiping down the counter?

Patient: I could try saying it a bit firmer, then use that palm-on-counter to steady myself and actually do something with the plate — straighten the garnish, give the rim a quick wipe, and send it. That way the phrase connects to a real task so it doesn't feel like empty talk. Honestly, in a full-on rush that still might not stop the spiral, but I'll try it next shift and see if it grounds me even a little.

Therapist: That sounds like a great approach – using the phrase as a small anchor to connect to your work. Just one thing to keep in mind: when you're in that rush moment, don't worry if it doesn't stop the spiral completely – it's just about taking a tiny step forward, like steadying yourself on that counter.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the palm thing and saying it firmer on my next shift. But honestly, I'm skeptical: if it just buys me five seconds before the spiral comes back, what then? I'm tired of little tricks that don't stick — that old school bullying voice feels deeper than a technique. If that doesn't work, what do I do in the moment or right after service so the self-criticism doesn't keep snowballing?

Therapist: Even if the palm thing buys you five seconds, what's one small thing you could do immediately after that shift to help prevent the spiral from growing – like writing down one thing that went well, or taking a few deep breaths before checking your phone?

Patient: Alright — I'll try writing one quick, specific win in my phone right after service, like "kept the duck on time" or "handled the rush without freaking." But I've done that before and it doesn't always stick — how is that supposed to actually stop the spiral when my brain's already replaying every mistake?

Therapist: When you write down that win, what's one thing you could do with that thought – like treating it like a small piece of paper you can fold up and tuck away, so it doesn't get lost in the replaying of mistakes?

Patient: I guess I could actually put the win somewhere real — a "wins" note in my phone or a photo in a folder I force myself to open before bed. But saying that makes me feel kind of ridiculous because this one awful moment keeps popping up and making me feel small, so I'm skeptical that'll stop the replay. I'll try the folder after my next shift, but if that doesn't help, what else can I do in the moment so it doesn't just snowball?

Therapist: When that awful moment pops up, what if you tried to notice it as just a thought – without judgment or trying to push it away, but simply observing it as a thought in your body, like a cloud passing by?

Patient: I try doing that — telling myself it's just a thought — but it lands in my chest like a hot fist and doesn't drift away. How is watching it like a cloud supposed to change that burning shame? I can try to notice it for one breath and then do the palm-on-counter thing, but honestly if it still keeps replaying like it always does, I need something else I can do in the moment that actually cuts the loop.

Therapist: When that burning shame shows up in your chest, what's one small physical sensation you can notice right where it is – like the warmth, the tightness, the feeling of your breath catching – without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: There’s this hot, tight knot under my ribs and my breath just gets shallow — my throat feels heavy and my hands go a bit clammy. I can try to name that feeling for one breath, but honestly…how is noticing that supposed to stop the shame from dragging me back into the same loop? It just makes me feel small and stuck.

Therapist: Right where that knot is, what's one tiny thing you could do to anchor yourself in this moment, like taking one tiny breath into your body, or letting your hand rest on your leg – not trying to change anything, just noticing the sensation of your hand touching your leg?

Patient: Okay — I can rest my hand on my thigh and take one tiny breath into that hot, tight knot, just feeling the weight of my palm there. It feels kind of pointless and I'm already bracing for it to keep coming back, so… how is that actually supposed to stop the replay when it hits?

Therapist: Even though you're bracing for it, when that knot comes back, what if you didn't try to push it away or fight it – but instead, simply noticed that tiny hand on your thigh, and took one more breath into the sensation of the weight of your palm?

Patient: I can do that — rest my hand there and take that one breath — and it takes the edge off for a second. But then the knot tightens again and I just feel small and stupid, like it didn't stick — especially during service when everything's loud and fast. If that pause only buys a beat, what do I actually do next when the shame's already spiraling?

Therapist: When the knot tightens again, and the shame starts to spiral, what's one tiny thing you could do to keep serving the customer, even if it's just a tiny gesture – like smiling at the customer, or adjusting the plate without being asked?

Patient: I could force a small smile and steady the plate — wipe the rim, tuck the garnish, something tiny that keeps the service moving. But that stupid shame still slides in and makes me feel useless, like none of it matters. Honestly, how is faking a grin for a second supposed to stop the loop from blowing up after the shift?

Therapist: When you're done with the shift, and you're leaving, what's one tiny thing you could do to mark the transition from "service mode" to "self-care mode" – like putting your uniform in the hamper, or locking up the station, or taking one step outside – without trying to shake off the shame, but simply noticing that you're leaving the chaos behind?

Patient: I could shrug off my apron, lock up the station, step outside and take one slow breath — maybe snap a quick photo of one small win on my phone before I change. It feels pointless and I can already hear that voice saying it won't matter, but I guess I can try it and see if it keeps the replay from kicking off right away.

Therapist: That's the thing – it's not about making it work, it's about taking the tiny step into a new story. When you take that photo, what if you don't try to analyze it or judge it – but simply notice the sensation of your fingers moving, or the sound of the camera shutter, or the feeling of the phone in your hand?

Patient: Alright — I'll try taking the photo and just noticing the click and the weight of the phone in my hand. It already feels a bit silly, like manicure for something that keeps bleeding out, but I can give it a shot tonight. If I still get flooded after that, what do I actually do next — how is that supposed to stop the shame from eating the rest of the night?

Therapist: If the shame comes flooding back, what's one tiny thing you could do to acknowledge it – like noticing the physical sensation of the shame in your body, or acknowledging the thought as just a thought – without trying to push it away or judge it?

Patient: I guess I could put my hand over that hot knot, take one slow breath into it and quietly say to myself, "this is just a thought," then open the wins folder and type one blunt line like "duck on time." But it still feels like a bandage on something way deeper — how is whispering to myself supposed to stop the shame from replaying all night? I'm already bracing for it to come back and it makes me feel small.

Therapist: Instead of trying to silence the shame with a thought or action, what if you were to ask yourself: What would I say to a friend who was struggling with this same thought? Would you try to fix it, or would you offer kindness and understanding?

Patient: I'd probably tell a friend to cut themselves some slack — say "you did what you could" and point out one concrete thing they did well, maybe even offer to get a drink and take their mind off it. But when I try that on myself it comes out thin and fake, like I'm lying to myself, and the shame just sits heavier — it feels embarrassing and small. So yeah, I'd offer kindness to someone else, but how do I actually start believing that kind of thing for me instead of just mouthing it?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to make the kindness work for you, you simply noticed that you would offer kindness to yourself if you were a friend – no expectations, no judgment, just the act of kindness itself?

Patient: I can notice that — like, I can see I'd tell a friend to cut themselves some slack. Maybe I could try the act anyway: say one gentle line to myself or make a tiny kindness like grabbing a cold drink and sitting down for two minutes. But honestly, it already feels performative and thin — how is just noticing or doing a small thing supposed to make the shame actually loosen its grip? I'm willing to try it, but I'm bracing for it to feel fake.

Therapist: What's the tiny thread of hope or connection that's driving you to try this kindness – is it relief from the weight of shame, a glimmer of self-compassion, or something else?

Patient: I guess the thread is a hope for some relief from that heavy shame — like maybe if I can stack up tiny, real proofs (a photo, a quick win) I can show myself I'm not always failing. But I'm pissed and embarrassed that one memory keeps dragging me down, and I worry any kindness will just feel fake — still, I'm willing to try it because I'm tired of that voice running the show.

Therapist: Instead of focusing on the photo or the win, what if you simply noticed the physical sensation of sitting down with the drink – the weight of the cup, the sound of the ice, the feeling of the cold liquid on your tongue?

Patient: Okay…I'll try that — notice the weight of the cup, the clink of ice, the cold on my tongue. But when that memory spikes and the shame clams up my chest, how is paying attention to a sip supposed to make the replay stop? I'll try it after my next shift, but I'm braced for it to feel like another flimsy trick.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the replay, you simply allowed the shame to show up – without judgment or trying to push it away – and then gently returned to noticing the physical sensations of the drink, like the weight of the cup or the sound of the ice?

Patient: I can try letting the shame be there and then bringing my attention back to the cup — the weight, the clink of ice, the cold on my tongue. Saying that already makes the knot tighten, like I'm just giving the shame more room to sit there. I'll try it, but really — how is noticing the ice supposed to actually loosen that knot when it spikes later? If it still floods me, what do I do next so it doesn't ruin the rest of the night?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to loosen the knot with the sensations, you simply noticed that the knot has tightened – no judgment, no trying to change it – and then took one small physical action, like taking another sip, or gently tilting your head to the side?

Patient: Okay… I can try that — notice the knot tightening and then take a slow sip or tilt my head, just enough to feel something real. But honestly, when that shame hits it still feels pathetic and tiny; how is sipping or tilting supposed to stop the replay? If that doesn't pull me out, what do I actually do next so it doesn't swallow the rest of the night?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to make the shame go away, you simply allowed it to be there – in all its awkward, painful glory – and then looked for one tiny, honest thought about what you're actually feeling, like "This is really hard" or "I'm scared"?

Patient: "Yeah…this is really hard." Under that I feel small and stupid, like my chest clamps up and everything shrinks. I can try to let it sit and notice that thought, but honestly — how is just noticing supposed to stop it from taking over and replaying all night?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "stop" the thought from taking over, you looked for one tiny connection between that thought and what's truly important to you – like "I care about showing up for myself" or "I want to be kind to myself"?

Patient: I guess the tiny connection is that I care about showing up — for myself, for my team, for the people counting on me — and I want to be kinder to myself instead of letting that old bully voice run the show. Saying that gives a little, tiny shift in my chest like maybe it matters, but mostly it still feels like words. How is naming that supposed to actually stop the replay when the memory spikes and the shame grabs me?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "stop" the shame, you simply used the words "I care about showing up" as a physical anchor – not to push away the shame, but to gently remind yourself to breathe, like taking one slow breath in through your nose, or placing one hand on your heart – when the memory spikes and the shame grabs you?

Patient: I can try that — place my hand on my heart, inhale slowly while saying “I care about showing up.” But honestly, I've said stuff like that before and it feels like sticking tape on a hole — how is that supposed to stop the replay when the knot's already burning and I'm mid-spiral? I'm worn out from little tricks that don't stick, so if that doesn't help in the moment, what do I actually do next?
