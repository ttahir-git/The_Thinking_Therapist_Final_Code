Patient: Lately, with the empty-nest and work burnout, I’ve been avoiding gatherings because I get intense anxiety in social settings. As soon as I even think about a friend’s dinner I picture myself saying something awful, everyone judging me, the friendship blowing up, and me ending up totally alone—my brain’s like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster.

Therapist: When you think about a friend's dinner, what's one specific, vivid image or thought that pops up right away – like that fortune-telling machine predicting disaster?

Patient: I instantly see myself walking in, tripping, and knocking a glass of red wine all over my friend's new dress — everyone freezing and staring while she accuses me of ruining everything. Then of course she rips off her mask, starts telling everyone what a mess I am, people stop inviting me, my friendships implode, and I end up totally cut off and furious at myself.

Therapist: Notice how that vivid story about ruining the dinner is actually making you feel anxious before you even step foot in the room – it's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable. What would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed that image to be exactly what it is: a thought, not a truth about who you are?

Patient: I try that, but the instant I tell myself it's "just a thought," my brain yells that that's exactly when I let my guard down and the disaster happens. Then I trip, spill the wine, she lashes out, people take her side, and I'm blocked from every group chat — it feels inevitable, not just a thought. I get that you're suggesting another perspective, but I can't make that feel realistic right now.

Therapist: Let's take a small step: right now, while you're sitting in this moment, what's one tiny thing you can do without trying to stop the thought (or the "disaster") from happening?

Patient: I can put both feet flat on the floor and take three slow, steady breaths right now. But honestly my brain's already screaming that's exactly when I'll let my guard down and the disaster will happen — so it feels like a useless little trick.

Therapist: Notice how that tiny act of grounding – putting feet on floor, taking breaths – didn't actually change the thought's story, but it created a tiny space between the thought and the action. What would happen if, for just a second, you let that space stay open?

Patient: If I let that space stay open even a second, my guard drops and the whole disaster accelerates — I trip, spill the wine, she lashes out, people take her side, and I'm shut out. I know you're asking me to try, but I can't make that feel realistic right now and it's making me kind of panicked — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on what's already happening right now, without trying to control the thought or the outcome. Can you name one physical sensation you're experiencing in your body, something that's happening without the thought's story?

Patient: My chest feels tight, like someone's squeezing it, my heart's racing, and my stomach's all queasy — heavy butterflies. I'm already getting more worked up just naming it, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice how naming those physical sensations – "my chest feels tight" – actually slowed you down just a bit. What if, instead of trying to make them "go away", you simply observe them as they are, without judgment?

Patient: If I just observe without trying to stop it, my brain yells that's when I let my guard down and the whole thing happens—tripping, the wine, everyone turning on me. Right now my chest's tight, breaths are shallow, my hands are clammy and there's this sick knot in my stomach. I'm getting more panicked even saying it, so can we slow down? I'm not ready to pretend that won't happen.

Therapist: Notice how your chest tightness, shallow breaths, clammy hands, and stomach knot are all happening NOW – in this exact moment. What would happen if, instead of trying to prevent the thought, you simply acknowledged these sensations as they are?

Patient: If I just acknowledge them, my brain screams that's when my guard drops and the whole chain starts — chest's tight, breaths are shallow, hands clammy, stomach in knots — and I can already see myself tripping, spilling the wine, everyone judging me, friendships collapsing. I get that you're asking me to observe, but saying that out loud just makes me more panicked, not less. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Look at your hands right now. They're clammy. What color are they?

Patient: They’re kind of pale, almost gray-ish, slick with sweat. And of course my brain’s already yelling that if someone sees that they’ll know I’m freaking out, everyone’ll judge me, and the night will fall apart.

Therapist: Notice how pale your hands are. What's one tiny, tiny thing you can do with them right now, without trying to change how they look or what they might mean?

Patient: I can slowly rub my thumb in my palm, like a tiny anchor. But already my head's chanting that if I do that someone will notice, they'll think I'm weird, whisper, my friend will snap at me, and the whole night will implode — I know it sounds ridiculous, but I can't stop seeing that, and it's exhausting to even try.

Therapist: When you rub your thumb in your palm, what happens in the exact moment right after you do it?

Patient: For a beat my breathing eases a little and my palm feels faintly warmer, like something actually landed. Then my brain immediately screams that's when someone will spot me, call me out, she'll snap, people will take her side, and I'm left cut off — so even that tiny anchor feels useless and draining.

Therapist: Notice how your breathing eases a little when you rub your thumb in your palm. What does that tiny shift in your body feel like to you, in this moment, without trying to label it as "good" or "bad"?

Patient: Like a tiny loosening in my chest — a faint warmth under my palm and my breath just... settles for a second. Then my brain immediately screams that's the exact moment everything starts — the wine, the yelling, people turning on me — and noticing even that little shift feels heavy and pointless.

Therapist: Just for a moment, let's say you notice that tiny loosening in your chest again. What's the sensation like to you, without trying to add meaning to it?

Patient: It's a tiny hollow, like air leaking out and my breath just eases for a second. But the instant I notice it my brain screams that's when everything starts — I trip, the wine spills, she blows up, everyone turns on me. Saying that even quietly makes me more panicked and kind of worn out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Look at your feet. Are they still on the ground?

Patient: Yeah — both feet flat, heels planted. It helps a tiny bit, but my brain's already certain that the moment I shift I'll trip at the dinner, spill the wine, and everyone will turn on me, and honestly this is wearing me out — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you simply be with that sensation, without trying to use it to "stop" the thought or "make" something happen?

Patient: They feel heavy and flat, like a dull steady pressure through my heels into the floor — I can kind of feel the carpet under my toes. For a beat my breath eases, but then my brain yells that's when I let my guard down and the whole chain starts — I trip, the wine goes everywhere, she lashes out, people take her side and I'm left cut off. I'm getting jumpy and worn out just saying that, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you simply... pause. Not to think about the dinner, not to worry about the thought... just pause.

Patient: I try to pause—my feet feel heavy and for a split second there's a quiet—but my brain immediately screams that's exactly when I trip, the wine spills, she blows up, and everyone cuts me out. It's making me shaky and kind of wiped out, so... can we slow down? I'm not ready to let that go yet.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. What's the sensation of your feet right now, without trying to add meaning to it?

Patient: They feel heavy and flat, heels pressing into the floor with a faint warmth under my toes—just a dull, steady pressure that briefly quiets my breath. But as soon as I notice that quiet, my brain yells that's exactly when I drop my guard, I'll shift, trip, spill the wine, she'll explode, everyone will turn on me — I can't make any other outcome feel real, and it's starting to wear me out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the faint warmth under your toes. Can you simply notice it, without trying to say it's "hot", "cold", or "good" or "bad"?

Patient: It's a faint, spreading warmth under my toes, like a thin thread holding me for a second. But the second I notice it my brain screams that's when I drop my guard and the whole disaster — I trip, the wine spills, she blows up, everyone turns on me — and just saying that wears me out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your toes warming up. Can you simply notice the sensation of warmth spreading, without trying to say it's "getting hotter" or "it's not hot enough"?

Patient: It's a thin warmth creeping under my toes, oddly steady for a second. But my brain instantly yells that's when I drop my guard—I'll shift, trip, spill the wine, she'll blow up, and everyone will turn on me. Saying that even quietly makes me more panicked and wiped out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your toes warming up. Can you pause for just one tiny breath, without trying to think about the outcome or the thought?

Patient: I take one tiny breath—my chest loosens for a beat and it actually helps for a second—but my brain immediately screams that's exactly when I drop my guard and the disaster unfolds: I trip, the wine spills, she lashes out, everyone turns on me. I'm getting jumpy and wiped out just saying that, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your chest loosening. Can you hold onto that tiny release, without trying to use it to "stop" the thought or "make" something happen?

Patient: I try to hold it — there's a tiny easing, like a breath unclenching my ribs for a second. But the second I let that sit my brain screams that's exactly when I drop my guard and the whole disaster happens — I trip, the wine spills, she lashes out, everyone turns on me — it's making me shaky and kind of wiped out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your ribs easing. Can you simply... pause with that ease, without trying to add meaning to it or think about the outcome?

Patient: There’s this tiny ease in my ribs for a beat, but the instant I try to hold it my brain screams that's exactly when I drop my guard — I shift, I trip, the wine spills, she blows up, everyone turns on me. Saying that even quietly is making me shaky and kind of wiped out, so… can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your ribs easing. What's the sensation of that ease, without trying to say it's "good" or "bad" or think about what it means?

Patient: It's a thin, hollow looseness under my ribs — like something unclenching for a beat and then going quiet. But the instant I notice it my brain screams that's exactly when I drop my guard — I shift, I trip, the wine spills, she blows up, everyone turns on me. Saying that even quietly is making me shaky and wiped out, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the looseness under your ribs. Can you simply... pause with it, without trying to label it as "good" or "bad"?

Patient: I can pause — there's a thin hollow under my ribs, like it unclenches for a second. But the instant I notice it my brain screams that's exactly when I drop my guard: I shift, I trip, the wine spills everywhere, she snaps at me, everyone takes her side and I'm left cut off. Saying that even quietly kind of drains me, so... can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the pause between your ribs. Can you simply... stay with that pause, without trying to think about the outcome or the story?

Patient: I can try to stay with that tiny pause—there’s a faint quiet between breaths—but the moment I hold it my brain screams that’s when I drop my guard: I shift, I trip, red wine everywhere, she explodes, people take her side and I’m cut out. Saying that even quietly makes me shaky and worn out, so… can we slow down? I can’t make any other outcome feel real right now.

Therapist: Notice the pause between your breaths. What's the sensation of that pause, without trying to think about the story or the outcome?

Patient: It's a tiny quiet — a half-beat where my chest eases and my breath just sort of hangs there. But the moment I notice it my brain screams that's exactly when I drop my guard and everything spirals — I shift, I trip, red wine everywhere, she explodes, people take her side and I'm cut off — saying that even quietly just drains me, so... can we slow down?
