Patient: Well, lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because social situations make me really anxious — I just get flooded and can't breathe. I'm an artist and with the house so quiet since the kids left, my confidence has plummeted and I don't really have much social support. I don't know, it's hard to talk about.

Therapist: That feeling of being overwhelmed by social situations sounds really suffocating. When you say you avoid gatherings because they make you "flooded," what's one thing that usually happens right before you start feeling that way – like a trigger or a physical sensation that signals you're about to get stuck?

Patient: I guess it usually starts with my chest tightening and my hands getting kind of cold, like I can't catch my breath. Then my head fills with those mean little thoughts — "they'll think I'm boring" — and I just want to disappear. I don't know, it's embarrassing to say.

Therapist: When your chest tightens and your hands get cold, what's the one thing you notice about that physical sensation – like a word or a phrase that describes it, without judgment ("it feels like a knot")?

Patient: I don't know... maybe like a heavy knot, like a clamp squeezing my chest. My hands go cold and tingly and I feel kind of pinned to the spot. I guess that's the best way to put it.

Therapist: That knot in your chest is a very tangible experience – it's a physical sensation you can feel right now. When you think that others will think you're boring, what's one thing that's really important to you about being around people – like what they value about you, or what you're passionate about?

Patient: I guess I want them to notice my work — the colors, the little details I fuss over — and not just see me as quiet or invisible. It matters to me that people think I'm someone who cares about things, who has something to offer. I don't know, I feel silly even saying that.

Therapist: When you think "they'll just see me as quiet, invisible," what's the one thing that's already happening in your body right now – the knot in your chest, the tingle in your hands – that shows you're already showing up with something, even if it's just that you're feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I guess my breathing gets really shallow and my shoulders hunch up, and I start fiddling with my ring like I'm trying to hold myself together. I don't know, it feels like I'm bracing so I don't say the wrong thing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: You're already showing up with that physical action, even when you feel overwhelmed – you're fidgeting with your ring because you're trying to cope. What would it be like to take one tiny breath, just one, before you say something or do something, and see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might help a little. When I'm in it my breath gets so shallow I almost forget how to breathe, so pausing feels weird and clumsy. I've tried breathing exercises before and they calm me for a minute, but then the thoughts come back — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Even if pausing feels clumsy right now, what's one tiny thing you notice about your breath when you do pause – like a slight pause in your chest movement, or a tiny rise in your belly?

Patient: I guess I notice a tiny lift in my belly, like a little soft rise, and my chest eases a notch. It's so faint it almost vanishes as soon as those thoughts start racing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: That tiny lift in your belly happens right now, even when thoughts start racing – it's a tiny bit of space you've created by pausing. What would it be like to hold onto that tiny lift for just 1 second, without trying to change it or push it away, and see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to hold it for a second my belly lifts and my chest eases a little, and my shoulders drop — but then the thought about being boring rushes back and it disappears. I guess it helps for a beat, but it's hard to keep it. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When your belly lifts and your chest eases, you're showing up with your work – that's something to hold onto. What would it be like to notice just that shift – the lifted belly, the eased chest – without trying to change it or push it away, and see what happens to the thought about being boring when you do?

Patient: I guess if I notice that little lift the "they'll think I'm boring" voice quiets for a beat, like it doesn't have to shout as loud. But it never lasts — then I worry I'm doing it wrong and the thought rushes back. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the thought about being boring quiets for a beat, what happens to your work – the colors, the details – in that moment? Does it feel like you're still doing it, even if the thought isn't shouting?

Patient: I guess when that thought quiets I can actually get into the colors — the little marks, the way a green sits next to a blue — and I feel lighter, like I'm inside the work for a moment. But it never lasts long before the worry sneaks back and I pull away. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: That feeling of lightness, when you're inside the work, what's one thing you can notice about that feeling right now – like a physical sensation, a thought, or a sensation in your body – that shows you're already present with it, even if the thought isn't present?

Patient: I notice a quiet warmth in my belly and my shoulders loosen a little, like something soft opens up. My fingertips tingle and want to make a mark on the canvas, and for a moment that critic voice goes quieter. I don't know, it's small and I worry it'll vanish — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: That quiet warmth in your belly, when you make a mark on the canvas, what happens to the rest of your body – your chest, your breath, your whole presence – in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... when I'm really into a mark my chest loosens, my breath deepens a touch, and my shoulders drop — my hands just want to keep working. But it scares me because it disappears so fast and the critic rushes back — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: When your chest loosens, your breath deepens, and your hands just want to keep working, what's one thing you can commit to noticing in that moment – just for a breath, a heartbeat – before the critic rushes back, and see what happens?

Patient: I guess I could try to notice the quiet warmth in my belly and the tingle in my fingertips — the weight of the brush and the little scratch of paint on canvas — for just one breath. But when I do, a shameful, frustrated feeling pops up and tries to shove it away, so I get clumsy and pull back. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: When that shameful feeling pops up, what's one thing you can gently acknowledge about it – like noticing it's just a thought, or that it's connected to the critic's voice – and then what happens when you take that breath and try to notice the quiet warmth and the weight of the brush again, without trying to push the feeling away?

Patient: I guess I could try telling myself it's just a thought, that the critic's voice isn't the whole me. But when I do, a hot shame rushes up — my face burns, my hands get clumsy and I snatch the brush away; if I take that breath and notice the warmth and the weight it steadies me for one beat, then the shame claws back. I don't know, it's embarrassing and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens to your body when the shame claws back in, just for a beat, before it rushes back in again – is your chest tight, your breath shallow, your shoulders tensed?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I guess when the shame claws back my chest clamps, my breath goes shallow, and my shoulders pull up tight. My face gets hot and my hands fumble — it feels embarrassing and furious at the same time, like I want to curl up and hide. I don't know, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your chest clamping tight – what happens to your breath when that happens, right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I don't know, I guess my breath just gets really shallow, like I'm holding it, then little quick gasps. My face heats up and this shame and frustration wells up and I clench my hands — it feels embarrassing and I freeze. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you're holding your breath, pause for a second... what's the sensation in your body, right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels like it's clamped down, my breath is almost stuck — little panicked gasps — and my shoulders hitch up. My hands go cold and I fumble with my ring, my face feels hot and ashamed, and I just want to hide. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the feeling of your chest being clamped down – what's the sensation of that "clamping" right now, just beneath the surface of your awareness?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band low in my chest, a dull pressure that won't ease — like something's sitting on me. My breath gets tiny and quick, and my hands go fidgety and numb. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: When your breath gets tiny and quick, try to notice what happens to your body, just for a moment, without trying to push the breath out or change it. What's the sensation in your chest, or in your body, when you're holding that tiny breath?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band low in my chest, a dull pressure, and my breath gets tiny and quick so my shoulders hitch up. My hands go numb and I fumble my ring, then this hot shame and frustration wells up — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: What's the thought that's trying to push the tiny breath away, right now?

Patient: I guess the thought is that I'm a failure — that they'll see how clumsy and useless I am, that I somehow messed up and don't deserve to be here. I don't know, it makes my face burn and I want to hide; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: What's the sensation of your feet on the ground right now, without trying to change it or judge it?

Patient: I don't know... my feet feel kind of heavy and flat on the floor, like they're planted but numb at the edges, as if I'm stuck. It makes me feel stupid and hot with shame, like I should be moving but can't — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, right now. What's the shape of your breath, or the sensation of it touching your nostrils?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a thin, cool thread brushing my nostrils, barely there. My chest hardly lifts — the air feels trapped low — and as soon as I notice it that hot shame wells up and it tightens like something pressing down. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the hot shame pressing down on your chest – is it a tight band, a weight, a heaviness? What's the sensation of that weight moving down into your body?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band across my chest at first, then a heavy, lead-like weight that sinks down into my ribs and gut, making everything go quiet and my hands go clumsy. The shame wells up and makes my face hot and my breath shrink — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your face getting hot – is it a warmth, a flush, a tingling? What's happening to your mouth, your lips, your tongue?

Patient: I don't know... it's this hot, prickly flush across my cheeks, like a sudden burn. My mouth goes dry, my lips feel tight and my tongue feels thick so words catch — I swallow and everything feels stuck and clumsy. It makes me ashamed and annoyed with myself, and I just want to hide; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your throat when you swallow – is it a tightness, a lump, a heaviness? What happens to your voice when you try to speak?

Patient: I don't know... when I swallow it's like a lump that won't move, a tightness right at the front of my throat, like something's stuck there. My voice goes small and shaky, like it wants to come out but the words get caught, and then shame and frustration wash over me and my hands fumble — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of shame washing over you – is it a warmth, a heaviness, a pressure? What's happening to your body right now, physically?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a hot, heavy tide — more like a pressure that settles across my chest and sinks into my gut. My breath gets tiny and quick, my shoulders pull up, my face flushes, my hands fumble with my ring and my throat feels full so my voice goes small, and then this frustrated shame makes me want to hide. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?
