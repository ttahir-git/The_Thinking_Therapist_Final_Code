Patient: I've been feeling pretty low since the move, and I keep reaching for a drink to numb it — not every day, but often enough that it's worrying me. I've been a nurse my whole life, so I should know better, but when I get lonely or useless it feels like the easiest fix. I've tried talking about this before, so forgive me if I'm blunt, but how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That worry about reaching for drinks when you're feeling low is really important because it means you're recognizing what might be helping - or hurting - your feelings. As someone who's always put others first, what's the value of taking care of yourself in those moments?

Patient: I guess the value would be that I can actually keep doing my job and not feel completely wiped out — I still want to be useful, you know? But it also feels selfish and vague; I don't even know what 'taking care of myself' looks like at my age. I've heard about self-care a hundred times — how is that supposed to help with the urge to drink when I'm already numb and tired?

Therapist: It sounds like your value of being useful is really important to you, even when you're feeling tired and numb. When you reach for a drink, what's the first thing that happens when you drink?

Patient: The first thing is this immediate loosening — my chest lightens, the noise in my head quiets, and I can stop thinking about being lonely or useless for a while. It feels like permission to relax, but then I get foggy and ashamed and wake up thinking, "What did I even do last night?" I know it's temporary and stupid — I'm a nurse, I know the risks — so how is talking about my feelings supposed to help when the drink gives me that relief right away? I've tried other stuff and it doesn't stick.

Therapist: That fog and shame after drinking feels really tough - it's like a weight on top of your exhaustion. What's one small thing you could do right now, just for a moment, to make space for that value of being useful when you're feeling that fog?

Patient: Maybe I could do one concrete, tiny thing — like tidy up my work bag or sort the meds drawer, something that actually feels useful for a few minutes. I can see how that might remind me I'm still competent, but honestly, when the fog hits it feels stupid to do anything but drink, and I've tried distraction stuff before — how is that supposed to beat the immediate relief?

Therapist: When you drink to clear the fog, you describe it as "permission to relax." What if, instead of trying to change that feeling or distract yourself, you simply noticed it as a thought - just the thought that "I need to drink to clear the fog"?

Patient: Okay, I can try noticing it — like telling myself "that's just a thought" — but I'm skeptical. How is that supposed to help when the feeling's so raw and urgent? Noticing just... leaves me sitting with the urge, and that's exactly when I reach for the drink. I'm willing to try, but what comes after noticing that's actually useful?

Therapist: When you notice that thought, what's one tiny physical sensation that happens in your body that doesn't involve drinking?

Patient: My chest tightens and there's a knot in my stomach, my hands get a bit clammy, and I feel this jittery restlessness like I need to do something right now. It literally feels like my body is shouting "drink" before my head even has a chance—how is naming that gonna stop it?

Therapist: Those physical sensations - the knot in your stomach, the clamminess in your hands - are happening because your body is trying to tell you something: it's still needing that temporary relief to feel safe. But what if, instead of giving in to that relief, you looked for one tiny way to take care of yourself that didn't involve drinking?

Patient: I could try something tiny — like grabbing a glass of cold water, stepping outside for two minutes, or holding an ice cube to snap myself back — but honestly, when that urge hits it feels meaningless compared to a drink. How is that supposed to actually replace the relief alcohol gives me? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it, can we slow down?

Therapist: You're right to feel overwhelmed - noticing the thought and physical sensations takes courage. When you're feeling like that, what's one thing you can allow yourself to feel without trying to change it?

Patient: I guess I can allow myself to feel the loneliness and the heavy tiredness in my chest without trying to fix it right away. But I'm skeptical—how is just sitting with that supposed to stop me from grabbing a drink when it all feels so urgent? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed thinking about this, can we slow down?

Therapist: When the urge to drink hits, what's one tiny thing you can do with your body right now, without trying to change it, that doesn't involve drinking?

Patient: I could stand up and step outside for a couple minutes, put my hands on the railing and really feel my feet on the ground while I take a few slow breaths. But honestly, when the urge hits that feels like nothing compared to a drink — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down?

Therapist: When the urge to drink hits, what's one word or phrase that describes it to you, without judgment?

Patient: "Numbing pull" — a hollow, urgent ache that wants to be shut up. But seriously, how is just naming it supposed to stop me?

Therapist: The value that might be connected to this ache is "connection" - the feeling of being seen or understood by others. When the urge to drink hits, what's one tiny way you could show up for someone else, without having to drink, that feels connected to that value?

Patient: I could check in on a neighbor or call a colleague and ask if they need anything—something small and practical, like offering to pick up groceries or help sort meds, so I actually feel useful. But honestly, how is that supposed to beat the immediate relief of a drink when that hollow pull hits? I'm willing to try it, but it feels like a long shot and I'm skeptical.

Therapist: When the hollow pull hits, you're willing to try the small action. What's one tiny thing you can commit to doing right now, just for a moment, without thinking about the outcome, that feels connected to showing up for someone else?

Patient: Alright — I'll send my neighbor a quick text right now, something like "Hey, do you need anything from the store?" — just one line, no big drama. I don't expect it to feel like a drink, but it's a tiny thing that might remind me I'm useful. I'm getting a bit tense about all this, though—can we slow down?

Therapist: Your body is tensing up - what's one tiny physical sensation you can notice right now, without judgment, that shows up in your body when you think about sending the text?

Patient: My shoulders are bunching up and my chest feels like a little tight pressure right under my ribs, and my thumbs go a bit numb — like I'm bracing for something. My jaw's clenched too. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed thinking about it, can we slow down? And honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body right now, without trying to change it or make it go away. What's the sensation of your breath touching the inside of your nostrils?

Patient: It's a faint coolness on the inhale and a warmer little puff on the exhale, but my breaths feel shallow and jumpy. I can notice it if I try, but it doesn't stop my hands from wanting something in them — how is noticing that supposed to help when the urge's so loud? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: When you notice the numbness in your hands, what's one tiny thing you can do with that numbness, without trying to change it or use it to distract yourself?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Maybe I could rest my hands in my lap and lightly press my fingertips together, just paying attention to the numb, tingly feeling without trying to fix it or do anything else. It feels a bit silly, but I can try to let the numbness be there and describe it to myself. I'm getting a little overwhelmed just thinking about it, can we slow down?

Therapist: You're feeling overwhelmed, and that's okay. Notice the sensation of that feeling in your body right now, without trying to change it or push through it. What's one tiny thing you can do with your breath to stay with that feeling, just for a moment?

Patient: I can try taking three slow breaths — inhale through my nose, pause a beat, then a longer exhale — and pay attention to the cool in and warm out. But I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps when the urge's so loud and my hands feel numb. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down? How is that supposed to stop me from reaching for a drink?

Therapist: As you take that slow breath in, notice the sensation of the coolness in your nostrils, and then when you exhale, notice the warmth of your body releasing. Where in your body is the numbness most present right now?

Patient: Mostly in my hands — my thumbs and fingertips feel tingly and sort of dead, like pins-and-needles; there's a dull numbness in my jaw and that tight spot under my ribs too. My mind's jumpy and I can't hold on to one thing—how is noticing this supposed to help when the urge's yelling at me? I'm getting anxious and my breaths are shallow; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you notice the sensation of the tingle in your thumbs right now, without trying to change it or distract yourself? Just notice the tingle, like a tiny thread in the air, and see if you can hold onto that thread for just one second.

Patient: I can kind of feel a faint tingle in my thumbs, like a tiny thread — but it vanishes as soon as I try to hold it. My chest's tight and my thoughts are jumping all over, so I can't keep my attention there for more than a second. How is that supposed to stop me from reaching for a drink? Can we slow down?

Therapist: When the tingle vanishes, can you notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body right now, just for a tiny moment? Like, right now, as you speak, notice the sensation of your breath touching the inside of your nostrils.

Patient: I can feel the cool in and warm out, but it's shallow and my mind keeps darting away — I can't hold it for more than a second. The tingle in my thumbs disappears the moment I try to focus and I'm getting more anxious just trying to notice. How is paying attention to my breath supposed to stop me from reaching for a drink? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Instead of trying to hold the breath, can you do one tiny thing with your hands right now? Just one tiny movement, like opening your fingers slightly or letting your hand relax.

Patient: Alright — I'll try. I let my fingers uncurl a bit and rest them on my knee; there's a tiny loosening but the numb tingle's still there and my heart's racing. How is that supposed to stop the urge to drink? I'm getting more anxious; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the numbness in your hands without trying to change it or distract yourself. Just acknowledge it as "this numbness is here," without judgment.

Patient: "This numbness is here." My thumbs and fingertips are tingly, my jaw's tight, and there's that heavy pressure under my ribs. I can name it, but it doesn't make the urge quieter — I'm more anxious now, and honestly, how is saying that supposed to stop me from reaching for a drink? Can we slow down?

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you could do with your body that doesn't involve drinking, that might feel slightly pleasant?

Patient: Maybe I could make a warm cup of tea and hold it in my hands — feel the heat and take a slow sip. My hands are numb and I'm anxious, so that might be a tiny pleasant thing, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when the urge is screaming at me? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: What's the value that this small act of making tea might hold for you?

Patient: It feels like a tiny bit of comfort and routine — the warmth in my hands, a slow moment that says I can still look after myself, which ties into that value of being useful. But honestly, how is a cup of tea supposed to beat the immediate relief of a drink? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: When you think about drinking, what's the first sensation that comes up in your body?

Patient: The first thing is my chest loosens and this warm, heavy sinking spreads through my stomach — everything eases and my shoulders drop like a weight's been taken off. My head goes fuzzy, thoughts slow down, and for a minute the loneliness quiets. But then the shame and fog roll in afterward, and I keep thinking — how is noticing that supposed to stop me from reaching for a drink? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: When you notice your chest loosening, what's one tiny thing you could say to yourself to acknowledge that sensation, without judgment?

Patient: Maybe I'd say to myself, "Okay — my chest is loosening; that's just a feeling and it will pass," or "This is temporary; I can notice it without doing anything." But honestly, how is saying that supposed to stop the urge when it feels like real relief? I'm getting more anxious thinking about this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Instead of trying to stop the urge, what's one tiny thing you can notice about the sensation in your chest right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: It's a brief hollowing right under my ribs—a soft, warm emptying that comes and then slips away, and my breath gets suddenly shallower when it does. Naming it feels small and kind of pointless compared to the relief of a drink—how is that supposed to help? I'm getting anxious and distracted; can we slow down?
