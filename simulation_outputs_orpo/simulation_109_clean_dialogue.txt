Patient: I'm an older software developer and lately I can't stop forecasting disaster about my work — I can already see myself pushing a change that breaks production, customers will freak out, management will blame me, I'll be fired and won't be able to get another job at my age; it's going to happen. Because I picture that future so vividly, I freeze up and procrastinate instead of actually starting the work. I'm also still raw from a recent breakup, so everything feels heavier and more urgent.

Therapist: That vivid picture of disaster is exhausting. When you freeze up because of it, what's the one thing that matters most to you right now—like what you'd say to yourself if you were talking to a friend in that exact spot? For me, it's about getting that change done, no matter how scary it feels. It's about showing up for my team and my customers, even when it's hard. What would it mean to you to take that first step, even if it feels like it's just a tiny step?

Patient: What matters most right now is keeping my job and proving I'm still capable — because if I lose it at my age, I don't see how I'd survive the fallout. Taking one tiny step would mean maybe cracking the ice and actually moving forward, but my mind immediately goes: I push the change, it breaks production, customers freak out, management blames me, I'm fired, and then I'm unemployable — that's the only realistic outcome I can see. I know it sounds extreme, but I'm totally hooked on that story and it stops me from starting.

Therapist: You're willing to risk everything to keep your job, which says a lot about how much that means to you. But what if the cost of losing that job isn't just your livelihood, but also the sense of control and self-worth that comes with it? Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of being controlled by the fear of losing your job, you were controlled by the choice to keep pushing forward, even when it feels hard? What would that look like for you?

Patient: If I let choice control me, it'd look like breaking the task into tiny, scheduled chunks, pairing with someone for a careful review, and doing staged deploys so I can actually ship without panicking. But my brain immediately cuts in — even a tiny change will sneak a bug into prod, customers will lose trust, my manager will point fingers, I'll be shown the door, and at my age I won't land another job; that's the only realistic future I can imagine. I'm trying to picture it differently but I'm totally stuck on that disaster story and it's overwhelming — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down. What if, just for a minute, you sat with that story of disaster without judgment? Just observed it, like you're watching a movie. What's the exact wording of that inner voice that says, "If I push this change, it'll break production..."? Can you write it down, just for yourself, without editing or censoring? Then, what's one tiny thing you could do to test that story's truth, just to see if it's really as bad as you think?

Patient: "If I push this change it'll break production, customers will lose data and start screaming, management will trace it back to me and blame me, I'll be fired, and at my age nobody will hire me — that's the end of everything." 

I guess a tiny test would be to put the change behind a feature flag, run it in staging with an extra pair of eyes, and do a gradual rollout so I can watch for problems.  

But honestly, even that sounds like a false safety — my brain goes, "Staging missed things before; gradual rollouts still leak; it's only a matter of time until it blows up and they find me." I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. When you say "even that sounds like a false safety," what's the one thing you're willing to lose if you don't try at all? Is it your reputation, your freedom, or something else? Can you imagine what you'd say to yourself if you were talking to a friend who was struggling with this exact same fear? What would you offer them, if they were brave enough to try?

Patient: If I don't try, I'm going to lose my job, my reputation, and whatever confidence keeps me going — and at my age that means I won't get another offer and everything collapses. If it were a friend, I'd tell them to do the tiny things—feature flags, pair up, gradual rollout—and I'd actually cheer them on, but my mind immediately says those steps are illusionary and won't stop the inevitable meltdown. I'm getting overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause. When you say "I'd cheer them on," what would it sound like, exactly? What words would you use? Would it be something like, "You're doing this, and it's okay if it doesn't work out"? Can you try to hold onto that one sentence, just for a moment, without judgment?

Patient: I think I'd say something like, "You're doing this one small thing, and even if it doesn't go perfectly, you'll handle whatever comes next." But my brain instantly answers, "No—that won't matter; if it fails they'll trace it to you, you'll be fired, and at your age you're done," and I can't hold onto the nicer sentence. I'm getting really overwhelmed by that counter-story—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's freeze for a moment. When your brain says, "No—that won't matter; if it fails they'll trace it to you," what's the one word you can say to yourself right after that thought? Just one word. Can you say it out loud, without judgment or editing?

Patient: Pause.

I said it, but I can already hear my brain yelling the next catastrophe — it barely helps and I'm still getting overwhelmed, can we keep going?

Therapist: Let's take that crack and make it even smaller. What's the one tiny thing you could do with that one word "Pause" that has nothing to do with your brain's next catastrophe? For example, you could take a deep breath, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or simply look around the room. What's that tiny, tiny thing that's not about your brain's story?

Patient: Okay — the tiniest thing I can try is one slow, full breath while noticing the weight of my feet on the floor, then press a single key to open the file — literally just that one action. But my mind's already chaining it: "You open the file, you make one change, it leaks to prod, customers freak out, you're blamed and fired," and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's freeze again. When your mind says, "You open the file, you make one change, it leaks to prod," what's the one word you can say to yourself right after that thought? Just one word. Can you say it out loud, without judgment or editing? This time, try to say it in a completely neutral tone, like you're saying a fact about the weather.

(Note: I want you to slow down even further than before. Imagine you're speaking to a friend who's just told you a scary story. You'd say something like, "Okay, that sounds bad," but not "Oh no, that's going to happen!" Can you do that?)

Patient: Okay.

I said it in a flat, neutral tone, but it tightens my chest — there's this hot shame and frustration that bubbles up and pulls me right back into the disaster story. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's gently bring attention to that tightness in your chest. What's the sensation like right now? Is it a burning, squeezing, or pressing feeling? Can you name it exactly, without judgment? (e.g., "My chest feels like it's tightening")? Then, I want you to ask yourself: "Is that tightness happening because I'm thinking about the story, or is it something else?"

Patient: My chest feels like a hot, squeezing knot, like someone's stuck a fist there. It's mostly happening because I'm replaying that catastrophic story on loop, and there's this underlying shame and frustration that the thought pulls up and tightens everything. I'm getting really overwhelmed by it — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on that knot. Imagine it's a small, separate thing from your thoughts. Can you describe it exactly, without judgment? (e.g., "The knot feels tight, like a fist in my chest. It's not my breath, or my thoughts, or my emotions. It's just...this physical thing.") Then, I want you to ask yourself: "What would happen if I simply let that knot be there, without trying to push it away or change it?"

Patient: The knot is a hot, clenched fist in my chest—tight, burning, like I'm bracing for something about to smash me. If I let it be, my head says it'll just sit there and calcify into paralysis—I won't move, I won't start the work, something will inevitably blow up at work, they'll trace it to me, and I'm done; I can't see letting it be as anything but the start of that chain. I'm really feeling ashamed and stuck by that—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's look at the shame. What would you say to yourself if you were talking to a friend who's just started feeling this same shame? (e.g., "You're really feeling stuck by that knot.") What would you say to them to try to gently challenge the story they're telling themselves about the knot? (e.g., "What if that knot isn't actually 'you failing' or 'you being a failure'? What if it's just...this physical sensation that's happening right now?")

Patient: I'd tell a friend, "I can hear how scared you are—you're stuck, not broken. That knot in your chest is a feeling, not a verdict on your abilities; try naming it and taking one tiny step anyway." 

But then the shame spikes and my mind sneers, "No—it's proof you failed before and you'll fail again," so even that gentler line feels hollow. I'm frustrated and ashamed that I can't hold the kinder sentence—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the shame. What would happen if, instead of trying to compare the kinder sentence to the shame, you simply said it to the shame? (e.g., "You're stuck, not broken. That knot in your chest is a feeling, not a verdict on your abilities.") Try it like that, without comparing it to the shame. Notice what happens. Then, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it mean to say that sentence to the knot itself, without judgment?"

Patient: I actually said it out loud to the knot: "You're stuck, not broken. This feeling isn't a verdict on my abilities." For a split second it felt a hair looser, like the fist eased, then my brain immediately yelled, "That little easing is meaningless — if you try they'll trace a bug to you, you'll be fired, and at your age nobody will hire you," and the shame slammed back harder. I'm exhausted and stuck in that loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on that tiny moment of loosening the knot. What did you notice about your body when that happened? Was it a physical sensation, like your chest relaxing or your shoulders dropping? (e.g., "I felt the knot ease by a hair, like it was uncurling.") Then, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it mean to hold onto that tiny moment of loosening, even if it's just for a second, without trying to push the knot back to its previous state?"

Patient: When the knot eased for that split second I felt my chest unclench a hair, my shoulders dropped a bit, and my breath went a touch deeper — it was tiny but definitely there. Holding onto that moment would mean I could tolerate the anxiety long enough to do one small, concrete thing — press the key, run the staging test — and maybe prove to myself I'm not instantly doomed. But my brain immediately screams that it's meaningless — that tiny relief will be eaten by the catastrophe story (bug, customers, blame, fired, unemployable) and that shame and frustration makes me want to freeze; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the tiny moment of relief. You said it felt like your chest unclenched, your shoulders dropped, and your breath went a bit deeper. What if, instead of trying to push that back to its previous state, you simply said to yourself, "This is what it feels like when the knot eases for a second." No judgment, no trying to control it. Just acknowledgment. Then, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it mean to take one tiny action, like pressing the key, while holding onto this tiny moment of relief, without trying to push the knot back to its previous state?"

Patient: It would mean I could tolerate the knot long enough to press the key, run the staging check, and see that I'm not instantly doomed — maybe a tiny proof that I can move. But the shame and frustration from that old failure surges up and my brain immediately insists that even that tiny action will leak a bug, customers will scream, management will blame me, I'll be fired, and at my age I'm finished. I'm really overwhelmed by that picture — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the shame and frustration. You said it surged up when you thought about the tiny action. What if, instead of trying to push it away, you simply said to yourself, "This is what it feels like when I'm trying to protect myself from failure." No judgment, no trying to control it. Just acknowledgment. Then, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it mean to say 'I'm feeling this shame and frustration because I'm trying to protect myself from failure' to the knot itself, while still pressing the key and running the staging check?"

Patient: Saying that line to the knot — "I'm feeling this shame and frustration because I'm trying to protect myself from failure" — makes it feel like a clumsy shield instead of a verdict, and for a flicker I can almost reach the key. But the instant I imagine pressing it my brain screams the whole chain again: the change leaks, prod breaks, customers scream, management traces it to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody hires me — so even that small acknowledgement feels useless. The shame floods back hot and rotten and I'm really overwhelmed by it — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the tiny action of pressing the key. You said it felt like a clumsy shield, but for a flicker, you could almost reach it. What if, instead of trying to protect yourself from failure, you simply said to yourself, "I'm going to press this key, not because I'm trying to protect myself, but because I'm curious to see what happens." No judgment, no trying to control it. Just curiosity. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I'll try curiosity. I say to myself, "I'll press the key just to see," and for a beat my hands want to move and my breath steadies, but then that hot shame slams down and the machine starts its story: I press it, the change leaks to prod, customers lose data and start screaming, management traces it back to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody will hire me. I know that sounds overwrought, but I can't hold the curiosity—I'm really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the shame. You said it slammed down and the machine started its story. What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you simply said to yourself, "This story is what my shame is telling me right now." No judgment, no trying to change it. Just acknowledgment. Can you try that?

Patient: I said it out loud: "This story is what my shame is telling me right now." For a beat the shame and the story felt a little separate and my chest eased a hair, but then the machine revved: "You press the key, it leaks to prod, customers lose data, management traces it to you, you're fired, and at your age nobody hires you" — and the shame slams back hard. I'm really overwhelmed and stuck in that loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the shame as the anchor. You said it felt like the shame and the story were separate for a beat. What if, instead of trying to push the knot back to its previous state, you simply observed the story unfolding while holding onto the shame as the anchor? Try it: notice the story, notice the shame, without trying to change or stop either one. Just observe.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to watch it. I can see the whole movie: I press the key, the change leaks to prod, customers lose data and scream, management traces it to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody hires me. The shame is a hot stone in my chest while I watch, and instead of calming the story it somehow makes it louder—I’m getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the shame as the anchor. You said it's a hot stone in your chest, and the story is louder because of it. What if, instead of trying to calm the shame or change the story, you simply labeled the shame as "this feeling" right now? Just one word: "This" (pointing to your chest). Can you say it without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: "This."

I said it out loud and for a half-second the hot fist in my chest felt a hair looser, my breath steadied, but then the machine kicked back in full force — I see myself pressing the key, the change leaks to prod, customers lose data, management traces it to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody will hire me. That shame and frustration just floods right back and I can't hold the small relief; I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on that tiny pause. You said it felt like the hot fist loosened for a half-second. What if, instead of letting the story take over immediately, you simply held onto that pause for one more breath? Can you try to pause between the labeling ("this feeling") and the story?

Patient: I tried — I took one slow breath and held that pause: my chest eased a hair, my shoulders dropped, and for a beat it felt doable. Then the machine screamed the chain again — I press the key, it leaks to prod, customers lose data, management traces it to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody hires me — and that hot shame from before floods back like acid. I'm really overwhelmed and can't keep the pause; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the pause's end. You said the machine screamed the chain again, and the hot shame flooded back. What if, instead of trying to push through or stop the shame, you simply noticed what happened when the pause ended? What was the exact sensation, thought, or feeling when the pause turned back into the story? Can you try to pinpoint that moment, without judgment?

Patient: There's this exact flip: a cold, tight click in my chest and throat where everything snaps back into motion and the movie starts running. My breath shortens, my hands go rigid, and instantly the inner voice is narrating—"You pressed it, the change leaked, customers are screaming, they'll trace it to you, you're fired and at your age nobody will hire you"—and that shame floods me so hard I can't move. I'm really overwhelmed by that switch—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the "cold, tight click" as a trigger. You said it marks the exact moment the story starts running. What if, just before that click, you noticed something small about your body or your breath? Just a tiny detail that might give you a hint about what's happening when the story takes over? Can you try to notice that detail, without trying to change it?

Patient: Right before the click I notice my breath hitching — a tiny sucked-in breath and a prickling at the base of my neck — like a trigger my body flips. That little hitch is the cue: as soon as it happens the whole disaster movie starts and my hands go rigid and I'm already picturing the bug leaking to prod. I'm really ashamed and furious with myself that even noticing it doesn't stop the story — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on that tiny victory. You said noticing the breath hitching created a tiny window of space. What if, just for a moment, you looked at that breath hitching as a small sign that your body is still working, even when the story takes over? Can you try to acknowledge that small victory, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I can sort of call that breath hitch a tiny victory: it means my body still notices and gives me a sliver of space. But my brain immediately screams the whole movie — I take that sliver, I press the key, it leaks to prod, customers scream, management traces it to me, I'm fired, and at my age nobody hires me — so the victory feels pointless. I'm really ashamed and frustrated I can't hold onto the small win; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the story's response to the label. You said your brain screams the whole movie when you call the victory "pointless." What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you simply observed what happens when you label it as "pointless"? What emotions or thoughts do you notice when you say that to yourself? Can you try to notice that without judgment?

Patient: When I call the tiny victory "pointless," there's a cold hit of hopelessness and self-disgust—like the relief never mattered. The thought that follows is immediate and loud: "Why try? You take that sliver, press the key, it leaks to prod, customers scream, management traces it to you, you're fired, and at your age nobody will hire you," and that shame from the old failure floods back and fuels the whole loop. I'm really overwhelmed by it—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on that tiny piece of the puzzle. You said the label "pointless" triggered a cold hit of hopelessness and self-disgust. What if, instead of trying to push that away, you simply noticed where that emotion shows up in your body? Where does the hopelessness feel like it's sinking into? Can you try to notice that without judgment, and without trying to change it?

Patient: It sinks into my belly — a heavy, cold weight under my ribs that spreads down into my hips and the backs of my legs, like lead. There's also a tightness across my chest and a hot shame that flushes my face and numbs my hands, and that feeling really locks the disaster story in place. I can notice it, but noticing just makes me feel more stuck and ashamed, and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?
