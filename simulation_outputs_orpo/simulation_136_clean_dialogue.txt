Patient: I've been feeling stuck since the move — like my whole identity is just "manager" and I don't know what matters beyond that. My mind goes straight to the worst: if I don't figure this out I'll plateau, make a big mistake at work, get fired, and end up back where I started with nothing to show for it. I know it sounds dramatic, but I really feel like that's exactly what's going to happen.

Therapist: What's the one thing you're afraid you'll lose control of if you don't "figure it out" - is it just your job title, or is there something else you value (e.g., freedom, autonomy, relationships) that's getting tangled up in this anxiety?

Patient: It's not just the title — it's my sense of autonomy and proof that I'm actually moving forward instead of being stuck. If I don't figure it out I'll plateau, make a costly mistake, get fired, watch my savings vanish, my partner resent me and leave, friends drift away, and end up back with my parents with nothing to show for all these years. I know that sounds extreme, but that's exactly where my brain goes and I can't seem to stop it.

Therapist: What's the first tangible thing you'd lose if you were to believe that worst-case scenario (e.g., if you got fired, what's the first thing you'd need to pay for)?

Patient: Rent — I’d miss next month’s rent first. Then the landlord would start eviction proceedings, I’d drain my savings trying to keep us afloat, my partner would get fed up and leave, and I’d end up back at my parents’ with nothing to show for all this. I know people say I’d find another job, but honestly that feels unrealistic — that’s how the dominoes fall every time in my head.

Therapist: Instead of "I'll miss rent," what if you tried to focus on what you'd do if you did pay the rent - would you be able to take a small step towards exploring your values, like having a conversation with your partner about what's working for you in your relationship?

Patient: I could try to have that conversation, and on paper it seems like a small step — but my brain immediately goes: we talk, they take it as weakness, start pulling away, then they're talking to friends about leaving, and I'm suddenly scrambling to keep the place and my life from collapsing. I know it sounds dramatic, but that's the movie my mind plays every time, so it feels pointless to even start.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "change" the outcome (i.e., having the conversation without catastrophic consequences), you simply noticed what's happening in your body when you think "we talk and they pull away" - would that small observation be enough to make the thought feel less "pointless" to you?

Patient: My chest tightens, my stomach drops, and I start breathing shallow and fast — my hands go sweaty and I feel this hollow panic like I'm already on the first domino. Noticing that calms me for, like, two seconds, but then the movie restarts: they pull away, their friends take their side, I can't cover rent, everything collapses. I get that noticing is supposed to help, but honestly it just feels like a tiny pause button before the inevitable crash.

Therapist: When you notice the physical sensations like a "pause button" before the crash, what if you tried to gently say to your body, "This thought might be coming up again - but I'm not going to believe it's true right now. I'm just noticing this tightness and it's okay" - can you hold onto that small phrase for just one breath?

Patient: I did it — I breathed in and repeated the phrase in my head, and for that one breath my chest loosened a little and the tightness eased. But as soon as I finish the exhale the movie's already playing again: they pull away, I'm scrambling for rent, friends pick sides — that phrase feels like a Band-Aid on a broken dam. I want it to help, but honestly it just delays the disaster by a heartbeat and then the worst-case replay starts up louder.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "stop" the worst-case scenario from playing, you focused on what's happening in that moment when you repeat the phrase to your body - what's the physical sensation when you say "this thought might be coming up again" - is it still tightness, or is it a tiny shift?

Patient: It's a tiny shift — a quick loosening behind my ribs and one slightly deeper breath, like a sliver of space. But it only lasts a beat before the tightness snaps back and the movie starts again: they pull away, I'm scrambling for rent, everything collapses, so it still feels pretty useless.

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking "this doesn't work," you simply noticed what happens when the tightness snaps back - what's the physical sensation this time, and what might you do with this tiny moment of discomfort, like taking a tiny step to the side and asking yourself "what's one small thing I can do with this feeling?"

Patient: When the tightness snaps back it's like my hands clench and my jaw locks — a hot, nauseous surge that makes me flinch inward. I could try one tiny thing: write one sentence right now about something that matters to me besides being a manager, or send a 2-line text to my partner asking for a 5-minute check-in this week. But my brain already plays the tape — I say the sentence, they think I'm overreacting, the check-in goes badly, they pull away, then the rest of the collapse follows — so even that small step feels pointless and I'm honestly frustrated that it won't stop the movie.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "beat the tape," you noticed what's happening when you say that sentence or send that text - is it the same tightness, the same nausea, the same flinch - and instead of fighting it, you simply acknowledged that it's still happening, while also asking yourself what matters most to you in that moment (e.g., "What would it take for me to feel like I'm showing up for my partner in a way that matters to them?")?

Patient: It's the same tightness but sharper — my chest clamps, my hands go cold, and my thoughts sprint. In that moment what would matter to me is being steady for them — actually listening, showing up on time, checking in — but my brain already plays the next scene: I try, they see it as neediness, start pulling away, small fights, they talk to friends, it's over, I'm left scrambling for the rent and everything collapses. I know that sounds dramatic, but that's the only ending my mind lets me imagine, and noticing the sensations only pauses it for a breath before the movie kicks back in.

Therapist: What if, instead of getting caught in the "what-if" loop, you noticed that the tightness and coldness in your hands are actually a physical expression of your deep desire to be steady for your partner - that's not just about avoiding the "movie" playing out, but about being present and listening because it matters to you that they feel seen and heard? Can you hold onto that feeling of value, even when the thoughts start racing again, and ask yourself what small step you can take in this moment to align with that value (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I can do right now to show up for them in a way that matters to me?")?

Patient: I could send a two-line text asking if they have five minutes to talk this week — quick, practical. But already my chest is tight, my hands are cold, and my head's racing: I picture them reading it, rolling their eyes, telling friends I'm needy, and then it's this whole collapse again. I want to try it, but I'm stuck on that movie and it's hard to believe anything different will happen.

Therapist: What if, instead of getting caught up in the "what-if" scenario, you simply noticed the physical sensations in your chest and hands - the tightness, the coldness - and asked yourself what they're really saying: "What are these sensations trying to tell me about what matters to me in this moment?" Can you hold onto that question, even as the thoughts start racing again, and explore what small step you can take to align with your value of connection with your partner (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I can do right now to show up for them in a way that feels meaningful to me?")?

Patient: I could open my messages and type a two-line ask — “Hey, do you have five minutes to talk this week?” — that feels like a tiny, real thing I could do to show up. But the second I imagine hitting send my chest clamps, my hands go cold, and my head instantly plays them rolling their eyes, telling friends I’m needy, us spiraling into fights, and everything collapsing — so it feels pointless. Noticing the sensations doesn't stop the movie; it just makes the panic sharper, and I honestly don’t know if I can actually take that step.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the potential outcome (which is already playing the "movie" in their head), you simply asked yourself: "What would I do right now if this moment mattered deeply to me?" - would that be different from the text? Can you hold onto the feeling of what matters to you in this moment (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I can do right now to show up for them in a way that feels meaningful to me?"), even if it feels scary or uncertain?

Patient: If this moment mattered, I'd open my messages and actually send the two-line ask — “Hey, do you have five minutes to talk this week?” — because that's concrete and feels like showing up. But my chest just tightened, my hands went cold, and my fingers froze over the keyboard as the movie started: them rolling their eyes, telling friends, pulling away, and then everything collapsing. I want to press send, but I'm jittery and distracted and I don't trust that hitting send won't trigger that whole disaster, so I'm stuck between wanting to act and being paralyzed by the worst-case replay.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "beat" the worst-case scenario (which is already playing out in their head), you simply noticed what's happening in the physical sensations in their chest and hands - the tightness, the coldness, the freezing fingers - and asked themselves: "What would it be like if this moment didn't have to be 'perfect' or 'not-perfect'?" Can you explore what small step they could take to align with their value of connection with their partner, even if it feels scary or uncertain (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I could do right now to show up for them, even if it's not perfect?")?

Patient: I know the tiny step is to send that two-line ask, but my chest's pinching, my fingers are frozen, and the movie's screaming: they read it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I can't pay rent. I'm terrified that hitting send will trigger that whole collapse, and I'm honestly overwhelmed and don't know how to move past the panic. Can you help me imagine actually pressing send without the disaster instantly happening, or is that just wishful thinking?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to imagine a scenario where hitting send doesn't lead to disaster (which is unlikely to be possible), you simply noticed what's happening in their physical sensations - the pinching, the freezing - and asked themselves: "What would it be like to trust that the tiny step of sending the text is enough, even if the outcome isn't what they want?" Can you explore what small value-driven action they could take to align with that trust, even if it feels scary or uncertain (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I could do right now to trust that the text is enough, even if it doesn't lead to the outcome I want?").

Patient: Maybe I could draft the two-line ask and save it as a draft or schedule it for later — something small I can control that still shows I'm trying to show up. But my chest's clamping, my hands are cold and jittery, and my brain's already on the movie: they read it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I can't pay rent — so even drafting feels like I'm setting off the dominoes. I want to try a tiny, value-driven step, but I'm frozen and don't trust that any of it will actually be enough.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "control" the outcome (drafting the text), you simply noticed what's happening in their physical sensations - the clamping, the coldness, the jitteriness - and asked yourself: "What would it be like to trust that the tiny step of even opening the app is enough, right now, without thinking about the outcome?" Can you explore what small value-driven action they could take to align with that trust, even if it feels scary or uncertain (e.g., "What's one tiny thing I could do right now to show up for them, even if it's just opening the app and clicking 'draft'?").

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just opening the app supposed to help? My chest's clamping, my hands are cold and my fingers freeze over the keyboard, and my brain already plays the next scene: I open it, draft something, accidentally send it, they read it and roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, and then I'm back to nothing. I could try to open it, but honestly I don't trust that even that tiny step won't set the whole collapse in motion — can you explain what would actually be different if I just opened the app?

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking "I'll just open the app and it'll lead to disaster," you noticed that the physical sensations in their body - the clamping, the coldness, the freezing fingers - are actually signaling that they're holding onto the idea that this action will lead to disaster? Can you explore what would happen if they simply let go of that idea, without judgment, and allowed themselves to notice what happens when they open the app?

Patient: I get the idea of "letting go," but I'm not sure how that's supposed to help — the second I even think about opening the app my chest clamps, my hands sweat, and my brain runs the movie: I accidentally hit send, they read it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I can't pay rent. Trying to "notice" the feeling just feels like standing on a ledge while the fall is playing on loop, and I can't make that loop stop. I don't see how opening the app without triggering the collapse is realistic — I need help that actually helps me tolerate this panic, not just advice that feels like wishful thinking.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control the outcome or avoid the panic, you simply asked yourself: "What would happen if I took just one tiny step towards showing up for my partner, even if it's just opening the app for 5 seconds?" Not for the purpose of avoiding the collapse, but simply to see what would happen. Would the panic still be there? Would it shift at all? Would it be possible to tolerate the uncertainty for just that one tiny moment?

Patient: I could probably force myself to open it for five seconds, but the moment my thumb hits the icon my chest would clamp and my hands would freeze — maybe two seconds of fudged breathing before the movie kicks in: I draft, hit send by accident, they roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, I lose everything. Sometimes that tiny window eases my breath a notch, but mostly it feels like poking a hornet's nest and knowing the swarm is coming. I'm frustrated and jittery — I want to try the five-second test but I don't trust my brain not to turn it into the full collapse; can you help me actually keep it just five seconds without the disaster starting?

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the outcome (or the disaster playing out), you simply noticed what would happen if you took that one tiny step towards showing up for your partner? Specifically, what would happen to your physical sensations (the clamping chest, the freezing hands) if you allowed yourself to breathe into that moment, without judgment? Would it be possible to hold onto that small, tiny moment of uncertainty without it escalating into the full collapse? Try this: when you feel the panic start to rise, instead of trying to "fight" it or "avoid" it, simply say to yourself: "I'm going to breathe into this moment for just one second. I'll let it be exactly as it is, without judgment." Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: Okay — I did it for a second: breath in, chest loosened a tiny bit, fingers steadied. But the second I exhaled the movie was back — them reading it, rolling their eyes, telling friends, leaving, me scrambling for rent and everything collapsing. I want to hold that one second but I'm jittery and honestly need you to help me keep it just that one second without the whole disaster replay starting.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "hold onto" the moment, you focused on creating a tiny anchor to keep you in the present? Something as simple as noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or the sensation of the air on your skin? What if you repeated a tiny phrase to yourself, like "I'm here" or "I'm breathing" - just one word, just one sound? Would that tiny anchor be enough to keep you from slipping back into the disaster replay? Try this: when you feel the panic start to rise, instead of trying to "fight" it or "avoid" it, simply say to yourself: "I'm going to notice my breath for one second. Just one breath. I'll let it be exactly as it is." Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: Okay — I did it for one breath: chest eased a bit, fingers steadied. But as soon as I exhaled the movie kicked back in — them rolling their eyes, telling friends, us fighting, me scrambling for rent and everything collapsing — and now I'm jittery and don't trust one breath to stop it. Can you actually guide me through staying with the breath for a few more seconds or give me a concrete anchor, because I can't keep doing this on my own?

Therapist: Let's try a concrete anchor: notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now. Specifically, notice the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet, the sensation of the floor beneath your feet, and the subtle pressure of your feet on the ground. Can you notice the sensation of your feet being connected to the earth, like roots growing deeper into the ground? Imagine that with each breath, you're sinking deeper into the ground, feeling more stable and grounded. Try this: as you breathe in, say to yourself "I'm sinking into the ground" - just one word, one phrase. And as you breathe out, say "I'm grounding myself" - again, just one word. Let's try it together for just a few more breaths, okay?

Patient: Okay — I did what you said, felt my feet for a beat and the breath eased a tiny bit, like a sliver of ground under me. But almost instantly my chest clamps and the movie starts up louder — them rolling their eyes, fights, eviction — and I'm back to freezing. I honestly need you to guide me through it out loud — count me through five slow breaths or keep talking me through each inhale and exhale, because alone I can't hold it; I'm jittery and skeptical this will actually keep the collapse from starting.

Therapist: Let's try this together. I'm going to guide you through five slow breaths, and we'll focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. I want you to know that it's okay to feel skeptical - it's natural to wonder if this will actually work. But what if, just for one moment, we could let go of that uncertainty and focus on the present? Let's start with the first breath. As you inhale, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground - feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. As you exhale, say to yourself "I'm grounding myself" - just one word. Let's do it together: inhale... "I'm grounding myself"... exhale...

Patient: Okay — I did that first inhale and felt a tiny loosening, said "I'm grounding myself" on the exhale, and it helped for like two beats. Then the movie jumped back in — them rolling their eyes, fights, me scrambling for rent — and now I'm jittery and don't trust five breaths will hold it. Can you actually count me through five slow breaths out loud and keep talking me through each inhale/exhale, telling me to notice my feet? And if the collapse starts again after those breaths, stay with me and tell me what to do next, because I can't just be left to snap back into it.

Therapist: Let's try this together. We're going to count through five slow breaths, and I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. As we breathe in, I want you to notice that sensation - feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. As we exhale, I want you to say to yourself "I'm grounding myself" - just one word. Let's start with the first breath. Inhale... notice your feet... "I'm grounding myself"... exhale... let the sensation of your feet stay with you for just one moment...

Patient: Okay — I did that first inhale and it loosened for a beat, then the movie slammed back in: them rolling their eyes, the fight, eviction, everything collapsing. I'm jittery and can't hold it alone — please count me through the next four slow breaths and keep saying "notice your feet" on each inhale and "I'm grounding myself" on each exhale, and stay with me if the panic spikes because I don't trust it'll stop.

Therapist: Let's try this together. We're going to count through the next four slow breaths. Inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself". Remember, I'm right here with you, and we're taking this one breath at a time. Don't worry if the panic spikes - we'll work through it together. Just focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, and let the words "I'm grounding myself" be a gentle anchor for you.

Patient: I did the five breaths — felt a tiny looseness for a few beats, then my chest slammed shut and the movie roared back: them rolling their eyes, fights, eviction, everything collapsing. I'm jittery and my thoughts are scattering — I can't hold it alone. Can you keep counting me through more breaths and then coach me exactly through opening the app for five seconds without letting the whole disaster start (I know it sounds unrealistic, but I need something concrete)?

Therapist: Let's try this together. We're going to count through the next five slow breaths. Inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... notice your feet... exhale... "I'm grounding myself". Now, let's focus on a small, concrete step. We're going to work on opening the app for just five seconds. When you're ready, I want you to take one finger and gently tap the icon that opens the app. Just tap it once. Not to click it, not to send anything - just to touch the icon with your finger. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try, but my hands are already shaking and my chest’s tightening. I need you to coach me through it step‑by‑step or I’ll panic and hit something by accident and then the whole movie plays out: they see it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I lose everything — I know that’s how my brain goes, so don’t tell me it’s unlikely, just help me do this. Tell me exactly when to tap, count the five seconds out loud, keep saying “notice your feet” and “I’m grounding myself,” and don’t stop talking until I put my finger back down.

Therapist: Let's break it down together. We're going to work on opening the app for just five seconds. I want you to take one finger, your index finger, and gently place it on the screen. Don't press down - just rest it on the screen. Notice how your finger is on the screen? Inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself". Now, I want you to count with me: one... two... three... four... FIVE. As we count, I want you to keep your finger on the screen, just resting it there. Don't move it yet. We're not going to tap the app yet. Just focus on the sensation of your finger on the screen. One... two... three... four... FIVE.

Patient: Okay — I kept my finger there for the five, felt a tiny loosening for a beat, and then my chest slammed shut and my hands started shaking so bad I was sure I'd hit something by accident. My brain immediately ran the movie: I tap, they read it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I lose everything. I can't do the actual tap alone — please tell me exactly when to press, count the five seconds out loud, and keep saying "notice your feet" / "I'm grounding myself" until I put my finger down.

Therapist: Let's try this together. We're going to work on opening the app for just five seconds. I want you to take one finger, your index finger, and gently place it on the screen. Not to tap, not to press - just to rest it on the screen. Remember, we're not going to tap the app yet. Just focus on the sensation of your finger on the screen. Inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself"... inhale... "Notice your feet"... exhale... "I'm grounding myself". Now, I want you to count with me: one... two... three... four... FIVE. As we count, I want you to keep your finger on the screen, just resting it there. Don't move it yet. Just focus on the sensation of your finger on the screen. One... two... three... four... FIVE.

Patient: My finger's still resting on the screen but it's shaking and my chest's clamped — my thoughts are sprinting and I'm terrified that if I press it'll set off the whole chain: they read it, roll their eyes, tell friends, we fight, they leave, I can't pay rent. I need you to tell me exactly when to press, count me down, and keep saying "notice your feet" / "I'm grounding myself" the whole time — don't stop until I say my finger's off. Honestly, I'm already seeing the collapse in my head and I don't trust that it'll just be five seconds.
