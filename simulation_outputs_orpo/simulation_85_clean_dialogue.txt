Patient: I'm a teacher in my early fifties and lately, since the kids moved out, I've been really on edge — little things set me off and I can't seem to manage my anger. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster: I just know they'll stop calling, my job will fall apart because I'm distracted, and everything will unravel so I'll be alone. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't make myself believe any other outcome, and it makes me snap at colleagues and my partner.

Therapist: Those little things that set you off and your mind racing with worst-case scenarios – what's one specific situation that always seems to trigger that "disaster" feeling, like a particular phone call or task that makes you feel like you're already losing control?

Patient: When my daughter's phone goes straight to voicemail, I instantly go to worst-case: I see her hurt or ignoring me, then she stops calling, then I lose my footing at work from being distracted, my partner drifts away, and I'm left alone. It feels like a chain reaction that already started, and I get so angry at whoever's around because I'm trying to control a future I "know" is coming. I know people say she might just be busy, but that possibility feels impossible to me.

Therapist: When your phone goes to voicemail, and that worst-case scenario starts playing out in your head, what's one tiny thing you could do just for 30 seconds to take the power back from that story? For example, could you take a deep breath, notice the sensation in your body, or simply ask yourself, "Is this thought really true?"

Patient: I guess I could set the phone face down and do 30 seconds of slow, counted breaths, really noticing the lift and fall in my chest. But honestly, even when I try that, my brain's already scripting the next disaster, so it feels like a useless pause before the inevitable.

Therapist: Instead of just breathing, what if you tried to catch that next thought when it comes, just for a moment, and say to it, "Wait, where did that come from?" What if you tried to ask your mind to be a little more curious about its own story, rather than automatically going to worst-case?

Patient: I mean, I can try to ask that, but the moment I say "where did that come from?" my mind just answers with an even louder catastrophe — like, "she's gone, your life is falling apart" — and curiosity gets drowned out. It feels like trying to sip water in a hurricane while my brain keeps tossing logs on the fire, and then I get furious at whoever's around for not stopping it. I'm trying to be curious, really, but it just keeps snapping back to "this will definitely happen," so it feels impossible.

Therapist: When your mind starts with that loud "catastrophe" thought, instead of trying to stop it or argue with it, what if you simply acknowledged it with a tiny, almost imperceptible gesture – like a slight nod or a tiny "hmm" – and then let it be there for just one second before gently asking, "What's the purpose of that thought?"

Patient: Okay—I tried that once: I gave it a tiny "hmm" and asked, "What's the purpose?" and my mind immediately answered, like, "It's trying to protect you, to warn you so you can stop this before she disappears or gets hurt and your life unravels." I know that sounds extreme, but that explanation feels absolutely real, and then I get furious at anyone nearby for not seeing the same emergency.

Therapist: When you say that thought is trying to "protect" you, what value is that protection really serving – is it avoiding being hurt, or is it avoiding being present with your daughter, or avoiding being your own partner? What value is that thought really trying to keep safe, even if it's using a crazy story?

Patient: It’s trying to save me from the pain of being abandoned — to avoid being alone, losing my role as a mother, and losing control of my life. My brain acts like if I can predict the disaster, I can stop it, so it magnifies every small sign into proof the end is already happening. People tell me it's about being present or accepting uncertainty, but that feels naive and unrealistic to me — I get furious when others act like there isn’t a real emergency to prevent.

Therapist: When you feel that "end is already happening" thought rising up, what's one small thing you could do to honor the value of being present with your daughter right now, even if it feels like the disaster is already unfolding – could you make a tiny gesture, like taking a sip of water or noticing the sound of her voice, without trying to fix anything?

Patient: I guess I could try something tiny — set the phone down, take a slow sip of water, and really listen to the sound of her voice for thirty seconds. But honestly, when I do that my brain screams that it's just a delay and the voicemail still means she's slipping away, so it feels like a useless performance and I end up furious at everyone for not fixing the "real" problem. I'm trying to do it, but I keep getting pulled back into the disaster story.

Therapist: When you're feeling like that tiny act of listening is just delaying the inevitable (your brain screaming that the voicemail still means she's slipping away), what if you tried to ask yourself, "What's the thought that's driving that 'delay' feeling – is it really about fixing the problem or is it about being present with your daughter?"

Patient: It's definitely about fixing — my brain screams that if I don't act, everything will collapse, so that pause feels like surrendering control. So the thought's really trying to protect me from being hurt and abandoned, not to help me be present with her. I try to ask that question and the catastrophic voice just gets louder, and then I get furious at people for not treating it like the emergency it "is."

Therapist: When you feel that catastrophic voice getting louder, and you're getting furious about not being able to "fix" the situation, what's one tiny thing you could do to subtly shift the focus from fixing to being with your daughter right now – could you take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "I'm not trying to fix anything, I'm just showing up for my daughter"?

Patient: I can try that — take the breath and tell myself I'm just showing up — but honestly when I do my brain immediately screams that it's surrender and the disaster is already happening, so the breath feels meaningless and I get tighter and then furious at whoever's around. I want it to calm me, but it feels like whispering while a loudspeaker's announcing the end, and then I end up snapping at my partner for not fixing the "real" emergency.

Therapist: When you feel that "whispering while loudspeaker" sensation, what if you tried to pause for just one moment – one single second – before trying to breathe, and instead of focusing on fixing the disaster, you simply notice the sensation of your own body holding tension, like you're noticing the weight of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I try that—pause, notice my feet—but it barely registers; my mind's already narrating the end: she's gone, work falls apart, my partner drifts away. It feels like such a tiny, useless move against that loudspeaker, and then I just get angry at whoever's around for not stopping it.

Therapist: When you notice that your mind is immediately narrating the end, what if you tried to ask yourself, "What's the thought that's driving this 'narrative' – is it trying to protect me from feeling lost, or is it actually trying to keep me stuck in this pattern of fear?"

Patient: It's definitely trying to protect me from feeling lost — it turns every little thing into proof that the disaster's already started so I have to act. I can see how that could also be keeping me stuck, but right now that idea feels impossible and I'm too drained to argue with it, so I just snap at whoever's nearby.

Therapist: When you feel that narrative getting loud again, and you're too drained to argue with the idea that it might be keeping you stuck, what if you tried to connect with the value that's actually driving this thought – the value of being present with your daughter, and staying connected to her – and ask yourself, "What would it take for me to be willing to be present with her, even if it feels hard or uncertain?"

Patient: I guess it would take something concrete — like a clear, unmistakable sign that she's okay and won't just vanish, or someone giving me a real promise that things won't fall apart. Right now I don't have the energy to sit with the uncertainty, and my brain won't accept anything less than proof, so I just end up snapping. I want to be present, but I don't know how to quiet that disaster-machine.

Therapist: What if, instead of waiting for a clear sign or a promise, you tried to create a tiny, small-step willingness to be present with your daughter right now – without expecting proof or certainty – by simply making a tiny commitment to show up with her for just 30 seconds, no matter what?

Patient: I could try—I'll force myself to stay with her for 30 seconds—but my brain already says it's just a pause before everything collapses, and I'll probably end up furious afterward. Still... okay, I can try, even if it feels pointless.

Therapist: As you commit to staying with her for 30 seconds, what's one tiny thing you could do to make that small step feel more connected to the value of being present with her – like noticing the sound of her voice, the feeling of her hand in yours, or the sensation of her breathing – and ask yourself, "What would it be like to be fully present with her, without trying to fix anything?"

Patient: Maybe I could press my thumb into her hand and count her breaths for those thirty seconds — feel the warm weight, notice the little pauses — just to ground myself. But even doing that, my brain's already shouting that it's only a delay before she vanishes and everything collapses, and it takes so much energy to do this that I just feel resentful and ready to snap.

Therapist: As you press your thumb into her hand and start counting her breaths, what if you tried to notice the sound of your own voice – the one that's whispering "she's going to vanish" – and ask yourself, "Is that voice really mine, or is it the one that's trying to control the moment?"

Patient: It doesn't feel separate — it's like my own alarm that hijacks me, trying to control the moment so I can stop the disaster before it happens. I can try to notice it, but mostly it just drowns everything out and leaves me flat and snappy at whoever's nearby.

Therapist: What if, in the midst of that alarm, you tried to simply acknowledge it – just one tiny acknowledgment – without trying to change it or use it to control the moment? For example, you could say to yourself, "That voice is here, and it's loud" – without judgment or resistance – and then pause for just a moment before turning to your daughter.

Patient: I tried that — I said to myself, "That voice is here and it's loud," but it just bounced back louder: she's gone, my classes fall apart, my partner drifts away, I'm left alone. It felt almost pointless and wore me down, and I still ended up snapping at my partner like some kind of alarm bell.

Therapist: As you felt that voice bounce back, what if you had paused for just one tiny moment before turning to your daughter – not to try to fix the disaster, but simply to notice her presence with you? For example, you could have looked at her, smiled, and said "I'm here with you" – without trying to change the narrative, just to show her you're present.

Patient: I tried that once — looked at her, gave a weak smile and said "I'm here with you," but my brain just kept screaming she's slipping away and the smile felt hollow. It hardly changed anything; afterward I was flat and snapped at my partner, so it still feels like a pointless pause before the whole thing collapses.

Therapist: When the voice of "she's slipping away" started screaming again, what if, instead of trying to change it or push through it, you had simply noticed the physical sensation in your body – the feeling of tension, the tightness in your chest – and said to yourself, "This is what it feels like when I'm trying to hold onto control"?

Patient: Yeah, I tried that — said to myself "this is what it feels like when I'm holding onto control" and I did feel the tightness for a moment, like a hollow in my chest. But my brain immediately turned that into proof: if I'm tight now, she's already disappearing, my classes will fall apart, my partner will drift away — so I snap and feel worse, not calmer. I want that noticing to help, but it just feels useless and I'm too worn out to keep battling it.

Therapist: As you felt the snap and the familiar "proof" narrative emerge, what if, instead of trying to change it or push through it, you had asked yourself, "What's the story about control that's worth fighting for?" – not about what's happening in the moment, but about what's driving this pattern of struggle?

Patient: I think the story I'm fighting for is that if I don't grab the wheel now everything will start to fall apart — she'll stop calling, my job will suffer, my partner will drift off, and I'll be left with nothing. It's really about not wanting to feel helpless or useless, like control is the only shield against being abandoned. Saying that out loud just makes me more exhausted and furious, because my brain insists that stepping back equals surrender and proof the disaster's already begun.

Therapist: What if, instead of fighting the narrative, you were to say to yourself, "I'm willing to try letting go of control for just 30 seconds – not to see if it works, but to see what happens when I don't try to fix everything right now"?

Patient: Okay... I can say that out loud — "I'm willing to try letting go for 30 seconds" — but the moment I do my brain yells that it's surrender and the whole chain of disaster is already rolling: she'll stop calling, I'll mess up at work, my partner drifts, I'm alone. I could do the 30 seconds, I guess, but it already feels pointless and I'm sort of resentful just thinking about it.

Therapist: Just before you say "for 30 seconds," what if you added one tiny word to make the commitment concrete? For example, instead of saying "I'm willing to try letting go," you could say "I'm willing to try letting go for just one second"?

Patient: Okay... I'll say, "I'm willing to try letting go for just one second." But the moment I do, my brain screams that one second won't matter — it's just a pause before she disappears and everything unravels — so it already feels pointless and I get resentful.

Therapist: What if, as you pause for just one second, you instead noticed the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – the sensation of air touching your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the feeling of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I try to notice the breath and the tiny feeling of air on my nostrils, but it barely lands — my brain's already screaming she's gone, my classes will fall apart, my partner will drift away. It feels like I'm watching the end happen and I don't have the energy to keep pretending a breath will stop it.

Therapist: As you feel the familiar "she's gone" thought emerging, what if you gently asked yourself, "What would it be like to say'she's gone' to someone else – someone who doesn't have to live with the consequences of her absence?"

Patient: They'd probably try to soothe me, but that just feels pointless — saying it out loud would make it real and kick off the chain: no calls, work falling apart, my partner drifting, and me alone. It just makes me more furious and worn out, like talking won't stop the disaster unless someone can actually prevent it.

Therapist: What if, when the thought "she's gone" emerges, you instead gently said to yourself, "That's a really hard story to live with" – not trying to fix it, but simply acknowledging its weight?

Patient: I tried saying that once — "that's a really hard story to live with" — and it just got swallowed up by the louder alarm: "it's not a story, it's already happening." It felt like a weak whisper against a megaphone and left me flat and more furious at everyone nearby, but... I can try it again even though I don't expect it to do much.

Therapist: When the alarm thought emerges again, what if, instead of trying to label it, you simply noticed the sensation of your feet on the ground – the weight of them, the feeling of the floor beneath you – and said to yourself, "I'm here, even if the story isn't"?

Patient: I did that once — felt my feet, whispered "I'm here," and my head just replayed the same tape: she stops calling, work unravels, my partner drifts away. It barely lands and it takes so much effort to even do it, but... I can try again, even if it already feels pointless.

Therapist: When the familiar "she stops calling" thought emerges, what if you instead asked yourself, "What's the physical sensation of exhaustion in my body right now – is it a knot in my stomach, a heaviness in my chest, or a dull ache in my shoulders"?

Patient: There’s this tight stone in my stomach, my chest feels heavy like I can’t catch a full breath, and my shoulders are all bunched up. The second I notice it, my brain slams that into “she’s gone” and everything’s already collapsing, so I just go flat and snap. I don’t have the energy to keep trying tiny tricks that feel pointless—what do you want me to try right now when that knot shows up?
