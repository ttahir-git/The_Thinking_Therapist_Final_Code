Patient: Lately I've been feeling stuck, like all I am is a construction worker and nothing else really matters. My mind's a fortune-telling machine that always predicts the worst — if I don't figure this out I'll lose the job, then the place, then end up alone and broke, and I can see that whole chain playing out. Since the breakup it's worse; I don't see any realistic alternative, other outcomes just feel like wishful thinking.

Therapist: What's one small thing you'd be willing to do tomorrow, just for a few minutes, if it meant you could delay that worst-case scenario for a tiny bit longer? For example, would you be willing to take a short break from checking work emails or making plans to focus on that one thing you've been putting off?

Patient: I could try doing ten minutes tomorrow morning before the site — just sit outside without my phone and write one thing I care about, nothing fancy. But honestly I can already see how it'll go: I sit there, my mind starts predicting the next screw-up, I miss a call, lose a job, and that little break won't change a thing. Still, I can try those ten minutes, even if it feels like a token move against what's coming.

Therapist: So, when you sit there writing, what might you notice about your mind's predictions? Is it like a voice in your head saying "this will definitely go wrong," or more like a nagging feeling in your chest? Can you gently say to your mind, "You're predicting the worst, but what if what's actually happening is just sitting in silence?"

Patient: It's a loud, running voice and a tight chest — like machinery that won't stop narrating the next disaster. I tried saying that line before, but it just gets ignored; the machine answers back with the next step — lose the job, lose the place — so telling it to sit in silence feels dumb and unrealistic. I'll still try to say it tomorrow out loud, even if I can already hear how it'll just come back louder.

Therapist: You're right, telling your mind to sit in silence might feel unrealistic. What would it take, just for a moment, to make room for that thought ("lose the job, lose the place") without the machinery narrating the worst-case scenario? What's one tiny value or need that saying "it's okay" to the machine could serve – for you, right now?

Patient: Maybe it just takes admitting I need to protect my ability to keep working — that little "it's okay" would serve the need to conserve my energy so I don't make a dumb mistake on site. It buys me a minute of steadiness to get through the shift and keep the paycheck, even if it doesn't fix anything else. I'm not convinced it'll silence the machine, but I can see letting it be for a bit to avoid screwing things up.

Therapist: That's a great insight – recognizing that "it's okay" to the machine serves your need to conserve energy. What's one small concrete action you could do tomorrow morning – right after you sit outside – that would make room for that thought without trying to silence the machine? For example, could you simply take a deep breath, notice your body relax, and then gently say to yourself, "I'm here to work" – without trying to change the outcome?

Patient: Yeah, I can do that — after I sit outside I'll take three slow, deep breaths, notice my shoulders and feel my feet on the ground, then say out loud, "I'm here to work" without trying to change anything. Of course my head's already narrating the rest — that pause'll make me miss a call, my boss'll think I'm slacking, I'll get written up, then fired, then lose the place — so it still feels like a band‑aid. Still, I'll try it if only to steady myself enough not to screw up on site.

Therapist: So, when you say "I'm here to work" out loud, what happens when you notice that your mind starts telling the story of what might go wrong? Can you notice that story like you're reading a book – not as if it's true, but as if it's just a story that's playing in your head?

Patient: I can try to look at it like a book, but the pages are sticky — the machine's voice drags me right back into the plot and I'm picturing the whole collapse before I finish a line. Saying "it's just a story" feels like pretending; the narration keeps supplying specifics and I can't just watch it go by without getting grabbed.

Therapist: That makes sense – it feels like you're trying to hold onto the book to keep the story from unfolding. What would happen if you simply noticed the story as it came up, without trying to control it or stop it? What would be the value of just watching it unfold, like a movie playing in the background?

Patient: I can try to imagine it like a movie, but I'm glued to the screen — the plot drags me right into losing the job, the place, ending up alone before the credits roll. Maybe if I could actually watch it without reacting I'd feel less panicked and get through the day, but that feels unlikely — the machine won't let me be just a spectator.

Therapist: What happens to your body when you feel that panic rising up – where do you feel it in your chest, stomach, or shoulders? Can you notice that physical sensation just for a second, before the story starts playing again?

Patient: It starts as a tight band across my chest, like someone's squeezing, and a hollow knot in my stomach — my shoulders hitch up and my breathing gets shallow. I can catch that for a second if I force it, but the fortune-telling machine immediately kicks in with the next disaster and drags me back into the story. I'll try to notice it tomorrow for a few breaths, but honestly I'm pissed off at how glued I am and don't expect I'll stay just a watcher.

Therapist: That's really tough – it sounds like you're feeling stuck and frustrated with how caught up you are in the story. What would happen if, just for a few seconds tomorrow, you focused on noticing that tight band across your chest instead of trying to stop the story? Would that even be enough to make a tiny difference in how you feel on site?

Patient: Maybe if I actually focused on that tight band for a few seconds my shoulders would drop and my breathing would slow just enough that I don't fumble a cut or miss a step and screw something up. But the machine's already yelling that the pause will make me miss a call, my boss'll think I'm slacking, I'll get written up, then fired — so I don't expect it to fix anything big. Still, I'll try those breaths tomorrow; if it just keeps me steady long enough to get through the shift one time, that's something.

Therapist: That's a great goal – if you can just keep your shoulders down and breathing steady for a few breaths, it might make all the difference in getting you through the shift without messing up. What's one small thing that would make it worth it to stay steady for just a few seconds – is it getting through the day without needing a break, or staying safe on site?

Patient: Mostly it's about staying safe and keeping the paycheck — if I can steady for a few seconds I won't fumble a cut or miss a step, and that helps me keep the job and the place. Of course the machine's already yelling that a tiny pause won't stop the chain and I'll still end up screwed, but I'll try the breaths anyway if only to get through today without messing something up.

Therapist: So, when you take those breaths and notice the tight band across your chest, what's the story that the machine is telling you – that a tiny pause will guarantee disaster? Can you notice how that story doesn't match what's actually happening – you're just taking a few breaths to steady yourself?

Patient: It tells me that those three breaths are the moment everything starts to unravel — I miss a call, the boss thinks I'm slacking, I get written up, fired, lose the place — like a sequence that has already started. I can see, if I step back, that right now I'm just standing by my truck breathing, not losing a job, but the machine drags me into the end-of-world version so fast it feels real. I'll try to notice that mismatch tomorrow, though I'm pissed off at how easily I get pulled back into the story.

Therapist: That's a great insight – you're recognizing how the machine is using the story to make it feel like you're already losing control. What would it be like to simply stand by your truck, breathe, and notice that you're not yet in the story – that the next moment is still yours to choose?

Patient: I don't know — seeing the next moment as mine feels like lying to myself; the machine's already got the whole collapse plotted out. Maybe standing by the truck and breathing gives me a few seconds of quiet, enough to steady my hands so I don't fumble a cut, but I can already hear it narrating the rest — missed call, write‑up, eviction. I'll try to take that tiny choice tomorrow, even if I expect it'll only delay what’s coming.

Therapist: You're right, the machine's already predicting the worst – but what if the choice to breathe by the truck wasn't about changing the outcome, but about what's happening in that one moment? Can you notice what's happening in your body when you think "I'm already losing control" – is it tension, anxiety, or something else?

Patient: It's a tight squeezing in my chest and that hollow knot in my stomach, my shoulders lift up, my jaw clamps, and my breathing gets shallow — my hands start to buzz like I'm about to drop a tool. When I tell myself "I'm already losing control" all that spikes: my heart races, my vision narrows, and the machine immediately fills in the rest — miss the call, get written up, fired, out on the street. I'm pissed off at how automatic it is, but I can try to notice those sensations for a second tomorrow even though I don't expect it will shut the machine up.

Therapist: You're noticing that when you say "I'm already losing control," your whole body goes on high alert – it's like your nervous system is on the trigger. Can you pause that thought for just a second, without trying to stop the machine, and simply notice what's happening in your body right now?

Patient: Okay — I can try to pause it for a second. When I do, the tight band in my chest loosens a hair, the hollow knot in my stomach's still there, my shoulders drop a little, my jaw unclenches, and my hands stop buzzing so much — my breathing gets a tiny bit deeper and my heart settles a notch. But the machine's already lining up the next disaster — missed call, write‑up, fired — and I get yanked back into the story before I can really breathe. I'm going to try to notice those few seconds tomorrow, even if I don't expect it to quiet the machine for long.

Therapist: That tiny pause you just made, even if it was just a hair, is still a step towards noticing what's happening right now – not just the machine's prediction. What's one small thing you could do tomorrow, when you pause the story, that would make a tiny bit of space for you to breathe again?

Patient: I'll plant both feet on the ground, take three slow breaths, and name three things I can see — just to pull my attention back into my body for a few seconds. Of course the machine's already yelling that those seconds will make me miss a call and kick off the whole write‑up/fired cascade, but I can at least try it. If it steadies my hands enough so I don't fumble a cut, that's enough reason to do it.

Therapist: That's a great plan – taking three slow breaths and noticing three things you can see will literally anchor you in your body. What's the smallest, most concrete thing you're willing to do tomorrow when you're on the job, if you can just hold onto that attention for a few seconds without letting the machine take over?

Patient: The smallest thing I'll do is this: before I start any task tomorrow I'll stop for three seconds, plant both feet, take three slow breaths, say out loud "I'm here to work," and do a quick safety check of my hands/tools/footing. I can already hear the machine screaming that the pause will make me miss a call and kick off the whole write‑up/fired sequence, but if it keeps me from fumbling a cut or falling, it's worth trying.

Therapist: That's a powerful commitment – you're willing to try this small experiment just to stay safe, even if the machine's predictions don't match up. When you say "I'm here to work" out loud, what happens to the story in that moment – does it start to feel a tiny bit less urgent, or does it still feel like a ticking clock?

Patient: For a beat it actually quiets — my chest loosens, my breathing slows, and I can focus on the task ahead. But the machine always comes back louder, like it used the pause to spit out a newer, faster collapse: miss the call, boss notices, write‑up, fired, out on the street. So yeah, it feels a tiny tick slower, maybe enough to do the job safely, but I don't believe it buys me anything beyond that short window.

Therapist: It's interesting that you mention it feels like a tiny tick slower – what if that small window, even if it's just a fraction of time, is actually enough to make a difference in your work? What's one tiny thing you could do with that small window that would make it worth holding onto, even if the machine's prediction still tries to bring you back down?

Patient: I'll use that little window to do a real safety check — plant my feet, tighten my harness/gloves, make sure the tool's secure and the ladder's stable. It only takes a few seconds and even if the machine's right about everything falling apart, at least I won't be nursing a crushed hand while the rest goes south. The machine's already yelling that pausing will make me miss a call and get fired, but I'd rather keep my hands and the paycheck than rush. I'll try it tomorrow, even if I don't expect it to stop the rest of the collapse.

Therapist: That's a great commitment – you're willing to use the small window to do something concrete that matters to you, even if the machine's predictions don't match up. What would you say to yourself right now, if you could hear the machine's voice again – what would you say back to it, instead of just letting it dictate your actions?

Patient: I'd tell it to shut up long enough to get the job done — take three breaths, check my tools, and focus on the next move. I know it'll spit out the whole collapse story and call me naive, but I'm saying, "Not now — my hands and my paycheck matter." If it starts yelling later, we'll deal with that then, but right now I need it to wait.

Therapist: That's a powerful statement – you're saying that your hands and paycheck matter, and that you're not going to let the machine's story control your actions right now. What does that feel like in your body – is there tension or release, now that you've set that boundary?

Patient: There's a small release — my shoulders drop a bit, my chest eases, and I can breathe a hair deeper. But my jaw's still clamped and the machine's already yelling that this calm is the lead‑in to the collapse, so I'm skeptical; I'll try to hold it for the shift, but I don't expect it to stop the rest of the story.

Therapist: It's interesting that you're holding onto that small release, despite the machine's prediction – what would it take for you to notice that release as something more than just a "temporary calm" before the collapse? What would you say to yourself if you could say, "I'm not just holding onto this calm, I'm actually creating space for something new"?

Patient: I'd probably roll my eyes and call it bullshit — the machine's already sketching the next disaster — but maybe I'd say, "Alright, for now this calm is mine; I'll use it to steady my hands and check my gear." I can already see the write‑up/fired chain in my head, but I'll try to hold that space long enough to get through the shift. I'm skeptical it'll lead to anything bigger, but I can try not to waste the quiet.

Therapist: That's a great insight – you're recognizing that even when you're skeptical, you can still choose to hold onto the calm and use it for something concrete, like steadying your hands. What would happen if, instead of calling it "bullshit," you said to yourself, "I'm not fighting this calm, I'm actually using it to do my job"?

Patient: I'd probably snort and call it a trick, but then try to say it anyway: "I'm not fighting this calm, I'm actually using it to do my job." For a few seconds my chest loosens and my hands steady, but the machine's already narrating how that calm is just the bait before the collapse — missed call, write‑up, fired. Still, I'll try to let that line anchor me long enough to check my tools and get the task done.

Therapist: It's remarkable that you're willing to try to hold onto that small moment of calm, despite the machine's prediction. What if, instead of trying to fight the narrative, you simply acknowledged it and said, "Okay, I see the bait. But I'm choosing to focus on this task right now"?

Patient: Yeah — I can say that out loud: "Okay, I see the bait, but I'm choosing to focus on this task right now." For a beat it actually helps — chest eases, hands steady — but the machine's already busy sketching the next catastrophe (missed call, write‑up, fired), so I'm not deluding myself that it fixes anything. Still, I'll say it tomorrow before I start a task and see if I can hold that focus for more than a few seconds, even though I'm pissed off at how hooked I am.

Therapist: That's a powerful phrase – "I see the bait, but I'm choosing to focus on this task right now." What if, instead of just saying it to yourself, you said it out loud to the machine? What would happen if you met that narrative with a clear, firm voice, saying "I'm not buying that story"?

Patient: If I said "I'm not buying that story" out loud, for a beat the machine stumbles — my chest eases and I can actually take a breath. Then it gets pissed and kicks up an even nastier sequel — missed call, boss watches, write‑up, eviction — like it's offended I called it out. Still, I'll try saying it loud in the truck before a job if it buys me a few seconds to steady my hands. If it just comes back louder, though, do I keep arguing with it or just keep doing the work?

Therapist: That's great that you're willing to try saying it out loud – "I'm not buying that story" – to meet the machine's narrative with a clear voice. When it kicks up an even nastier sequel, what if instead of getting caught up in the fight, you simply acknowledged the story and said, "I'm not buying that story, but I'm going to do this task anyway"?

Patient: I can try that — say out loud, "I'm not buying that story, but I'm going to do this task anyway." For a second my chest eases and my hands steady, but the machine almost always comes back louder and paints the next collapse — missed call, write‑up, eviction — so I don't fool myself it fixes anything. Still, I'll use that line tomorrow, but I worry: what if keeping up the arguing just wears me out and the narration gets nastier?

Therapist: What if instead of trying to "win" the argument or "outsmart" the machine, you simply used the phrase "I'm not buying that story, but I'm going to do this task anyway" as a way to create space for your own values and goals? What if, instead of trying to fight the narrative, you used the phrase to remind yourself that you're doing this work because of something that matters to you, not because of the machine's story?

Patient: I can try that — say out loud, "I'm not buying that story, I'm doing this because my hands, the paycheck, and keeping a roof over my head matter." Saying it might snag me long enough to do the safety check, but I'm pissed — the machine will already be drafting a nastier sequel about missing a call and getting fired. If it still screams, what am I supposed to do next? I don't want to just argue with it all shift.
