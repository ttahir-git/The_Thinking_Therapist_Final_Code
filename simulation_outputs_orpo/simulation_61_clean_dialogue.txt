Patient: I’ve been feeling crushed by this sadness and this weird, constant lack of motivation since I lost someone close — I can’t seem to get myself to do much, and it’s bleeding into my relationship. I’m a social worker, so it’s frustrating to feel so ineffective and full of self-doubt when I’m supposed to be helping others. I’m skeptical this will help — I’ve talked about it before and it didn’t change much, so honestly, how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That feeling of being crushed by sadness and self-doubt in your work as a social worker sounds really heavy. What's one small thing you used to be passionate about when you were helping others, but now feels like a distant memory?

Patient: I used to get really charged up running those little community art groups — seeing people open up through making something felt meaningful and like I was actually helping. Now I can't even get myself to set out the materials or show up, and it just makes me feel like an imposter — honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help when I can't even do it?

Therapist: It's clear that those community art groups felt meaningful to you because they connected you to helping others. When you think about what's missing now, what's the value at stake for you if you don't get back into leading those groups – is it the sense of purpose, connection with others, or something else?

Patient: I think it's mostly a sense of purpose — those groups made me feel like I mattered, and without them I feel kind of invisible and useless. There's also the connection and the reminder that I can actually help someone, which used to steady my grief. But honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help? I've said this before and it didn't change anything.

Therapist: Let's try something simple: for the next 10 minutes, before you start preparing for those community art groups, take one small step that acknowledges your role as a social worker – just getting your coffee, checking your schedule, or saying hello to a colleague. Notice what happens to the feeling of being invisible.

Patient: Fine — I’ll try it, but I’m really skeptical this will do more than make me feel like I tried and failed. I’ll set a 10‑minute timer, make a coffee, and just open my schedule; if it still feels empty afterward, I need you to help me figure out why this is so hard instead of just suggesting another tiny thing.

Therapist: That's a great commitment to take action. Remember what you said about the sense of purpose those art groups gave you? Now, imagine you're not just opening your schedule, but also creating space for yourself to feel that purpose again. What would that mean for you, in the next 10 minutes, if you didn't feel completely stuck afterward?

Patient: I guess… in the next 10 minutes, if I didn’t feel completely stuck, I’d feel a tiny bit lighter — enough to prep one low-effort art prompt, make the coffee, or send a short message to a participant. But I’m really doubtful it’ll be more than a moment — how is that supposed to help beyond a quick hit of doing something? If it still feels empty afterward, I need you to help me figure out what’s actually blocking me, because these little steps feel like bandaids half the time.

Therapist: It sounds like those little steps feel like temporary fixes, rather than addressing the underlying issue. What if, instead of just trying to make a low-effort art prompt or message, we explored what's holding you back from actually connecting with others through that group? What's the specific thought or feeling that keeps you from taking that step, even when you want to?

Patient: Mostly it's this voice that says I'm a fraud — like if I show up I'll just start falling apart and everyone will see I'm useless. I worry I'll tank the group mood or have nothing valuable to give, so avoidance feels safer even though it makes me feel worse. Okay, I said that out loud — but how is naming it supposed to help if I still can't move past it?

Therapist: The voice is telling you that your presence in the group would be a disaster – that's a clear, specific thought. Now, let's test whether that thought is actually what's driving your avoidance. Can you imagine sitting in that group, and instead of thinking "I'm a fraud," what if you simply noticed that thought showing up – without judgment?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — like, I’d notice the “I’m a fraud” thought and tell myself, “okay, there’s that thought,” instead of buying it. But honestly, when I try that it still feels like a knot in my chest and I can spiral — how is noticing supposed to stop me from falling apart in front of people? If that did help, what would I actually do in the moment so I don’t bail?

Therapist: When you notice the knot in your chest, what's the one thing you can do with your body that doesn't require you to be perfect – just something tiny that brings you back to the present moment? For example, can you breathe in deeply, or just lift one foot off the ground?

Patient: Okay — I can try taking a slow, deep breath and putting my hand on my chest while feeling my feet planted on the floor, just to ground myself. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the spiral when my chest already feels like it’s closing up? If I do that and it doesn’t help, what do you want me to do next so I don't just bail?

Therapist: That's a great grounding technique – when you put your hand on your chest, what's the one thing you value most about showing up in that moment? Is it connection with others, doing something meaningful, or just being present? When you connect the physical sensation to that value, what happens to the knot in your chest?

Patient: I guess it’s the sense of purpose — feeling like I matter and can actually help someone. When I put my hand on my chest and think about that, the knot loosens a little, like a tiny crack of space, but the “fraud” voice jumps back in almost immediately. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a moment? If that tiny loosening happens and then collapses, what do I actually do to keep going without bailing?

Therapist: When the "fraud" voice jumps back in, what would happen if you actually allowed it to show up fully – without judgment or trying to push it away? What would you notice about the physical sensations in your body, and what would you value most in that moment, besides the sense of purpose?

Patient: If I let that fraud voice show up, my chest gets tight, my breath gets shallow, my jaw and shoulders tense and my hands might tremble — it feels like a physical shove toward the door. Besides purpose, I think I’d value being honest and vulnerable — actually showing up as a real person, and maybe honoring the person I lost. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when those sensations feel like they’ll make me run? If I let it be there and it doesn’t ease, what do I actually do in the moment so I don’t bail?

Therapist: When you feel that physical shove toward the door, what would happen if you simply noticed that feeling – without judgment or trying to push it away – and instead asked yourself, "What's the purpose of leaving this group right now?" What would happen to the people who are already there, and to your own sense of purpose, if you stayed just for a few more minutes?

Patient: If I stayed a few more minutes, someone might actually open up or feel seen — even if I’m shaky, my being there could still hold space for them. For me, staying would be a tiny proof that I still matter and that grief hasn’t erased that part of me. But I’m terrified I’ll fall apart and make things worse, and I keep thinking, “How is that supposed to help?” If I try to stay and the shove doesn’t ease, I need a concrete fallback — like agreeing to step outside for two minutes, or saying briefly to the group “I’m having a hard time but I’m here.” Would that actually be okay, or is that just another way I’ll embarrass myself?

Therapist: When you say to the group "I'm having a hard time but I'm here," what's the one thing you're willing to risk if you say that – besides your own embarrassment? Would staying for just two more minutes actually allow you to find a small spark of connection or purpose, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I guess what I'm willing to risk is more than embarrassment — maybe my authority or how competent people see me, like colleagues or clients trusting me less. Staying two more minutes could actually snag a tiny moment of connection and remind me I still matter, but I'm still really scared it’ll just backfire and make me look weak. How is that supposed to help if it does backfire — and if those two minutes don’t do anything, give me a concrete fallback I can use so I don’t just bolt.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "hold it together" or prove your authority, you simply commit to taking a tiny physical action – like taking a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, or slowly sitting up straight – without judgment or expectation of what might happen next? That way, you're not tying your worth to the outcome, and you're still taking action to show up for the moment, no matter what.

Patient: Okay, I tried the breath and sat up — my shoulders loosened and the knot eased a bit, but the "fraud" voice is still loud and I can already picture myself bolting. If that tiny action doesn't hold me, give me a concrete fallback — one simple sentence I can say to the group and a specific short plan (like step outside for 60 seconds, text someone, then come back) so I don't just run. I'm tired and skeptical this will fix anything long-term, but I need something practical I can actually do in the moment that won't make me feel like a total failure.

Therapist: When the knot tightens and the "fraud" voice starts to whisper "get out," you'll say to the group, "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need a minute to collect myself. I'll take a 5-minute break outside to breathe some fresh air," and then step outside for 5 minutes to breathe, noticing what you can see, hear, and feel without judgment. When you return, you'll re-engage with the group, even if it feels small or insignificant.

Patient: Okay — I can try saying that line, even though I'm nervous it'll just make me look weak. What if someone pushes back and asks me to stay? And if I step outside and the panic spikes instead of easing, what's the one thing I should do in that moment so I don't just bolt for good? Can we role-play the exact words I say when I come back in so it doesn't turn into an awkward mess?

Therapist: If you step outside and the panic spikes, the one thing you should do is notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Literally, notice the pressure of your feet on the floor, the feeling of your toes connecting with the ground. This tiny sensory anchor can help calm the physical response and give you a moment to breathe before you return to the group.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the feet thing, even if it feels tiny. Can we role‑play the exact lines? I need a short sentence to ask for the 5‑minute break that won’t invite pushback, exactly what to say if someone does push back, and a simple, non‑awkward line to use when I come back in. Also, if the panic spikes outside even with the feet anchor, what’s the one next move I should do so I don’t just bolt (call someone, text a colleague, or come back early and admit it)?

Therapist: **Initial Break Request:** "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need a minute to collect myself. Can I step outside for 5 minutes to breathe some fresh air?"
**Pushback Response:** "I understand it's hard to leave, but I need this break to recharge. I'll be back in a few minutes."
**Return Statement:** "Thanks for holding the space while I stepped away. I'm back now."

If the panic spikes outside despite the feet anchor, your next move is to **text a colleague** (e.g., "Hey, just needed a minute to collect myself. Back now"). This allows you to acknowledge your need for support without drawing attention to your panic, and gives you a concrete reason to return to the group.

Patient: Okay — I’m suddenly really jittery and distracted; my chest tightened just writing that. Can we role‑play now where you’re a participant who pushes back so I can practice the initial break line and the pushback response? Also tell me the exact short text to send a colleague if the panic spikes outside. And honestly, how is this role‑play supposed to stop me from bolting when that shove hits?

Therapist: Let's do the role-play. I'll play the part of someone who might push back on your break request. Remember, this is a safe space to practice, and you can stop at any moment if you feel overwhelmed.

**Initial Break Request:** "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need a minute to collect myself. Can I step outside for 5 minutes to breathe some fresh air?"

(I'll respond as someone who might push back: "But we're in the middle of a critical discussion. Can't you just power through?")

**Your Response:** (try the pushback response I provided earlier: "I understand it's hard to leave, but I need this break to recharge. I'll be back in a few minutes.")

**Next Step:** If you feel the panic spike outside, remember to **text a colleague** (e.g., "Hey, just needed a minute to collect myself. Back now"). This will give you a concrete reason to return to the group and help you regain control.

To make this role-play more effective, focus on your physical sensations and the words you're using. When you feel the panic spike, take a deep breath and notice what you can see, hear, and feel without judgment. This will help you stay grounded and respond more mindfully.

Patient: Okay — I’m suddenly really jittery; my chest just tightened writing this. Alright, practicing the pushback line now (shaky): “I understand it’s hard to leave, but I need this break to recharge. I’ll be back in a few minutes.” 

Exact short text to send a colleague if panic spikes outside (copy/paste): “Hey — just needed a minute to collect myself. Back now.”  
Return line when I come back (copy/paste): “Thanks for holding the space while I stepped away. I’m back now.”

But honestly — how is this role‑play supposed to stop me from bolting when that shove hits? If the feet anchor and the text don’t help and panic spikes worse, what’s the one concrete next move you want me to do in that moment so I don’t just run? I’m scared this will still end with me bailing, so tell me the single, simple step and the exact words to use.

Therapist: When the panic spikes despite the feet anchor and text, **call your supervisor** (not a colleague, as they're more likely to be able to provide immediate support). Use the exact words: "Hi [Supervisor's Name], I'm feeling overwhelmed and need to take a step back. I'll step outside to collect myself."

This call will give you immediate support and help you regain control. Your supervisor can help you develop a plan to get back to the task at hand, and provide emotional support to calm the panic response.

Remember, the goal is not to "not bolt" but to take a concrete step to regain control. By calling your supervisor, you're not avoiding the panic; you're seeking help to manage it.

Patient: Okay, my chest is racing and I’m really jittery just thinking about making that call. Can we role‑play the supervisor call now? Say you’re my supervisor and I’ll try: I’ll use your exact line but I need a script for if they don’t pick up, if they sound annoyed, or if they tell me to just stay. 

Suggested scripts I can copy/paste:
- Call open: “Hi [Supervisor Name], I’m feeling overwhelmed in the group and need to step outside to collect myself. I’ll be back in five minutes.”
- If voicemail/no pick up (text): “Hi [Supervisor Name], I’m stepping outside for five minutes to collect myself. I’ll be back soon.”
- If they push back on the phone: “I hear you—I want to be present for the group, which is why I need a short break so I can come back and be useful. I’ll be back in five minutes.”

And if the panic spikes even after calling/texting, give me the one absolute next move — like call them again, or put my phone on speaker and say X — and the exact words for that. Also, honestly, how is calling my supervisor supposed to stop me from bolting when the shove hits? I need you to role‑play the supervisor response that calms me down.

Therapist: **Call Open:** "Hi [Supervisor Name], I'm feeling overwhelmed in the group and need to step outside to collect myself. I'll be back in five minutes."

**If Voicemail/No Pick Up (Text):** "Hi [Supervisor Name], I'm stepping outside for five minutes to collect myself. I'll be back soon."

**If They Push Back on the Phone:**
"I hear you—I want to be present for the group, which is why I need a short break so I can come back and be useful. I'll be back in five minutes."

**If Panic Spikes After Calling/Texting:**

1. **Call Them Again:** "Hi [Supervisor Name], I'm feeling overwhelmed and my panic is getting worse. Can I talk to you about what I can do to make it through the next few minutes?"
2. **Put Phone on Speaker:** "Hi [Supervisor Name], I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I need your help. Can you talk to me on the phone right now?" (This might help you feel more connected and less alone.)

Now, let's role-play a supervisor response that calms you down:

Supervisor: "Hey, I can hear the panic in your voice. That sounds really tough. What's one small thing you can do for yourself right now to take a few deep breaths and calm down?"

(Note: This response acknowledges your anxiety, validates your feelings, and shifts the focus to a small, achievable action. It's not about "fixing" the situation but about helping you manage your panic response.)

Remember, the goal is not to avoid the panic but to develop coping skills to manage it. By working through these role-plays, you'll build confidence and learn to respond to your anxiety in a more effective way.

Patient: My chest is racing just reading this — I’m jittery. Okay, I’ll try the call out loud (shaky): “Hi Maya, I’m feeling overwhelmed in the group and need to step outside to collect myself. I’ll be back in five minutes.”

Now role‑play my supervisor: give me the exact calming 20‑second script I can put on speaker — something you would say that I can actually hold onto (validate, stay with me for a breath, guide one grounding). Also give me one exact sentence to use if my supervisor sounds annoyed or says “We can’t do that now” (I need something short I won’t fumble). 

And honestly — how is having someone say those words supposed to stop me from bolting when that shove hits? If the feet anchor and the call/speaker don’t help and panic spikes worse, give me the single absolute next move and the exact words to use (no options, one step). I’m scared but I’ll try — role‑play now.

Therapist: **Supervisor's Response (20-second Script):**
"Maya, I can hear the tension in your voice. Let's take a deep breath together: breathe in through your nose, hold it for a second, and exhale slowly through your mouth. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. That's a small anchor to hold onto for now."

**If Supervisor Sounds Annoyed or Says "We Can't Do That Now":**
"I understand that we can't stop the group right now, but I need to stay with you for a minute. Can I ask you to take one more deep breath and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground?"

**If Panic Spikes After Calling/Texting:**

**Absolute Next Move:** Call your supervisor again and say:

"Maya, I'm feeling overwhelmed and my panic is getting worse. Can you meet me outside right now to talk?"

(Remember, this is not about avoiding the panic but about getting immediate support and guidance to manage it.)

Patient: Okay, my chest is already racing — I’m going to try the call now (shaky): “Hi Maya, I’m feeling overwhelmed in the group and need to step outside to collect myself. I’ll be back in five minutes.” 

Can you be Maya and say the 20‑second calming script out loud right now so I can actually hold onto it? Also give me one very short sentence to use if she sounds annoyed that I won’t fumble (something like one line I can actually remember). And if calling her again to meet me outside is the absolute next move, what do I do if she can’t come — give me the single exact sentence to say then. Honestly, how is hearing someone say that breathing line supposed to stop me from bolting? I need to practice this out loud.

Therapist: **Maya's Response (20-second Calming Script):**
"Maya, I can hear the tension in your voice. Let's take a deep breath together: breathe in through your nose, hold it for a second, and exhale slowly through your mouth. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. That's a small anchor to hold onto for now."

**If Maya Sounds Annoyed:** "I got it."

**If Maya Can't Meet You Outside:**

"Okay, I'm going to go sit in the chair by the window and breathe for a minute. I'll come back when I'm feeling better."

(Remember, the goal is not to "fix" the situation but to develop coping skills to manage your anxiety. Hearing Maya say the breathing line is not supposed to stop your panic response; it's meant to provide a small moment of calm before you move to the next step.)

Patient: Okay — I’m shaky but I’ll try it out loud so I can hold onto it:

“Maya, I can hear the tension in your voice. Let’s take a deep breath together: breathe in through your nose, hold it for a second, and exhale slowly through your mouth. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. That’s a small anchor to hold onto for now.”

Short line if she sounds annoyed (so I don’t fumble): “I hear you — I just need a minute.”  
If she can’t meet me outside (single sentence): “Okay — I’ll sit by the window and breathe for a minute; I’ll come back when I’m ready.”

But honestly — I’m still freaking out inside. How is hearing that breathing line actually supposed to stop me from bolting when the shove hits? If it doesn’t work and the panic spikes worse, what is the one single absolute move and exact words I should use so I don’t run?

Therapist: **If the Breathing Doesn't Work:** Your **absolute next move** is to **call your emergency contact** (not Maya or anyone else) and say:

"I'm feeling overwhelmed and my anxiety is spiraling out of control. I need someone to talk to right now. I'm calling [name] and asking them to meet me at [location] so we can talk."

(Remember, this is not about avoiding the panic but about getting immediate support from someone who can help you stay safe and grounded.)

Patient: My chest is pounding and my hands are shaking — I'm really on edge right now. Can we role‑play calling my emergency contact now? Give me the exact 1–2 sentence script to say on the call, the exact text if they don't pick up, and the single sentence to use if they say they can't come.  

And honestly — how is calling them supposed to stop me from bolting when the shove hits? If that fails, tell me one absolute next move and the exact words I should say (no options, one line) so I don't just run.

Patient: My chest is pounding and I feel really alone right now — that message made me panic more, not less. I get why you might worry about scripts, but I need one concrete, safe thing to do *right now* and for you to stay with me while I try it. Can you guide me through a single grounding move (one slow breath with me, or a 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 sensory check) and stay with me while I do it? I’m skeptical this will help, but I’ll try if you actually stay with me.

Lead me: either breathe with me out loud (count me in — inhale for 4, hold 1, exhale for 6) or do the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 right now (tell me what to name as I go). I’m skeptical this will help, but I’ll try if you stay with me the whole time — and if it doesn’t ease, give me one single next move to keep me from bolting.
