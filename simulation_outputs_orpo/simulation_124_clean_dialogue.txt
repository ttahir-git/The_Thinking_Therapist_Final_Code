Patient: I'm a chef in my mid-fifties who just moved, and lately I've been using procrastination like a way to numb this nagging depression. The problem is my brain immediately jumps to worst-case—if I don't get my act together I'll mess up service, get fired, lose my place, and end up alone and ruined—like that's the only thing that can happen. I try to be upbeat and distract myself, but I keep getting hooked on those disaster stories and then I freeze.

Therapist: When you said "my brain immediately jumps to worst-case," what's one specific situation where you freeze up that you wish you could handle differently, without getting sucked into that "I'll mess up" story?

Patient: The clearest one is a packed Saturday night when the tickets pile up and someone calls out—I'm supposed to hold the line but I freeze, because my brain screams that if I flub one dish it'll set off this chain: angry customers, the owner fires me, the place folds, I lose my flat and end up alone and ruined. I wish I could just triage the plates and ask for help, but the fortune-telling part of me won't buy any calmer outcome — all I can see is that apocalypse unfolding.

Therapist: When you're holding the line on a packed Saturday night, what's one small, dish-specific thing you could focus on doing just for the next 30 seconds that would bring you closer to serving those customers with care, rather than getting caught up in the "ruin everything" story?

Patient: I could grab the top ticket and spend the next 30 seconds just plating the next dish—spoon the sauce, set the protein, and add the garnish so it’s ready to go. But even as I do that, my head's yelling that it won't matter, one slip will still lead to catastrophe, and I freeze halfway through.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when your head starts yelling about the "it won't matter" story – what exactly is that thought saying to you? Is it "you're not good enough," "you'll fail," or something else? Can you observe that thought like a thought, without taking it on board or trying to change it – just notice it passing by, like the sound of a bird outside?

Patient: It’s basically yelling, “You’re not good enough — you’ll flub this night, get fired, lose your flat, end up alone,” like it’s narrating my doom. I can try to notice it as a passing sound, but it doesn’t feel like a thought — it feels like a movie that’s already started and I can’t hit pause. When I try to just observe it, it still drags me in and my chest tightens, so noticing doesn’t make it quieter.

Therapist: When you feel like that "movie" is starting to play again, take a tiny pause before responding to the yelling thought – literally, just pause for a millisecond, before you react. Then, without trying to change the thought or make it quieter, simply ask yourself: "What would happen if, for just this moment, I let that story stop playing?"

Patient: If I let it stop even for a second, I see myself zoning out, spooning the wrong sauce, the ticket gets mixed up, customers start yelling, the owner snaps, I'm fired, the place shuts down, and I'm on the street — it plays out like a movie and feels inevitable. I know that sounds over-the-top and maybe not realistic, but my brain won't accept any other ending, and so I freeze instead of just doing the next small thing. I'm trying to pause, but it feels like letting go of a rope that’s the only thing keeping me from falling into that whole collapse.

Therapist: What's one value that matters to you about holding down that line – what would it mean to you if you were able to do that task, not just to avoid the worst-case scenario, but because it's connected to your care for your customers and your team?

Patient: It matters because I care about my craft and about not letting my team or the guests down — holding the line feels like showing pride in the work and being dependable. If I could do it, it would prove I’m still competent, give me some dignity and stability, and mean I’m not just a flake who’s let everything slide. But the fortune-teller in my head immediately says that even that won’t save me — one mistake and all that pride and stability gets wiped out — so I can’t fully trust or feel that value.

Therapist: Notice how the "one mistake" story has become a justification for avoiding this task – instead of "I'll fail if I'm not perfect," what would it mean to you if you chose to stand for the value of pride, even if it meant taking a risk or making a mistake? What's the opposite of "that pride will get wiped out" – what would you be willing to stand for, even if it's not guaranteed to work out?

Patient: I guess I'd want to stand for showing up for the team and my craft — trying to do the best I can in the moment, even if it's messy. But my head immediately says that "doing my best" won't matter, one slip will still wipe out any pride and I'll be ruined, so it feels pointless to risk it. I'm trying to hold the idea of being present and resilient, but I'm frustrated because my brain won't let that stick without dragging me into the apocalypse story.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: for just 10 seconds, before you start plating that dish, commit to being present with your hands, noticing how they feel as you hold the spoon and the plate. Don't worry about the outcome, don't think about the "one mistake" story – just focus on the sensation of your hands moving in the present moment. Can you do that for just those 10 seconds?

Patient: I can try for ten seconds, though my brain's already screaming that in that time I'll fumble the sauce, the chef will lose it, I'll get fired and end up on the street—so it feels almost useless to try. Okay, I'll try to focus on how the spoon feels in my hand for those ten seconds, but I'm already tense.

Therapist: Notice the tension in your body as you focus on the spoon – where do you feel it most? Is it in your shoulders, your jaw, or your hands? Just acknowledge the tension without trying to change it – no effort, no judgment. Just observe it like a physical sensation.

Patient: Mostly in my shoulders and jaw — my chest feels tight and my hands get a little clammy around the spoon. I can name it, but naming it just seems to feed that doom-movie: the tightness becomes proof I'm already screwing up, and my head's off planning the fallout instead of plating. I try to just observe it, but noticing makes me more keyed up and scattered, like the body's already started the panic before I do anything.

Therapist: Instead of noticing "I'm already screwing up," try noticing "the tightness in my shoulders is just a physical sensation that's showing up right now." Avoid the story that comes with it – no judgment, no interpretation. Just observe the sensation itself, like a temporary guest in your body. What happens when you focus on that sensation, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I try to focus, the tightness actually feels sharper—shoulders squeeze, jaw locks, hands go clammy—and rather than settling it feels like proof I'm already screwing up, so my head immediately starts the whole "you'll be fired and end up on the street" movie. I'm trying to just watch the sensation, but I get jittery and scattered and can't stop spiraling.

Therapist: Take a tiny pause – just a breath – before trying to focus on the tightness again. When you're ready, notice the sensation without trying to change it – just "what is this feeling right now?" Don't try to stop it or fight it; just observe it as a physical sensation. What happens when you pause before trying to focus on it again?

Patient: I took a breath, but the pause just gave the doom-movie room to swell—my shoulders and jaw tightened more and my heart started thumping like it's already in a panic. Trying to "just notice" the tightness made it feel like proof the catastrophe is happening, and my attention kept pinging away to little checks and worries instead of staying with the sensation. I want to do the exercise, but my head immediately shoots: "You’ll flub tonight, get fired, everything collapses," and I get jittery and unfocused.

Therapist: Notice that you're using the word "just" – "just notice," "just observe." When you say "just," what's actually happening is that you're trying to force a specific outcome (focusing) onto the sensation. Instead of "just noticing," try saying "I'll observe this tightness for 5 seconds without trying to change it." What's the difference between that and "just noticing"?

Patient: "Just notice" feels vague and kind of shaming—like if I can't do that, I'm failing—so my doom-machine uses it as proof I already am failing. Saying "I'll observe this tightness for 5 seconds" is more concrete and feels like something I could actually try: it's time-limited and gives me a tiny bit of control. But even with that, my brain immediately screams that in those five seconds I'll fumble the sauce and the whole place will collapse, so I get more tense and can't hold it. I'm getting really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause just for a heartbeat – literally, just a single second – before trying to observe the tightness. When you're ready, take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I'm going to pause for one second before I try to observe this tightness." Don't think about what you'll do after the pause; just commit to pausing for one second.

Patient: Okay — I took the breath and paused for that one second, but instead of anything calming the movie just cranked louder; my chest tightened, my jaw locked, and my head flooded with the whole “you’re ruined” sequence. I want to try, but I’m really jittery and distracted right now — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take it back to just noticing the physical sensation in your body – the tightness in your chest, the lock in your jaw. Before we even think about "observing," just say to yourself: "I'm feeling this tightness right now." No goal, no intention – just acknowledging the sensation. Can you do that for just a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: "I'm feeling this tightness right now." Saying it kind of makes it worse—the chest clamps, my jaw locks, and my head instantly starts narrating the whole 'you're already screwing up' movie. I'm really jittery and distracted—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation itself, without trying to label it or think about it. Just notice where it is in your body – is it in your chest, your jaw, your hands? Where is the tightness? Can you point to it?

Patient: Mostly in my chest and jaw, with my shoulders and the palms of my hands getting clammy too — like a band across my chest and a tight knot in my jaw. When I try to point to it or focus on it, it sharpens and my head immediately starts narrating the whole collapse again, so I get more scattered. I'm really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the physical sensation. What's happening when you feel that band across your chest and that knot in your jaw? Is it like your body is holding onto something? Can you notice what that something is?

Patient: I think my body's literally clutching this rope of responsibility — like I'm holding on so tight because the fortune-teller part insists that if I loosen even a little everything collapses: one messed-up ticket, I'm fired, the place folds, I'm on the street. That band in my chest and the knot in my jaw feel like the rope pulling tighter, and the harder I try to "notice" it the more the movie revs up and drags me in. I'm really jittery and distracted right now — can we slow down a bit so I don't get swallowed by the story?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to notice the rope or fight it, you just... let it be there? As you sit with that band in your chest and that knot in your jaw, what if you simply acknowledged the rope as a physical presence, without trying to change it or fight it? No goal, no intention – just a tiny, tiny pause to notice the rope as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "just letting it be" supposed to help? If I let that rope sit there without doing anything, it just feels like I'm admitting the collapse is coming and the movie starts playing louder, like I'm waiting for the place to fall apart. I'm really jittery and distracted right now; it feels impossible to sit with it without my head narrating the worst-case.

Therapist: Let's try to reframe "letting it be" as a tiny act of curiosity: What would happen if, instead of trying to fight the rope or change the story, you simply looked at it with curiosity – not judgment, not resistance, just curiosity? What would that feel like?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's curiosity actually different from "letting it be"? If I try to be curious I picture myself poking the rope and my brain screaming that the poke'll make it snap and the whole collapse starts. Maybe curiosity would feel like actually noticing the rope's weight and how my chest tightens when I touch it—like "it's heavy, it's here"—but that already feels impossible because the fortune-teller turns even that inspection into proof I'm doomed. I'm really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the rope itself and look at what's keeping you from letting go. What's the underlying reason you're holding onto the rope so tightly? Is it fear of failure, fear of losing control, or something else?

Patient: I think it's mostly fear—fear of losing everything that proves I'm competent: the job, the flat, the respect of the team. There's also this shame thing—like if I let go and make a mistake they'll see I'm a fraud and that'll be the start of the collapse the fortune-teller insists on. So I clutch the rope hard and procrastinate to numb the panic, because distancing feels safer than risking that one slip that "definitely" ruins me. I'm really jittery and scattered right now—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "not feel" shame or "push it away," you simply noticed it as a physical sensation in your body – a knot in your stomach, a tightness in your chest? What would that feel like, without trying to change it or fight it?

Patient: It feels like a knot in my stomach and a heavy band across my chest—my jaw clamps and my palms get clammy. The stupid part is that when I try to notice it, noticing becomes proof for the fortune-teller—“see, you’re already failing,” and the whole disaster movie cranks louder. I can imagine being curious about it, but right now I’m too jittery and scattered to stay with it—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Before you try to notice the knot in your stomach or the band across your chest, take a tiny pause – just a breath. Let the thoughts and sensations be there for a moment, without trying to change them or notice them. Just be present with the feeling of being jittery and scattered.

Patient: I took the breath like you said, but instead of settling it felt like the pause gave the doom-movie more room — my chest tightened, jaw locked, and my head immediately started narrating how I'll ruin the night and lose everything. I want to let it be, I really do, but the sensations just feel louder and pull me into that collapse story, so I get jittery and scattered and can't stay with the moment. Can we slow down a bit — like, what do I do right now when the movie starts cranking up?

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you can do right now, when your head starts to narrate the collapse story, that feels safe and concrete? For example, can you touch your feet on the ground, or feel the air on your skin? Something as simple as that can help you stay present, even when the movie is getting loud.

Patient: I can press my feet into the floor and feel the weight shift, maybe count to five and notice the air on my skin — it's small and concrete so I can actually do it. Still, my brain's already yelling that it won't help and the whole collapse story is inevitable, so I'm jittery and distracted. Okay, I'll try pressing my feet now, but can we slow down after that?

Therapist: Press your feet into the floor and take a deep breath in for a count of one... two... three... four... five. As you exhale, notice the air on your skin. When you're ready, take one tiny pause – just a moment – before trying to notice what happens when you say to yourself, "I'll let it be."

Patient: I pressed my feet, counted to five, felt the air on my skin, then paused and said to myself "I'll let it be" — but the movie just cranked louder. My chest tightened, jaw locked, hands sweaty, and it felt like admitting defeat instead of help. I'm not sure I follow how "letting it be" won't just let the collapse happen — I'm confused and jittery. Can we slow down and do this in smaller steps?

Therapist: Instead of trying to "let it be" all at once, let's start with a tiny action that you can do right now, when you feel the movie getting loud. Can you take one tiny breath, just one tiny breath, before the thoughts start to come up? That's it – just one tiny breath.

Patient: Okay — I can try one tiny breath. I took it, but it barely moves the needle; my head's already screaming that one slip tonight and I'm fired, flat gone, everything ruined. I'm really jittery and distracted—can we slow down and do even smaller steps?

Therapist: Just before you try to notice the thoughts, take a tiny pause – just a fraction of a second – to notice the sensation of your body after the tiny breath. What do you feel right now?

Patient: I took that tiny pause, but I'm honestly confused—how is noticing this supposed to stop the movie? Right now my chest's a tight band, my jaw's clenched, my heart's pounding and my hands are clammy, and as soon as I pay attention my head is already narrating "you'll ruin the night" like it's proof. I'm really jittery and distracted—can we slow down and do something even smaller that I can actually hold onto?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or think about it. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the floor right now?

Patient: Yeah — I can feel my feet on the floor, a solid, heavy press under my heels and the balls of my feet. But the second I notice it the doom-movie cranks up, my chest tightens and my head's yelling I'll ruin the night, so I can't seem to hold onto that grounding; I'm confused how noticing this is supposed to help and I'm really jittery — can we slow down a bit?
