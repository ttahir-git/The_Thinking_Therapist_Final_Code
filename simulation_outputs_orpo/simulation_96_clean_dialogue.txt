Patient: I'm a senior accountant, and lately I've been on edge about job instability — I get unexpectedly angry and frustrated in conversations about work or when I worry I'll lose my job. I don't know, it's awkward to say, but that keeps coming up and it's been weighing on me.

Therapist: That feeling of being on edge about job instability really stands out. When you worry about losing your job, what's the one thing about your work that you're willing to lose before you'd rather give up your job altogether?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd be willing to lose chances for promotion or the fancy title before I'd quit — I'd rather keep the steady paycheck and routine. It's hard to say for sure, though.

Therapist: So, having a steady paycheck and routine feels really important to you. What would happen in your life right now if you could guarantee that paycheck and routine, no matter what happened with the job or promotions?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if that paycheck and routine were guaranteed I'd feel a lot less anxious and maybe sleep better. I might not snap at people as much and could pay more attention to small things—my garden, the grandkids—but it's awkward to imagine.

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start. What's one small thing you could do tomorrow to make room for that feeling of security and routine, even if it's just for 5 minutes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could spend five minutes in the morning going over my budget or writing a tiny to-do list so I know what needs handling. Maybe just sit with my coffee and breathe before I check emails — it's awkward to say, but that might help me feel steadier.

Therapist: That's really beautiful. So, what would happen if you could show up fully in your garden or with the grandkids tomorrow, knowing that you'd already made space for that steady feeling in the morning?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd be less jumpy and actually listen to the grandkids instead of being distracted by worry. Maybe I'd notice the roses and enjoy them instead of rushing. But I worry it wouldn't last — I'd probably start thinking about bills and snap back into it, and it's awkward to say that.

Therapist: So, what would it feel like to pause that thought about bills and bills when you're with the grandkids? Would it be like a tiny little pause in the breath, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it'd feel like a small hollowing out in my chest, like one slow breath where the worries step back for a moment. But I'm afraid it'll only last a minute before I'm thinking about work again — it's awkward to admit.

Therapist: That one slow breath feels like a tangible step. What if you committed to taking that breath with you for the next 10 minutes, not because you think it'll last forever, but just because it's a small way to show up for the grandkids and the garden?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — take one slow breath and hold it with me for the next ten minutes when I'm with them. I'm skeptical it'll last and it's awkward to admit how jumpy I am, so maybe I'll set a tiny alarm or stick a note by my chair to remind me. It feels doable, I think, but I'm worried I'll forget or get annoyed.

Therapist: So, what would happen if you started the 10 minutes by acknowledging that thought about forgetting or getting annoyed, and then simply brought your attention to that slow breath? Would it be like a tiny little whisper of kindness to yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess acknowledging the worry first would make it a little quieter, like a tiny whisper that I could notice and let be. It's awkward to say, but maybe that would stop me from snapping in those job-related conversations—I'll try it, though I'm worried I'll still get annoyed or forget.

Therapist: So, what if, instead of focusing on whether you'll forget or get annoyed, you simply committed to bringing that one slow breath with you into the next conversation, as a tiny act of kindness to yourself and others?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — bring that one slow breath into the next conversation. It feels a bit silly and I'm skeptical it'll stop me from snapping when job stuff comes up, so maybe I'll put a note on my phone or a sticky by the chair to remind me.

Therapist: So, what if, in the next conversation when job stuff comes up, you didn't wait for it to start snapping – but instead simply noticed the one slow breath, and asked yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I asked myself that it might slow me down a bit, like giving the anger a place to pass. It's awkward to say — I'm worried I'll freeze or sound odd in the moment, but I can try to notice the breath and ask that question quietly when it starts rising. I'll try, though I don't know if it'll work.

Therapist: That's exactly what we're going to try. When you feel that anger rising, you'll take a deep breath in, notice it in your body, and then quietly ask yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that—take the breath and ask myself the question when it starts rising. It feels awkward and I'm worried I'll freeze or snap anyway, and honestly I'm a bit overwhelmed by trying all this. Can we also talk about what to do if it doesn't help or if I still lose my temper?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge your overwhelm, and then gently shift focus to the question: what would happen if, even if you do freeze or snap, you still took that one slow breath and asked yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I do that even after snapping, it might help me calm down sooner and maybe make it easier to apologize or step away for a minute. I'm still worried it'll feel useless or embarrassing, and I'd like to talk about what to do if the breath doesn't stop me from losing my temper.

Therapist: What if, when you feel the snap rising, you take that one slow breath and ask yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?" even if it feels like it's not working – and instead of judging yourself for "not doing it right," you simply acknowledge the thought and notice how it changes your physical sensation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually did that, maybe my shoulders would drop a bit and the tightness in my chest would ease for a moment. It's awkward to say, but I'm worried it'll still feel silly or I'll freeze and then have to fumble an apology — can we talk about simple, practical things I can do right after a snap, like how to step away or apologize without making it worse?

Therapist: What if, right after the snap, you took a 2-second pause and said "I'm so sorry, I lost my cool" – without making excuses or justifying the snap, just acknowledging it and taking responsibility? That small step might help you create space for a more genuine apology or a chance to step away and regroup.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying "I'm so sorry, I lost my cool," but it feels embarrassing and I worry it'll sound fake or make things worse. Can you give me a couple of very simple follow-up lines—like something to say if I need to step away, or a short way to apologize without explaining myself?

Therapist: Here are two simple follow-up lines: "I'm so sorry, I need to step away for a minute" or "That was a mistake, can I make it right with you?" These lines acknowledge the snap, take responsibility, and give you an easy out to step away without feeling like you need to justify it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess those lines are okay, though they feel a bit formal and embarrassing. Could we try even simpler ones—like "I'm sorry, I need a minute" or "I shouldn't have said that"—and can we practice how I might say them so it doesn't come out weird?

Therapist: Let's practice saying "I'm sorry, I need a minute" with a calm, matter-of-fact tone. Try it with me: "I'm sorry, I need a minute." (pause) See how it sounds? Now, let's try "I shouldn't have said that" with a similar tone: "I shouldn't have said that."

Patient: I don't know... okay, um: "I'm sorry, I need a minute." 

"I shouldn't have said that." 

I guess they felt small and awkward when I said them — like admitting a fault out loud. Can we do a quick role-play where you bring up something about my job and I try to use those lines? I'm nervous about how they'll sound in the moment.

Therapist: Here's the scenario: I ask you about a recent project, and you accidentally reveal some confidential information. Your goal is to use one of the lines to acknowledge the mistake and step away without making excuses. Let's do this: "I was working on that project and...".

Patient: I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry — I need a minute.

Therapist: That was a great try! You got the words out, and it didn't sound too awkward. Now, let's talk about what happened next. What did you notice about your body or emotions after saying those lines?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest loosened a bit and my shoulders dropped—like a tiny bit of calm came back. At the same time I felt embarrassed and hot in the face, like I wanted to hide or change the subject, and I worried it sounded fake. I'm not sure what to do with that mix—can we maybe practice another quick scenario? I'm kind of nervous but willing to try.

Therapist: Let's try another scenario: we'll pretend that you're in a conversation with a colleague, and you accidentally reveal a small mistake you made on a project. Your goal is to use the line "I shouldn't have said that" and "I'm sorry — I need a minute" again. This time, we'll focus on noticing what happens when you feel that mix of emotions, and see if we can find a way to use it as a small moment of calm amidst the awkwardness. Ready?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready to try, though I'm nervous. If they bring it up I'll try to say "I shouldn't have said that" and then "I'm sorry — I need a minute." It feels awkward, but okay — you can start when you're ready.
