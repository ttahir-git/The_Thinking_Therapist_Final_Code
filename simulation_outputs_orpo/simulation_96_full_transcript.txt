Patient: I'm a senior accountant, and lately I've been on edge about job instability — I get unexpectedly angry and frustrated in conversations about work or when I worry I'll lose my job. I don't know, it's awkward to say, but that keeps coming up and it's been weighing on me.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the pattern of uncontrolled anger and frustration, and it's affecting your conversations about work. The core emotion you're struggling with is anxiety. Your goal is to explore the underlying value that's driving your avoidance of this feeling: What's the one thing that matters most to you about your job that this anxiety is threatening to undermine?

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of being on edge about job instability really stands out. When you worry about losing your job, what's the one thing about your work that you're willing to lose before you'd rather give up your job altogether?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd be willing to lose chances for promotion or the fancy title before I'd quit — I'd rather keep the steady paycheck and routine. It's hard to say for sure, though.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a key value at play: security and stability. Now, let's connect that value to the anxiety: What would it take for you to feel like the steady paycheck and routine were worth holding onto even when the promotion or title wasn't guaranteed? That's when the value shifts from job security to something more personal.

Therapist Answer:
So, having a steady paycheck and routine feels really important to you. What would happen in your life right now if you could guarantee that paycheck and routine, no matter what happened with the job or promotions?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if that paycheck and routine were guaranteed I'd feel a lot less anxious and maybe sleep better. I might not snap at people as much and could pay more attention to small things—my garden, the grandkids—but it's awkward to imagine.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've begun to see how the value of security and routine is linked to reduced anxiety and improved relationships. The goal now is to turn this insight into a concrete, small step towards taking action: What's one tiny thing you could do in the next 24 hours to make space for this valued feeling of security and routine, even if it feels awkward?

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a great place to start. What's one small thing you could do tomorrow to make room for that feeling of security and routine, even if it's just for 5 minutes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could spend five minutes in the morning going over my budget or writing a tiny to-do list so I know what needs handling. Maybe just sit with my coffee and breathe before I check emails — it's awkward to say, but that might help me feel steadier.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're already seeing the value of small, tangible steps towards creating space for that feeling of security and routine. Now, let's connect this moment to your valued action of tending to your garden or spending time with the grandkids: How might this small step of creating a morning routine actually make it possible for you to show up more fully in those moments, when they matter most?

Therapist Answer:
That's really beautiful. So, what would happen if you could show up fully in your garden or with the grandkids tomorrow, knowing that you'd already made space for that steady feeling in the morning?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd be less jumpy and actually listen to the grandkids instead of being distracted by worry. Maybe I'd notice the roses and enjoy them instead of rushing. But I worry it wouldn't last — I'd probably start thinking about bills and snap back into it, and it's awkward to say that.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're seeing how this small step could ripple out into other areas of your life, like connecting with loved ones. The worry you're feeling is about losing momentum, but what if we reframed it as an opportunity to practice defusion: What if, instead of thinking "I'll always slip back into worry," you could simply notice the thought without judgment, and instead choose to stay with the value of being present with the grandkids?

Therapist Answer:
So, what would it feel like to pause that thought about bills and bills when you're with the grandkids? Would it be like a tiny little pause in the breath, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it'd feel like a small hollowing out in my chest, like one slow breath where the worries step back for a moment. But I'm afraid it'll only last a minute before I'm thinking about work again — it's awkward to admit.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensation of defusion as a slow breath, and that's a great anchor. The fear is that it won't last, but what if we looked at that as an opportunity to practice willingness: What if, instead of fighting the thought that it won't last, you simply committed to taking that one slow breath, even if it feels like just a minute?

Therapist Answer:
That one slow breath feels like a tangible step. What if you committed to taking that breath with you for the next 10 minutes, not because you think it'll last forever, but just because it's a small way to show up for the grandkids and the garden?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — take one slow breath and hold it with me for the next ten minutes when I'm with them. I'm skeptical it'll last and it's awkward to admit how jumpy I am, so maybe I'll set a tiny alarm or stick a note by my chair to remind me. It feels doable, I think, but I'm worried I'll forget or get annoyed.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete plan to take that slow breath with you for the next 10 minutes, and that's a great start. The worry is about forgetting or getting annoyed, but what if we reframed that as an opportunity to practice self-compassion: What if, instead of beating yourself up for forgetting or getting annoyed, you simply acknowledged the thought and gently brought your attention back to the breath?

Therapist Answer:
So, what would happen if you started the 10 minutes by acknowledging that thought about forgetting or getting annoyed, and then simply brought your attention to that slow breath? Would it be like a tiny little whisper of kindness to yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess acknowledging the worry first would make it a little quieter, like a tiny whisper that I could notice and let be. It's awkward to say, but maybe that would stop me from snapping in those job-related conversations—I'll try it, though I'm worried I'll still get annoyed or forget.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential pathway to reducing the snap in job-related conversations: acknowledging the worry as a tiny whisper. The worry is about forgetting or getting annoyed, but what if we looked at that as an opportunity to practice willingness to show up with effort, not perfection?

Therapist Answer:
So, what if, instead of focusing on whether you'll forget or get annoyed, you simply committed to bringing that one slow breath with you into the next conversation, as a tiny act of kindness to yourself and others?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — bring that one slow breath into the next conversation. It feels a bit silly and I'm skeptical it'll stop me from snapping when job stuff comes up, so maybe I'll put a note on my phone or a sticky by the chair to remind me.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete plan to bring that one slow breath into the next conversation, and that's a great start. The skepticism is understandable, but what if we reframed it as a chance to practice experimentation: What if, instead of expecting the breath to magically stop you from snapping, you simply showed up with it as a tiny act of curiosity, and saw what happened?

Therapist Answer:
So, what if, in the next conversation when job stuff comes up, you didn't wait for it to start snapping – but instead simply noticed the one slow breath, and asked yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I asked myself that it might slow me down a bit, like giving the anger a place to pass. It's awkward to say — I'm worried I'll freeze or sound odd in the moment, but I can try to notice the breath and ask that question quietly when it starts rising. I'll try, though I don't know if it'll work.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small but tangible step to notice the breath and ask the question in the moment: noticing the breath and asking "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?" That's a tiny act of courage, and it's okay if it doesn't work perfectly – the goal is to experiment and see what happens.

Therapist Answer:
That's exactly what we're going to try. When you feel that anger rising, you'll take a deep breath in, notice it in your body, and then quietly ask yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that—take the breath and ask myself the question when it starts rising. It feels awkward and I'm worried I'll freeze or snap anyway, and honestly I'm a bit overwhelmed by trying all this. Can we also talk about what to do if it doesn't help or if I still lose my temper?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging your overwhelm and willingness to explore this further. It's normal to feel that way, especially when facing a big change. The goal isn't to "fix" the overwhelm, but to learn how to work with it while still taking small steps towards your goal.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge your overwhelm, and then gently shift focus to the question: what would happen if, even if you do freeze or snap, you still took that one slow breath and asked yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I do that even after snapping, it might help me calm down sooner and maybe make it easier to apologize or step away for a minute. I'm still worried it'll feel useless or embarrassing, and I'd like to talk about what to do if the breath doesn't stop me from losing my temper.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're considering the practical outcome of using the breath, even when it feels like it's not working. That's a great place to focus. When it comes to feeling useless or embarrassing, let's examine that thought: what would happen if you took a moment to breathe, even if it didn't immediately stop the snap? Would it be like taking a small step back from the reaction, just for a second?

Therapist Answer:
What if, when you feel the snap rising, you take that one slow breath and ask yourself "What would happen if I just breathed into this feeling for a moment?" even if it feels like it's not working – and instead of judging yourself for "not doing it right," you simply acknowledge the thought and notice how it changes your physical sensation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually did that, maybe my shoulders would drop a bit and the tightness in my chest would ease for a moment. It's awkward to say, but I'm worried it'll still feel silly or I'll freeze and then have to fumble an apology — can we talk about simple, practical things I can do right after a snap, like how to step away or apologize without making it worse?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're focusing on the physical sensations that might happen after taking the breath – your shoulders dropping and the tightness easing. That's a great way to anchor the experience. Now, let's turn to the practical question of what to do after a snap: what's one small, concrete step you could take to show up for the person you're with, even if you feel like you've blown it?

Therapist Answer:
What if, right after the snap, you took a 2-second pause and said "I'm so sorry, I lost my cool" – without making excuses or justifying the snap, just acknowledging it and taking responsibility? That small step might help you create space for a more genuine apology or a chance to step away and regroup.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying "I'm so sorry, I lost my cool," but it feels embarrassing and I worry it'll sound fake or make things worse. Can you give me a couple of very simple follow-up lines—like something to say if I need to step away, or a short way to apologize without explaining myself?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're worried about sounding fake or making things worse. Let's focus on a simple, unembellished way to show up for the person you're with. We can start with a tiny apology that doesn't require explaining yourself.

Therapist Answer:
Here are two simple follow-up lines: "I'm so sorry, I need to step away for a minute" or "That was a mistake, can I make it right with you?" These lines acknowledge the snap, take responsibility, and give you an easy out to step away without feeling like you need to justify it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess those lines are okay, though they feel a bit formal and embarrassing. Could we try even simpler ones—like "I'm sorry, I need a minute" or "I shouldn't have said that"—and can we practice how I might say them so it doesn't come out weird?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for even simpler ways to show up for the person you're with. Let's practice those lines together: "I'm sorry, I need a minute" or "I shouldn't have said that." We can start with a relaxed tone and focus on the words themselves.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice saying "I'm sorry, I need a minute" with a calm, matter-of-fact tone. Try it with me: "I'm sorry, I need a minute." (pause) See how it sounds? Now, let's try "I shouldn't have said that" with a similar tone: "I shouldn't have said that."

Patient: I don't know... okay, um: "I'm sorry, I need a minute." 

"I shouldn't have said that." 

I guess they felt small and awkward when I said them — like admitting a fault out loud. Can we do a quick role-play where you bring up something about my job and I try to use those lines? I'm nervous about how they'll sound in the moment.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to practice using those lines in a role-play scenario. Let's do a quick simulation where I bring up something about your job, and you try to use the lines "I'm sorry, I need a minute" or "I shouldn't have said that." This will help you see how they sound in a real moment.

Therapist Answer:
Here's the scenario: I ask you about a recent project, and you accidentally reveal some confidential information. Your goal is to use one of the lines to acknowledge the mistake and step away without making excuses. Let's do this: "I was working on that project and...".

Patient: I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry — I need a minute.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You used the line "I shouldn't have said that" to acknowledge the mistake, and then added "I'm sorry — I need a minute" to show that you're taking responsibility and stepping away. It sounds calm and matter-of-fact!

Therapist Answer:
That was a great try! You got the words out, and it didn't sound too awkward. Now, let's talk about what happened next. What did you notice about your body or emotions after saying those lines?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest loosened a bit and my shoulders dropped—like a tiny bit of calm came back. At the same time I felt embarrassed and hot in the face, like I wanted to hide or change the subject, and I worried it sounded fake. I'm not sure what to do with that mix—can we maybe practice another quick scenario? I'm kind of nervous but willing to try.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the physical sensations that happened after using the line, and that's great. Now, let's explore the mix of emotions: the calm, the embarrassment, the heat, and the worry that it sounded fake. We can work with that.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try another scenario: we'll pretend that you're in a conversation with a colleague, and you accidentally reveal a small mistake you made on a project. Your goal is to use the line "I shouldn't have said that" and "I'm sorry — I need a minute" again. This time, we'll focus on noticing what happens when you feel that mix of emotions, and see if we can find a way to use it as a small moment of calm amidst the awkwardness. Ready?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready to try, though I'm nervous. If they bring it up I'll try to say "I shouldn't have said that" and then "I'm sorry — I need a minute." It feels awkward, but okay — you can start when you're ready.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try, and that's a great start. Here's the scenario: I'm in a conversation with you about a recent project, and I mention that I've noticed some inconsistencies in the data. Your goal is to use the line "I shouldn't have said that" and "I'm sorry — I need a minute." Go ahead and respond as if we're having the conversation.

(Note: I'll respond as a colleague might, not as a critical or confrontational person. We're just practicing a real conversation.)

(I'll start) Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the Johnson report. I noticed that the numbers don't quite add up...
