Patient: Lately I've been leaning on talking to friends and family to avoid the ugly feelings my social anxiety brings, and it's starting to feel automatic. The minute I open up, my mind turns into this fortune-telling thing that says if I show anything real they'll judge me, then they'll pull away, then I'll lose them all and be completely alone and ruined—so I keep talking just to drown that out. I know that sounds dramatic, but it feels like the only thing I can do before the disaster sequence starts.

Therapist: When you talk to friends and family about your feelings, what's the first thing that comes up in your mind just before you open up – like the exact phrase that starts the fortune-telling story ("If I show anything real, they'll judge me")?

Patient: "If I tell them how I really feel, they'll judge me, spread it around, pull away, and I'll be left alone and ruined."

Therapist: That feeling of being left alone and ruined sounds really connected to the value of connection and belonging that matters to you – can you think of a specific time when being connected with someone else made you feel seen or heard in a way that matters to you?

Patient: A few months ago my sister came to a small show I had and stayed after to tell me she really felt something in my pieces — for a minute I felt seen and less like a fraud. It made me feel lighter, like somebody finally understood the messy part of me. But then my mind immediately says: she'll think it was a pity compliment, she'll bring it up to others in a way that makes me look weak, people will quietly pull away, and I'll end up exactly where I started.

Therapist: When you imagine your sister thinking a pity compliment about your art, what would it be like to simply acknowledge that feeling – without jumping to the worst-case scenario – and say to yourself, "That's a hard truth I'm carrying right now"?

Patient: I wish I could, but my head won't let me — the second I try to hold that thought it slides straight into the disaster script. It becomes: she'll tell people, they'll see me as weak, my gigs dry up, friends stop inviting me, I lose income and end up alone and ruined. I know it sounds over the top, but I get completely hooked and can't just sit with the feeling without the fortune-telling taking over.

Therapist: When you say "I get completely hooked and can't just sit with the feeling without the fortune-telling taking over," what would happen if, just for one tiny breath, you gave that thought a tiny label – like "that's the thought" – without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: I try, but the second I try to say "that's the thought" my head snaps back, "yeah right, that's what people say when they're weak," and the whole disaster tape starts up again — she'll tell others, they'll see me as fragile, my shows dry up, I'm alone and ruined. Labeling just feels pointless, like another thing that proves I'm exposed instead of actually stopping the story.

Therapist: What would happen if, instead of labeling "that's the thought," you tried to notice what's happening right after the thought arises – like the physical sensation in your body, the emotion, or the words that follow – without trying to change it?

Patient: I try, but as soon as the thought pops up my chest tightens, my throat goes dry, and my stomach flips—like a knot that won't loosen. Then the little fortune-telling voice pipes in: "They'll think you're weak, she'll tell everyone, your shows dry up, you're alone," and I'm pulled straight back into that movie. It doesn't feel like just noticing—those body sensations feel like confirmation, so I can't stay with them without the whole disaster script taking over.

Therapist: When the thought arises and your body reacts, what if you tried to describe it to yourself in a very literal way – like, "My chest is tight" or "My stomach is flipping" – without trying to change it or attach meaning to it?

Patient: I try to do that — like quietly tell myself "my chest is tight, my stomach's flipping" — but the second I name it my brain sneers, "that's what weak people say," and the whole disaster movie kicks back in: she'll tell everyone, my shows dry up, I'm alone and ruined. Saying it out loud or in my head feels like admitting it, which somehow makes the prediction more real instead of settling me. I don't know how to just sit with the sensations without getting dragged into the spiral.

Therapist: What's the one tiny thing you can notice in your body right now that's not connected to the thought – like the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sound of your breath, or the feeling of the air on your skin?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor—there's a steady pressure under my heels and the carpet is a little rough against my socks. But the second I notice that, my brain screams that noticing is admitting I'm fragile and everyone will see it, she'll tell others, my shows dry up, and I'll be alone and ruined.

Therapist: When you notice your feet on the floor, what if you said to yourself, "I'm noticing my feet on the floor because...?" – without trying to connect it to the thought or make it about vulnerability?

Patient: I'd probably start with, "I'm noticing my feet on the floor because I'm here in the room right now." But the second I do, my brain snaps back that saying that is admitting weakness — she'll tell others, they'll see me as fragile, my shows dry up, and I'll end up alone and ruined. I'm getting overwhelmed by how fast it pulls me into that movie; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try this: when you notice the thought, take one tiny breath – just one – before responding. That's all. No trying to change it, no pushing it away, no labeling it. Just one tiny pause. Can you do that with me?

Patient: Okay—I can try. I'm taking one tiny breath now...but as soon as I do my chest tightens and that fortune-telling voice is already yelling she'll tell others, my shows dry up, I'm alone and ruined. I did one breath, but it barely landed before the movie started; can we slow down and do another one together?

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of your chest tightening – without trying to push it away or change it. Just notice it, and then exhale slowly. When you exhale, what happens to the thought – does it stay the same, or does it change in any way?

Patient: It loosens for a breath—my chest eases a hair and the words get quieter for a second—but the thought doesn't really change; it snaps right back into the same movie: she'll tell people, they'll see me as weak, gigs dry up, I'm alone and ruined. I can try another slow breath, but it already feels like bait for the disaster tape—can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back – imagine that the thought is a small, separate bubble floating in the air in front of you. You don't have to do anything with it yet – just notice it as it is, without trying to change it or push it away. Look at that bubble – what does it look like?

Patient: It looks like a small, grayish bubble—kind of smoky and thin—with the word "weak" smeared across it, and when I look closer there are quick flashes inside: my sister leaning in to whisper, people snickering, posters for my shows getting crossed out, me sitting alone in an empty studio. The bubble feels like a magnet that pulls everything toward that ending, and I get totally hooked watching the whole disaster play out. I know some people say it's "just a thought," but that feels impossible—my brain insists it'll happen: she'll tell others, my gigs dry up, and I'm ruined.

Therapist: When you look at the thought as a small, smoky bubble, what might be happening in your body when you imagine the quick flashes inside – what sensations or emotions are present?

Patient: My chest clamps up, my throat goes dry, my stomach knots, and my hands go cold — my breath gets shallow and my jaw tightens. Emotionally it's this sharp shame and a sinking dread, like grief for the future loss I already see. And then those sensations feel like proof to my brain: if I feel this, she'll tell others, my shows dry up, I'm ruined — so I get totally glued to the movie and can't look away; can we slow down?

Therapist: When you feel the chest clamping up and the shame sinking in, what's the one thing you can notice about that sensation that doesn't involve the thought – is there a place in your body where it's not happening, or a sensation that feels opposite to that pain?

Patient: I can feel a little warmth at the back of my neck and steady pressure under my feet — those spots don't clamp like my chest does. But the second I notice them my brain sneers that noticing is admitting I'm fragile, and the whole movie starts up again: she'll tell people, my shows dry up, I'm ruined. Can we slow down?

Therapist: When you notice the thought starting to play the movie again, take one tiny breath and say to yourself, "That thought is here." That's it – just acknowledge its presence, without judgment or effort. What happens next?

Patient: I take the breath and tell myself "that thought is here," and for a tiny second it actually softens like a crack in the tape. Then my brain immediately sneers, "that's what weak people say," and the disaster movie floods back—she'll tell everyone, my shows dry up, I'm alone and ruined. I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed by how fast it snaps back; can we slow way down?

Therapist: When the thought starts to play the movie again, take another tiny breath and focus on the pause between acknowledging it ("that thought is here") and the brain's reaction – notice the space between those two moments, without trying to change anything. What does that pause feel like?

Patient: It's a hair-thin gap — like the tiny hollow between two train cars — where the chest unclenches a notch and the static quiets for a breath. It feels cool and almost empty, like an eyelid closing for a second, but it's so fragile my brain is already queuing up the next catastrophe and the movie snaps back on. Can we slow down and try to stay in that little space a bit longer?

Therapist: When the chest unclenches a notch and the static quiets for a breath, notice what happens to the sensation of your chest – what does it feel like to let go of that tension for just one moment? As for the thoughts, what's the first thing that arises when the movie snaps back on – is it the same story, or is there a slight variation?

Patient: When it lets go for a beat it feels like the pressure just thins out — a cool hollow under my sternum, my breath comes a touch deeper, and everything feels... looser, almost like there’s a tiny gap where panic can’t grab me. But the movie snaps back so fast it's like someone rewinds and presses play: same script — she'll tell everyone, they'll see me as weak, gigs dry up, I'm ruined — sometimes with extra details, like she'll exaggerate or someone will make a joke that spreads and it all escalates. I get stuck watching that replay and can't stay in the quiet; can we slow down and sit in that little gap a bit longer?

Therapist: When the chest unclenches and the static quiets for a breath, notice the sensation of the pressure thinning out – what does it feel like to let go of that tension for just one moment? As for the thoughts, what's the first thing that arises when the movie snaps back on – is it the same story, or is there a slight variation? Try to notice the tiny details, like the tone of the voice or the facial expression – what makes this version slightly different from the last one?

(Also, I'm going to pause here for a moment. Can you take one tiny breath and notice how you're sitting with this question? What's the sensation in your body, and what's the thought that arises when you think about staying in that little gap?)

Patient: When it thins out for that beat it feels like a cool hollow under my sternum and my breath slips a little deeper — a tiny, almost-empty space where the tightness eases. When the movie snaps back it's basically the same story but with meaner, sharper details: her voice sounds mocking instead of pitying, someone posts a joke about me that gets shared, a promoter quietly drops me — the tone becomes ridicule instead of concern. I'm jittery right now, my hands keep fidgeting and my attention keeps jumping to, "This calm won't last — it's bait for the disaster," so it's getting harder to stay in the gap; can we slow down and sit in that space a bit longer?

Try to notice the tiny details, like the tone of the voice or the facial expression – what makes this version slightly different from the last one? 

Notice how your body is responding to the thought "This calm won't last – it's bait for the disaster" – what's the physical sensation in your body when you think that?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow, my heart starts fluttering, my hands go buzzy and my jaw clenches — like my body's gearing up to escape. Right after that the fortune-teller kicks in: they'll notice I’m shaking, they'll think I'm pathetic, someone will make fun of me, my gigs vanish, and I'm ruined. I'm getting really jittery just saying that — can we slow way down and try to stay in that tiny gap a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice how your body is responding to the thought "they'll notice I'm shaking, they'll think I'm pathetic" – what's the physical sensation in your body when you think that? Try to notice it without judgment – don't try to change it or push it away. Just observe it, like a cloud passing across the sky.

Imagine you're sitting in a chair, feeling the seat beneath you – what's the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Can you stay with that sensation for just one breath?

Patient: I can feel my heels pressing into the floor and the rough carpet under my socks. I take one breath and for a blink it roots me—my chest loosens a little and the air feels steadier. But it snaps back fast: they'll see me trembling, they'll think I'm pathetic, someone will make a joke that spreads, my shows dry up, I'm ruined. I'm really jumpy and my attention keeps darting—can we slow down and try to stay in that little gap for a few breaths?

Therapist: Notice how your body is responding to the thought "they'll see me trembling, they'll think I'm pathetic" – what's the physical sensation in your body when you think that? Try to notice it without judgment – don't try to change it or push it away. Just observe it, like a cloud passing across the sky.

Let's try a tiny experiment: as you breathe out, say the word "let go" to yourself – just one word, without judgment. What happens in your body when you say that word?

Patient: When I whisper "let go" on the out-breath there's this half-second where my jaw unclenches and my chest thins out — it actually feels real for a blink. Then my brain screams it's a trap, my heart races, my hands buzz, and the movie floods back louder: they'll see me as pathetic, someone will make a joke, my shows dry up, I'm ruined. I'm jittery and distracted now — can we slow way down and try it again more slowly?

Therapist: Let's try to "pause" between the two moments – the moment you say "let go" and the moment your brain screams "trap". Imagine you're holding a tiny breath between those two moments. What happens in your body when you're holding that breath? What sensations arise, and what thoughts come up?

Notice that you're still trying to push the thought away ("it's a trap") – what if you just allowed it to be there, without judgment? What would that feel like?

Patient: When I hold that tiny breath my whole body locks — jaw clenches, hands buzz, my head goes a bit woozy and my chest feels squeezed. For a hair it's quieter, like the panic backs off, but then "it's a trap" bolts in and the movie rewinds: they'll see me as fragile, they'll laugh, promoters drop me, my shows vanish, I'm ruined. Letting the thought just be feels impossible — it somehow makes the disaster more real, like I'm handing it permission. I'm getting really jittery and distracted — can we slow way down and actually sit in that gap for several breaths?

Therapist: Let's try to "anchor" the thought "it's a trap" by noticing what happens in your body when you say it to yourself. What sensations arise, and what emotions come up? Notice that you're trying to push it away ("handing it permission") – what if you just allowed it to be there, without judgment? What would that feel like?

Imagine you're holding a tiny stone that represents the thought "it's a trap". What would happen if you just held it, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: If I hold that little stone it feels heavier than it should — rough and warm, my palms go clammy and my pulse skips. The weird thing is the more I study it, the faster the fortune-telling kicks in: holding it is like admitting the trap, so of course she'll tell others, jokes spread, promoters bail, my shows disappear and I'm ruined. I can't seem to just hold it without the whole disaster movie starting, and now I'm jittery and my attention keeps darting — can we slow way down and try to sit with it for a few breaths?

Therapist: Let's try to "observe" the thought "it's a trap" without judgment. Imagine you're watching a movie, and you're not participating in it – you're just observing the characters and the story. What does the thought look like when you're watching it from a distance? What emotions arise, and what sensations do you notice in your body?

Notice that you're still trying to push the thought away ("the whole disaster movie starting") – what if you just allowed it to be there, without judgment? What would that feel like?

Patient: From a distance it looks like a cheap horror film on repeat—grainy, with "weak" stamped across the credits and little scenes of people laughing and posters getting crossed out. Emotionally it's sharp shame and a sinking dread; physically my chest clamps, my jaw tightens, my hands buzz, and my attention keeps darting to the next catastrophic frame. Letting it "just be" feels like handing it the keys—if I do that it'll go straight to the worst: she'll tell others, jokes spread, promoters bail, my shows vanish, I'm ruined—so I can't believe staying distant would help. I'm really jittery and distracted right now; can we slow way down and try to sit with it for a few breaths longer?

Therapist: Let's try to "let go" of the need to control the thought. Imagine you're holding a balloon with the thought "it's a trap" written on it. What would happen if you just let the balloon float away, without trying to hold onto it? What would that feel like for your body and your mind?

Notice that you're still trying to control the thought ("staying distant would help") – what if you simply allowed it to be there, without judgment? What would that feel like?

Patient: If I let the balloon go for a second it actually feels lighter—my chest eases a hair and there's this tiny lift, like the air under my ribs opens up. But it hardly floats away before my brain yanks it back and I see it snagging on a hook: she'll mention it to someone, they laugh, a promoter drops me, my shows dry up, I'm ruined. Physically I get jitterier—hands buzzing, breath shallow, jaw tight—and mentally I can't trust "letting go" because it feels like giving the thought permission to come true. I'm really distracted and on edge right now; can we slow down and try staying with that tiny lift for a few breaths?

Therapist: Let's try to "hold" onto that tiny lift for just a moment longer. Imagine you're holding onto the tiny sensation of your chest easing, and the air under your ribs opening up. What does that feel like for your body? What sensations arise, and what emotions come up?

Notice that you're still trying to control the thought ("giving it permission to come true") – what if you simply allowed the sensation of the lift to be there, without judgment? What would that feel like?

Patient: When I hold that tiny lift it actually feels like my ribs have a little space — my breath slips deeper, there's a quiet warmth behind my neck and a tiny hopeful flutter, like for a second the panic lost its grip. But the second I notice it my head yells it's bait and the movie rewinds: she'll mock me later, someone posts a joke, promoters bail, my shows dry up, I'm ruined. I'm really jittery and my hands won't stop fidgeting — I can't seem to let that lift just be without the disaster snapping back; can we slow down and stay with it for a few more breaths?
