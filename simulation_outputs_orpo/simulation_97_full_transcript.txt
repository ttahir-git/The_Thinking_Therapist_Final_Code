--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Honestly, I've been obsessing about how I'd perform at a job — even though I'm unemployed I keep replaying interviews and imagining screwing up, and that worry just freezes me and turns into procrastination. With the PTSD and money stress layered on top, it feels impossible to get moving. I don't really see how talking about it will help, but I'm here.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and fear about your future job performance. The PTSD and financial stress are amplifying the anxiety. Goal: Explore the tangible cost of this avoidance behavior to create space for action.

Therapist Answer:
That replaying of interviews sounds like a huge emotional weight to carry. When you imagine "screwing up," what's one specific thing that happens in your body right before you freeze into procrastination? Is it your chest tightening, your legs feeling heavy, or your mind going blank?

Patient: My chest tightens and my throat kind of closes up, then my head goes foggy like someone flipped off the lights — I can't pull words together. After that I just distract myself with busywork or doom-scroll instead of starting whatever I should. How is noticing that supposed to help? I've tried breathing stuff before and it doesn't stick.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Noticing the physical sensations is a small step towards acknowledging the avoidance process. The connection to breathing hasn't been sustainable, so we need to pivot. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
I understand you're skeptical, but notice what happens just before you start those distractions – you're already "frozen," and it feels like a choice. What would it take for you to start working on that job search, even just 5 minutes, without the distraction of doom-scrolling?

Patient: I guess a ridiculously tiny step — like someone telling me to set a two-minute timer and just open the resume file — might get me to do five minutes. Or having someone check in 10 minutes later so I feel accountable could help, but I've done timers and accountability before and still end up doom-scrolling. How is that supposed to help when my chest tightens and my head goes dark? I need something that actually breaks that freeze, not another trick that feels useless.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a tangible step that addresses the freeze, not just another strategy. The timer and accountability worked previously, but the struggle persists. Goal: Explore the value of "not doing" something – creating space for the chest tightens.

Therapist Answer:
What if, for just 10 seconds, you simply stopped fighting the freeze and let that physical sensation be present – without trying to breathe, distract, or "do" anything – just observe it, like a leaf on water?

Patient: Okay... fine, I’ll try it for ten seconds. Right now my chest feels like it’s being squeezed, my throat closes, and the thought “I can’t” is on repeat — letting that sit feels like tempting a breakdown. I focused on the pressure and the fog: it didn’t vanish, but it got a hair less all-consuming and I didn’t immediately grab my phone. Still—how is that supposed to turn into actually opening the resume and doing work, not just tolerating the panic for ten seconds?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the first step into the discomfort, and it's not vanishing immediately – that's okay. The goal isn't to eliminate the panic, but to create space for it. Goal: Connect the tiny moment to the value of taking action despite the discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
Just as you noticed the fog get a hair less all-consuming, what would it mean to take one tiny action – like opening that resume file – not to "fix" the panic, but because it's connected to the value of exploring job opportunities?

Patient: I guess it would mean doing something small on purpose — not to erase the panic but to prove to myself I can move even when I'm frozen, like a tiny act of defiance against the whole “I’m broken” story. Maybe that little win would slowly chip away at the dread and make the next step feel less impossible. I'm skeptical — timers and pep talks haven't worked — but if you actually stayed with me for those first few minutes or asked me to read the first line out loud, I might actually open the file instead of doom-scrolling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're turning the panic into a small act of defiance, which is a powerful shift. The skepticism is valid, but we're not trying to force a magic solution; we're exploring a tiny step that might build momentum. Goal: Introduce the idea of "reading aloud" as a low-stakes, concrete action.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like to try something simple: would you read the first sentence of your job search statement out loud to yourself, right now, without any expectation of success?

Patient: Alright, fine — I'll say it out loud: "I am applying for customer service and office support roles where I can use my communication and organizational skills to help teams run smoothly." Saying it didn't make the chest tightness vanish, but it felt like a tiny, stubborn step — still skeptical, though: how is that supposed to help beyond a momentary nudge? Can you stay with me and ask me to open the resume file now? I need that check-in or I'll probably just doom-scroll.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The first sentence is out loud, and it's a small step forward. Now we need to build on that momentum. Goal: Ask you to open the file in a gentle, non-judgmental way.

Therapist Answer:
That takes courage to say it out loud. I'm not asking you to do anything more than that next tiny step – just: would you open the resume file that's on your computer or phone right now, and take a look at it for just 30 seconds?

Patient: Alright, fine — I'm opening it now. It's open; my chest's tight and my hands feel clumsy, but I can see the top paragraph — please check back in 30 seconds and ask me what line caught my eye, because if you don't I'll probably doom-scroll.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've opened the file, and now we need to gently coax you into looking at the words. Goal: Create a gentle check-in to keep you engaged.

Therapist Answer:
Just 30 seconds. I'll check back in. For now, I'm just going to say: what's the first line that stands out to you in this top paragraph?

Patient: "The phrase 'help teams run smoothly' — it hit me like, huh, that actually sounds like something I want to be doing. My chest's still tight and my hands are clumsy, but that's the line that caught my eye. How is noticing that supposed to actually get me to hit 'apply' though?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the line that resonated with you, and now we need to bridge the gap between noticing it and taking action. Goal: Connect the line to a concrete next step.

Therapist Answer:
That line "help teams run smoothly" is specific to what you want to do. What's one small thing you could do right now, with this clumsy hand, to take a tiny step towards making that happen?

Patient: I can paste "help teams run smoothly" into the first line of a cover message and hit "save draft" — it's tiny and reversible. I'll do it if you actually stay with me for two minutes and ask me what I changed, because otherwise I'll just doom-scroll. And honestly, how is pasting a line supposed to bust the freeze for good?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a tiny, reversible step that's within your reach. Now we need to create a sense of accountability and connection to the action. Goal: Connect the act of saving to a value.

Therapist Answer:
I'll stay with you for two minutes. Right now, you've pasted "help teams run smoothly" into the cover message. What's one value or reason that keeps you from hitting "apply" – is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's fear of failure and perfectionism — if I hit apply and get rejected it feels like proof I'm not good enough, so I stall to avoid that verdict. There's also this idea of protecting myself from more disappointment and the chaos of money stress — ironically, avoiding action makes the situation worse. But seriously, how is just naming that supposed to actually get me to press "apply"?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core drivers of your freeze: fear of failure, perfectionism, and protecting yourself from financial stress. Now we need to connect those to a value that's worth taking action for. Goal: Introduce a "what's worth it" question.

Therapist Answer:
Those fears are weighing you down, but what's one thing that would happen if you hit "apply" and got rejected – is it that you'd learn something new, you'd be one step closer to financial stability, or something else?

Patient: I guess one thing is I’d get data — like whether my resume and message land, or what parts I need to change, so it slowly chips away at the “I’m worthless” story. But yeah, rejection would still feel like a punch and it doesn’t magically fix the money stress, so I’m skeptical that “data” is enough. If you actually stay with me and prompt me to hit apply in 30 seconds, I’ll try — otherwise I’ll just doom-scroll and convince myself the whole exercise was pointless.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the data to a potential payoff, but still worry about the underlying story. Now we need to pivot to actionability. Goal: Make the 30-second prompt actionable.

Therapist Answer:
You're right that data isn't a magic fix, but it's a crucial step. I'll stay with you for 30 seconds. When I ask you to hit "apply," I want you to do it not because I'm asking you to overcome your fears, but because we've established that data is a tangible step towards the value you care about – getting closer to financial stability. Here's the deal: in 30 seconds, I want you to press the "apply" button, and as soon as it's done, I'll ask you to share what specific action you're taking next, even if it's just a tiny tweak to your cover message.

Patient: Okay — I clicked "apply." My chest was tight and my hands felt clumsy, but it's sent. Next I'll edit one bullet to emphasize "team coordination and reliable support" and save the updated resume, then draft a one-line follow-up message. Can you stay with me and check back in 5 minutes to ask what I changed? I'm skeptical this will fix anything, but I'm doing it.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've taken action, and now we're iterating on the small step. Goal: Connect the editing process to the value of taking control.

Therapist Answer:
That's the spirit! You've taken the first action after clicking "apply." Now, let's make the editing process meaningful. What is it about emphasizing "team coordination and reliable support" in that bullet point that feels most important to you – is it that it makes your skills sound more valuable, or something else?

Patient: Because it sounds concrete — not braggy — and actually shows what I'd do day-to-day, not some vague buzzword. It pushes back on that "I'm worthless" story and makes me feel slightly less terrified of sending applications. Still skeptical it’ll be enough to land a job, but okay — can you hang with me while I change that bullet?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the editing process to making your skills sound concrete and valuable. Now we need to hold onto that momentum. Goal: Keep the value-focused mindset while editing.

Therapist Answer:
That's the right focus – making your skills sound concrete and valuable. As you edit that bullet point, I want you to notice what's happening in your body. What physical sensations are showing up now that your skills sound more concrete – is your chest feeling a little less tight, your hands feeling a little more steady?

Patient: My chest's a touch less tight and my hands are a bit steadier — like a tiny crack in the fog — but everything feels heavy and slow, like I barely have the energy to keep going. Noticing helps a little, but how is that actually supposed to stop me from slipping back into doom-scrolling? Can you hang with me while I finish this edit so I don't bail?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've noticed a tiny crack in the fog, and that's a great sign. Now we need to anchor that progress in action. Goal: Use the momentum to commit to the next step.

Therapist Answer:
That crack in the fog is worth holding onto. Now, I want you to commit to finishing that edit – just one more small step. As you type those new words, I'll ask you to do one tiny thing: type the entire sentence out loud, just for a second. That's it. Just one tiny sentence out loud.

Patient: " I coordinate schedules and provide reliable administrative support to help teams run smoothly."

Saying that loosened my chest a hair, but everything still feels heavy and slow. Can you hang with me while I paste it into the resume and save, and check back in two minutes to ask what I changed? I'm skeptical, but I'll do it.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've typed it out loud, and that's helped loosen your chest. Now we're about to take action on the physical page. Goal: Connect the act of saving to the value of taking control.

Therapist Answer:
That sentence sounds clear and concrete. Now, let's make saving it to the resume a tangible step. As you paste it in, I want you to notice what physical sensation happens when you click "save" – is your hand feeling a little lighter, your mind feeling a little clearer? And then, I'll check in in two minutes to ask you what's changed next.

Patient: Okay — I pasted it and hit save. My hand felt a tiny bit lighter and my chest eased a notch, but everything still feels slow and like I'm moving through mud. I'll try to draft that one-line follow-up now, but I'm skeptical this will stop me from doom-scrolling; please check back in two minutes and ask what I changed so I actually finish it.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've saved the update, and that physical sensation helped ease your chest. Now we're about to take action on the next tiny step. Goal: Use the momentum to draft that one-line follow-up.

Therapist Answer:
That one-line follow-up is within reach. As you draft it, I want you to remember that the goal isn't to write a perfect message; it's to get something down on paper that shows you're moving forward. What's one sentence that comes to mind when you think about what you'd say to follow up on that updated bullet point – just one sentence, not a whole paragraph?

Patient: Hi — I've updated my resume to highlight my experience coordinating schedules and providing reliable administrative support to help teams run smoothly, and I'd appreciate the chance to discuss how I can contribute.


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've drafted that one-line follow-up, and it's a great start. Now we're going to make it concrete. Goal: Commit to sending it.

Therapist Answer:
You've written the sentence, and now it's time to send it. I'll ask you to do one tiny thing: send that message to one person's email address right now – it can be a generic email address, like "careers@example.com." That's it. Just send it.

Patient: Okay — my chest just jumped and my hands are shaking a bit, so honestly I’m panicking about pressing send. How is that supposed to help again? But… I need you to stay with me, so I’ll do it if you check back in two minutes.

I hit send to careers@example.com. My heart’s racing and the “what if I screwed it up” loop is already starting. Next I’ll set a five-minute timer to draft one more quick application — can you check back in five minutes and ask what I changed?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The panic is understandable, but we need to acknowledge it and work with it. Goal: Connect the physical sensations to the value of taking action.

Therapist Answer:
That panic is a sign that you're moving past the comfort zone, and that's progress. The shaking hands and racing heart are physical reminders that you're taking a risk – a risk that can lead to growth. As you start the timer for the next application, I want you to notice what's holding you back – is it fear, perfectionism, or something else? What's the one thing that's preventing you from drafting that application right now?

Patient: Mostly it's the fear of rejection and the voice that says one more "no" equals I'm worthless — that makes me freeze. My chest's tight, my hands are shaky, and my head keeps pinging off useless thoughts so I can't focus. How is being aware of that supposed to make me actually finish the draft? I'll set the five-minute timer now, but you need to check back in five minutes or I’ll just doom-scroll.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core driver of your freeze: the voice of worthlessness. Goal: Reframe that voice into a tangible step.

Therapist Answer:
That voice is a story you've told yourself before – a story that's not true. As you start the timer, I want you to notice one thing: what's one tiny action you can take right now that would move the story forward, even if it's just writing one sentence? Not "I'll finish the entire application" – just "I'll write one sentence." Can you do that?

Patient: I can write one sentence: "I bring reliable scheduling and administrative support skills and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help your team." 

Okay, I'll type that now and start the five-minute timer — my chest's tight and my hands are jittery, and I'm skeptical this will actually change anything, but I'll do it if you check back in five minutes and ask what I wrote.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've written the sentence, and that's a tangible step. Goal: Connect the action to the value of taking control.

Therapist Answer:
You've typed the sentence, and now it's time to take a small victory. I want you to notice what's changed in your body – is your chest feeling even tighter, or is the jitteriness starting to subside? As you look at that sentence, I want you to ask yourself: what's one thing that's different about how I'm feeling right now compared to when we started?

Patient: It's a tiny shift — my chest's a notch less tight and the urge to doom-scroll isn't as immediate, but my head's still buzzing and everything feels slow and heavy. Feels like a crack in the fog, not a real fix, and I'm skeptical this will stick. Can you check back in five minutes and ask me what I wrote so I don't bail?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged the tiny shift, and that's progress. Goal: Build on that momentum.

Therapist Answer:
That crack in the fog is exactly what we're working with. As you wait for the timer to go off, I want you to imagine what would happen if you took just one more tiny step – just one more sentence to add to your application. What's the one thing that would make you feel slightly more in control, slightly more like you're moving forward?

Patient: " I'm organized, dependable, and committed to improving team efficiency through clear communication and proactive support." Writing that would make me feel a bit more in control because it's concrete and useful to paste in — my chest's still tight and my mind's jittery, but can you check back in two minutes to ask what I actually added so I don't bail?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've added another sentence, and that's concrete progress. Goal: Celebrate the small win and make it a tangible step forward.

Therapist Answer:
That sentence is a powerful addition – it's specific, useful, and shows you're thinking about how you can help the team. As you wait for the timer to go off, I want you to notice what's different about how you're feeling right now compared to when we started: what's one thing that's shifted, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: A tiny shift — my chest's a notch less tight and the urge to doom-scroll isn't immediate anymore, so there's a small sense that I actually did something. Everything's still slow and foggy and I'm skeptical this will stick; can you check back in two minutes so I don't bail?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged the tiny shift, and that's progress. Goal: Build on that momentum and make it a habit.

Therapist Answer:
That sense of accomplishment is real – you've taken action, and it's made a difference. As you wait for the timer to go off, I want you to think about what you're going to do with this small win: what's one thing you're going to do tomorrow to keep moving forward, even when it feels slow and foggy?

Patient: Okay — tomorrow I’ll block two short, timed sessions: 25 minutes in the morning to find and submit two tailored applications, and 25 minutes in the afternoon to personalize follow-ups and tweak my resume. I’ll set calendar alerts and put my phone across the room so I don’t doom-scroll, though I’m not convinced this will actually land me anything. Can you check in with me tomorrow and ask whether I did those blocks so I don’t bail?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've set a plan, and that's concrete action. Goal: Make tomorrow a step towards building momentum.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great plan – breaking it down into smaller blocks makes it manageable. As you prepare for tomorrow, I want you to notice one thing: what's the one thing you're most afraid of happening if you don't follow through with tomorrow's plan?

Patient: That I’ll spiral further into money trouble and that every missed day will feel like proof I’m worthless — and eventually I won’t be able to keep a roof over my head or get back on my feet. Everything feels heavy and slow, so the fear usually just freezes me and makes the loop worse. Can you check in tomorrow and ask if I did those two 25‑minute blocks? I need that or I’ll just doom‑scroll — and honestly, how is naming the fear supposed to actually stop it?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've named the fear, and now we need to connect it to action. Goal: Create a small step that moves you past the fear.

Therapist Answer:
That fear is a story you've told yourself before – a story that's not true. When you feel that freeze coming, what's one tiny thing you can do right now to take a small step towards those blocks tomorrow?

Patient: I can do one tiny thing right now: create the two 25‑minute calendar events for tomorrow with alerts and put my phone across the room so it’s harder to doom‑scroll. I’ll set them now — I’m moving slow and it feels like effort, and I’m still skeptical this will stick, so please check in tomorrow and ask if I actually did them.
