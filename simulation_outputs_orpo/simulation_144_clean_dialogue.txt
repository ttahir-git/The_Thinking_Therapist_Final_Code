Patient: I've been throwing myself into painting and every hobby I can find to numb this grief since my last kid moved out. The problem is when I start a project I immediately picture the worst — the shows tank, galleries stop calling, I lose my savings and my apartment, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's just how it will go. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but that feels unrealistic to me.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios sound really painful. When you start a project, what's the one thing you're trying to avoid that's making that worst-case picture feel so real? Is it the fear of failure, or something else?

Patient: It's the fear of ending up totally alone and erased — not just one flop, but that domino effect where a bad show means no gigs, no money, losing my place, and everyone drifts away. I know people say that's extreme, but when I start something that's exactly the future I see and I can't make myself believe otherwise.

Therapist: When you're painting, what's one small thing you'd be willing to create just for yourself, even if it means it might not be "perfect," without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: Maybe a tiny 4x6 postcard — just scraps, paint, no pressure, something I can shove in a drawer. I tell myself it's just for me, but the minute I make it I picture someone finding it, mocking it, it becomes a joke, that leads to a bad review, then no galleries, then everything collapses — that's how it always goes. I know people say that's over the top, but it still feels like the only realistic path.

Therapist: Before you create that tiny postcard, can you try saying to yourself, "I'm making this just for me, and if someone sees it, they might think it's silly, but I'm willing to take that chance because it means I'm creating something for myself"?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — "I'm making this just for me, and if someone sees it, they might think it's silly, but I'm willing to take that chance because it means I'm creating something for myself." But the minute I say it I can see someone finding it, posting it, people laughing, a bad review, galleries closing, and everything collapsing. I know that sounds dramatic, but saying it feels like tempting fate and it doesn't make those images stop.

Therapist: Can you try to notice what just happened when you said that willingness statement? What happened to your body or mind when the thought of someone seeing your postcard showed up?

Patient: My chest tightened and my breath got shallow, my stomach dropped and my hands started to shake. As soon as I said it the whole disaster movie snapped into place in my head — someone posts it, people laugh, a bad review, galleries close — and that picture just hooks me so hard I can't see any other outcome. It feels like proof, like I'm tempting fate if I try to believe anything else, and that makes the willingness statement evaporate.

Therapist: Can you see how the idea that you're "tempting fate" by trying to create that postcard actually makes the thought of failure feel more real? What if, instead of trying to avoid the thought, you simply acknowledged it without judgment – like saying to yourself, "That's a really vivid picture, but I'm not buying it as a fact"?

Patient: I hear you, but when I try to treat that image like "just a picture," it feels like I'm daring fate — like if I don't accept it as real I'll get blindsided. My chest clenches and the scenes get louder, like the more I tell myself it's not true the more my brain drags up 'evidence' that it will happen. I don't know what else to do here — can we try something different? I'm starting to feel stuck and overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body right now – the tightness, the shaking hands, the shallow breath. What happens when you try to hold onto those feelings (like trying to avoid the catastrophic picture)? What would happen if you gently allowed those sensations to be present, without trying to change them or fight them away?

Patient: When I try to hold onto the feelings, everything spikes — chest gets tighter, breath shallows, my hands shake and the disaster movie just roars louder like it's feeding on my resistance. If I try to let the sensations be, there's this weird half-second where the tightness softens and the images feel a little farther away, but then my brain screams that the calm is just bait and the worst-case scenes slam back in harder. I don't trust that allowing will keep me safe — it feels like tempting fate — and honestly I'm starting to feel overwhelmed; can we slow down or try something different?

Therapist: Notice that when you try to let go of the sensations, you're not avoiding the disaster movie – you're simply noticing that it's not the only thing happening in your body. What if, instead of trying to control the thoughts or feelings, you simply acknowledged the fact that you're feeling overwhelmed? What would happen if you said to yourself, "I'm feeling really tight in my chest right now, and that's okay"?

Patient: "I'm feeling really tight in my chest right now, and that's okay." Saying it made my shoulders drop for like a second and the images got a little quieter, but then my brain screamed that if I let up I'll be blindsided — someone posts the postcard, people laugh, a bad review, galleries close, everything collapses. I know that sounds dramatic, but it feels real, and honestly I'm getting more overwhelmed; can we slow down or try a different way of working with this?

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath with me and pause for just one more moment? When you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – the feeling of your body being present in this space. No thoughts, no worries – just the sensation of your feet.

Patient: Okay — I breathe in and out and I can actually feel my feet for a beat, like a tiny steadying thing. But it's only a second before my chest clamps up and the disaster reel starts again — someone finds the postcard, posts it, people laugh, a bad review, galleries dry up, and everything collapses. I'm getting really overwhelmed by that picture; can we slow down or try a different way to work with this?

Therapist: Notice the phrase "everything collapses" – what does that phrase specifically evoke in your body? Is it a physical sensation, a thought, or an emotion? Try to describe it in just one word, without judgment.

Patient: Crushing.

I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed; can we slow down or try something else?

Therapist: What would you need to feel connected, creative, and valued in this moment, even if it's just for a tiny step? Not about the postcard or the outcome, but about what feels meaningful to you right now?

Patient: I think I’d need something tiny and grounding — a messy palette on the table, a cheap mug of tea, and someone to just sit with me and say, “I see you’re making this for you,” without pushing outcomes. But even picturing that, my brain already plays the worst-case — someone posts it, people laugh, galleries shut, I’m erased — so I can’t fully trust that it would help. I’m feeling tight and jittery now; I’m getting overwhelmed, can we slow down or try a different approach?

Therapist: Can you give yourself permission to hold the thought "I'm making this for me" – even if it's just for a moment – without judgment? No trying to control the outcome, no worrying about what others might think. Just permission to be with that thought, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay... I'll try: "I'm making this for me." I can hold it for a split second — my chest loosens — then the disaster reel slams back in: someone finds it, posts it, people laugh, a bad review, galleries close, I'm ruined. My hands are shaking and I feel crushed; that permission feels like tempting fate and I can't trust it. Can we slow down and try something else — maybe you name what you notice in my body with me, or guide a grounding exercise I can do while trying to hold the thought?

Therapist: Notice how your hands are shaking and your chest feels crushed. What sensation is present in your toes right now, while you're holding the thought "I'm making this for me"? Try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to control it or change it.

Patient: There's a soft pressure and tiny warmth under my toes for a second, like a little anchor, then a tingling numbness creeps in as my brain fires the disaster reel — someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close. It helps for a beat but the images slam back and my chest tightens again. I'm really getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and try naming sensations together or do a grounding exercise you guide me through?

Therapist: Let's try something simple: whenever your mind starts to go to the disaster scenario, I want you to say to yourself, "My chest is tight." Not "I'm going to fail" or "I'm ruined," just "My chest is tight." Can you try saying that to yourself right now, while noticing the sensation in your chest?

Patient: "My chest is tight." Saying it for a beat made my shoulders drop a little and my breath slowed, but then the disaster movie snapped back — someone posts the postcard, people laugh, a bad review, galleries stop calling, I lose money and end up alone. I know that sounds dramatic, but it feels inevitable, and now my hands are shaking and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down or can you guide me through naming sensations with me right now?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your hands right now – they're shaking. Where is the shaking in your hands, exactly? Is it in your fingers, your palms, or somewhere else? Can you describe it in just one word?

Patient: It's in my fingers — one word: "trembling." I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed; can we slow down and name sensations together?

Therapist: Notice how the trembling is affecting your fingers – is it a buzzing, a vibrating, or a heavy feeling? Where in your body is the trembling most noticeable?

Patient: It's a buzzy, vibrating tremor mostly in my fingertips and the pads of my fingers. It creeps up into my palms and forearms and settles as a heavy knot in my chest. When it shows up I get this shameful heat, like all my past screw-ups are on replay and it proves I'm doomed — that just makes the disaster movie louder. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and name sensations together?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the shameful heat in your chest – is it a burning, a searing, or a dull ache? Where in your body does it manifest, exactly? Try to describe it without judgment, just as it is.

Patient: It's like a searing burn right behind my breastbone, hot and raw, spreading up into my throat and jaw so my face feels flushed and my ears buzz. That shamey heat makes me feel exposed and stupid, and it fuels the disaster movie — I swear it's proof everything will collapse. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and name sensations together or try a different grounding thing?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "The shame heat is here." Not "This is proof everything will collapse" or "I'm doomed," just "The shame heat is here." As you say this, notice the sensation of the heat in your chest, the flush on your face, and the buzzing in your ears. Can you stay with this sensation for just one more breath without judgment?

Patient: I breathed out and said, "The shame heat is here." For a beat the searing behind my sternum eased, but then it spread into my throat and jaw, my face flushed, and that hot shame turned into the same awful certainty — someone posts the postcard, people laugh, galleries dry up, I lose everything. It barely helped and now my hands are trembling and I feel exposed and pissed at myself for even doing this; I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try a grounding exercise together?

Therapist: Let's try a "5-4-3-2-1" grounding exercise together. When you're ready, notice:
1. 5 things you can see around you (not the postcard, but just objects in your space)
2. 4 things you can touch or feel (like your feet on the ground or the chair beneath you)
3. 3 things you can hear (not the disaster movie, but just sounds in your environment)
4. 2 things you can smell (not perfume or cooking, but just scents in your space)
5. 1 thing you can taste (not food, but just a sensation in your mouth)

As we count together, try to stay with each sensation without judgment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try.

Five things I see: a paint-stained mug, a messy palette, a stack of canvases, a crooked postcard on the table, a gray sky outside the window. Four things I can touch: the rough canvas edge, the chair under me, the cool rim of the mug, the floor under my feet. Three things I hear: distant traffic, the hum of the heater, a neighbor's radio. Two things I smell: wet paint and old tea. One thing I taste: a faint metallic tang in my mouth.

That actually steadied me for a second — my chest eased a bit — but then that shame heat flared and the disaster movie slammed back in: someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close, I'm erased. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and keep naming sensations together?

Therapist: Notice the shame heat in your chest – where is it exactly? Is it behind your breastbone, up in your throat, or somewhere else? Try to describe it in just one word, without judgment. For example, you said "searing" earlier, but what if we focus on just the sensation, without the emotion?

Patient: Burning. It’s right behind my breastbone and creeps up into my throat. That shamey, “I’m a screw-up” hum kicks in and the disaster reel roars — someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close — and I’m already getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and keep naming sensations together?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "The shame heat is burning." Not "I'm a screw-up" or "I'm doomed," just "The shame heat is burning." As you say this, notice the sensation of the heat in your chest, the burn in your throat, and the hum of shame. Can you stay with this sensation for just one more breath, without judgment?

Patient: I breathed out and said, "The shame heat is burning." For a second the burn behind my sternum softened, but then the shame flared hotter in my throat and that disaster reel — someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close, I'm erased — slammed back in. I'm pissed and overwhelmed; can we slow down or try a different grounding exercise together?

Therapist: Let's try a "5-4-3-2-1" exercise with a twist: instead of noticing objects, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations in your environment, notice the sensations in your body that are NOT related to the shame or disaster. For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the chair beneath you, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on these sensations without judgment, just as they are.

Patient: Okay, I'll try.

My feet feel planted — a little heavy on the balls of my feet, the soles a muted pressure. The chair's firm against my hips, my back resting on the wood; the air at my nostrils is cool when I inhale and warm when I exhale. For a second that steadied the buzz in my fingers and eased the burn in my chest, but then that stupid shame-memory flickered and the disaster reel slammed back in — someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close — and I feel exposed and really pissed at myself. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down or try a different grounding thing together?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations that arise when you think about the shame-memory (the flicker of the disaster reel). What sensations are present in your body when you connect with that memory? Is it the same burn in your chest, the same buzz in your fingers, or something different? Try to notice these sensations without judgment, just as they are.

Patient: When I bring that shame-memory up, my chest sears like a hot weight behind my breastbone and it climbs into my throat so I can barely swallow. My fingertips buzz and tremble, my palms go clammy, there's a metallic taste in my mouth, and my stomach drops into this hollow knot. I feel flushed, my jaw locks, and a shameful heat makes me want to shrink — and then the disaster movie starts blasting: someone posts the postcard, people laugh, galleries close, I'm erased. I'm really overwhelmed and pissed off about feeling this way; can we slow down and name sensations together or try another grounding thing?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations right now, just as you're saying "I'm overwhelmed and pissed off about feeling this way". What sensations are present in your body, exactly? Can you name them without judgment? For example, "My chest is sore behind my breastbone" or "My fingers are trembling". Try to focus on the sensations, not the story behind them.

Patient: When I say that, my chest feels like a hot, sore weight right behind my breastbone — tight and searing — and my throat closes so my jaw locks. My fingertips are buzzing and trembling, my palms are clammy, there's a metallic taste in my mouth, my stomach is a hollow knot, and my breath is shallow and quick. The shame-heat and that disaster hum are loud in the background, and I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down and keep naming sensations together?

Therapist: Notice the effort you're making to breathe, despite the shallow breath. That's a tiny act of kindness, just for yourself. You're not trying to control the sensations, just noticing them as they are. Can you say to yourself, "I'm noticing my breath, even though it's shallow"?

Patient: "I'm noticing my breath, even though it's shallow." Saying that calmed my inhale for a beat and my chest eased a little, but then the shame-heat flared and the disaster reel slammed back — someone posts the postcard, people laugh, galleries close, I'm erased. I'm really overwhelmed and pissed off; can we slow down and try a different grounding or name sensations together?

Therapist: Let's try a "5-4-3-2-1" exercise, but this time, focus on your five senses in the present moment, without thinking about the shame or disaster. Notice:
1. Five things you can see right now (not the postcard, just objects in your space)
2. Four things you can touch or feel (your feet on the ground, the chair beneath you, etc.)
3. Three things you can hear (not the disaster reel, just sounds in your environment)
4. Two things you can smell (not perfume, just scents in your space)
5. One thing you can taste (not food, just a sensation in your mouth)

Notice these sensations, without judgment, just as they are.

Patient: Okay — I'll do it.

Five things I see: a paint-stained stool, a messy palette with dried color, a stack of blank canvases leaning, a chipped mug, a gray sky through the window.  
Four things I can touch: the chair under me, the rough edge of a canvas, the cool rim of the mug, the floor under my feet.  
Three things I hear: the heater humming, distant traffic, a neighbor's radio through the wall.  
Two things I smell: wet paint and stale tea.  
One thing I taste: a faint metallic tang.

That actually steadied me for a second — my feet felt rooted and my chest eased a bit — but then this hot shame flared up and the disaster reel snapped back in: someone posts it, people laugh, galleries close, I'm erased. I'm really getting overwhelmed and pissed off; can we slow down and try another grounding thing or name sensations together?
