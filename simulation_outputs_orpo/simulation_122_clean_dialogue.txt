Patient: I've been noticing I intellectualize my feelings a lot to avoid the anxiety—I turn emotions into analysis or lists instead of actually feeling them. I run a small business and with the job instability after losing work, I guess that's made it worse. I don't know how to stop doing that or what it even looks like to feel things without overthinking.

Therapist: When you say you turn emotions into lists or analysis to avoid anxiety, what happens to your body in those moments? Does your chest feel tighter, your stomach twisty, or is there a knot in your shoulders?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest gets tight and my stomach feels twisty sometimes. My shoulders and jaw tense up too, but I usually just push it into planning or analyzing so I don't have to sit with it.

Therapist: Those physical sensations – the tightness in your chest, the twisty stomach, tense shoulders, and jaw – are signals that your body is trying to tell you something. Can you imagine taking one tiny breath and noticing that tightness, twistiness, or tension right now, without trying to "fix" it or push it away? Just observe it as a physical sensation, without judgment.

Patient: I don't know... I'll try. Taking a breath now, my chest feels tight like a band, my stomach's twisty, and my jaw and shoulders are tense. It feels weird to just notice it—I already want to start planning or figuring out why instead of staying with the feeling.

Therapist: That tightness in your chest and twistiness in your stomach feel like they're saying, "Hey, you're feeling anxious, and that's okay." What's one small thing you value about your business or yourself that you'd like to take action on today, even if it feels uncomfortable to sit with this anxiety?

Patient: I guess I value being reliable and keeping the business afloat. Maybe today I could just send one short update email to clients about timelines—like one quick message, not a huge thing. I don't know, even that feels big because my brain's already gearing up to plan every possible reply and edit. Can we... talk about how to keep it small without me spiraling into analysis?

Therapist: When your brain starts planning every possible reply and edit, notice the thought "I need to be perfect" without judgment. Say to yourself, "That's the thought I have right now. It's showing up. Can I thank that thought for its job – helping me prepare – and then let it go?"

Patient: I don't know — that "thank the thought" thing feels kind of dumb and doesn't really stop me. My brain immediately starts drafting ten versions and my chest tightens. I guess what might help is a concrete rule, like a one-sentence update and a 10-minute timer so I can't keep editing — can we make that together?

Therapist: Let's make it simple: "I'll send one short update email to one client, using just three sentences, and I'll work on it for exactly 10 minutes without editing or planning beyond that."

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that. My brain's already drafting ten versions though—can we role-play the three-sentence email now so I don't overthink it? My chest is already tightening just thinking about sending it.

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. I'll start: "Hey [Client's Name], just wanted to touch base on the timeline for the project. We're on track to meet the deadline on [Date]. I wanted to keep you informed and make sure everything is going smoothly." Now, notice how your body feels when you hear those three sentences.

Patient: I don't know... hearing it makes my chest clamp up and my stomach knot tighter, and my jaw gets really tense. I already want to rewrite it a dozen ways and plan for every possible reply. I guess maybe if we actually role-play you as the client and I send it and you give one short reply, that could help me stop over-editing—can we try that?

Therapist: Let's do the role-play. I'll play the client, and you'll send the three-sentence email. Then, I'll respond with just one short sentence. Remember, we're not trying to perfect the email or plan for every possible reply. Just send the email and respond briefly.

Patient: Hey [Client's Name], just touching base about the project timeline. We're on track to meet the deadline on [Date]. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Therapist: "Sounds good, thanks for the update. I'll check in soon."

Patient: I don't know... that reply should help but instead my chest tightened and my mind's already spinning with possible follow-ups. I keep wanting to open the thread and tweak things or draft a pre-answer, and it's making me jittery and distracted. I guess can we do the client one-sentence reply now and practice me not responding beyond that?

Therapist: Let's try it. I'll respond with the one-sentence reply again, and you respond with just one sentence. This time, when I say "Sounds good, thanks for the update," you can respond with "Got it" or "Okay" without elaborating.

Patient: Got it.

Therapist: That was a great response! You didn't elaborate or plan beyond the brief exchange. Let's try another one.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try again. Got it — my chest's tight and I'm already annoyed at myself for wanting to fix it a dozen ways.

Therapist: Notice the tightness in your chest right now, and say to yourself: "That's the tightness I feel when I'm about to overthink." Then, take one breath and gently say "Okay" again, without adding anything else.

Patient: I don't know... I took a breath and my chest's still tight — I'm feeling ashamed and frustrated with myself for getting like this. Okay.

Therapist: That tightness in your chest feels like it's saying, "You're getting frustrated with yourself." What's one small thing you'd like to show up with curiosity about in this moment, instead of trying to fix the tightness?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try being curious about which thought pops up first when my chest tightens — like whether it's 'I'm failing' or it goes straight to 'fix it' planning. I'm kind of ashamed it's the same loop every time and I want to look away, but okay, I'll try to notice that.

Therapist: Notice that "okay" is still a brief response, even though you're now exploring the thought that comes up. You're not trying to change it or fix it – just noticing what shows up. Can you take just one tiny breath before answering that thought, without adding anything else?

Patient: I don't know... I took that tiny breath. The first thought that popped up was "I'm failing," and then my brain immediately wants to jump into "how do I fix this" — drafting replies and checkpoints. My chest's still tight and I'm feeling ashamed and annoyed at myself for getting stuck like this. Can we, uh, stay with the "I'm failing" feeling a bit longer instead of trying to fix it right away?

Therapist: Notice the physical tightness in your chest when you say "I'm failing." That's where the discomfort is right now. Just observe the tightness without trying to push it away or fix the thought. What does the tightness feel like right in this moment?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a heavy clamp across my chest, breath gets shallow and my stomach twists up. There's this hot, sinking shame with it and I feel kind of stupid for even having it. I guess everything narrows and my brain yells "fix it" so I want to bail, but can we... stay here a bit? I'm nervous about spiraling, but I want to try.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath getting shallow – it's like your chest is physically shrinking. That's what's happening right now. Can you place that sensation of shrinking in your body, like you're noticing it as a physical feeling, without adding any story to it? Just the sensation of the breath moving in and out, like that's enough.

Patient: I don't know... I put that shrinking right under my sternum and it's like a heavy clamp — my breath's shallow but I can feel it move in and out, and it brings this hot, sinking shame. My brain's already yelling to fix it or plan something, and I can feel myself getting jittery and annoyed at myself. Can we slow down and just sit with this for a minute?

Therapist: You've noticed the effort to slow down, which shows you're willing to stay with the discomfort. That takes courage. Can you acknowledge that effort to yourself, without judgment? Say to yourself: "I'm trying to stay with this."

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to stay with this. My chest's still tight and I can feel the urge to bail or start fixing things, but I'm holding on to it for now — it feels awkward and shamey, honestly.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of "awkward" right now – it's like a small, prickly feeling in your body. What's one tiny, small thing you can do with that feeling, without trying to fix it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could put my hand on that prickly spot and quietly say "awkward" once to name it, then take three slow breaths and just notice. My chest's tight and I'm kind of ashamed it's such a big thing, but I'll try to stay with it instead of planning or fixing.

Therapist: That's a beautiful small step! Notice how your body feels when you say "awkward" and put your hand on the spot – is there any change, even a tiny one? And now, with your three slow breaths, what's the sensation of the breath moving in and out – just notice it, without trying to change it.

Patient: I don't know... when I said "awkward" and put my hand there the prickles softened a tiny bit, like a degree of relief, but the clamp in my chest is still pretty strong. With the three slow breaths I can feel the air move a little deeper—still shallow overall—but I'm already jittery and annoyed at myself, like I should've fixed this by now. Can we stay here a bit longer? I'm nervous about spiraling but I want to try, even though my brain's already drafting solutions.

Therapist: Notice that even though your brain is already drafting solutions, you're staying with the discomfort of the clamp in your chest. That takes courage. Just one tiny thing: what would you do right now if you didn't try to fix it – what would you simply notice about the discomfort instead?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd try to just notice the heavy clamp in my chest, the shallow breaths, that hot shame feeling, and the prickly awkward spot without trying to plan or fix anything. I'm already jittery and my brain's yelling to do something, so can we stay with it a bit longer? I'm nervous about spiraling but I want to try.

Therapist: Notice how you're willing to stay with the discomfort, even when your brain is already trying to plan solutions. That takes a lot of courage. Say to yourself: "I'm choosing to notice this, not to fix it. I'm choosing to stay with the discomfort, not to push it away."

Patient: I don't know... I'm choosing to notice this, not to fix it. I'm choosing to stay with the discomfort, not push it away. My chest's still clamped, my stomach's twisty, and I'm honestly feeling ashamed and kind of frustrated with myself. Can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer—maybe guide me through one more breath?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your chest being clamped, your stomach being twisty, and the feeling of shame and frustration. Take one more breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am noticing this moment, with the discomfort and the shame. I am here, right now, with my breath."

Patient: I don't know... I breathed out and said it: "I am noticing this moment, with the discomfort and the shame. I am here, right now, with my breath." My chest's still clamped and my mind's jittery and distracted—I feel ashamed like I should've fixed this by now. Can we do another guided breath? I'm already worrying I'll start planning again.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your chest being clamped, and the feeling of shame and frustration. Take one more breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am not my thoughts. I am not my worries about what's next. I am the breath moving in and out of my body right now."

Patient: I don't know... I said it — "I am not my thoughts. I am the breath..." — but my chest's still clamped and my mind's already racing with fixes. I'm feeling ashamed and jittery; can we do one more slow breath and maybe a quick grounding anchor? I don't want to start planning again.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, the sounds around you – bring one of these sensations to the forefront of your attention. Say to yourself: "My feet are touching the floor. I can feel the weight of my body on the ground."

Patient: I don't know... my feet are touching the floor, I can feel the weight in my heels and a little vibration through the chair, and the air on my skin — but my chest's still clamped and my stomach's twisty. I'm jittery and ashamed, like I should've fixed this already, and my brain's already leaning into planning. Can we do one more grounding anchor or a slow breath? I don't want to start spiraling into drafting replies.

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your chest, the heaviness or tightness – what's one tiny thing you can do with it right now, without trying to change it? You can say to yourself: "This tightness is right here in my chest, but I can focus on my breath without trying to fix it."

Patient: I don't know... I said it to myself — "This tightness is right here in my chest, but I can focus on my breath" — and I could feel the breath a bit deeper, but the clamp's still there and my mind's already drafting fixes. I'm annoyed and kind of ashamed for not snapping out of it, so can we do one more grounding anchor or another slow breath? I'm nervous I'll start spiraling but I want to keep trying.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, the sounds around you – bring one of these sensations to the forefront of your attention. Say to yourself: "I am here, in this moment, with my breath moving in and out."

Patient: I don't know... I said it—"I am here, in this moment, with my breath moving in and out"—but my chest's still clamped and my stomach's twisty. I'm jittery and ashamed like I should've snapped out of it, and my brain's already drafting fixes. Can we do one more slow breath and maybe another grounding anchor? I don't want to start spiraling.
