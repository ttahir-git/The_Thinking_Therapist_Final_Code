Patient: I'm a manager and lately I've been procrastinating more and more to numb the uncomfortable feelings that came with recent changes — it feels like an adjustment disorder thing. It's starting to mess with work and our finances and I get really down and embarrassed about it. I guess... I don't know how to stop.

Therapist: That procrastination is likely linked to the recent changes, which feels really overwhelming. When you say it's making you feel "down and embarrassed," what's one thing you usually do when you're in a meeting or with a colleague right before it hits you, like when you're about to say something or respond to a question?

Patient: I don't know — I kind of go quiet, avoid eye contact, or scroll my phone like I'm checking something important. I guess I’ll crack a joke or say “I’ll follow up on that” and then put it off, or steer the conversation to something safer. It just feels easier than dealing with the heat of the moment.

Therapist: Those avoidance behaviors might feel like a quick fix, but what happens when you're already behind on work or missed a deadline because of it? How does that impact the team or your finances?

Patient: It just snowballs — people end up covering for me, projects get delayed, and I can see the frustration in my team. For money, missing deadlines has meant delayed payments and a couple of lost opportunities, which makes the bills feel heavier. I don't know, I guess I just feel guilty and like I'm failing everyone, and talking about it kind of makes me shut down.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really committed to your team and the success of the projects. What's one value that's being protected when you avoid talking about this or dealing with the discomfort of being in the moment – is it "avoiding failure," "protecting others," or something else?

Patient: I guess it's mostly about avoiding failure — I don't want people to see me as incompetent, so I put things off rather than risk messing up. I don't know, maybe part of me is also trying to protect the team from my own stress so they don't have to deal with it.

Therapist: When you're not willing to tackle this discomfort, it means you're not showing up fully for the team – they need your input and expertise to succeed. What would happen if, instead of avoiding the discomfort, you made space to be vulnerable and say, "I'm struggling, but I want to figure this out together"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'm terrified they'd see me as weak or start doubting my decisions, and that would make things worse at work. Maybe they'd be supportive, but I don't know how to start that conversation without feeling like I'm just dumping on them or making everything fall apart.

Therapist: Let's start with something ridiculously small: What's one tiny thing you could say to your team right now – just one sentence – that acknowledges your struggle without needing to fix it?

Patient: I don't know—maybe I could say, "I'm having a hard time adjusting to some recent changes and might be slower on follow-ups right now; I appreciate your patience."

Therapist: That tiny sentence takes courage, and it shows you're willing to be imperfectly present with your team. What's one small thing you could do in the next meeting to make space for more engagement, like asking a question or making a connection with someone's idea?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could just ask a simple clarifying question, like "Can you walk me through how that would look in practice?" That feels doable and lets me stay engaged without having to make a big decision on the spot.

Therapist: That question shows you're willing to listen and learn, which is a huge step towards being more engaged. What if, instead of asking just a clarifying question, you also made a brief connection to how that idea relates to the team's goals – like, "That makes sense because it aligns with our strategy to..."?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could try something like, "That makes sense because it aligns with our strategy to improve client retention," but I'm worried it’ll sound forced or like I'm just parroting. Maybe I'll stick to the clarifying question if adding the connection feels too awkward.

Therapist: If you connect to the value by saying, "That makes sense because it aligns with our strategy to improve client retention," and then pause, what would happen if you simply acknowledged the connection without feeling like you needed to justify it? Would that feel more natural, or would you still feel like you're forcing it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it might feel a bit more natural if I just said it and paused. But I worry it'll sound fake or like I'm making excuses, so I automatically justify or change the subject. Maybe if I practiced pausing and not filling the space, it could feel less forced, but I'm not sure how to stop myself from jumping in.

Therapist: When you justify or change the subject, it sounds like you're trying to avoid feeling uncomfortable or exposed. What's the underlying value that's driving that avoidance – is it fear of being wrong, fear of being vulnerable, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's mostly fear of being wrong and looking incompetent. Maybe it's also about control and not wanting to burden the team; I worry being vulnerable will make them see me differently.

Therapist: That fear of being wrong is what keeps you from making that small connection to the value of improving client retention. What if, instead of focusing on avoiding being wrong, you focused on being present with your team – what would happen if you showed up with curiosity and openness, even if it felt a little uncomfortable?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I showed up curious and open, people might respond better and we'd make smarter choices, and maybe I'd stop procrastinating so much. But it feels risky; I'm terrified of stumbling or sounding incompetent and then everyone doubting me, so I tend to shut down and avoid. Maybe I could try it in a tiny way, like asking that clarifying question and actually pausing, but I'm not sure I won't just freeze.

Therapist: Let's try reframing that tiny act of asking a clarifying question as a way to build confidence, not avoid risk. What if, instead of thinking "I'll freeze," you told yourself "I'll take a deep breath, ask the question, and see what happens"? Would that shift the focus from avoiding risk to building a small sense of control?

Patient: I don't know — I guess that could help a little. It feels like a tiny, scary thing though; I'm worried I'll still freeze or sound stupid. Can we… could we practice that pause or a simple line I could use when I take the breath?

Therapist: Let's create a tiny anchor phrase together. What's one simple phrase that you could say to yourself when you take a deep breath, just before asking the clarifying question? It could be something like "I've got this" or "One breath, one question." What feels most comfortable for you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess "One breath, one question" feels okay. It sounds a bit corny, but it's short and might actually remind me to pause. Can we practice it once? I'm kind of nervous about doing it in front of others.

Therapist: Let's practice "One breath, one question" in a quiet moment, just between us. Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, say "One breath, one question" out loud. Don't worry about what it sounds like – just focus on the feeling of taking that breath and saying those words.

Patient: Okay. I took a deep breath — One breath, one question. It felt weird and my heart sped up, but I didn't freeze. I don't know… can we do that again a couple more times? I'm nervous about trying it live.

Therapist: Let's try it again. Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, say "One breath, one question" out loud. Don't worry about how it sounds – just focus on the feeling of taking that breath and saying those words. We'll repeat it a few more times, and I'll remind you to breathe deeply when you feel your heart start to speed up.

Patient: Okay, I breathed — One breath, one question. It felt weird and my heart sped up, but I said it. I don't know, can we do it two more times? I'm really nervous about trying it in a meeting.

Therapist: Let's try it one more time. Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, say "One breath, one question" out loud. Remember to breathe deeply and slowly, and try to let go of any tension. You've got this.

Patient: Okay — I breathed. One breath, one question. My heart's still racing and it felt weird, but I didn't freeze. I don't know… can we do it a couple more times, and maybe practice a tiny line to use if someone asks me something on the spot?

Therapist: Let's practice a tiny line to use if someone asks you a question on the spot. What if, instead of pausing, you simply said "That's a great question" or "I'm not sure, but I'll find out"? This can help you buy time to take a breath and respond more thoughtfully. We can practice this line together, starting with a simple scenario: someone asks you a question, and you respond with "That's a great question" – go ahead and try it.

Patient: "That's a great question." It felt weird—my heart raced but it did buy me a second. I don't know, I guess it helped me avoid freezing but I worry it sounded like a dodge; can we try the other line, "I'm not sure, but I'll find out," and do a quick role-play where you ask me a tough question?

Therapist: Let's try the line "I'm not sure, but I'll find out." I'll ask you a tough question, and we'll do a quick role-play. Remember, the goal is to sound natural and take a deep breath. Here's the question: "What's the best way to improve our team's collaboration with the marketing department?" Go ahead and respond as if you're in a real meeting.

Patient: One breath, one question. "I'm not sure, but I'll find out." I said it — my heart's racing and it felt like a dodge, but I guess I could follow with, "Can you clarify what success would look like for you?" — I'm nervous it'll sound weak; can we role-play the follow-up where they press me?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play where I press you on your follow-up question. Remember, I'm playing the role of a skeptical team lead who wants to see concrete action. Here's the scenario: "That's not very specific. What exactly do you mean by 'clarify what success would look like'?" Go ahead and respond as if you're in a real meeting.

Patient: I don't know — one breath, one question. Maybe we start with one joint KPI, like average client response time, and a monthly sync with a named owner to follow up on actions; it's not perfect, but it gives us something concrete to try.

Therapist: That's a great starting point – the joint KPI and monthly sync gives you a concrete way to measure progress and hold each other accountable. What if I said, "That sounds like a good first step, but what would happen if we also made sure that the owner is invested in making sure the team is following up on those actions? How would that change the outcome?"

Patient: One breath, one question. I don't know — I guess if the owner is really invested it would make follow-up more likely and maybe take some pressure off me, but I'm scared it'd look like I'm passing the buck or set me up to be blamed if it fails. I don't know how to make that feel safe without sounding like I'm dodging responsibility.

Therapist: That's a natural concern. Instead of saying "it would make me look like I'm passing the buck," what if you said, "I want to make sure we're both on the same page and that the owner is committed to following up – what would that look like for them to be truly invested in this process?" This shifts the focus from your own fear to creating a shared understanding of the owner's role.

Patient: I don't know — I guess that wording could help shift things, but I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed and worried it'll come off as me dodging blame. Can we slow down and role-play me saying, "I want to make sure we're both on the same page..." and then practice a pushback where someone accuses me of avoiding responsibility?

Therapist: Let's role-play. I'll play the role of the skeptical team lead who accuses you of dodging blame. You start by saying, "I want to make sure we're both on the same page..." and I'll respond with a pushback. Then, we'll work through it together. Here we go:

Patient: I want to make sure we're both on the same page about the owner's role and what being "committed" actually looks like — who does what and when. I don't know, I just want us to set clear expectations so this doesn't fall through the cracks.

Therapist: That's a great start, but it sounds like you're still putting the onus on the owner to take action. Doesn't that mean you're not taking ownership of your own role in making sure this happens?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I do want to take ownership, but I'm terrified I'll mess it up and let everyone down. So I end up splitting responsibility to feel safer, even though I know that's not really owning it. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed talking about this — can we slow down and figure out one tiny, specific thing I could commit to that wouldn't make me sound like I'm dodging?

Therapist: Let's focus on one tiny thing. What's one small thing you could commit to doing today that would demonstrate taking ownership of the process, without putting the entire team on the hook? For example, what if you simply committed to sending an email to the team by the end of the day, just to let them know you're thinking about the project and that you're committed to moving forward?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could send a short email today saying I'm putting together a plan and will propose a joint KPI and an owner by Friday. I'm nervous it'll sound like I'm covering my tracks or avoiding responsibility. Can you help me draft a one-sentence email that doesn't sound weak?

Therapist: Here's a possible one-sentence email: "I'm taking the lead on this project and will propose a clear KPI and owner by Friday, ensuring we're aligned and moving forward."

Patient: I don't know — that sentence sounds... kind of strong, but maybe in a way I’m scared will seem either defensive or like I'm covering things up. I guess could we try a slightly softer version like, "I'm taking the lead and will propose a KPI and owner by Friday — I welcome any input," and also a firmer one if needed? I'm nervous about actually sending anything; can we practice how I might say it out loud first?

Therapist: Let's try both versions out loud. We'll start with the softer one: "I'm taking the lead and will propose a KPI and owner by Friday — I welcome any input." Go ahead and say it out loud, slowly and naturally. Then, we'll try the firmer one: "I'm taking the lead on this project and will propose a clear KPI and owner by Friday, ensuring we're aligned and moving forward."

Patient: "Okay — I'm taking the lead and will propose a KPI and owner by Friday — I welcome any input." 

"And the firmer one: I'm taking the lead on this project and will propose a clear KPI and owner by Friday, ensuring we're aligned and moving forward." 

My heart's racing — the softer one felt less scary but maybe wishy-washy; the firmer felt strong and made me nervous it sounds defensive. I don't know, can we practice the softer one a few more times so I don't freeze when I actually send it?
