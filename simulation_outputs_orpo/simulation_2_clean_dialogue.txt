Patient: Hi — lately I've been feeling really stuck, like my whole sense of self is wrapped up in the business and I don't know what matters beyond that. Since the kids left and with the PTSD stuff, I guess it's been hard to figure out who I am now. I don't know, it's just... overwhelming sometimes.

Therapist: That feeling of being overwhelmed by the business and unsure about what matters beyond it sounds really draining. When you say "I don't know what matters beyond that," what's one thing that used to bring you joy or feel important to you when you were working with the kids?

Patient: I guess it was the small moments — like when a kid got really excited about a project or trusted me enough to open up. I don't know, I miss that connection, but it's hard to imagine having that kind of meaning outside the business now.

Therapist: Those small moments with the kids, like when they got excited or trusted you, were full of meaning because they were connected to your values as a caregiver. Can you see how that sense of connection and care is still there, even though the kids are gone? What would it be like to hold onto that sense of care and connection in your work with others, like clients or colleagues?

Patient: I guess I can see that — caring was the core of it. But with clients or colleagues it feels... forced, like I'm performing instead of really connecting. I don't know, I worry it won't feel the same or that I'll just be faking it and still feel empty.

Therapist: That worry about faking it when you're trying to connect with others sounds like it's tied up with the fear that you'll still feel empty afterward. Can you notice what's happening when you say "I'm faking it"? Is that worry actually a thought, or is it a feeling in your body?

Patient: I don't know — it's both, I guess. There's this nagging thought that I'm a fraud, and at the same time a tightness in my chest and my stomach flips so I go quiet. Can we slow down? It's getting a bit intense.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and notice that thought ("I'm a fraud") as just that – a thought. Can you see it as a story you're telling yourself, rather than truth?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can sort of see it as a story when I catch myself, but it still feels really real, like a knot in my chest. I'm starting to pull away now, can we slow down a bit? Maybe... could we talk about tiny things I could do when that feeling hits?

Therapist: Let's start with something super small: when that knot in your chest shows up, what's the first tiny thing you can do with your body that feels like a tiny act of kindness? For example, could you take a tiny breath in through your nose, or roll your shoulders slightly?

Patient: I guess I could try a tiny slow breath — in through my nose, out through my mouth — and maybe rest my hand on my chest so it feels less like a knot. I don't know, it feels awkward to do this, but wiggling my toes on the floor or rolling my shoulders might help too. Can we keep it slow? I'm already feeling a bit nervous about getting into it.

Therapist: Let's take that tiny slow breath together: in through your nose, out through your mouth. As you breathe, notice where you place your hand on your chest. When you're ready, gently wiggle those toes on the floor or roll your shoulders – whatever feels like a tiny release. Just for a moment, stay with that small action and notice what happens in your body.

Patient: Okay — I tried the slow breath and put my hand on my chest. It did loosen the knot a little, but it's still there and I feel kind of awkward about doing it in front of people. I don't know, I guess maybe I could try it during a quiet moment at work, but can we keep this slow? I'm getting a bit nervous about going deeper.

Therapist: Let's talk about what it means to you to feel safe in your work. What does that feel like? Is it feeling like you can breathe, or like you can be yourself? Can you imagine doing that slow breath during a quiet moment at work, like during a meeting break or when you're waiting for a client to arrive? Would it feel like a tiny act of courage, or a small step towards being more present with others?

Patient: I don't know — maybe feeling safe at work would just be being able to breathe without that knot and not feeling like I have to perform all the time, like I can be myself without people thinking I'm fragile. I guess doing the breath in a quiet moment would feel like a tiny act of courage but also really awkward — I'm worried someone will notice and judge me, so I usually avoid it. Can we slow down? Maybe talk about tiny, private ways to practice it so I don't feel exposed, like sneaking a breath in the bathroom or on a quick walk?

Therapist: Let's talk about tiny, private ways to practice this slow breath. You mentioned sneaking a breath in the bathroom or on a quick walk. What if you did that in a way that feels like a tiny indulgence, like taking a sip of water or smelling a scented candle? Or what if you did it while you're doing something you already do regularly, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower?

Patient: I guess that could actually work — I already have those little routines, like brushing my teeth, showering, or making coffee. Maybe I could sneak a slow breath and rest my hand on my chest while the kettle boils or when I'm rinsing dishes, so it's private and doesn't feel performative. I don't know, it still feels awkward and I'm getting nervous talking about it — can we keep it slow?

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of the breath. When you take that slow breath, notice what happens in your body. Does your chest relax, or do you feel your shoulders drop? Can you feel the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I don't know — when I take that slow breath my chest loosens a bit and my shoulders drop, and I can vaguely feel the air moving, but the knot's still there and my stomach flips. It feels really awkward and I'm worried someone will catch me doing it. Can we slow down? Maybe just pick one tiny, private habit I can try at work.

Therapist: Let's focus on one tiny habit. What if, while you're waiting for the kettle to boil, you take a very small breath in, just for a second, and rest your hand on your chest? It's a tiny, private moment, and no one will notice it. Can you try that for just a second?

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try that — I just did a tiny breath while imagining the kettle and rested my hand on my chest. I don't know, the knot loosened a little and my shoulders dropped, but my stomach still flips and it felt kind of weird and awkward. Maybe I could try it for real during coffee or in the bathroom, but I'm nervous someone will notice — can we keep this slow?

Therapist: Let's talk about trying it in the bathroom. You mentioned it already feels like a private moment, and you're more alone there. What if, while you're washing your hands or brushing your teeth, you take a small breath in and rest your hand on your chest, just for a second? It's still a tiny habit, and you can try it without worrying about being noticed by others.

Patient: I guess I could try that — washing my hands feels private enough. I don't know, it still feels kind of silly and I'm nervous it'll just feel awkward, but maybe if I tell myself it's part of rinsing it'll be easier. Can we slow down? Maybe... could you help me come up with one simple cue so I actually remember to do it?

Therapist: Let's make it easy. What if you say to yourself just before you start washing your hands, "Okay, I'm washing my hands now"? That's a simple cue that says, "It's time to breathe." Then, as you're washing your hands, take that small breath in and rest your hand on your chest. It's a tiny habit, and you can start small.

Patient: I guess I can try that — probably say it silently though, saying it out loud feels weird. I don't know, I'm worried I'll still forget; could we pick a backup cue like when I turn the kettle on or start the coffee? I'm getting a bit nervous about all this, can we slow down a little?

Therapist: Let's use the kettle or coffee as a backup cue. What if, when you turn on the kettle or start the coffee, you say to yourself, "Time to breathe"? It's a small phrase that reminds you to take a breath, and it's easy to remember because it's tied to something you already do daily. That way, if you forget to use the hand-washing cue, you can fall back on this one.

Patient: I guess I can try the kettle/coffee cue — silently saying "time to breathe" and taking that tiny breath while the water heats. I'm worried I'll forget or feel ridiculous doing it and then just give up. Maybe just one cue — the kettle — so I don't have to hold onto too many things at once? I don't know, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's stick with the kettle. Silently saying "time to breathe" while the water heats is a small, manageable habit. You can start with just that one phrase, and if it feels too awkward, you can always add a tiny physical action like resting your hand on your chest later. Just focus on taking that one tiny breath while the kettle heats, and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll try the kettle cue — silently say "time to breathe" and take one tiny breath while it heats. I don't know, I'm nervous I'll forget or feel ridiculous and just stop doing it. Can we slow down? Maybe tell me one small thing to notice right after the breath so it doesn't just feel pointless.

Therapist: Right after you take that tiny breath while the kettle heats, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just pay attention to that feeling, without trying to think about it or change it. It's just a tiny moment of awareness, and it might help you remember that you're doing this small act of kindness for yourself.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — notice the air moving in my chest and maybe where it feels like it loosens the knot. I guess I could also notice my shoulders dropping or that tiny shift in my stomach. I don't know, it still feels awkward and I'm getting nervous it'll feel pointless or I won't remember — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's simplify it. Instead of noticing multiple things, just focus on the sensation of your chest expanding slightly as you take that tiny breath. That's the physical sensation that's already happening, and it's a tiny, tangible thing that you can notice. Don't try to add anything else to it – just be with that sensation for a second.

Patient: Okay... I can try that. When I take the tiny breath my chest lifts a little — it's faint but it's there, and I don't know, it loosens the knot a bit. I'm feeling kind of worn out though, so can we keep it slow?

Therapist: That makes sense. You're tired, and that's okay. Just acknowledge that you're feeling worn out, and that's enough for now. Don't try to force anything else – just be with that feeling of tiredness for a moment. We can come back to the breath later when you're feeling more rested.

Patient: Okay... I guess that helps to hear. I don't know, I'm pretty worn out and it's hard to focus — could we just keep it slow and maybe pick one tiny practical thing, like setting a silent phone reminder for the kettle cue? I don't know, can we do that?

Therapist: Let's do that. Set a silent phone reminder for 10 minutes from now to remind you to take that tiny breath while the kettle heats. That's a tiny commitment that feels almost insignificant, but it can help you build the habit. When the reminder goes off, just take a deep breath and notice the sensation in your chest.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's a 10‑minute reminder supposed to help with the kettle cue? I guess it's meant to nudge me, but I can already picture ignoring it or feeling annoyed. I'm feeling pretty worn out and fiddling with my phone feels like too much. Maybe something even simpler, like a little sticky note by the kettle or a mark on my mug, would work better? I don't know.

Therapist: A sticky note by the kettle or a mark on your mug sounds like a great idea. That way, you can see it without having to do anything else. You can even just place the note or mark there as a reminder, without having to think about it. Just place the note or mark now, and we can forget about it for now.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can put a sticky note, but honestly I'm so worn out I don't really feel like getting up right now. Maybe I'll just make a tiny mark on my favorite mug instead since it's less fuss and I'll see it when I make coffee. I don't know—what should I do if I still ignore it? Can we keep this slow?

Therapist: That's a great plan. Making a mark on your mug is a small, low-fuss action that you can do without getting up. If you still ignore the mark, you'll just forget about it. The goal isn't to remember to do something when you're feeling tired; it's to take tiny action right now to build the habit. So, take a deep breath and make that mark on your mug. Just a small, gentle mark.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's a little mark on the mug supposed to help with all this? I guess I could make it, but I'm so worn out I can't bring myself to get up right now; can we slow down and just plan to do it after a short break? I don't know, I feel kind of stuck.

Therapist: It's okay to feel stuck. Let's take a break. You can sit here for a minute, take a few deep breaths, and gather your energy. When you feel a little more grounded, we can come back to that tiny mark on the mug. No pressure, no expectations. Just a short break to recharge before taking that small action.

Patient: Okay... I can sit for a minute and try a few breaths, though it already feels like too much. I don't know — I guess after that I could try to make the mark, but I'm worried I'll just avoid it or feel silly. Can we keep it slow and maybe plan one tiny step I can actually manage right after the break?

Therapist: Let's focus on just one tiny step. After your break, can you simply pick up the mug and hold it in your hand? That's it. Just pick it up and hold it. No need to make a mark, no pressure. Just being able to hold the mug in your hand is a tiny accomplishment.

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I don't know if I can get up, but I'll reach for the mug and hold it for ten seconds. It feels kind of silly and heavy, and I'm already feeling numb—can we keep it slow and you stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: Let's take it one second at a time. You're going to reach for the mug, and when you do, I'll be right here with you. You'll pick it up, and I'll help you hold it for just one second. That's it. Just one second. You can do that.

Patient: Okay... I reached for the mug and I'm holding it now — just like you said, for a second. It felt heavier than I thought and my fingers shook a little; the knot loosened some but it's still there. I don't know, can we do that again but slow? Please stay with me while I set it down.

Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take your time. You're holding the mug, and now you're going to set it down. Just slowly, gently, and carefully. Don't rush it. You're in control. I'm here with you. Take your time.

Patient: Okay... I set it down — slowly. My hands shook and the knot's a bit looser, I guess, but I feel kind of blank and worn out. Can we just sit quietly for a minute? I don't know, I don't want to go deeper right now — can we keep it slow and you stay with me?

Therapist: Let's sit quietly together. No pressure, no expectations. Just sit with the mug on the table, and take some deep breaths. I'm here with you. We can just be. No need to talk or do anything else. Just be.

Patient: Okay... I'm sitting here. I feel kind of blank and the knot's still there — I don't know, it's hard to do more right now. Can we just stay quiet for a few minutes, and when you're ready gently remind me about the kettle cue again?
