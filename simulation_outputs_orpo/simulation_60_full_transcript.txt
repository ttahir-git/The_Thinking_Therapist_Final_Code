--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, lately I've been obsessing over how I'm performing at school — I worry I'm not doing enough and it makes me procrastinate until everything's a scramble. I don't know, I overthink every lesson and then avoid planning, and I guess that just makes me feel more isolated.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a pattern where you get caught up in worries about not doing enough, leading to avoidance and procrastination, which creates more stress and isolation. Core emotion is anxiety about performance. Goal: Explore how this avoidance affects your connection to valued learning and actions.

Therapist Answer:
When you say you overthink lessons and avoid planning, what's one thing you used to enjoy about learning that's now hard to find amidst all this worrying?

Patient: I used to love that moment when a lesson clicked and students got curious — it felt kind of electric and fun. Now I can't seem to find that spark; I overthink everything and I don't know, I guess I'm stuck trying to make things perfect instead of enjoying them. I keep comparing myself to other teachers who seem to have it together, but... I don't know.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're highlighting how your perfectionism is blocking the enjoyment of learning moments, and comparing yourself to others isn't serving you—this comparison reinforces the "not good enough" feeling. Goal: Introduce a small experiment to connect with that "electric" feeling without needing to "make things perfect".

Therapist Answer:
That electric feeling when a lesson clicks sounds amazing! What if, for just one minute, you focused on the curiosity in your students' eyes, rather than trying to plan the perfect lesson?

Patient: I don't know... that actually sounds kind of nice, and I guess I want to feel that again, but when I'm in class my brain immediately jumps to everything that could go wrong — timing, kids not caring, admin watching — so it's hard to just notice them. Maybe I could try to look for one curious face for a minute, but I don't know how to stop myself from reaching for the planner when I start panicking.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the obstacle: your mind jumps to worst-case scenarios, making it hard to focus on the present moment. Goal: Introduce a small act of defusion to gently shift your attention from planning to noticing students.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tiny experiment: when you notice your mind starting to worry about planning, pause for just a breath and say to yourself, "Notice the pencil in my hand" (or whatever small object you're holding). That's it, just acknowledging its presence. Can you do that for a single second without reaching for the planner?

Patient: I can try that. I don't know if I won't grab the planner anyway, but I guess I can look at a pencil for a second and say the phrase. It feels kind of silly, and I'm already worried it'll just make me spiral, but... okay, I'll try.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to experiment with this tiny act of defusion, acknowledging the potential for it to spiral, yet taking a small step towards changing your relationship with your thoughts. Goal: Celebrate the tiny act of noticing, even if it's imperfect.

Therapist Answer:
That's all it takes – just noticing the pencil for a second. What did that feel like, not trying to change anything, just acknowledging it?

Patient: I don't know — it actually felt kind of grounding for a second, like my shoulders eased and I wasn't planning three backup lessons at once. But then I guess my brain started racing again and I almost reached for the planner out of habit. It helped a little, but I'm embarrassed at how much a tiny thing did, and I don't know how to keep it from slipping back into panic.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged the initial grounding effect, which is a small victory, but also noticed that your brain quickly reverted back to planning mode. Goal: Connect the tiny act of noticing to a value, like taking care of yourself in class.

Therapist Answer:
That tiny moment of grounding felt like a small act of kindness to yourself – you gave yourself permission to pause from planning, even if it was just for a second. What would it mean to you to prioritize that small act of kindness in class, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I'm actually giving myself permission to be present instead of trying to control everything. But I'm also scared it would just be a one-off and I'd go right back to panicking — I don't know how to make that minute stick, and I'm already thinking about other things I should be doing instead. Can we maybe talk about small ways to remind myself without it feeling like another checklist?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the fear of it being a one-off and the struggle to make it stick – this is a common pattern in our minds. Goal: Introduce a small, experiential strategy to anchor this moment, rather than relying on mental reminders.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to remember to notice the pencil, you actually create a tiny physical anchor – like a small note on your desk or a tiny drawing – that reminds you of that one second of grounding?

Patient: I don't know... I guess a tiny note or drawing might help, but I'm already worried it'd just be another thing to remember and then I'll beat myself up if I forget. Maybe something I already touch, like a small sticker on my lanyard or a paperclip on my planner, would feel less like a task and more automatic.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a way to anchor this moment without adding another mental task, and you're considering using something you already touch as a physical reminder. Goal: Introduce a small, automatic action that connects to that sticker or paperclip.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try attaching the sticker to the paperclip. As soon as you touch the paperclip, you'll know that tiny moment of grounding is already there, even before you think about it. What's one thing you could do in that moment, when you touch the paperclip, that feels connected to taking care of yourself in class?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I touch the paperclip I could take one slow breath, tell myself "one minute," and look for one curious student — just one face to remind me why I'm there. Then maybe do one tiny task, like jot a single learning objective on a sticky note instead of trying to plan the whole lesson. I'm already worried it'll turn into another thing to forget and then I'll beat myself up, though.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the small actions that feel connected to taking care of yourself in class, and you're worried about turning it into another task. Goal: Emphasize the core intention behind these actions, rather than the specific steps.

Therapist Answer:
When you touch the paperclip, it's not about doing "one thing" or "one task" – it's about connecting to your value of being present and caring for students. That breath, the phrase "one minute," and the single curious face are just tiny threads to weave into that value. Can you see how these small actions become a gentle reminder of what matters most to you in that moment?

Patient: I guess I can see that — it feels like a softer way to remind myself why I'm here, not just another to-do. I don't know, I'm still scared it'll feel fake or I'll forget and then beat myself up about it. Maybe we could also talk about how this shows up when I'm grading — that feels even worse and I don't know where to start.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that this small act of presence might be more genuine than your usual grading approach, and you're hesitant about how it might show up in grading – this is a common fear. Goal: Connect the act of presence to the values that guide your grading, rather than just the act itself.

Therapist Answer:
When you're grading, what's the value that's driving you to do what you're doing? Is it about fairness, accuracy, or supporting student growth? How might this small act of presence when teaching – noticing one curious face – show up in grading, as a way to connect with those values?

Patient: I guess when I'm grading it's about fairness and wanting students to actually learn, not just get a score — I want to help them improve. Maybe noticing that curious face could shift me toward growth: write one encouraging comment and one tiny next-step instead of getting stuck on every point. I don't know if I won't still obsess over points though — it feels overwhelming just thinking about it.

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the values that drive your grading, and you're seeing how noticing that curious face might shift your focus to growth – this is a powerful connection. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible action to make this value feel more concrete, rather than getting overwhelmed by the thought of grading.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take that single encouraging comment and tiny next-step. What would it mean to write it on the paper, right after you've noticed that curious face? Just write it down, without thinking about all the other points. Can you see how that small action might connect to your value of fairness and supporting student growth?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if I just write one brief encouraging line and one tiny next-step right after I spot that curious face, it would feel like I'm actually supporting them instead of obsessing over every mistake. But my head's kind of racing and I'm distracted — I'm already worrying I'll forget or that it'll take too long and then I'll have a pile of papers staring at me. Maybe something super short like "Nice idea — try adding X next time" could work, but I'm not confident I won't freak out about the rest.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the small action of writing one brief encouraging line and one tiny next-step as a way to connect with your values, but you're getting caught up in the "what ifs" about forgetting or being overwhelmed. Goal: Ground this small action in the present moment, without worrying about the bigger picture.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the very next moment when you see that curious face. Just as soon as you notice it, take one tiny breath and write the single phrase: "Nice idea — try adding X next time". No thinking about the rest, no worrying about forgetting. Just that one small action, in this exact moment.

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try that — when I spot a curious face I'll take one breath and write "Nice idea — try adding X next time" without overthinking. I don't know, my mind's really racing and I'm having trouble staying with one thing; I keep picturing the whole pile of papers and freaking out. Can we maybe practice how to keep it that short when I'm panicking?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to stay with the small action due to racing thoughts and panicking about the bigger picture. Goal: Introduce a simple technique to anchor the breath and focus on the physical sensation, rather than the thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a tiny anchor: when your mind starts racing and you feel the panic rise, notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just feel the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. When you notice your breath is moving, say to yourself "In" (as you inhale) or "Out" (as you exhale), and hold it for just one beat. That's it. No thinking, no trying to control anything. Just the physical sensation of the breath, and the tiny phrase "Nice idea — try adding X next time".

Patient: Okay, I can try that, but my chest feels tight and my thoughts are jumping all over — I don't know how long I can hold it without picturing the pile of papers. I guess having you guide me through a few breaths might help so I don't spiral into planning. Can we just do it together for, like, three breaths?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed and the tightness in your chest is making it hard to focus. Goal: Use this moment to anchor the breath and calm the physical sensation, rather than trying to push through the thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take three breaths together. I'll guide you through each one. Ready? Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs... hold... exhale slowly through your mouth... hold. Just the breath, no thinking. Next breath... inhale... hold... exhale... hold. No thoughts, just the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Last breath... inhale... hold... exhale... hold.

Patient: I don't know — that actually helped for a second, my shoulders eased, but my chest's still tight and my mind's already racing back to the pile of papers. I guess I can try another round, but can you keep it super simple and count with me? Can we do one slow breath together and then practice saying the "Nice idea — try adding X next time" phrase right after?

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the physical sensation of tension is still present, but willing to try again with a simple approach. Goal: Use the counted breaths to anchor the moment, and then focus on the phrase with precision.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it: Inhale with me... 1... hold... exhale with me... 2... hold... exhale with me... 3... hold... Now, right after your next breath, let's practice saying the phrase together: "Nice idea — try adding X next time". Ready?

Patient: Okay... I'm ready. Inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... (breath) "Nice idea — try adding X next time." I don't know, that helped a little but my chest's still tight and my mind's already back on the pile of papers — can we do another one and count with me slowly?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try again, and the phrase is starting to feel more concrete. Goal: Use the slow count to create a tiny pause before the phrase, and focus on the physical sensation of the chest tension.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, slowly: Inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... (pause for a beat) "Nice idea — try adding X next time". Ready?

Patient: Okay... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... (breath) "Nice idea — try adding X next time." I don't know — that helped a little, but my chest's still tight and my mind's already darting back to the pile of papers. Can we do one more, really slowly, and count with me so I don't rush it?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try again, and the pause is becoming more noticeable. Goal: Use the slow count to create a tiny gap between the breath and the phrase, allowing you to connect with the physical sensation before adding the words.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it one more time, really slowly: Inhale... 1... hold... (pause for 2 beats) exhale... 2... hold... (pause again) "Nice idea — try adding X next time". Ready?

Patient: Okay... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... (breath) "Nice idea — try adding X next time." I don't know — that helped for a second but my chest is still tight and my head's already darting back to the pile of papers and things I forgot to do. I feel jittery and kind of scattered; can we slow down? I'm worried I won't be able to keep it together in class.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the tightness in your chest and scattered thoughts are still present, and you're worried about maintaining focus in class. Goal: Use this moment to acknowledge the struggle and gently acknowledge that it's okay to be scattered – it doesn't mean you've failed.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel scattered and worried about being able to focus. That's actually a sign that you're trying something new and it's working. Remember that it's just one tiny moment of focus – it doesn't have to be perfect. What if, instead of trying to control your thoughts, you allowed yourself to be with the physical sensation of your chest tightening, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice the tightness it just feels like my chest is squeezing and I want to jump up and fix something. I guess I could try to be with it without judging, but I'm really scared it'll pull me into thinking about everything I haven't done. Can we slow down and do one very slow breath together while you guide me through just noticing the tightness step by step?

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the physical sensation of the chest tightening as a source of discomfort, and you're worried about getting pulled into thinking about everything you haven't done. Goal: Use this moment to anchor the physical sensation, step by step, without judgment or trying to control it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one very slow breath together. Inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... (pause for 5 beats) Now, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest tightening... where is it? Is it on the left side, the right side, or somewhere in the middle? Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it or fix it. What does it feel like?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight, heavy pressure right in the middle of my chest, and my breath gets really shallow. I guess my head's already darting to the pile of papers and stuff I should be doing, so I'm feeling restless and kind of distracted while I try to notice it.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the physical sensation of the chest tightening, but your head is already pulling you away with worries about work. Goal: Gently bring your attention back to the physical sensation, using a simple phrase to anchor the moment.

Therapist Answer:
When your mind starts to wander (and it's okay if it does), notice it. Say to yourself, "My mind is pulling me away" (or whatever phrase feels like "my mind is pulling me away" to you). Now, gently bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest... "the tight, heavy pressure" you noticed. Can you just notice that sensation for a moment, without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: I don't know... I can try. "My mind is pulling me away" — it's already doing that, I guess. The tight, heavy pressure is right in the middle, like someone's pressing on my sternum, and my breaths feel shallow and quick. I keep wanting to jump up and fix things, and it's hard to just sit with it — can we slow down and stay with this for a bit longer?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the effort to stay with the sensation, despite the pull of distractions. Goal: Use the present moment to create a tiny pause before trying to move forward.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one more deep breath together, just for a moment... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... Now, notice the sensation in your chest again, just for a moment... "the tight, heavy pressure" pressing on your sternum. Can you just be with that sensation, without trying to change it or fix it, for just one more heartbeat?

Patient: I don't know... I can try. It feels like a heavy pressure right in the middle, my breath gets shallow and my heart races — I actually held it for a beat, but then my head shot to the pile of papers and all the things I haven't done and I felt my chest tighten more. Can we slow down and do a few very slow breaths together or maybe use the paperclip anchor? I'm starting to feel panicky and restless and I don't want to spiral.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the pattern of holding your breath and then getting pulled away by worries, which is creating more tension. Goal: Use a gentle anchor to connect with your body, without judgment or trying to control it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the paperclip anchor. Remember the paperclip with the sticky note that says "Nice idea — try adding X next time"? Let's just focus on the paperclip right now. Notice its weight, its shape, its texture. Can you just be with the paperclip, without thinking about anything else? No worries about work, no thoughts about what you need to do. Just the paperclip.

Patient: I don't know... it's small and kind of light in my fingers, cold metal and smooth except where the sticker's stuck on — the sticker feels a little bumpy. My chest is already tight and my head keeps racing to the pile of papers, so I'm sort of jittery trying to just notice it. Can you guide me through touching it and doing one slow breath with me so I don't immediately spiral?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the physical sensations of the paperclip, but your body is already responding to the work worries. Goal: Gently connect with the tactile experience, and then use the breath to create a tiny pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the paperclip for just one moment. Reach out and gently touch the paperclip, noticing the cold metal, the smoothness, and the slight bump from the sticker. Just touch it, don't think about anything else. Now, let's do one slow breath together... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... Can you feel your chest slowing down, even if your mind is still racing?

Patient: I don't know... touching the paperclip and that breath helped a tiny bit, but my chest's still tight and my head's already on the pile of papers. Can we do another really slow breath together? And maybe afterward could we practice one super-short grading comment I can actually remember, because I'm scared I'll forget and then freak out.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the small breakthrough from the paperclip and breath, but still struggling with the physical tension. Goal: Use another slow breath to anchor the moment, and then practice a concrete grading comment to build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another slow breath together... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... Now, let's focus on just one word: "kindness". Say it to yourself: "kindness". Just the word. No thoughts about work, no worries about forgetting. Just the word "kindness".

Patient: I don't know... "kindness" — I said it out loud and it helped a tiny bit, like my shoulders eased for a second, but my chest's still tight and my head's back on the pile of papers. I guess can we practice that super-short grading comment now? I'm really worried I'll forget it and then freak out.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to practice the concrete grading comment, despite the lingering worries. Goal: Use the moment to anchor the comment in your body, and then take a small step towards implementing it in class.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice that super-short comment. Remember, it's just one sentence: "That idea shows me..." What word or phrase do you want to use to connect to their idea? For example, "That idea shows me you're..."? Try saying it out loud, slowly and clearly: "That idea shows me..."

Patient: I don't know... maybe, "That idea shows me you're thinking creatively." I guess that feels supportive but I'm already jittery and worried I'll blank when grading — can we say it together a few times so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've landed on a phrase that feels supportive, but the nervousness is still present. Goal: Use repetition and physical anchoring to make the phrase feel more concrete and manageable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's say it together a few times, slowly and clearly. Remember, it's just one sentence: "That idea shows me you're thinking creatively." Let's take a deep breath together... inhale... 1... hold... exhale... 2... hold... "That idea shows me you're thinking creatively." Repeat it with me: "That idea shows me you're thinking creatively."

Patient: I said it with you — "That idea shows me you're thinking creatively." I don't know, it helped for a second but my chest's still tight and my brain's already on the pile of papers. Can we do it a couple more times slowly? And I guess could we make an even shorter version I can actually remember when I'm panicking, like just "Good thinking"?
