Patient: I'm a construction worker and the burnout's been brutal — I've been drinking more to numb it, and my head's like this fortune-telling machine that only spits out disasters. I keep seeing the worst chain of events: I'll screw up a job, get fired, lose my place, end up alone and stuck, and that certainty makes me reach for a drink. I know it sounds messed up but any other outcome feels fake and impossible.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios are like a constant hum in the background, aren't they? What's one thing you'd be doing differently on a job site tomorrow if you knew with certainty you wouldn't mess up – something small that would mean just one less drink that night?

Patient: Honestly, I'd ask the foreman for a quick break or to swap me off the tricky stuff so I could focus — if I knew I wouldn't mess up I'd actually step back instead of numbing it with a beer. But I don't see that happening; if I asked he'd think I'm weak, bench me, they'd hire someone else, I'd lose hours, and then I wouldn't be able to pay rent and I'd drink even more — that's how it always goes in my head, no other ending feels real.

Therapist: That thought about needing a break to avoid messing up is a tiny spark – what's one tiny value-related reason you could do that small step for yourself, even if it feels impossible right now?

Patient: I guess a tiny reason is that I care about not letting the crew down — I want to be someone who shows up and does a good job, even if it's just stepping back for a minute. But my brain already says that'll blow up — they'll think I'm weak, cut my hours, and then everything spirals, so asking feels impossible.

Therapist: That care for the crew is what drives you to want to do a good job – what would that care look like in the midst of this "blowing up" scenario?

Patient: I guess it would look like owning up — asking for a quick break and then staying late or covering someone else so the job stays on track. But my head immediately jumps to them seeing me as weak, benching me, cutting my hours, me missing rent, drinking more to cope, and then getting fired and ending up on the street — that chain feels inevitable. I know it sounds dramatic but I can't shake that certainty, so even trying to do the right thing feels impossible.

Therapist: The thought about missing rent and ending up on the street is a story your mind is telling itself – can you name that story without judgment, like "that's a thought my brain is having right now"?

Patient: Yeah — that's the "I'm gonna screw up, get benched, miss rent, and end up on the street" story my brain's telling me right now. Saying it out loud doesn't make it feel any less real though; it still feels like the only thing that's going to happen.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to take that small step of asking for a break, not to change the outcome but just to see what happens – what's one tiny thing you could do right now to connect with that care for not letting the crew down?

Patient: Maybe I could ask for a quick 10-minute break or to swap off the tricky bit — right now I could rehearse exactly what I'd say or even scribble a two-line note to hand the foreman. But my head's already yelling they'll see it as weakness, bench me, cut my hours, and then I’ll start drinking more and everything collapses — so practicing feels pointless. I want to do it because I don't want to let the crew down, but I can't shake that disaster story, so it just feels impossible.

Therapist: What would happen if you asked for that break because you genuinely care about doing a good job for the crew, not because you're trying to avoid the worst-case scenario – what's one thing that value would look like in that moment?

Patient: I guess that value would look like me being straight with the foreman — asking for a quick ten-minute break, then staying late or swapping so the crew's not left hanging. But the minute I imagine doing that my brain goes, "He'll think you're weak, bench you, cut your hours, you miss rent, drink more, and everything collapses," so doing it feels impossible.

Therapist: What if the only thing you're trying to avoid is the story your brain is telling itself, not the outcome itself – can you ask for that break just because you're willing to do a good job for the crew, not because you're trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I wish I could ask for the break just because I care, but my brain won't let me. As soon as I picture it, it plays the whole thing out — he thinks I'm weak, benches me, cuts my hours, I miss rent, drink more, and then I'm screwed — so trying "just to see" feels impossible. I know that sounds stuck and stupid, but that's how hooked I am on the story, and it makes me reach for a beer instead.

Therapist: What's the tiny, tiny thing that's driving you to need to control this outcome, even though it's not working – is it the fear of being seen as weak, or something else?

Patient: Yeah — mostly it's the fear of being seen as weak. I get this rush of shame, like I already messed up once, so if I don't control everything now it'll just snowball — benched, cut hours, miss rent, drink more, end up alone — and any other outcome feels fake and impossible. That shame makes me try to force a safe result, even though forcing it only makes me numb out more.

Therapist: What would happen to that shame if you didn't try to control this outcome because it's not about being weak – would you still feel the same shame, or would something else show up – is there a value that matters more to you than avoiding that shame, like doing a good job for the crew?

Patient: If I didn't try to control it, the shame would probably hit me like a punch — raw, loud, and I’d feel exposed and useless, and honestly I'd reach for a drink to quiet it. Maybe underneath that panic there's the part of me that actually wants to do right by the crew, but my brain immediately says letting the shame sit will make everything spiral — benched, hours cut, rent missed, drinking more, ending up alone — so avoiding the shame feels like survival. I want the “do a good job” value to be bigger, but right now that disaster story drowns it out and I just feel stuck and pissed at myself for being stuck.

Therapist: Can you imagine doing that quick 10-minute break not because you're trying to avoid the shame, but because you genuinely want to show up for the crew – what would that small act feel like in your body, and what's one tiny step you could take right now to connect with that value without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I can kinda imagine it — my shoulders would loosen, my breath would drop a notch, and there'd be this tiny relief like I'm actually doing right by the crew. Right now my chest's tight, my stomach's knotted, I get hot and embarrassed and pissed at myself, and the urge to drink kicks in to quiet that. One tiny step I could take is rehearse one straight sentence on my phone or scribble a two-line note to give the foreman during lunch, or just take three slow breaths before I speak — but as soon as I picture it my brain goes, "They'll see you as weak, bench you, cut hours, you miss rent, drink more," so even that tiny step feels like it's already ruined.

Therapist: What if the tiny step wasn't about avoiding the shame or the disaster story, but about actually connecting with the value of doing a good job for the crew – can you say to yourself right now, "I'm willing to take this tiny step not to avoid the shame, but because it feels like it might actually help me do right by the crew"?

Patient: Okay — I'll say it: "I'm willing to take this tiny step not to avoid the shame, but because it might actually help me do right by the crew." But even saying that makes my chest clamp up and my face go hot like I already messed up, and my brain immediately launches the bench/cut-hours/miss-rent/drink-more spiral, so it still feels impossible to actually do it.

Therapist: What would happen to your body and your breath if you let go of the "it's gotta be perfect" story and just focused on taking that tiny step – what would you notice if you let your chest unclench and your face relax, without trying to control it?

Patient: If I let go a bit my chest would loosen and my breath would slow — my shoulders might drop and there'd be this tiny relief, like maybe I could actually think straight for a second. But the minute that calm shows up my brain starts the tape — they'll see me as weak, bench me, cut my hours, I miss rent, I drink more, and it all falls apart — any other outcome feels fake and impossible. I feel ashamed and pissed at myself for even wanting that calm, like I already messed up, so even the idea of letting go feels out of reach.

Therapist: What would happen to the shame and tension in your body if you didn't try to control it, but instead allowed yourself to be present with it – not as something to be "fixed" or "avoided," but just as it is?

Patient: If I let it be, my chest would feel crushed and my face would go hot — I'd feel totally exposed and useless, like everyone can see I messed up. That exposure would kick the urge to drink to shut it up, 'cause my brain immediately starts the benched/cut-hours/miss-rent spiral and I can't stand that. I want to try staying with it, but it just makes me furious at myself for being hooked on the worst-case story, and I don't know how to sit there without grabbing a beer.

Therapist: What would happen to the urge to drink if you allowed yourself to be present with the shame, without trying to "fix" it or escape it with a drink – what would you notice about the sensation of being furious at yourself, and how might that be connected to what you value most?

Patient: If I actually sit with it the urge to drink spikes — it's this hot, burning pressure in my chest and throat and my hands go shaky like I have to quiet it now. I'm furious at myself; the shame hits like this familiar punch and the self-talk is brutal — "you screwed up, you're useless." That fury's tied to wanting to be reliable for the crew and being terrified they'll see me as weak, and my brain just plays the spiral — benched, hours cut, miss rent, drink more — so being present feels unbearable and I reach for a beer.

Therapist: Just for the next breath, notice where your attention is right now – is it on the shame, the anger, the fear, or is it on the physical sensation of your hands shaking, the pressure in your chest, or the sound of your own voice? Can you gently acknowledge that these sensations are happening, without judgment, and without trying to change them – just observe them, like a wave passing by?

Patient: Right now my attention's split — mostly on the shame and this tight pressure in my chest and the shaking in my hands. I'm kind of confused though; I don't see how just noticing that stops the tape in my head — the minute I pay attention my brain goes, "That's proof you're failing, they'll bench you, cut hours, you'll miss rent," and it just spirals. Saying it out loud makes me feel exposed and furious at myself, and I can't tell if noticing it will help or just make me want a drink faster — how's just observing supposed to help with that?

Therapist: Noticing your thoughts isn't about stopping the spiral; it's about creating space to work with it. When you notice that thought "you're failing" popping up, what would it take for you to hold that thought without judgment – just for a moment, like watching a cloud pass by? Would you be able to see that it's just a thought, not a fact about you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to "just watch" that thought it lands like a verdict, not a cloud, and my chest clamps up and my hands shake. Holding it without judging feels impossible because the minute I look at it my brain shouts "proof" and plays the whole bench/cut-hours/miss-rent/drink-more tape, so it doesn't feel like just a thought. I get pissed at myself for not being able to do this and honestly don't see how noticing it won't just make me want a beer faster.

Therapist: Noticing your thoughts isn't about changing the story or stopping the spiral; it's about noticing the story itself. When you notice that thought "you're failing" popping up, what's one tiny thing you can do with it, right now, without trying to change it – is you can say to yourself, "I'm noticing this thought"? That's it – just noticing that thought, without judgment, without trying to fix it or escape it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try that it feels like admitting it, like saying "I'm noticing this thought" makes it real and my brain treats it as proof I'm failing. My chest clamps, that shame hits hard and I get pissed at myself, and then the whole tape starts — bench me, cut hours, miss rent, drink more — so "noticing" just feels like it's lighting the fuse. I can say it, but it doesn't calm anything; it just makes me want a beer faster.

Therapist: What's the purpose of noticing that thought "you're failing" – is it to change it, to stop the spiral, or is it something else? What would happen if noticing that thought wasn't about changing it, but about taking care of yourself in the moment – would that change how you feel about it, or about the drink?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to "notice" it just feels like admitting the verdict, like saying it out loud makes it real, and my chest clamps and my hands start shaking harder. I guess maybe the purpose could be to take care of myself for a second — give myself a beat to breathe instead of reaching for a beer — but honestly my brain instantly screams "proof" and starts the whole bench/cut-hours/miss-rent spiral, so it just makes me more desperate to drink. I want noticing to help, but right now it just feels like it lights the fuse, and that pisses me off at myself.

Therapist: What would your body do if you didn't try to change that thought, but instead let it be a tiny, tiny thing – like a single, hard knot in your chest – would that knot loosen, or would it still feel tight?

Patient: Maybe if I just let it be the knot would unclamp a hair — like one slow breath, shoulders dropping a millimeter. But then my brain immediately slams it shut with the whole bench/cut-hours/miss-rent/drink-more movie, the knot tightens worse, my hands shake, and I get this hot shame and fury at myself for not being able to hold it — I don't know how to sit with that without wanting a beer.

Therapist: What happens to that knot – does it feel less tight when you're trying to hold onto it, or does it just feel like you're fighting it even harder?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to let the knot be it sometimes unclenches a hair, like one slow breath, but the second that tiny loosen happens my brain treats it like proof I'm failing and the knot slams tighter. I get hot, ashamed, furious at myself, my hands start shaking, and I want a beer to shut it up because my head immediately runs the whole bench/cut-hours/miss-rent/drink-more movie. I honestly don't know how to sit with even a tiny bit of loosen without it flipping into that disaster tape.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to hold onto the looseness, you simply noticed that the knot is a little bit looser – without judgment, without trying to change it, without even thinking about what to do with it? What would happen to your body, to your thoughts, if you just let that tiny bit of looseness be?

Patient: I... I'm not sure. Maybe my chest eases a hair for a second, like you said, but then my brain screams that's the exact moment everything's exposed — they'll see me as weak, bench me, cut hours, I miss rent, and I drink more. It's confusing and it feels like a trap, and I get furious and ashamed at myself for even wanting that tiny loosen.

Therapist: Just for the next heartbeat, let your chest be the tiny bit looser, without thinking about what's "behind" it. No judgment, no analysis, no "what will happen next". Just the sensation of that tiny bit of looseness, right now, without trying to hold onto it or push it away.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try that my head just flips out. There's this sharp shame from something that happened before that slams the tiny looseness shut the second it shows up, and my brain immediately screams, "They'll see you as weak, bench you, cut hours, you'll miss rent, you'll drink more." How is just noticing supposed to help when it feels like it's lighting the fuse? I'm confused and pissed at myself.

Therapist: What's the value that's driving that shame response – is it avoiding being seen as weak, or is it something else? What would happen to that shame if you didn't try to avoid being seen as weak, but instead looked at it as a signal that you're showing up, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: I think it's mostly that I don't want anyone to see me as weak — and underneath that there's this need to be reliable for the crew so I don't feel like a screw-up. If I tried to treat the shame like a signal I'm actually showing up, it just goes raw and my chest slams shut; I get hot, my hands shake, and my brain immediately plays the bench/cut-hours/miss-rent/drink-more movie. I don't really get how looking at it that way helps — it just makes me furious at myself and even more desperate for a beer.

Therapist: What would happen to your need for reliability if you allowed yourself to feel the shame without trying to push it away – would that change how you feel about being seen as weak, or would something else show up?

Patient: I... I don't know — when I let the shame sit it feels like I'm naked and useless, my chest crushes, my face goes hot and I get furious at myself. That need to be reliable doesn't disappear; if anything it kicks into overdrive and I end up trying to control it, which in my head always becomes the moment they bench me, cut my hours, I miss rent, and I drink to shut it up. I'm confused when you say "let it be" because it sounds like it should help, but all I can see is that spiral — so I don't see how sitting with the shame would make me less scared of being seen as weak; it just makes me want a beer more.

Therapist: What if, for just one tiny moment, you didn't try to push the shame away? You didn't try to control it, or change it, or avoid it – you just noticed it, as it was, right in this moment? What would happen if you didn't try to "fix" it, or "change" it, but just... noticed it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try that the shame just swallows me; my chest crushes, my hands shake, my face goes hot, and I can feel the beer reaching for me. Maybe for a heartbeat it loosens and I think I could sit with it, but the second that happens my brain screams they'll see me as weak, bench me, cut my hours, I'll miss rent, and everything spirals, so I bolt for a drink. I'm confused and pissed at myself because I want to try just noticing, but it feels like a trap and I don't know how to stay there without freaking out.
