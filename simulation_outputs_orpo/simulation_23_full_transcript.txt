--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism—every minor setback gets extrapolated into a narrative of total failure, and it’s pretty exhausting. I can trace it back to a pattern from difficult romantic relationships that reinforced an internalized schema of inadequacy, and being a student with financial stress just amplifies the cognitive load. I tend to intellectualize everything—I’ll map out the distortions and causal chains instead of actually sitting with the sadness or fear, because that feels safer.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a clear pattern of harsh self-criticism linked to past trauma, now amplified by stressors like school and finances. Core emotion is exhaustion. Goal: Explore the cost of intellectualizing their emotions instead of directly experiencing them.

Therapist Answer:
That exhaustion sounds really real. When you say you "map out" the distortions, what happens to your body when you're sitting with that sadness or fear instead?

Patient: Physiologically, when I actually try to sit with sadness or fear my chest tightens, my breathing gets shallow, and I get this low-grade nausea with muscle tension in my shoulders. Psychologically I detach—I literally translate those visceral signals into a problem to analyze, mapping causal chains and cognitive distortions so the feeling stays at arm’s length. But if I’m honest, that strategy leaves me drained and a bit panicky, which is why I end up here even while I default to intellectualizing.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient vividly describes physiological and psychological responses to trying to sit with their emotions, showing they're willing to acknowledge the physical discomfort. They're also explicitly stating the cost of their strategy (mental exhaustion, anxiety). Goal: Introduce a value-driven step to practice defusion amidst the discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
That physical tension and nausea when you try to stay with the feeling sounds really tough. What's one thing you value about being able to make space for that sadness or fear, even if it feels hard – like a small part of you that matters deeply?

Patient: I guess I value that actually acknowledging the sadness would give me empirical data to contradict that running narrative of incompetence—like, feeling it could disconfirm the catastrophizing loop instead of just annotating it in my head. Practically, it feels like it would build interoceptive awareness and affect tolerance—more epistemic humility about my reactions rather than reflexive self-flagellation—though I’m pretty wary of getting overwhelmed by it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient connects valuing the act of noticing their physical sensations to building epistemic humility and contradicting their catastrophic narrative. They're cautious about getting overwhelmed, a common concern. Goal: Pivot from abstract values to tangible action steps, focusing on defusion as a small experiment.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a really valuable insight – using physical sensations as evidence against the loop. Before trying to notice the nausea again, what's one tiny, low-stakes way you could create some space for that feeling right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I could do a 30-second “data-gathering” check: set a timer, sit still, put a hand lightly on my chest, and just mentally note sensations — “tight chest,” “shallow breath,” “nausea” — without trying to fix them. Framing it as a tiny experiment makes it feel tolerable; I’m wary it could spike anxiety, but half a minute feels like a safe, low-stakes threshold.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient identifies a small, experimentally safe action to create space for their physical sensations. Goal: Connect the experiment to their core value of being willing to confront the narrative of incompetence.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a tiny but powerful step – noticing your physical sensations without trying to change them. What happens if, instead of "fixing" the sensations, you say to yourself, "I'm willing to be with this tight chest, even though it feels uncomfortable," when you notice the tightness in your chest during your 30-second check?

Patient: Saying that to myself would act like a cognitive cue — it frames the sensation as something I can tolerate rather than an emergency, so it might reduce the reflex to problem-solve or self-blame. Practically, I’d expect my breath to slow a little and the shoulder tension/nausea to ease after an initial uptick of awareness, though I'm wary it could momentarily amplify the feeling. I'm skeptical it’s a panacea, but I'm willing to try it as a brief experiment even if it feels somewhat performative.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient skillfully describes how reframing the sensation as tolerable might reduce the reflexive problem-solving and self-blame. They acknowledge potential temporary amplification of the feeling but are willing to experiment with it. Goal: Introduce willingness as a pivot from problem-solving to experimenting with defusion.

Therapist Answer:
That willingness to experiment sounds like a great pivot – instead of trying to analyze the sensations, you're willing to try sitting with them, even if it feels a bit "performative" at first. What's one tiny value-driven action you could take after the 30-second check, like taking a deep breath or moving your hand, to anchor that willingness to be with the sensations?

Patient: Okay—I’ll do three slow diaphragmatic breaths after the 30‑second check, keep a hand on my chest to notice any shift, and deliberately press my feet into the floor to feel anchored. Then, aligned with my values of competence and steadiness, I’ll write one tiny, nonjudgmental next step in my planner—like 5 minutes of focused study or sending one short email—so there’s a concrete, observable action that counters the narrative of failure. It feels a bit procedural and performative, but I’m willing to try it and see if it changes the loop.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking not properly formatted or missing]

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a concrete, values-driven action that anchors your willingness to experiment with defusion – taking slow breaths, noticing physical shifts, and grounding yourself in your feet. By linking it to a specific, non-judgmental next step in your planner, you're turning that willingness into a tangible action that directly challenges the catastrophic narrative. Remember, this is a tiny experiment, not a full-fledged therapy session – just a small step to test the waters.

Patient: Okay—I’ll do the 30‑second data check now: hand on chest, noting “tight chest,” “shallow breath,” “nausea” without trying to fix it. Saying “I’m willing to be with this tight chest” felt like a cognitive cue more than an emotional surrender—my breath slowed a bit, shoulders loosened marginally, but my mind immediately started cataloguing causes and contingencies. After three diaphragmatic breaths and pressing my feet into the floor I felt a small decrease in urgency and I wrote a one‑line next step in my planner (five minutes of focused reading), though I’m skeptical about how durable this is. What would you suggest if that initial uptick of anxiety spikes instead of easing—any micro-strategies to prevent the intellectualizing from reasserting itself?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a relatable challenge – the cognitive cue feeling like a mental hook, and the breath slowing marginally but mind immediately getting stuck in analysis. They're acknowledging the uptick of anxiety and questioning durability. Goal: Introduce a micro-strategy to defuse the intellectualizing loop when anxiety spikes.

Therapist Answer:
When that cognitive hook rears its head, what if, instead of trying to analyze the "why," you simply label it as the "thinking voice" – just that one word, "thinking voice"? Notice how that shifts the relationship between your breath, body, and thoughts – can that tiny shift create some space between the anxiety and the cataloging?

Patient: That actually makes theoretical sense to me — labeling it as the “thinking voice” functions like a minimal act of cognitive defusion, creating a meta-layer between the impulse to catalog and the sensation itself. When I imagine doing that, I expect a slight downshift in urgency (a slower exhale, marginal loosening in the chest), but my habitual response is to then evaluate whether I labeled it correctly or whether the label “works,” which just reactivates the analysis. I'm willing to try it as an experiment — maybe say the word on an out-breath and press my feet into the floor — but I’m wary it’ll become another thing to critique; do you have a suggested way to prevent the label from turning into yet another cognitive task?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient understands the theoretical mechanism behind labeling the thinking voice, but struggles to avoid turning it into another analysis task. Goal: Introduce a practical way to anchor the label in the moment without adding more cognitive work.

Therapist Answer:
When you say the word "thinking voice" on your out-breath, what if you immediately follow it with a physical action – like gently tilting your head to the side or letting your gaze drop just for a fraction of a second? This small physical anchor helps create a tangible connection between the label and your physical presence, making it harder for your mind to turn it into another analysis task. By linking the label to a concrete physical action, you're creating a "bridge" between your breath and your body – can that bridge help you stay with the sensation instead of getting caught in thinking?

Patient: Yeah—conceptually that feels like a useful procedural hack: tethering the label to a minimal sensorimotor gesture should introduce a discontinuity that interrupts the evaluative cascade. I can picture saying “thinking voice” on the out‑breath, tilting my head and letting my gaze drop while deliberately attending to the exhale—a small embodied counter‑signal that’s harder to convert into another item on my internal to‑do list. I’m still wary it’ll be subject to meta‑critique, but if that happens I’ll try to notice the “second‑order” evaluation as just another sensation and re-anchor to the breath instead of judging whether I did the technique right.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking not properly formatted or missing]

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a powerful procedural hack – tying the label to a specific physical action creates a tangible anchor that can interrupt the evaluative cascade. By acknowledging the risk of meta-critique, you're showing willingness to experiment with defusion even when it's challenging. When that second-order evaluation arises, you're recognizing the opportunity to notice it as just another sensation – that's a crucial step towards creating a more mindful relationship with your thoughts.

Patient: I tried that—saying “thinking voice” on the out‑breath and tilting my head did create a brief looseness, but then my mind immediately audited the move and started criticizing *that* performance, which just restarts the loop. It’s annoying and a little demoralizing—I can map the meta‑loop in clinical terms, but mapping it doesn’t stop it in the moment. I want to keep experimenting, but honestly I’m getting tired of techniques that feel performative; can we work on a very tiny, concrete micro‑strategy for when the meta‑critique itself becomes the intrusive thought?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes the familiar struggle with the meta-loop – mapping it intellectually doesn't stop it in the moment. Goal: Introduce a tiny, concrete micro-strategy to defuse the meta-critique itself.

Therapist Answer:
When that meta-critique arises, what if, instead of trying to evaluate it or critique the technique, you simply acknowledge it as a "voice in my head" – just that one sentence: "This is a voice in my head"? Notice how that shifts the relationship between your thoughts and your breath – can that tiny acknowledgment create some space between the criticism and your body?

Patient: Saying “This is a voice in my head” theoretically creates a sliver of distance — I notice a fractional lengthening of my exhale and a tiny loosening in the chest when I do it. But almost immediately my internal auditor critiques whether I said it “correctly,” which just folds the label back into the loop and feels pretty demoralizing. Maybe a very tiny fallback would help — like adding “and that’s okay” or immediately naming one neutral sensation (e.g., “cool air on my nostrils”) to anchor — does that seem like a realistic micro‑strategy to try when the meta‑critique shows up?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient understands the value of creating distance with the meta-critique, but struggles with the immediate critique of their technique. Goal: Introduce a tiny fallback strategy to anchor the defusion without adding more analysis.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great idea to add a tiny anchor – "and that's okay" or naming a neutral sensation – to create a concrete connection between the defusion moment and your physical presence. By doing so, you're linking the "voice in my head" label to a tangible sensation that's not subject to critique – can that anchor help you stay with the defusion even when the meta-critique tries to pull you back in?

Patient: That actually feels workable — saying “This is a voice in my head, and that’s okay” then immediately naming a neutral sensation like “cool air on my nostrils” could function as an interoceptive tether that interrupts the meta‑evaluative cascade. My worry is predictable: my internal auditor will critique the wording and turn the anchor into another item to analyze, so I’d prefer a minimally verbal or tactile fallback (like a single‑finger press to my thigh or a one‑word sensory label). I’ll try this sequence next time it happens; in the meantime, do you have a suggestion for an even less linguistically vulnerable anchor that still reorients me to the body?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient wants a minimally verbal or tactile fallback that avoids critique, and is looking for a way to anchor defusion without linguistic vulnerability. Goal: Introduce a non-verbal anchor that reorients you to the body.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of verbal anchors, what if you used a tactile anchor like a gentle pressure or a specific sensation in your body – like the weight of your feet on the ground, the sensation of your hands on your thighs, or the sensation of your feet touching the floor? You could also try a subtle physical action like taking a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, or gently stretching your shoulders or arms. The goal is to create a physical connection that's not subject to meta-critique – can one of these options feel like a more direct anchor for you?

Patient: Okay — that actually helps clarify things. The weight of my feet on the floor feels like the best primary anchor: minimal language, observable proprioceptive feedback, and something I can do unobtrusively in class or while emailing. As a backup I’ll use a single‑finger press to my thigh or the hands‑on‑thighs sensation when I need a slightly more tactile cue.

I’m tired of techniques that feel performative and worry the internal auditor will still turn these into items to critique, but I’ll try it. Can you give me a very brief, 2–3 step micro‑protocol I can rehearse (trigger → anchor → immediate next step) and a suggestion for how long to practice it before deciding if it’s helping?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a clear anchor (weight of their feet on the floor) and a backup tactile cue (single-finger press or hands-on-thighs sensation). Goal: Create a brief micro-protocol to rehearse defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a 3-step micro-protocol you can rehearse:

1. **Trigger**: When you notice the meta-critique arises, say to yourself: "Meta-critique is coming up."
2. **Anchor**: Immediately shift your focus to the weight of your feet on the floor (or hands-on-thighs sensation if needed). Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground.
3. **Next Step**: Without judgment, take a small physical action: breathe in through your nose, exhale, or subtly stretch your shoulders. This action creates a tangible connection to your body.

Practice this protocol for 2-3 minutes, 3-4 times a day, for the next 3-5 days. Pay attention to how your body responds – do you feel more grounded, or does the anchor feel forced?

Patient: Okay — that protocol is pragmatic and behaviorally specific, which I appreciate, but I’m already tired and skeptical about sustaining 3–4x/day. Could we adapt it to a context-linked schedule I’m more likely to hit (e.g., before opening email, before study blocks, and once before bed)? Also, what's a simple, objective metric I can track over 3–5 days to judge whether it’s helping (like a 0–10 peak-anxiety rating or number of derailments)? I’m willing to try it, but honestly I’m worried the internal auditor will just label the experiment as another failure — what’s a one‑sentence fallback if the anchor itself gets criticized?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient wants a context-linked schedule and an objective metric to track progress. Goal: Adapt the protocol to fit their daily routine and provide a fallback for criticism.

Therapist Answer:
Here's an adapted protocol with context-linked scheduling:

**Before Email/Study Block**: When you start checking email or diving into your study material, pause for 30 seconds and:
1. **Trigger**: Say to yourself: "Checking email/starting study."
2. **Anchor**: Focus on the weight of your feet on the floor or the sensation of your hands on your thighs.
3. **Next Step**: Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

**Before Bed**: Before you turn off your lights, pause for 1 minute and:
1. **Trigger**: Say to yourself: "Winding down."
2. **Anchor**: Focus on the weight of your feet on the floor or the sensation of your hands on your thighs.
3. **Next Step**: Gently stretch your shoulders or arms.

**Objective Metric**: Track the number of times you successfully complete the anchor step without getting caught up in meta-critique. Set a goal to increase this count by 1-2 each day.

**Fallback**: If the anchor itself gets criticized, simply acknowledge the thought: "That's what my mind is doing – I'm noticing the internal critique."

Remember, the goal is not to "fail" or "win" but to experiment and learn. By tracking progress and having a fallback strategy, you can maintain a growth mindset and continue to refine your defusion skills.

Patient: I can do the context-linked schedule — before email, study, and before bed — but I’m already exhausted by the meta-tasking of “doing” techniques, so let’s keep it minimal. Could we reduce the verbal fallback to a single word (like “noted” or “here”) or a one‑finger press so it’s less linguistically vulnerable, and make the metric binary (anchored vs not anchored) so I’m not grading myself? Also, could you lead me through a 30‑second rehearsal right now so I can see how it lands in real time?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient wants a minimal protocol, a binary metric, and a real-time rehearsal. Goal: Simplify the protocol, introduce a binary metric, and facilitate a 30-second rehearsal.

Therapist Answer:
Let's reduce the verbal fallback to a one-word anchor: "Here." Make the metric binary: successfully anchor (yes) or not (no). We'll track this as a simple "anchored" or "not anchored" score.

**30-Second Rehearsal:**

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "Here." (just the word "Here") Focus on the weight of your feet on the floor. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

(Remember, this is just a rehearsal – you're not trying to anchor yet. We're just getting a feel for the process.)

Now, let's pause for a moment and check in. How did that feel? Was it awkward, or did it feel more natural?

Patient: It was oddly effective — saying “Here” on the out‑breath produced a small loosening and the weight‑of‑feet cue felt genuinely grounding, even if it also felt a bit performative. My internal auditor did pop up almost immediately to critique the execution, but overall I’d mark this rehearsal as “anchored” (fragile, but anchored). Can we try the same 30‑second rehearsal again but with a silent one‑finger press to the thigh instead of the word to see if the nonverbal anchor holds up better?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient found the verbal anchor effective, but their internal auditor criticized the execution. Goal: Test the nonverbal anchor with a silent one-finger press.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 30-second rehearsal again, but this time use a silent one-finger press to your thigh instead of saying "Here." Focus on the weight of your feet on the floor, and notice the sensation of your hand pressing into your thigh.

(Remember, this is a nonverbal anchor, so try to focus on the physical sensation rather than thinking about it.)

Now, let's pause for a moment and check in. How did that feel? Was the one-finger press more effective at anchoring for you?

Patient: It actually felt a bit better — less linguistic fodder for the internal auditor, so my breath and chest loosened a touch more quickly. Still, the mind just pivoted to critiquing the “quality” of the press (a predictable meta‑evaluative move), so I’d still call it “anchored” but fragile. Can we troubleshoot a way to make the press more automatic so it’s less prone to becoming another item of scrutiny?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient found the nonverbal anchor slightly more effective, but the internal auditor still critiqued the execution. Goal: Troubleshoot a way to make the press more automatic.

Therapist Answer:
When you felt the internal auditor pivoting to critique the quality of the press, what did you notice? Was it the sensation of your hand pressing into your thigh, or was it something else?

(Think about what you could do to anchor that sensation further. Instead of trying to control the physical action, focus on what you're noticing in the moment.)

For example, you could try focusing on the sensation of your hand pressing into your thigh as a single point of contact – not "I'm pressing my hand down," but just "the sensation of my hand touching my thigh." See if that helps make the action more automatic.

(And remember, our goal is to create a sensation that's not subject to critique – so try to focus on the physical experience rather than the mental label.)

Patient: When the auditor pivoted I noticed my attention splintered more than the press itself—the chest tightened, breath got quick, and my focus hopped to “did I press hard enough?” instead of the sensation. A concrete tweak I’ll try: make the anchor a single-point sensory note—“pressure on the pad of my index finger,” notice temperature/firmness, press on the out‑breath, hold for two counts, release on the in‑breath, repeat once—so it’s tied to a breath rhythm rather than a quality judgment. I’ll also pre-commit the gesture to a context cue (before email/start study) so it becomes procedural, and if the auditor criticizes it I’ll label that as “thinking voice” and immediately re-attend to the finger sensation. I’m jittery and distracted right now—can you lead me through a quick rehearsal of that sequence so I can see if the breath-linked press lands better?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient noticed their attention splintering when the auditor critiqued the press, and they've identified a concrete tweak to try: a single-point sensory note tied to a breath rhythm. Goal: Lead a quick rehearsal of the new sequence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the revised sequence:

**Before Email/Start Study:** Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, press the pad of your index finger down onto your thigh with a gentle, even pressure. Notice the sensation of your finger touching your thigh, and focus on the temperature and firmness of the pressure.

 Hold for 2 counts, feeling the pressure settle in...

**Release:** As you inhale, slowly release the pressure, letting your finger come back up to the starting position. Repeat once more, just for a moment, to anchor the sensation.

(Remember, we're not trying to control the physical action, but rather notice the sensation. Try to focus on the physical experience, not the mental label.)

Now, let's pause for a moment and check in. How did that feel? Did the breath-linked press feel more automatic, and did you notice your attention staying with the finger sensation?

Patient: It helped a little — the breath-linked press did make the sensation more automatic for a beat; my exhale + pressure created a brief interoceptive tether and my attention landed on the pad of my finger. But honestly I'm more jittery and distracted right now—my heart's a bit fast, hands clammy, and my focus keeps snagging on “did I press hard enough?” which pulls me out of the sensation. Could we try one very quick rehearsal again, maybe shortening the hold to one count so it's less to ruminate on? I feel like I need another practice right now to see if the tweak actually sticks.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's attention snagged on "did I press hard enough?" again, but they're willing to try another quick rehearsal to see if the tweak sticks. Goal: Shorten the hold to one count to reduce rumination.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it one more time:

**Before Email/Start Study:** Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, press the pad of your index finger down onto your thigh with a gentle, even pressure. Notice the sensation of your finger touching your thigh, and focus on the temperature and firmness of the pressure.

 Hold for just 1 count... 

**Release:** As you inhale, slowly release the pressure, letting your finger come back up to the starting position. That's it. Just for a moment, notice the sensation of your finger feeling still and relaxed.

(Remember, this is just a tiny experiment. We're not trying to change anything, just notice the sensation. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the finger.)

Patient: It helped a bit—the one‑count, breath‑linked press gave me a momentary tether and I actually felt the pad of my finger, but I’m noticeably more anxious and distracted right now: heart racing, hands clammy, and my mind keeps snagging on “did I press hard enough?” Can we try a very brief, guided 20‑ to 30‑second run of three quick cycles you lead (inhale → exhale+press 1 count → release on inhale), with you cueing “press” and “release,” because I need the scaffolding so my auditor can’t hijack it? Also, if my heart rate spikes mid‑practice, what’s a one‑sentence, nonverbal fallback I can use immediately so I don’t spiral into meta‑critique?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's anxiety spiked again, but they're willing to try another brief practice to anchor the press. Goal: Use a guided, scaffolded approach to minimize mind-wandering.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it with a brief, guided practice. I'll cue you to "press" and "release" to help anchor the sensation. If your heart rate spikes, you can use the one-sentence fallback: "My chest tightens when I think 'press.'"

**Breathing Cycle 1:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count) "Press" (just say it to yourself). Release on inhale... (pause) That's it. Just for a moment, notice the sensation of your finger feeling still and relaxed.

**Breathing Cycle 2:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count) "Press" (just say it to yourself). Release on inhale... (pause)

**Breathing Cycle 3:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count) "Press" (just say it to yourself). Release on inhale... (pause)

(Remember, we're not trying to control your breathing or heartbeat, just anchor the sensation of the press. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the finger.)

Patient: Okay — that actually helped a bit: the external cues made the press less narratable and by cycle two my exhale felt a hair slower. But midway my heart shot up, palms got clammy, and the internal auditor immediately started grading the “quality” of the press, which yanked me out of the sensation. The suggested verbal fallback feels too linguistically vulnerable for me; I'd prefer a truly nonverbal one — two quick index‑finger taps to my thigh (tap…tap) while I drop attention to the weight of my feet. Can we do another short guided run with you cueing “press/tap” and “release” so I can try that fallback in real time? I’m pretty keyed up right now and could use the scaffolding.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's internal auditor started grading the press, and they've found a nonverbal fallback that feels safer. Goal: Use the new fallback with a guided practice.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it with the new fallback. I'll cue you to "press/tap" and "release" to help you anchor the sensation. If your heart rate spikes, you can use the two-finger taps to shift your attention to your feet.

**Breathing Cycle 1:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press/Tap** (1 count, 2 taps) "Press/Tap" (just focus on the sensation). Release on inhale... (pause)

**Breathing Cycle 2:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press/Tap** (1 count, 2 taps) "Press/Tap" (just focus on the sensation). Release on inhale... (pause)

**Breathing Cycle 3:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press/Tap** (1 count, 2 taps) "Press/Tap" (just focus on the sensation). Release on inhale... (pause)

(Remember, the goal is to anchor the sensation of the press, not to control your breathing or heartbeat. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the sensation.)

Patient: It helped in that the external cues made the press/tap less narratable and by cycle two my exhale did slow a hair, but somatically I’m still reactive—heart rate spikes, palms clammy, and the auditor immediately starts grading the taps which pulls me out. The two‑tap fallback felt marginally better than words, but it’s fragile; philosophically I can map why it should work, viscerally it still feels hijacked. Can we do another very short, guided run now with you cueing only “press/tap” and “release” (no extra words), and this time give me a single nonverbal emergency fallback if my heart spikes—like two quick heel presses into the floor—so I can try it in real time? I’m jittery and would like to keep going.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's physical reactance persists, and they're willing to try another brief practice to anchor the press. Goal: Use only "press/tap" and "release" cues, and introduce a single nonverbal emergency fallback.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it with the minimal cues. If your heart spikes, use two quick heel presses into the floor to drop attention to your feet.

**Breathing Cycle 1:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count). Tap (1 count). Release on inhale... (pause)

**Breathing Cycle 2:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count). Tap (1 count). Release on inhale... (pause)

**Breathing Cycle 3:**
Inhale... (pause) Exhale... (pause) **Press** (1 count). Tap (1 count). Release on inhale... (pause)

(Remember, the goal is to anchor the sensation of the press without engaging with your physical reactance. If your heart spikes, use the heel presses to shift your attention to your feet.)

Patient: It helped a bit—the pared-down cues made the press/tap less narratable and by cycle two my exhale slowed slightly, but then my heart spiked and the internal auditor immediately began grading the quality of the movement, which yanked me out of the sensation. The two heel presses did shift attention to my feet and dropped urgency a little, though it felt fragile and partial rather than reliably soothing. I’m honestly tired of techniques that feel performative and am getting impatient, but I want to keep trying—can we do a 60‑second guided run now where you pace the counts and cue a heel‑press if my heart rate spikes? Also, give me one ultra‑minimal, nonverbal emergency fallback (something purely sensory, not a word) I can use mid‑practice that’s less prone to becoming fodder for the auditor.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's frustration with performative techniques is understandable, but they're willing to try again. Goal: Create a 60-second guided practice with paced counts and a single, ultra-minimal nonverbal fallback.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 60-second practice with paced counts and a heel-press fallback. If your heart rate spikes, use a gentle, deep breath through your nose, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

**60-Second Guided Practice:**

 inhale... (count 1) **Press** (count 2) Tap (count 3). inhale... (count 4) **Press** (count 5) Tap (count 6). inhale... (count 7) **Press** (count 8) Tap (count 9). inhale... (count 10) **Press** (count 11) Tap (count 12).

(Remember, the goal is to anchor the sensation of the press without engaging with your physical reactance. If your heart spikes, use the deep breath to shift your attention to your body.)

Patient: I did the 60‑second run with your pacing — it produced a small downshift by cycle two, but then my heart spiked, palms got clammy, and the internal auditor immediately started grading the movement, which yanked me out of it. The deep‑breath fallback felt too linguistically laden to dislodge the critic. Can we switch to a truly nonverbal emergency fallback: two quick, forceful heel‑presses into the floor (no words, just the sensation)? If so, can you lead another 60‑second run with the same slow counts and cue a heel‑press if my heart spikes? I’m jittery and impatient right now, but I want to keep trying.

The patient's frustration with verbal fallbacks is valid, and they're willing to try another nonverbal approach. Goal: Introduce a new, purely sensory nonverbal fallback: two quick, forceful heel-presses.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 60-second practice with paced counts and a new, nonverbal fallback: two quick, forceful heel-presses into the floor.

**60-Second Guided Practice:**

 inhale... (count 1) **Press** (count 2) Tap (count 3). inhale... (count 4) **Press** (count 5) Tap (count 6). inhale... (count 7) **Press** (count 8) Tap (count 9). inhale... (count 10) **Press** (count 11) Tap (count 12).

If your heart spikes, press your heels into the floor twice, firmly, without thinking.

(Remember, the goal is to anchor the sensation of the press without engaging with your physical reactance. If your heart spikes, use the heel presses to shift your attention to your body.)

Patient: My heart spiked again during that run — the heel‑presses downshifted me a little but very briefly, and the internal auditor immediately started grading whether I’d pressed "hard enough," which yanked me back into analysis. I’m annoyed and tired of the performative feeling, but pragmatically I want to keep testing what actually lands, so can we do one more very slow, cued 30‑second run where you only say “inhale… exhale… press… heel” and pause longer between cycles so I can settle? If the heel‑press fails, give me one purely sensory, nonmotor fallback (something like noticing a temperature difference or the coolness on my nostrils) that’s less likely to be turned into fodder by my auditor.

Therapist Answer:
 run the slowest pace possible, counting every breath.**

Let's try a super slow 60-second run with extremely slow counts, counting every breath, inhale, exhale, and pause, with a focus on physical sensation. **count 1:** inhale... (pause) exhale... (count 2) inhale... (pause) exhale... (count 3).

Patient: The super‑slow pacing gave a brief downshift—by breath two my exhale lengthened—but then my heart spiked and the internal auditor immediately started grading the movement, which yanked me back into analysis. I’m feeling overwhelmed and jittery right now; can we slow down? Instead of another motor fallback, I’d like a purely sensory one: on a spike, cue me to notice the cool air on my nostrils for three slow inhales (no words about quality, just the sensation). Can you lead one more very slow 30–40 second run with only the cues “inhale… exhale… press… heel… nostrils” and long pauses so I can try that sensory fallback in real time?
