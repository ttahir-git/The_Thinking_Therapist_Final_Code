Patient: I've been feeling like my life is just my job — I'm an accountant and I'm stuck, directionless, and can't tell what matters to me beyond that role. Family fights have been constant and it's made the anxiety worse, like everything's just piling up and I don't know what's mine to fix. I'm skeptical this will help, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: That feeling of life being just about work is really heavy, especially with family fights making it hard to breathe. What's one thing that used to make you feel excited or hopeful when you were younger, something that's still possible for you now, even if it's not related to your job?

Patient: I used to do woodworking — making small furniture and fixing things — and it actually made me feel like I could create something that mattered. How is that supposed to help? I tried picking it back up once and got anxious after an hour, but maybe starting with tiny projects could be doable.

Therapist: It sounds like making small furniture brought a sense of purpose, even if it felt overwhelming now. Can you imagine what it would be like to hold one of those small pieces you made in your hands, knowing you created something that matters to you? What's the smallest, tiny step you could take today to make space for that feeling, like gathering some wood or a small tool?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is just pulling one small piece of scrap wood and one hand tool onto the kitchen table for fifteen minutes tonight—just to touch it and not try to make anything. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but last time I did an hour and got panicky, so a short, visible reminder might feel less overwhelming and remind me I'm not only an accountant.

Therapist: That's a great way to start - just having the tools and wood out for 15 minutes tonight feels like a tiny act of defiance against the anxiety that's been building up. What's one thing you're willing to do with those tools right now, without trying to make anything, just to hold them and acknowledge you're still a maker?

Patient: Alright — I'll grab one small rasp and that scrap wood, sit at the kitchen table, and just hold it and run the rasp gently over the grain for five minutes with a timer. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but maybe the no-pressure touch will be less likely to make me panic; I'm already feeling tense just saying it.

Therapist: Just holding that rasp and running it over the wood for five minutes, with no expectation of making anything, feels like a small act of kindness to yourself. What's one thing you value about that feeling of holding the rasp, even if it's just for five minutes, that might help you remember you're not just an accountant, but also a person who can create?

Patient: I value that it's tactile and predictable — something I can control for a few minutes and actually see progress on, which reminds me I can make things that aren't spreadsheets or family arguments. How is that supposed to help long-term? I don't know, but even a tiny, concrete reminder like that might stop me from feeling like my whole identity is just work for a little while.

Therapist: That tactile, predictable experience with the rasp reminds you that you can create something meaningful beyond spreadsheets and family arguments. What's one value that comes up for you when you think of creating something with your own hands, like "connection with family" or "personal growth", that might help you see how this small act is actually connected to what matters most to you?

Patient: Ownership — having something that’s mine I can shape and finish. How is that supposed to help with the bigger stuck feeling, though?

Therapist: That sense of ownership over something you can shape and finish feels powerful, especially when you think about how it connects to your values. What's one small commitment you could make to yourself today, related to woodworking, that would help you actually take action towards that feeling of ownership, and how would that feel like a step towards moving forward with your stuckness?

Patient: Okay — I'll do the five-minute rasp tonight with a timer, and I'll also set aside one 20-minute block on Saturday to actually shape that scrap into a small wedge or coaster and put it on my desk when it's done. If I finish it, I guess it'll be tiny proof I can make and complete something that's mine, not a spreadsheet, which might feel like owning a little piece of myself. How is that supposed to fix the bigger stuck feeling? I don't know — I'm anxious even saying this — but maybe having a real, finished object will make change feel less abstract and a bit less scary.

Therapist: That small wedge or coaster on your desk will be tangible proof you can create something that's yours, not just a spreadsheet. What's one thing you're willing to say to yourself when you hold that finished coaster, not just "I did it," but something that connects that small act to what matters most to you, like "I'm capable of creating something that shows up in my life"?

Patient: Maybe I'll say, "This is mine — I made it, and I can finish things that matter to me," like a reminder I'm not only useful at work. How is that supposed to fix everything? I don't know — I'm anxious saying it, but even if it feels small, it might help me remember I can choose something for myself without it getting eaten by spreadsheets or family fights.

Therapist: That small reminder to yourself, "This is mine — I made it, and I can finish things that matter to me," might feel like a tiny anchor in the midst of anxiety. When you're feeling overwhelmed by spreadsheets or family fights, what's one physical sensation you can notice in your body that you're willing to stay with, like the breath moving in and out of your chest, as you say that phrase to yourself?

Patient: It's the tightness across my chest and my shoulders — my breathing gets shallow. I can try focusing on the rise and fall there for three slow breaths while I say, "This is mine — I made it, and I can finish things that matter to me." How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but I'll try it and see if it grounds me for a minute; I'm already nervous about doing it.

Therapist: That physical sensation in your chest, coupled with the slow, deliberate breaths, might provide a small, tangible space to pause the anxious thoughts. When you say "This is mine — I made it, and I can finish things that matter to me," what's one thing you're willing to observe about that tightness in your chest, like noticing it as a sensation rather than a "problem" – is that okay?

Patient: Okay — I can try noticing it as a physical pressure, like a tight band across my chest, and name how it changes with each breath instead of treating it like a catastrophe. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but maybe calling it out as a sensation and watching it for a few breaths will make it feel less permanent; I'm anxious about doing it, but I'll try.

Therapist: By naming the tightness as a physical sensation and observing how it changes with each breath, you're creating a tiny space to experiment with defusion. What's one small thing you're willing to let be, exactly as it is, without trying to change it, while you breathe – is that okay?

Patient: Okay — I can try letting the tightness just be a band across my chest and notice it for three slow breaths without trying to fix it. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but I'm willing to do it because I'm tired of feeling like everything has to be solved right away. I'm nervous and might get impatient, but I'll stay with it for those breaths and tell you what I notice.

Therapist: That willingness to let go of trying to fix the tightness for three slow breaths shows you're ready to shift from problem-solving to presence. When you notice the tightness for those three breaths, what's the first thing that comes up for you when you think about creating something that matters to you, like that coaster or woodworking in general?

Patient: The first thing that comes up is a tiny relief — like maybe I could make something that's just mine and not for anyone else's approval. Then the panic sneaks in: what if I can't finish it, or it's meaningless, or my family mocks it. As I breathe I notice the tightness ease a bit and that image of a finished coaster feels like proof I might matter outside work — how is that supposed to fix everything? I don't know, but it makes the stuck feeling seem a little less absolute, at least for a moment.

Therapist: That image of the finished coaster as proof you might matter outside work shows up as a tiny, precious value for you. When the panic tries to pull that thought away, what's one tiny, tiny thing you're willing to do with that image, like just looking at it for another breath or naming one word that feels connected to it?

Patient: I can hold that image for one slow breath and quietly say the word "mine" to myself. How is that supposed to help? I don't know — when I try it the tightness loosens a bit and it feels like I'm not just my job for a second, but I'm worried it'll vanish as soon as I stop.

Therapist: That tiny act of holding the image and saying "mine" creates a small, fleeting sense of connection to yourself outside work. When you notice the tightness returning, what's one physical sensation in your body that's actually present, like the breath moving in and out of your chest, that you're willing to stay with, even when the image of the coaster disappears?

Patient: It's the small rise and fall just under my sternum — like a hollow that moves with each breath, and the tiny coolness in my nostrils. I can stay with that for three slow breaths and notice the pause between inhale and exhale. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but focusing on that feeling even when the coaster image disappears might stop me from getting completely pulled back into panic.

Therapist: That pause between inhale and exhale is a tiny anchor in the midst of uncertainty. What's one tiny, small step you're willing to take in the next breath, when the coaster image is gone, that feels connected to the value of creating something that matters to you, like making a small mark or taking a tiny step towards that wedge or coaster?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but in the next breath I'll pick up a pencil and make one tiny dot on the scrap wood — just one mark — then set it down. I'm already nervous and my chest feels tight just saying it, but I'll notice that for a breath and do the mark.

Therapist: That tiny dot might feel like a tiny act of defiance against the tightness in your chest. When you notice that tightness for one breath, what's one tiny thing you're willing to say to yourself about that dot, like "I made a mark" or "I took one tiny step"?

Patient: "I made a mark" — I can say that once and notice the tightness for one breath. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but saying it feels a bit grounding even though my hands are jittery and my mind keeps darting away; I'm having trouble staying with it.

Therapist: That phrase "I made a mark" creates a tiny pause between the struggle and the next step. What's one tiny sensation in your hands that's actually present, like the feeling of the pencil or the wood, that you're willing to stay with for the next breath?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but okay. I can feel the pencil between my fingers, the slight tremor and the rough grain of the wood under my palm, like a buzzing in my fingertips. How is that supposed to help? My hands are jittery and my mind keeps darting, but I'll try to notice that roughness for one breath.

Therapist: That roughness in your fingertips is a tiny anchor in the midst of your nervousness. When you notice the tremor for one breath, what's one tiny thing you're willing to let be, exactly as it is, without trying to change it – is that okay?

Patient: Okay — I'll let the tremor be, the buzzing in my fingertips, for one breath without trying to stop it. How is that supposed to help? I'm jittery and my mind keeps darting, but I'll try to notice it instead of fixing it.

Therapist: That tremor in your fingertips is actually fueling your willingness to make the next tiny dot. What's one tiny action you're willing to take with that trembling hand, not despite the tremor, but because of it?

Patient: Okay — I'll press the pencil down and make one small dot, letting the tremor be part of the mark. I'm not sure I follow how that helps — my chest's tight and my mind keeps jumping — but I can do that one dot and notice it. How is that supposed to help long-term? I'm anxious and distracted, but I'll say "I made a mark" for one breath after.

Therapist: That single dot, with the trembling hand and the rough wood, is now connected to the phrase "I made a mark". What's one value that comes up for you when you think of making that mark, like "I'm capable of creating something" or "I matter enough to make a mark"?

Patient: I guess the value is "I matter" — like proof I'm capable of making something that's mine, not just numbers. How is that supposed to help? I'm not sure I follow — my chest's tight and my mind's jumping, but when I say that phrase there's a tiny easing, even if it feels weird and fragile.

Therapist: That tiny easing when you say "I matter" is actually a tiny anchor to hold onto. What's one tiny thing you're willing to do with that phrase, like holding onto the phrase for the next breath, or noticing the sensation of the word "I" on your tongue, or looking at the dot you just made – can you stay with it for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. I’ll hold the phrase “I matter” on my tongue for one slow breath, look at the dot, and notice the tightness in my chest and the tremor in my hand. How is that supposed to help? I don’t know — it gives a tiny break from the panic but I’m already feeling overwhelmed and distracted, and it’s hard to believe this will actually stick.

Therapist: That tiny break from panic is actually a small victory. What if, instead of trying to "make it last" or "get through" this moment, you just say to yourself "this is enough" – that the dot, the phrase, the tension – is enough to hold onto for now?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try saying “this is enough” out loud once, even if it feels a bit silly. How is that supposed to help when the tightness usually just comes back? Saying it now makes a tiny pause and my chest eases a little, but I’m jittery and don’t know if it’ll stick; I’ll hold it for one breath and tell you what I notice.

Therapist: That tiny pause, and the easing in your chest, is actually connected to the phrase "I matter". What's one sensation that's actually present in your hand, or in your body, that's not just tension – like the feeling of the dot, or the breath moving in and out of your chest?

Patient: I can feel the tiny raised bump of the dot under my fingertip and a coolness on the pad of my thumb, and there's that faint hollow under my sternum moving with each breath. I'm not sure I follow how noticing those things actually fixes anything — how is that supposed to help? But it does pull me out of the panic for a second, and that small break feels mildly relieving even though I'm still jittery.

Therapist: Those sensations – the bump, the coolness, the hollow – are actually present, and you're noticing them. What if, instead of trying to "make sense of" or "fix" them, you just let them be, without judgment? Can you say to yourself "this is what's happening right now" without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying "this is what's happening right now" out loud once and hold it for a breath. It feels weird and my chest's tight and my mind's already darting, but when I say it there's a tiny loosening—how is that supposed to help? I don't know, but I can stay with it for another breath and tell you what I notice.

Therapist: That tiny loosening is actually connected to the phrase "I matter". What's one thing that's actually happening in your body right now, without judgment – like the sensation of your breath, or the feeling of the dot under your finger? Can you stay with that physical sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow, but okay. Right now I feel the hollow under my sternum moving with the breath, the cool pad of my thumb on the raised dot, and the tremor in my fingertips—I'll stay with that for one slow breath. How is that supposed to help? My mind's already darting, but I'll try and tell you what I notice.

Therapist: You're noticing the hollow under your sternum, the coolness on your thumb, and the tremor in your fingertips. What if you simply observed each of these sensations, without trying to make sense of them or change them? What would it be like if you just looked at each sensation, without judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I fully follow — but when I try it, it's like watching a storm pass: the hollow tightens then eases, the tremor buzzes, and naming them makes them a bit less catastrophic. It creates a tiny gap between the sensation and the panic my brain immediately invents, but I'm distracted, my chest's still tight, and I don't trust it'll stick. How is that supposed to help with the bigger stuckness? I can stay with these sensations for another breath if you want.
