Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — small mistakes turn into proof I'm a failure, which I know goes back to being bullied at school. It's creeping into my social life: I act gregarious at work but then avoid people or overexplain myself because I'm sure they're judging me. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; I've talked about it before, so how is this supposed to change anything?

Therapist: When you feel that knot of fear before social interactions, what's the tiny thing you could do instead of overexplaining yourself? For instance, could you simply introduce yourself with one word ("Hi") without elaborating on your job?

Patient: I guess I could literally just say "Hi" and try to stop there, but the minute someone asks "What do you do?" I panic and start overexplaining. I've tried sticking to short answers and it just makes me feel exposed—how is that supposed to fix the knot? Maybe I could prepare one short redirect like "Nice to meet you" and then ask them a question, but I'm not sure that will actually stick.

Therapist: When you say "Hi," what's the one question you could ask that doesn't require an answer right away, just to show genuine interest in the other person?

Patient: Maybe I'd try, "What's been the best part of your week so far?" — it feels low-pressure and invites something positive. But honestly, I've tried questions like that and I still freeze up inside; how is that supposed to stop the knot in my stomach?

Therapist: What's one thing that matters to you about showing up in social interactions, beyond just avoiding judgment?

Patient: That I actually connect with people — even tiny, real connections — so I don't feel like I'm just performing. It matters because I want proof, for myself, that I'm not the person those bullies made me feel like. But... how is that supposed to stop the knot right before I open my mouth?

Therapist: When you do say "Hi" and someone asks what you do, what's the tiny thing you can do right after that, without thinking about the rest of the conversation, just to connect with them?

Patient: Maybe I say a one-line answer like, "I manage operations," then immediately follow with, "How about you — what do you enjoy about your work?" and try to keep a small, steady smile so it feels like a real exchange. But honestly, when I do that I still get that knot—how is that supposed to fix the panic? Maybe repeating it could dull the reaction, but I'm skeptical it'll actually stick.

Therapist: When you say "I manage operations" and then "How about you...", what's the one physical sensation that happens just before you feel the knot?

Patient: A tightness in my throat — like I need to swallow and my voice gets thin. How is noticing that supposed to help?

Therapist: When you feel that tightness in your throat, what's the one tiny thing you could do with your body that wouldn't involve trying to swallow or speak, just to notice it as a physical sensation?

Patient: I guess I could rest my fingertips lightly on my throat and take a slow breath, just paying attention to the tight spot instead of trying to swallow or talk. It feels almost silly — how's that supposed to make the knot vanish? But fine, I can try noticing it, see if that changes anything.

Therapist: When you rest your fingertips on your throat and breathe slowly, what's the one thing that matters to you about that tightness, right in this moment, without thinking about the rest of the conversation?

Patient: That tightness matters because it’s a signal — proof I’m anxious but not broken; it's something I can notice instead of automatically reacting. It tells me I can tolerate the feeling for a moment, that it doesn’t have to lead to catastrophe. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to stop me from immediately overexplaining when panic hits? I'm willing to try it, but I'm already doubting it'll work.

Therapist: When the tightness shows up again in the conversation, what's the one thing you could say or do right after noticing it, that connects to the value of tolerating the feeling without needing to justify it?

Patient: I guess I could quietly rest my fingers on my throat, take one slow breath, and say, "Give me a second — I'm feeling a bit nervous," then pivot with a question like, "What's been the best part of your week?" I'm not sure I follow how saying that won't just make me feel more exposed, but I can try it.

Therapist: When you say "Give me a second" and then pivot to the question about the best part of the week, what's the one thing you hope will happen next, if the panic tries to hijack the conversation with a justification ("I need to explain why...")?

Patient: I'm hoping they'll just accept it — like give me a beat or answer the question without pressing me for a justification, so the tightness can ease and I don't feel forced to explain myself. I'm not sure I follow how that alone stops me from launching into a defense, but if they respond calmly or with curiosity maybe I won't feel compelled to overexplain. Still skeptical, honestly, but that's what I'd hope would happen.

Therapist: When you say "Give me a second" and pivot to the question about the best part of the week, what's the one tiny voice inside you that's whispering "But what if they don't accept it? What if I have to explain?" – what would you say to that voice if it was standing right in front of you?

Patient: I'd probably say out loud to that voice, "Okay, I hear you — but you don't get to run the show right now. I'm nervous and that's okay; I can take a breath and stay here without explaining myself." 

I'm not sure I follow how talking to that voice actually stops the knot — I've tried self-talk before and it doesn't stick — but maybe telling it to pause and breathe with me for a few seconds could at least steal a bit of its power.

Therapist: When you say "Give me a second" and pivot to the question about the best part of the week, what's the one small thing you hope will happen in those few seconds of breathing with the voice – is it that you'll feel a tiny bit more calm, or that you'll be able to speak without justification for just one sentence?

Patient: Mostly I want to be able to get out one sentence—ask my question or say "Nice to meet you"—without the immediate need to defend it. If I feel a tiny bit calmer from those breaths, that's a bonus. But honestly, I've tried breathing and quick self-talk before and it usually fades fast—how is that one-sentence win supposed to break the whole pattern?

Therapist: What's the one thing you hope to accomplish by getting out that one sentence – is it to connect with the other person, to show up for yourself, or something else?

Patient: Mostly I want to prove to myself I can say one normal thing without spiraling — so it's about showing up for myself and, hopefully, making a small connection. I guess it's both: a tiny bridge to someone else and evidence I don't have to implode every time. I'm not sure I follow how that one sentence really breaks the whole pattern, though — how is that supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: When you say that one sentence without justification, what's the one tiny thing that happens in your body – is it a subtle shift in your posture, a slight drop in your heart rate, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when that one sentence comes out I usually notice a tiny unclenching: my shoulders drop a bit, I let out a short exhale, and my voice steadies enough for one normal line. It feels almost microscopic and then the knot wants to come back—how is that supposed to actually change things long-term?

Therapist: When you notice that tiny unclenching – your shoulders dropping, your exhale, and your voice steadying – what's the one small action you can take right after that moment, to keep the shift going and move closer to your goal of connecting with the other person?

Patient: Right after the unclench, I could keep my shoulders down, soften my gaze, and actually say the question, then pause and let them answer — maybe rest a fingertip on my chest to stay grounded. I'm trying to see the point, but how is that supposed to help beyond a tiny moment? I mean, I'm skeptical it stops the rest of the panic, but I can try holding the pause and seeing if it lengthens the calm.

Therapist: What's the one thing you hope to achieve by pausing in that moment, beyond just holding the calm?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow, but I think the pause is meant to buy me space to choose instead of automatically freaking out — to let the awkward sit so I don't have to fill it with a defense. I want it to be a tiny test that the feeling won't ruin things and that someone else can hold the silence, which could slowly build evidence I can tolerate social risk. Honestly, it still feels too small to change the whole pattern — how is doing tiny tests like that supposed to add up to real confidence?

Therapist: What's the one tiny thing you can do after the pause that feels like a genuine choice – not just avoiding the panic, but actually moving closer to your goal of connecting with the other person?

Patient: I guess I could pick one tiny, real choice after the pause—like follow up with a single curiosity question about what they just said, for example, "What made that the best part?"—so it's an actual move toward them, not just avoiding my panic. I'm not sure I follow how that actually changes the pattern long-term—I've tried follow-ups before and it still feels like I'm faking—but maybe choosing curiosity instead of defense could pull me out of myself for a beat.

Therapist: What's the one thing you hope to achieve by choosing curiosity – beyond just avoiding the panic – that makes it worth taking the small risk of not having a clear answer right away?

Patient: I guess I hope curiosity will actually make me feel seen — like I’m not just defending myself but genuinely engaging, and that I can collect little bits of proof people aren’t judging me. It feels like those tiny wins could slowly contradict the bully-script in my head, but honestly I’m not sure I follow how a few small moments add up to real confidence.

Therapist: If you were to look back on those tiny moments of curiosity over the next few weeks or months, what would you see? Would you notice a pattern emerging – a shift from avoidance to engagement, from doubt to confidence?

Patient: I guess I'd notice a handful of tiny wins — a few times I stayed quiet, asked a real question, got a normal response, and didn't immediately start defending myself; maybe fewer cringe apologies and a couple more real laughs. I'm not sure I follow how those scattered moments actually turn into steady confidence though; it feels vague and slow and I get impatient. I keep thinking, what if it doesn't stick — how is that supposed to add up into something that matters long-term? Can you explain how those tiny wins build into real change?

Therapist: What's the one thing that you value most about feeling confident – is it feeling seen, heard, or valued? Whatever it is, can you imagine holding onto that value while you're working through these tiny wins?

Patient: I think feeling seen — like someone actually notices me as more than my mistakes — matters most. I can try to hold that as a little north star while I do the tiny wins, but I'm not sure I follow how holding a value in my head actually soothes the knot in my throat when panic hits. How is that supposed to change the immediate feeling, not just sound nice in theory?

Therapist: When you hold onto the value of feeling seen, what's the tiny physical sensation that happens in your body – is it a subtle shift in your chest, a slight drop in your heart rate, or a slight softening of your shoulders?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing this supposed to help? When I try, I sometimes feel a tiny softening in my chest, like a little warmth or release, and my shoulders drop maybe a fraction. But honestly, that feeling vanishes fast and I keep wondering how that small shift actually untangles the knot.

Therapist: When you notice the tiny softening in your chest and your shoulders drop, what's the one tiny thing you can do in that moment without trying to "fix" the knot – is it taking a slow breath, noticing the sensation in your feet, or simply sitting with the feeling without judgment?

Patient: I guess I'd take one slow, deliberate breath and feel my feet press into the floor—something simple to ground me instead of trying to fix the knot. I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the panic from spiraling, but I can try noticing my feet and breathing without immediately trying to make the feeling go away.

Therapist: When you take that slow, deliberate breath and feel your feet press into the floor, what's the sensation that shows up in your body or mind – is it a sense of calm, a slight expansion, or something else?

Patient: I notice a tiny easing — like a little opening in my chest and the throat loosening, and my feet feel a bit heavier, like I'm anchored for a second. I'm not sure I follow how that momentary ease is supposed to stop the knot from rushing back — it just feels too fleeting; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: With this tiny foothold, what's one small thing you can do to gently shift your attention away from the knot and toward connection – is it asking a simple question, noticing a detail, or taking another slow breath?

Patient: I guess asking a simple follow-up — like, “What made that the best part?” — feels doable; it gets me looking at them instead of looping in my head. I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the knot, though — how's this supposed to keep me from panicking? Still, I can try that and pair it with one slow breath and feeling my feet on the floor.

Therapist: When you ask "What made that the best part?" and focus on their response, what's the tiny sense of connection or understanding that arises in your body or mind – is it a gentle warmth, a slight softening, or something else?

Patient: I notice a little warmth in my chest and my shoulders unclench a hair, maybe a tiny loosening in my throat and a brief sense of being a person instead of a problem. I'm not sure I follow how that tiny softening actually sticks or stops the knot from coming back — how is that supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: When you notice this tiny softening, what's the one thing you're holding onto about being a person, rather than a problem – is it a sense of hope, a spark of curiosity, or something else?

Patient: I think it's a little thread of hope — that I'm more than my mistakes — and a spark of curiosity that other people might actually see the real me. It feels like a tiny proof that I can be a person, not just a problem. But honestly, I'm not sure I follow how holding that thought actually makes the knot go away — how is that supposed to help?
