Patient: I'm a senior construction worker and lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and this constant lack of motivation. I guess it comes from feeling cut off—lonely—and it's starting to mess with my relationship at home. I don't really like talking about this stuff, so it's awkward for me, but I wanted to try.

Therapist: When you say you feel cut off, what's one specific situation or event that makes you feel that way on the job site?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's when we take a break and everyone's in these little circles laughing and I'm just eating by myself. Or when they make plans for beers after work and I don't get a text — it just makes me feel invisible.

Therapist: Those moments of feeling invisible on the job site and at home must feel really painful. What's one thing you value deeply about being part of a team or being with people that's missing when you feel that way?

Patient: I guess what I miss is feeling needed—like I belong somewhere and my work or my company matters. When that's gone I feel useless and invisible, and I don't know, it just drains me and makes me short with my wife. I don't really like saying that.

Therapist: When you feel like you're not needed, what would it take for you to say to yourself, "I'm doing my best right now, even if it doesn't feel like it," without getting short with your wife?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it'd help if there was something tangible—like someone actually saying "good job" or a little routine where I can tick stuff off and see I'm contributing. But most of the time I'm wiped and snappy, and I don't know how to not take it out on my wife.

Therapist: Let's try this: when you're on the job site, before you head out, can you make a small commitment to yourself to do one thing that feels like it matters, like checking the lock on the site trailer or giving a nod to a team member? That tiny action can help you feel like you're contributing, even when it's hard to muster the energy to talk about it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the nod or checking the trailer—small stuff I might actually remember to do. It feels a bit like a band-aid though, and I'm worried it'll still leave me snapping at my wife. I don't like talking about that part—can we maybe figure out one tiny thing I could do at home too?

Therapist: Let's focus on something you can do right now, in this moment, to create space for feeling useful at home. Can you name one tiny thing you could do for your wife that doesn't require a big effort, like making her a cup of coffee or putting the dishes in the dishwasher?

Patient: I guess I could make her coffee in the morning or load the dishes before bed—something small I can actually remember to do. I don't know if it'll stop me from snapping, but maybe a little note that says "thanks" or "love you" might help. I don't really like getting into why I get short with her, though.

Therapist: Let's make a commitment to do one of those small actions today, without worrying about whether it'll stop you from snapping. Just say to yourself, "I'll load the dishes before bed tonight, and if I'm short with my wife, I'll just say 'love you' and move forward."

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to load the dishes tonight. I can set a phone reminder or slap a sticky note on the sink so I don't forget after a long shift—I'm usually wiped when I get home. But I'm worried it's just a band-aid and I'll still snap; can we stick to practical stuff—ways to remember or tiny phrases I can say instead of digging into why?

Therapist: Let's stick to what works for you. You've already mentioned setting a phone reminder or sticky note on the sink. For phrases, what's one small thing you could say to your wife when you're short with her, like a gentle acknowledgement of her presence?

Patient: I guess I could say something like, "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you." It's short, doesn't ask for a big talk, and at least lets her know I'm not mad at her. I don't really like saying stuff like that, but I can try.

Therapist: Let's make a commitment to use that phrase, "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you," when you're short with your wife tonight. Can you imagine saying it as you're loading the dishes, or maybe even before you start washing them?

Patient: I guess I can picture it—saying it while I'm loading the dishes sounds easier than stopping mid-argue. I don't know if it'll feel real or just automatic, but I'll slap a sticky note on the sink that says the phrase so I see it before I start. I'm not great with the why of all this, so can we keep to practical stuff—where's a good place to put the reminder so I actually notice it when I'm wiped?

Therapist: Let's put the sticky note on the sink, right next to the dish soap. That way, when you're loading the dishes and your mind is on autopilot, you'll see the phrase "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you" before you start washing.

Patient: Okay—I'll put the sticky note right by the dish soap like you said. I guess I'll set a phone alarm for when I get home too so I actually see it. I don't know if it'll stop me from snapping, and talking about the why makes me weirdly tense, so can we keep doing practical, simple steps for now?

Therapist: Sounds good. You've got the sticky note on the sink and a phone alarm set for when you get home. Just show up to loading the dishes tonight, say the phrase "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you," and see what happens.

Patient: Okay... I put the sticky note and set the alarm, but I'm feeling kind of on edge right now — my mind's jumpy and I can't focus. I don't know if I'll remember the phrase when I'm that keyed up. I guess maybe add another tiny cue I can actually do when I'm jittery, like taking off my boots and doing three deep breaths by the door before I head to the sink?

Therapist: That's a great idea to take off your boots and do three deep breaths by the door. When you feel jumpy, take a moment to remove your boots and sit down for three slow, deep breaths by the door before heading to the sink. This small pause can help calm your nervous system and make it easier to focus on the phrase.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try the boot thing — take them off and do three slow breaths by the door. I don't know if I'll remember when I'm all jittery and wiped, so I'll leave the boots there and set another quick alarm so I don't miss it. Can we stick to these small steps for now? I'm not great at talking about the why.

Therapist: Sounds good. You've got the boot thing down, and you're setting another alarm to remind you to take off your boots and do three deep breaths by the door. Just show up to the kitchen tonight, take a deep breath, and remember to say the phrase "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you."

Patient: Okay... I guess I’ll try the boots, three breaths, then load the dishes and say the phrase. I’m feeling kind of wiped and scattered right now, so I might forget — can we pick one extra really simple cue I can use if that happens? I don’t know what else to do when my head’s like this.

Therapist: Let's add a tiny anchor: if you forget the phrase or feel completely lost, just say "I love you" to your wife, even if it's just as you're leaving the kitchen. It's a tiny gesture that can help you connect with her presence and create a small moment of calm.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can just say "I love you" if I blank. My head's all jumpy and drained right now, so I might need one more stupidly simple cue—maybe a little note on the front door or a sticker on the sink so I see it when I come in. I'll keep the boots by the door like we said. I don't really want to get into the why tonight, so can we stick to these tiny steps for now?

Therapist: Sounds good. You're already doing the boots and three deep breaths, and now you're adding a sticky note on the sink with the phrase "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you." That way, when you come in from a long shift and your head is still jumpy, you'll see the note and remember to say the phrase.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll stick the note on the sink and leave the boots by the door. I don't know—my head's jumpy and kind of drained, so if I blank, can we pick one extra stupidly simple backup, like a sticker on the front door I actually can't miss?

Therapist: Let's add a sticker on the front door that says "BREATHE". That way, when you come in from a long shift and your head is still spinning, you'll see the sticker and remember to take a deep breath before loading the dishes and saying the phrase.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll stick the "BREATHE" sticker on the door, near the handle so I can't miss it. My head's still jumpy and wiped, so can we add one more tiny backup—like a short vibration alarm when I get home? I don't really want to get into the why right now, so let's just keep to these practical steps.

Therapist: Sounds good. You're already doing the boots and three deep breaths, and now you're adding a short vibration alarm on your phone that will vibrate for 2 seconds when you get home. When you feel that vibration, you'll remember to take a deep breath and say the phrase "Sorry — that came out wrong. I love you".

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll set the vibration alarm to two short buzzes and put the phone on my pocket so I actually feel it when I get in. My chest feels all tight and my thoughts are scattered, so I might fumble with it when I get home. I don't really want to dig into the reasons tonight—can we just stick to these little practical backups?

Therapist: Let's make it even simpler. When you get home, just pull out your phone and check it one-handed. As soon as you feel the phone in your hand, say "BREATHE" out loud to remind yourself to take a deep breath before checking the vibration. This way, the physical action of checking the phone becomes a trigger for your backup plan.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try the phone-check thing — pull it out one-handed and say "BREATHE" out loud. I don't know if I'll actually do it when I'm all jittery or if it'll feel stupid saying it in front of my wife; maybe I'll whisper it or say it under my breath. Can we add one more tiny backup — like a little sticker on the phone case I can feel so if I forget the word I still get a cue? I don't really want to get into why this is so hard tonight.

Therapist: Sounds good. You're already doing the phone-check-and-say-BREATHE routine. Now, let's add a small sticker to the phone case with a discreet "BREATHE" symbol. When you feel the phone in your hand, you can run your thumb over the sticker to remind yourself to take a deep breath. This way, even if you forget to say the word out loud, the physical sensation of the sticker will help you connect with the breath.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll stick the sticker on the case and try to run my thumb over it when I grab the phone. My head's foggy so I might still blank—can we add one more dumb backup, like a tiny sticky on the doorframe I can't miss? I don't want to get into the why tonight.

Therapist: Let's add a tiny sticky note to the doorframe that says "BREATHE". This way, when you walk through the door, you'll see the note and feel a physical reminder to take a deep breath before you even think about the phrase.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll stick the "BREATHE" note on the doorframe by the handle so I can't miss it. My head's all jumpy and drained right now, so I don't know if I'll notice it—and I don't really want to get into the why tonight.

Therapist: Sounds good. Just go home, walk through the door, and see the note on the frame. When you feel your heart rate slow down and your body relax just a bit, remember to take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

Patient: Okay... I'll try the door note and the breathe when I come in. I don't know if it'll actually calm me—my chest's tight and my head's foggy—so I might need one more stupidly simple backup I can do when I'm wiped. Can we stick to practical stuff and pick that extra cue?

Therapist: Let's add a simple "3-4-5" grounding exercise: when you feel like you're about to get overwhelmed, take 3 deep breaths in through your nose, hold for 4 seconds, and then blow out through your mouth. This tiny exercise can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to focus on your breath.

Patient: I guess I can try the 3-4-5 breathing — seems simple enough. My chest's still tight and my head's foggy, so I'll probably need another cue like writing "3-4-5" on the doorframe or a quiet vibration to remind me. I don't want to get into the why tonight — can we just stick to those tiny steps?

Therapist: Let's add a small marker to the doorframe that says "3-4-5". When you see the marker, you'll know it's time to take a few deep breaths and calm down.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll put the "3-4-5" marker on the doorframe like you said. My head's still foggy and drained, so can we also put a tiny "3-4-5" sticker on my phone case I can feel if I blank? I don't want to get into the why tonight.

Therapist: Sounds good. Just put the small "3-4-5" sticker on the phone case. When you feel the phone in your hand and see the sticker, it'll be a gentle reminder to take 3 deep breaths and calm down, even if your mind is blank.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll stick the "3-4-5" on the phone case. My head's still foggy and my chest's tight, so I might blank — I don't know, can we add one more stupidly simple backup, like a gentle recurring vibration when I get home? I don't want to get into the why tonight.

Therapist: Let's set your phone to vibrate every 5 minutes when you're at home. When the phone vibrates, it'll be a gentle reminder to take a few deep breaths and calm down, even if your mind is still foggy.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll set it to vibrate, but I don't know if constant buzzing won't just make me more jumpy. Can we make it just for the first 30 minutes after I get home instead of all evening? My head's foggy and drained, and I don't want to get into the why tonight—can we just try that and see how it goes?

Therapist: Sounds good. You can set your phone to vibrate every 5 minutes for the first 30 minutes after you get home. When the phone buzzes, it'll be a gentle reminder to take 3 deep breaths and calm down. Let's try it for just that first 30 minutes and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll set it to buzz every 5 minutes for the first 30 minutes and see how it goes. I'm worried it might make me jumpier—my chest's tight and my head's foggy—so if it makes things worse, can we try just two reminders instead? I don't want to dig into the why tonight, so can we keep to these small steps for now?
