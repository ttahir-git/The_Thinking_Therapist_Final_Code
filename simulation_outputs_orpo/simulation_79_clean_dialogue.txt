Patient: I've been obsessively analyzing my performance lately — I'm a senior in a new, demanding program and I keep forecasting worst-case scenarios about every assignment and presentation. That chronic worry tends to produce a kind of paralysis: instead of engaging, I procrastinate, and I catch myself rationalizing and theorizing about my feelings rather than actually feeling them.

Therapist: When you say "worst-case scenarios" come up, what's one thing you'd actually be doing instead of those scenarios that would be connected to your value of engagement in this program?

Patient: I guess, instead of spiraling into catastrophic forecasts, I'd be doing small, concrete things that signal engagement—breaking an assignment into micro-tasks, drafting a paragraph, or rehearsing a five‑minute chunk of a presentation. In my head I label this "incrementalization" or metacognitive scaffolding: initiate low‑stakes practice, get quick feedback from a peer or instructor, then iterate. The trouble is I tend to intellectualize that plan and get distracted by peripheral tasks—so I describe the process instead of actually starting it.

Therapist: When you label that process as "incrementalization," what value does that name actually mean to you in terms of showing up in your program?

Patient: For me "incrementalization" is shorthand for values like consistency over perfection, presence over performance, and the willingness to produce imperfect work so I can iterate and learn. It represents small, observable actions that register me as engaged—maintaining my identity as a learner and lowering the pressure to be flawless. Ironically, I tend to intellectualize the whole thing as a framework so I can talk about scaffolding instead of actually drafting that imperfect paragraph.

Therapist: When you're ready to actually draft that paragraph, what's the smallest, most awkward thing you could do that would feel like you're taking action towards those values, even if it means "failing" in some small way?

Patient: Probably the tiniest, most awkward thing would be setting a five‑minute timer and forcing myself to write one deliberately ugly sentence that names the task—like, "This paragraph will explain X, and I don't know where to start." It's humiliating in a small, precise way, but it concretizes engagement and honors the value of imperfection; I can call it an experimentary heuristic if that helps me tolerate the discomfort. I can already feel the urge to theorize about why this works instead of doing it, which is kind of a red flag.

Therapist: That sentence sounds like a tiny, imperfect act of commitment to those values – what would happen to the urge to theorize about it if you simply said, "I'm going to write that sentence now, even if it's ugly"?

Patient: If I actually said it out loud, the urge to theorize would probably attenuate — saying it converts abstract intentions into a behavioral contract, so there's less mental space for endless analysis. I'd still get a jittery, anticipatory anxiety — my heart speeds up and this internal monologue kicks in trying to reframe the move as "premature" planning. If I manage the one ugly sentence, there's usually a small rush of relief and absurd pride, though I'm already scheming ways to avoid doing it again, which is... typical.

Therapist: When you say that sentence out loud, what's the very next physical sensation you notice in your body – not the thoughts or the outcome, just the sensation of the sentence being spoken?

Patient: Clinically speaking, there's an autonomic spike — a quick shallow inhale and a small tightness across my upper chest and throat, like my breath gets pinched for a second. I also notice a little warmth in my face and a faint tremor in my hands. I could get into a whole physiological explanation about sympathetic arousal, but that's the raw sensation.

Therapist: In that moment when you feel your breath get pinched and your chest tighten, what's the tiny, small thing you could do with that physical sensation – without trying to change it or move away from it – that would be a tiny act of commitment to those values (imperfection, presence)?

Patient: I could try a tiny noting practice: for three natural breaths I’d silently name the sensation—“tightness,” “pinch”—and just observe it without trying to change it. That small act of labeling would be an embodied gesture toward presence over performance, a deliberately imperfect way to show up. I can already feel the impulse to psychoanalyze why that would work instead of actually doing it, which is exactly the pattern I’m trying to interrupt.

Therapist: You've committed to naming that tightness for three breaths – what's one tiny step you can take after those three breaths, before you know what the outcome is, that still aligns with those values?

Patient: I’d set a five‑minute timer and, without overthinking, type one ugly sentence — literally “This paragraph will explain X and I don’t know where to start.” That tiny behavioral nudge translates the noting into action and honors imperfection, even though I can already hear my brain prepping justifications for not doing it. If I feel the avoidance kicking in, I’ll name that too—“avoidance”—and hit start anyway.

Therapist: You're about to type that sentence – what's the first physical sensation you notice in your hands as you place your fingers on the keyboard?

Patient: I notice a light tingling across my fingertips and a faint tremor — my knuckles feel a little rigid, like they're primed to move but holding back. I could get verbose about anticipatory motor activation and sympathetic arousal, but concretely it's a cool, prickly sensation on the pads of my fingers and a tiny pressure at the base of my palms. I don't know—what would you suggest I try with that feeling next?

Therapist: Instead of trying to "work" the tremor or the tingling, what's one tiny thing you could do with your fingers as you type that sentence that aligns with those values – like making a small movement or gesture?

Patient: I could make a tiny micro‑ritual: rest my fingers, then press one key—the first letter—deliberately, almost ceremonially, and let each subsequent keystroke be slow and intentional. That tactile cadence would act as embodied incrementalization—showing up through movement and noticing the tremor rather than trying to eliminate it, though of course I'm already narrativizing why this would help.

Therapist: You're about to type the sentence – as you rest your fingers and press that first key, what's the sensation of the physical act of typing, without trying to analyze or justify it, just notice it?

Patient: There's a gentle, percussive click under my fingertip, a tiny give as the key depresses, and a brief settling — a little warmth that moves from the pad of my finger into my palm. For a moment the jittery anticipation softens into that simple, repeatable motion. I'm already itching to explain why that's meaningful instead of just sitting with it, which is pretty on-brand for me.

Therapist: You're typing that first key – what's the next physical sensation you notice as you make the next keystroke, without trying to analyze or justify it?

Patient: There's a slightly firmer resistance and a quick little vibration under my fingertip as the key goes down, and the click almost feels clipped — like it barely registered because my head's skittering. My hands keep the motion but my attention flits away, and I catch myself already formulating explanations for the distraction instead of just noticing the sensation.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation under your fingertip as you make the next keystroke – what's happening in your finger, without trying to label it or justify it, just observe the sensation of the vibration?

Patient: It's a thin, buzzy vibration right under the pad that jumps up into the first joint and then dissipates—sharp and quick, like a tiny electric ripple. My attention immediately skitters away and I start narrating reasons for the distraction, which just increases this anxious flutter.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of that electric ripple as it jumps up into your finger – what happens to the vibration when you simply stop trying to think about it, and just be with the sensation of the ripple?

Patient: When I stop the running commentary and just be with the ripple, it actually softens — the buzz becomes more like a muted hum localized in the pad of my finger instead of this sharp alarm. That said, my attention is fragile: the mind still flits to other anticipatory worries, so the presence only lasts a breath or two before something else hijacks me. What would you suggest I do to extend that quieted attention a little longer?

Therapist: As you notice the hum in your finger, what's one tiny physical action you can take to reinforce that quieted attention – like gently spreading your finger, or lightly touching the pad to the desk?

Patient: I can lightly rest the fingertip flat on the desk and slowly splay it a bit so the hum broadens into a duller pressure, holding that contact for three slow breaths and just noticing the sensation. It feels grounding in theory, but my chest's a little tight and my mind's already sprinting—I'm tempted to narrate why this works instead of simply doing it.

Therapist: You're holding the finger on the desk – what's the sensation in the pad of your finger as you exhale on the third breath, without trying to analyze it or justify it?

Patient: The pad of my finger feels like a soft, spreading pressure—warm and a little heavy, like the vibration has mellowed into a dull weight that eases a notch as I exhale. But even as I notice that, my chest tightens and my mind's already skittering into explanations about why this matters instead of just staying with the feeling.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the pressure in your finger as you exhale – what happens if you simply allow that pressure to be present, without trying to change it or justify it, for just one more breath?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. Letting the pressure sit for another breath makes the pad of my finger mellow into a warm, dull weight and the buzz quiets, but my chest still clenches and my attention fragments—so I keep wondering how merely "allowing" this leads to actually typing. Conceptually I can espouse the acceptance rationale, but practically I'm skeptical it won't just become another pause for rumination.

Therapist: What's one tiny physical action you could take while still noticing the pressure in your finger – like gently lifting the finger off the desk, or making a small adjustment to your grip – that would actually help you get back to typing?

Patient: Okay — I could slowly lift the fingertip, pull it back a centimeter, hover for one second over the first key, then press deliberately and keep typing for 30 seconds without stopping or editing. That tiny motor commitment turns passive noticing into actual initiation and might break the ruminative inertia — though I'm already critiquing the idea in my head and my chest's a bit tight about doing it.

Therapist: As you hover your finger over the first key, notice the sensation of the air moving between your finger and the key – what happens to the sensation of that space when you decide to press the key, rather than waiting to think about it?

Patient: When I press, that tiny air gap kind of collapses — the whoosh disappears and there's a small physical click and a little uncoiling in my chest, like a brief release. It actually truncates the anticipatory loop for a beat and my fingers get a bit more grounded, but my mind immediately starts narrating the next catastrophe so the calm evaporates fast and I get jittery again.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of your chest uncoiling – what happens when you make a tiny decision to let that calmness stay, just for a breath, rather than trying to "fix" it with thoughts about the next catastrophe?

Patient: If I actually let that calmness sit for a breath, the tightness softens into a small, warm expansion — a literal micro‑respite where the catastrophic loop loses amplitude for a few seconds. In that thin window I usually get enough momentum to press another key, but my attention's still skittish and I immediately start narrativizing the process instead of simply inhabiting the calm.

Therapist: As you notice the expansion in your chest, what's one tiny physical action you could take to make room for that calmness to stay – like taking a deep breath, or making a small, subtle adjustment to your posture – that would actually help you type without getting caught up in thoughts about it?

Patient: I could do a tiny somatic anchor: drop my shoulders, soften my jaw, take a slow three‑second exhale into the chest, keep my fingers on the keys and commit to typing—no editing—for thirty seconds. I know that sounds like jargon (somatic anchoring, etc.), and I'm a bit skeptical it'll hold—my mind will probably start narrativizing the next catastrophe—but at least it's a small, embodied nudge toward staying with the calm.

Therapist: As you drop your shoulders and take that slow exhale, notice what happens to the sensation in your chest as you type the first key – what's the physical sensation of the keys pressing down, or the movement of your fingers on the keyboard?

Patient: When I drop my shoulders and exhale, my chest loosens a notch—there’s a brief hollow expansion then a quick flutter as I press the key. The key itself gives a crisp, slightly resistant click under my fingertip, a tactile percussion that momentarily grounds the tremor in my knuckles. It produces a tiny sense of continuity—a micro‑success—but my attention is skittish and that calm attenuates fast as I start narrativizing the next catastrophe. I’m trying to actually inhabit the sensation instead of turning it into theory, but honestly I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and distracted—could you help me keep that fragile focus for another thirty seconds?

Therapist: When you notice your attention starting to wander or get caught up in thoughts about the next catastrophe, what's one tiny thought that you can say to yourself without judgment – just one word, one phrase – that acknowledges the overwhelm, without trying to "fix" it or push it away?

Patient: "I'm here." 

I know that sounds almost trite, but it names the overwhelm without trying to extinguish it — and of course I'm already narrativizing why that phrase might work instead of just saying it.

Therapist: Notice what happens to the sensation in your chest as you say "I'm here" – what's the physical sensation of those words, just for a moment, as you pause before typing the next key?

Patient: There's a small, warm openness under my sternum—a softening, like the ribs unclench a fraction and my breath lengthens a hair, heartbeat easing for a beat. But I don't know, it's fragile: my mind immediately starts interrogating the genuineness of that calm, spinning meta‑narratives and rehearsed catastrophes, so the respite evaporates fast and I get anxious about losing it.

Therapist: As you notice the warm openness, what's one tiny physical action you could take to make room for it to stay – like taking a tiny breath in, or making a small, subtle adjustment to your posture – that would actually help you stay with the calm for just one more beat?

Patient: I could take a very small, slow inhalation that nudges my chest open a hair, let a three‑second exhale soften the sternum, and subtly lower my chin—like creating a tiny somatic anchor—and hold that posture for one beat before the next keystroke. I know I'm already translating this into theory to keep distance, and honestly I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and distracted right now—can you help me stay with that one breath long enough to try it?

Therapist: As you take that slow inhalation and lower your chin, notice what happens to the sensation in your chest as you exhale – what's the physical sensation of that breath, just for one beat, before you type the next key?

Patient: The exhale makes my chest sink into a narrow, warm hollow — a tremulous, slightly rattling release that gives a momentary sense of space before my attention shards off. I'm actually feeling pretty overwhelmed and jittery right now; I want to hold that beat but my mind's already racing—could you help me stay with it for the next keypress?
