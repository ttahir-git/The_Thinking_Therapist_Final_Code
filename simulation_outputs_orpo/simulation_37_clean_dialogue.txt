Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed and sad since I started this demanding new program at work — I just don't have the motivation I used to, and it's starting to mess with my relationship. I'm a nurse, so I try to be practical and analytical, but my self-esteem's taken a hit and nothing I've tried so far has helped. How is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: That sense of overwhelm and sadness makes total sense, especially with the added pressure of this demanding new program. When you say you try to be practical and analytical as a nurse, what's one thing you wish you could do differently to make room for that motivation you used to have – without having to be "on" all the time?

Patient: I wish I could set firmer boundaries — like actually saying no to extra shifts and not forcing myself to study when I'm exhausted — so I have any energy left for things that matter. I've tried doing that before, but the guilt and feeling like I'm letting everyone down just drags me back. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That feeling of guilt and worry about letting others down is understandable. When you say you want to set firmer boundaries, what would it look like for you to practice "I'm doing the best I can with what I have right now" – not just for yourself, but also for your patients and loved ones who are counting on you?

Patient: I know, in theory that's what I'd like to tell myself and my family, but it just feels hollow when I say it. I've tried telling myself "I'm doing the best I can" and it doesn't stick — the guilt comes back and I still feel like I'm letting everyone down. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Let's try something small: When you're tempted to say no to an extra shift because you're exhausted, what's one tiny thing you could do just before saying no – just one tiny action that says "I'm taking care of myself"?

Patient: Maybe I'd take three slow breaths and say, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you," so I don't blurt out yes out of obligation. It feels too small though — I've tried pausing before and the guilt still crashes in, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those three slow breaths and a pause before responding are a great start – now, what does that small action of taking care of yourself actually mean for you, in terms of your value of being a nurse who shows up for her patients and her own well-being?

Patient: I guess it would mean prioritizing being truly present and competent when I'm with patients instead of being spread so thin I can't do either well. But it still feels like I'm choosing myself over others, and that guilt makes it hard to actually keep doing it — I've tried small things before and they don't stick. So... how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Let's flip the question: What would it look like for you to be present and competent for your patients, exactly, when you're not spreading yourself too thin? What would that mean for the care you give them, and how would that difference matter to them?

Patient: I guess it would mean actually having the energy to be fully there — listening without my mind wandering, noticing small changes in a patient's condition, double-checking meds, and explaining things calmly so families feel reassured. That would probably mean fewer mistakes, patients feeling safer, and families less anxious. But I can list all that and still feel stuck — picturing it doesn't change the guilt or the exhaustion, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: You've listed all the reasons why this matters – now, what's one tiny thing that would make you feel like you're not just saying it, but actually doing it – taking that first small step towards prioritizing yourself?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing would be putting a non-negotiable 30-minute "recharge" block on my calendar every day and telling one trusted coworker it's protected — then when the urge to say yes comes, I do the three breaths and actually step outside for that time. I know it sounds small and I've tried scripts before, but making it visible and having someone else know might force me to stick to it. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That sounds like a powerful commitment – now, what would you say to yourself if you saw that calendar block and you felt the urge to blow it off, instead of getting caught up in the "but I promised"?

Patient: I'd probably tell myself, "This 30 minutes isn't selfish — it's so you can do your job safely and be fully present," and remind myself that skipping it usually makes me worse for everyone. I'd also plan a tiny consequence, like not agreeing to an extra task if I skip the break, to make the commitment stick. But honestly, when the guilt hits I still hear, "You're letting people down," so I'm not convinced that pep-talk will work — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: When you feel that guilt creeping in, what's the first physical sensation you notice in your body that says, "Wait, I'm holding onto this thought instead of taking care of myself"?

Patient: Usually it's a tightness in my chest and this hollow ache in my stomach, like my breath gets shallow and my shoulders hunch up. My jaw clenches and my brain fogs so I can't think clearly — it's almost automatic. I get that noticing it could be a cue to pause, but... how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That tightness and hollow ache sound like a clear "stop" signal – what would you do with your body just for one second, before your brain starts reacting, if you noticed that tightness in your chest?

Patient: I'd let my shoulders fall, put a hand over my chest, and take one slow deep breath down into my belly — count to four in, hold one, and let it out slowly. I know that sounds basic and I've tried breathing before and it doesn't stop the guilt — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That pause is already happening – what would you do with the pause, if you just noticed it, without trying to change it or use it to solve the guilt?

Patient: I'd try to notice it and name it — like, "that's guilt" — and just let it be for a moment instead of jumping to fix it. Then I'd remind myself about the 30-minute break and actually step outside, even if my mind protests. But I'm skeptical — naming it and stepping away sounds too simple, so how is that supposed to help when the guilt still crashes in?

Therapist: Naming it isn't about fixing it – it's just about being with it. What would you do with that willingness to pause, if it wasn't about changing the guilt or the thought, but simply about being present with the pause itself?

Patient: I guess I'd try to just sit with it — notice the tightness, name it "guilt," take that belly breath, and not try to fix anything. Then I'd use that pause to actually step outside for the 30-minute break instead of apologizing or making excuses. But honestly, my brain immediately starts defending and planning, so how is that supposed to help when it never really makes the guilt go away?

Therapist: That's enough resistance right there – what would you commit to, instead of fighting the brain's plans?

Patient: Okay—I'll try this: for one week I'll put that non-negotiable 30-minute recharge on my calendar every day, tell one trusted coworker it's protected, and when the guilt hits I'll do the belly breath, name it "guilt," and actually step outside. If I blow it off, I won't agree to any extra tasks that day. But I'm skeptical—how is that supposed to help when the guilt still claws back?

Therapist: What would you do with the guilt if it showed up tomorrow, not as a reason to procrastinate, but as a chance to practice what you're already committed to doing – stepping outside for that 30-minute break?

Patient: Alright — tomorrow I'll actually keep that 30-minute block on my calendar, tell one coworker it's protected, and if the guilt shows up I'll put a hand on my chest, do a slow belly breath, name it "guilt," and walk outside for the break. If I cave and skip it, I won't agree to extra tasks that day. I'll try that, but I'm still skeptical it will quiet the guilt — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would you do if you caught yourself thinking "I'm a failure" or "I'm not doing enough" while you're walking outside – not trying to push the thought away, but simply noticing it, like you're watching a cloud passing by?

Patient: I'd try to notice it and say to myself, "There's that thought—it's just a thought," without getting pulled into the argument. Then I'd name one small concrete thing I did that day—like I showed up for a shift or finished a task—and keep walking so my actions back up what I'm telling myself. But honestly, I've done the noticing and the reminding before and the guilt still sticks, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice how that small concrete thing you did (showing up for a shift) actually supports what you value about being a nurse – what would you say to yourself if you connected that action to that value?

Patient: I'd probably tell myself, "You showed up today; that proves you're reliable and capable — that's what being a good nurse looks like," and try to let that sit for a moment. But even saying that feels thin; there's this voice that sneers it's not enough and I'm just pretending. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice the voice saying "it's not enough" – what would you say to that voice if you didn't try to silence it, but instead used the value to say "that's exactly what being a good nurse means"?

Patient: I'd probably say, "Showing up and doing the small, concrete things is exactly how you live your values as a nurse" — that being reliable and attentive, even in small ways, is what matters. But honestly, that still feels like a script I tell myself and the sneering voice keeps chewing on it, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice the small physical sensation in your body right now as you say that phrase to yourself – what happens when you actually live that value in the present moment, without trying to prove it to the sneering voice?

Patient: When I say that phrase there's a tiny loosening in my chest and my shoulders drop a bit, but my heart's still racing and my mind starts darting to the next thing I have to do. Actually living the value gives a brief, flimsy steadiness — a flicker of calm — but the sneering voice immediately undercuts it and I get yanked back into self-criticism and plans. How is that supposed to help when the anxious buzz and that voice just keep dragging me away?

Therapist: Notice the exact moment when the sneering voice starts to undercut the calm – what would you do with that exact thought, right now, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I'd try to notice and name it — "there's the sneering voice" — and let the thought be without arguing back. But right now my chest's tight, my heart's racing and my mind's darting to a hundred things, and I've tried that noticing before and it doesn't quiet the voice, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you simply say "there's the tightness in my chest" – what happens to the tightness, the racing heart, the darting mind, without trying to push them away or change them?

Patient: It softens for a split second — my shoulders drop and there's a tiny loosening — but my heart's still racing and my mind immediately scrambles to the next thing. Naming it gives a brief breather, then the thoughts start listing everything I haven't done and the sneering voice gets louder. I've tried this noticing before and it never really calms the churn, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you let the brief calm be, without trying to push the thoughts away or change the physical sensation – what if you simply allowed it to be, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: If I just allow it, there's this tiny hollow where the tightness loosens for a second and my shoulders drop — it's like a brief sigh. But almost immediately my heart picks up and my mind starts rattling off everything I haven't done and that sneering voice gets louder, and I end up frustrated that "allowing" never actually sticks. I can try to stay with it, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when the anxiety just rushes back?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "allow" the calm, you simply acknowledged that moment of bareness – the tiny hollow where the tension loosened – without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: If I just notice that hollow, there's a tiny flicker — my shoulders loosen and I get one clearer breath, and for a second I can actually feel a little space. But then my heart's still racing, my mind's already darting to the next thing and the sneering voice starts listing failures, and honestly it feels too brief to matter — how is that supposed to help when I can't hold on to the calm?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "hold on" to the calm, you simply noticed that it's already gone – the moment has passed, and the space is gone?

Patient: Noticing it's gone just makes me feel more exposed — the tightness snaps back, my heart races, and I start berating myself for "losing" whatever little calm I had. Honestly, it feels pointless and kind of infuriating; I'm not convinced that noticing the loss actually helps when the shame and the plans rush in. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "push away" the shame, you simply noticed it as it arises – like a whisper in the corner of your mind?

Patient: Yeah — I notice it, like a little whisper that makes my face hot and my chest tighten, and then my heart starts racing and my brain immediately scrambles to fix it. I can say, "that's shame," but that just seems to make the whisper louder, like I'm acknowledging it gives it permission to grow. I've tried naming it before and it never takes the sting away — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "fix" the shame, you simply allowed it to be – like a gentle ripple on the surface of a pond, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can try to picture it as a ripple, but right now my chest's tight, my heart's racing, and my mind's already darting to twenty things — when I "allow" it it just feels like letting the whisper get louder. If I did this, I'd probably give it thirty seconds while counting one slow belly breath, then force myself to step outside for that protected break I promised, but honestly I've done this before and it usually just turns into more rumination. How is that supposed to help me when the shame just keeps swelling and the plans kick back in? What would you actually have me do in that exact moment?

Therapist: In that exact moment, what would you do if you simply said to yourself, "I'm here" – not trying to change anything, not trying to step away, just noticing the fact that you are here, with the tight chest, the racing heart, and the mind that's already racing to plans?

Patient: I'd probably mutter "I'm here" to myself, try one slow belly breath and feel my feet on the floor, but my heart's racing and my mind's already leaping to the next thing. It just feels like another technique to remember—how is that supposed to help when the anxiety immediately eats the moment and I can't hold on to any calm?
