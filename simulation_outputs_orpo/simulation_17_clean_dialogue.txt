Patient: Hi — I'm a bit of an optimist by nature, but lately I've been stuck worrying about my performance as a business owner. My mind's a fortune-telling machine that always predicts the worst: one missed deadline and suddenly clients bail, suppliers quit, cash runs out, and the whole business collapses, so I just freeze. Because of that I'm procrastinating all over the place — I get distracted and put things off because it feels pointless to start.

Therapist: That fortune-telling machine sounds really draining. When you imagine a missed deadline causing everything to fall apart, what's one specific thing you're putting off because it feels pointless to start – something small, like checking an email or making a phone call?

Patient: I'm avoiding replying to a client's email about renewing a contract — something as small as confirming a meeting time. My mind goes straight to: I mess up the wording, they think I'm unreliable, they cancel, word spreads, cash dries up, suppliers bail, and I'm out of a business, so I just don't do it.

Therapist: When you imagine the worst-case scenario playing out after not responding to that email, what would it look like in terms of what's already happening in your business right now – for example, are you already behind schedule on other tasks or dealing with cash flow issues?

Patient: Yeah — I'm definitely behind on bookkeeping and a couple of proposals; nothing's exploded yet, but there's a growing pile of unfinished stuff because I keep dodging emails. My cash flow isn't catastrophic right now, but my mind fast-forwards: one renewal missed, invoices slow, a supplier gets jittery, payroll's at risk, and suddenly I'm drowning. It makes me freeze — I can't bring myself to reply because I can already see that whole collapse starting.

Therapist: Instead of getting stuck on the worst-case scenario, what would it take for you to just reply to that one email – just type a simple "Hi, I'm working on it" – and see what happens?

Patient: I can see myself doing the tiny things—set a five-minute timer, write a short template, or even say "on it" and hit send—but it feels like a flimsy fix. My head immediately jumps to: they read it, think I'm slow, back out, someone else picks them up, and that little ping starts the avalanche, so those tiny steps feel pointless. Honestly, I'd need a guarantee nothing bad will happen, and since I can't get that, I just freeze and put it off.

Therapist: What's at stake for you if you reply to that email – what's the value of keeping that client engaged and building trust, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: I know keeping them engaged matters — it's steady cash, my reputation, and proof I can handle things — so in theory that one quick reply is worth a lot. But the minute I picture sending even a short "on it," I see them reading it, thinking I'm slow, cancelling the renewal, then word spreads, invoices slow, suppliers freak out, and the whole thing collapses. I'm really stuck on that chain — the other, boringly normal outcomes where they just confirm feel like naive fantasy to me.

Therapist: Can you notice the physical sensations in your body right now when you imagine sending that email – where exactly do you feel tension or discomfort?

Patient: My chest tightens like someone's sitting on it and my stomach goes into a knot — hollow and queasy. My shoulders hunch, jaw clenches, hands get clammy and my breathing shortens, like I'm bracing for the collapse I can already picture. When that happens I just want to look away and busy myself with anything else so I don't have to hit send.

Therapist: Those physical sensations – the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach – are just sensations, not a prediction of what's going to happen. When you notice that knot forming, can you just observe it for a moment without trying to change it, like a bubble in water – it's just there, waiting to be noticed?

Patient: I try to notice it—my chest's tight and my stomach's a knot—but it doesn't help much. The minute I focus, my mind just starts narrating the whole collapse scene louder, like observing gives the doom-story more fuel. I get annoyed because the "just notice" idea sounds reasonable, but I can't make it stick and honestly I'm not sure how to keep observing without spiraling.

Therapist: Instead of trying to observe the sensations, what if you just made a tiny, small commitment to yourself – like taking one deep breath without adding any thoughts or stories – and just focused on that single breath?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try one deep breath — I take it now. For a beat my chest loosens, but it barely lasts before my mind gets louder: they read it, think I’m slow, cancel the contract, the news spreads, suppliers bail, payroll’s missed, and I’m done. I want that breath to steady me, but I’m totally hooked on the avalanche story and it feels impossible to stick with just the breath without spiraling.

Therapist: What's one thing that would happen right now if you just sent that email – what's the smallest, most immediate consequence of taking action?

Patient: The tiniest thing that would happen is they’d open it and see I’m on it — maybe a quick “thanks” or no reply at all. But my mind immediately hijacks that: they read it, decide I’m slow, cancel the renewal, and that single click sets off the whole cascade of clients leaving and suppliers panicking. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can’t seem to stop picturing that chain.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the catastrophic thinking, you simply acknowledged it as you just did – "that's a really dramatic story I'm telling myself" – and then what if you just made a tiny choice to do the opposite of that story?

Patient: I can say out loud, "that's a really dramatic story I'm telling myself," but the minute I do my head just layers on the disaster again. Sure, I could try the opposite and send a one-line "on it" — except I can already see them reading it, deciding I'm unreliable, cancelling, the word spreading, suppliers panicking, and me drowning in debt, so I freeze. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: You're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed right now. That's okay. It takes a lot of courage to show up with this kind of struggle. Would you be willing to just pause with me for a moment, without trying to do anything with ACT or the email, and just acknowledge that it's hard to breathe right now?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to pause with you, but it’s really hard — my breathing’s shallow, my chest’s tight, and my stomach’s in knots. The moment I notice it the fortune-telling machine kicks in louder: I can already see the renewal canceled, suppliers freaking out, payroll missed, and everything collapsing. I’m feeling more anxious and distracted right now, so can we slow down and just stay with this for a minute?

Therapist: You're really struggling to stay present right now – your body's reacting to the anxiety, and the thoughts are still loud. That's okay. It's not about pushing them away or changing them; it's just about noticing that it's hard to stay with this feeling. Can you just acknowledge that it's hard, without trying to add any thoughts or judgments to it?

Patient: I can say it’s hard — and it really is. The moment I try to just notice, my head slams on that disaster tape again: the renewal’s canceled, suppliers freak out, payroll’s missed, and I’m spiraling. I’m feeling jumpy and distracted right now, so I can’t seem to sit with it without adding those judgments.

Therapist: You're stuck in this cycle of noticing the struggle and then the catastrophic thinking taking over. That's really tough. Can you just acknowledge that the struggle feels like it's happening now, exactly as it's happening – without trying to label it or change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? But okay: the struggle is happening right now — my chest's tight, my stomach's knotted, my thoughts are racing and the worst-case tape is already playing on repeat. I try to just notice it, but the moment I do the collapse story drowns out everything else and I get jumpy and distracted, so can we slow down?

Therapist: You're doing the best you can right now, and that's okay. Just notice the physical sensations – the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach – as they are, without adding any thoughts or judgments. Can you just be with that feeling of tightness in your chest, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Okay, I’ll try: my chest is really tight, like someone's pressing down, my breath is shallow, and my stomach's a hard knot, but the second I notice it my head starts shouting the collapse story louder. I want to stay with it, but I'm jumpy and distracted and it's hard — can we slow down and just sit with this for a bit?

Therapist: You're doing a great job of noticing the physical sensations – your chest is tight, your breath is shallow, and your stomach's knotted. Can you just be with those sensations for one more breath, without trying to change them or add any thoughts? No goal, no effort, just being with the sensations as they are.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—I'll try one more breath. I take it and my chest loosens for a beat, but then the fortune-telling machine screams again: they cancel, word spreads, suppliers bail, payroll's missed, and I'm right back panicking. Honestly, it's overwhelming—can we slow down? I can't seem to sit with this without spiraling.

Therapist: It's okay that you're feeling overwhelmed. Your thoughts are just thoughts – they're not the truth. When you notice that panic rising up again, can you say to yourself, "That thought is here. It's just a thought. I've noticed it before, and it doesn't change the fact that I'm here, breathing"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try: "That thought is here. It's just a thought. I've noticed it before, and it doesn't change the fact that I'm here, breathing." I can say it, but it barely lands before the fortune-telling machine screams louder: they cancel, suppliers panic, payroll misses, and I'm ruined — I'm not sure how saying that is supposed to help. I'm really anxious and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay if the thought is still loud. Can you just look down at your hands – notice the shape of your fingers, the color of your skin, the way your hands are resting? Just look at your hands for a moment, without thinking about the thought or trying to change it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I'm looking at my hands: knuckles a bit swollen, some age spots, nails short. For a beat I notice them, but the fortune-telling machine's already screaming that the client will see I'm dithering, cancel the renewal, word spreads, suppliers panic, payroll misses, and I'm finished. I'm feeling jumpy and distracted—can we slow down and just sit with this?

Therapist: Can you just let your hands rest for a moment, without trying to do anything with them? Just allow them to rest on the surface – no need to look at them, no need to move them, just let them be.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Okay, I’ll try to let them rest: my hands feel jittery and keep wanting to reach for my phone like something bad just arrived. For a few seconds they settle, but then the fortune-telling machine fires up again — client cancels, suppliers panic, payroll’s missed — and I can’t keep still. I’m really overwhelmed and distracted right now, so can we slow down?

Therapist: That feeling of restlessness in your hands – it's like a tiny tremble. Can you just notice that tremble right now, without trying to stop it or change it? Just acknowledge the sensation of it, without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the tremble supposed to help? Okay, I can feel it: a little jitter through my fingers like they want to grab my phone. It barely registers before the fortune-telling machine screams that the client will cancel, word will spread, suppliers will panic, payroll will miss, and I'm drowning, so I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: You're feeling completely overwhelmed right now. Can you just say to yourself, "I'm feeling completely overwhelmed" – not "I'm going to be overwhelmed," not "I need to do something about it," just "I'm feeling completely overwhelmed"?

Patient: "I'm feeling completely overwhelmed." I can say that — and for a second it lands — but the fortune-telling machine immediately yells that the client will cancel, word will spread, suppliers panic, payroll misses, and I'm finished, so I'm still jittery and can't calm down. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "That's it. I've noticed the overwhelm." Don't add anything else – just acknowledge the fact that you're noticing it, and then let the breath out.

Patient: I breathe out and say, "That's it. I've noticed the overwhelm." For a beat my chest eases, but almost immediately the fortune-telling machine starts yelling that they'll cancel, word will spread, suppliers panic, payroll misses, and I'm right back panicking. I'm really jittery and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just the feeling of your feet being connected to the earth – not your thoughts, not your chest, just your feet. Can you stay with that sensation for a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I’ll try: my feet feel flat on the floor, a little numb at the toes, like they're anchoring me for a second, but as soon as I notice it my head starts shouting the collapse tape — they cancel the renewal, word spreads, suppliers panic, payroll misses — and I keep wanting to grab my phone. I'm really jittery and distracted right now, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Just before you notice the thoughts again, say to yourself: "Okay, thoughts are here." No judgment, no effort – just a gentle acknowledgement that the thoughts are present.

Patient: Okay — "Okay, thoughts are here." I can say that and for a split second it eases, but then the fortune-telling machine is yelling they'll cancel the renewal, word spreads, suppliers panic, payroll misses and I'm sunk. I'm really jumpy and distracted right now — can we slow down and just sit with this a bit?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, pause for a moment before saying "Okay, thoughts are here". Just stay with the pause for a second, without saying anything.

Patient: I take the breath and try the pause — I do it, and for a second it's quiet, but then my fortune-telling machine floods the silence with the cancellation-catastrophe: they read it, cancel, suppliers panic, payroll misses. I'm feeling really jittery and overwhelmed; can we slow down? I can't seem to hold the pause without spiraling.

Therapist: Instead of pausing before the thoughts, try pausing after you've noticed them. Just as soon as you say "Okay, thoughts are here", pause again before you react. Take a tiny breath, and before you move or react, pause for just one more beat.

Patient: "Okay, thoughts are here." I take the tiny breath and try the pause—there's a half-second of quiet, then the fortune-telling machine blasts the whole collapse scenario into my head. My chest tightens, my hands itch to grab the phone, and I can't hold the pause without spiraling. I'm not sure I follow how the pause stops the avalanche—can we slow down and maybe try something calmer or more concrete I can do when the panic hits?

Therapist: Let's try something small and physical. When you feel that panic rising up, I want you to notice your feet touching the ground. But instead of just noticing it, I want you to do one tiny thing with your feet. Can you wiggle one toe? Just one toe?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. I wiggle one toe now and it loosens me a hair for a beat, but my fortune-telling machine immediately screams that the pause shows I’m dithering, the client cancels the renewal, word spreads, suppliers panic, payroll misses, and I’m finished. I’m really jittery and overwhelmed right now; can we slow down?
