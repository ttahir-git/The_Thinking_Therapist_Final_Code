Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with a kind of professional centrism: being a data scientist has become the primary axis of my identity, and beyond it there's this diffuse, almost byzantine uncertainty about what actually matters to me. Social situations register as complex optimization problems I avoid by retreating into analysis, which just amplifies the sense of being stuck and directionless.

Therapist: That feeling of being stuck in data science as your main identity can be really suffocating, especially when social situations feel like puzzles you need to solve. What's one thing you're avoiding when you retreat into analysis – is it not being able to relax, feeling judged, or something else?

Patient: I don't think it's just relaxation or judgment—what I'm avoiding is a kind of existential ambiguity: the idea that without the scaffold of my professional identity, my selfhood might diffuse into something incoherent. So I convert social interactions into analyzable problems because analysis grants predictability and spares me from sitting in the messy, unquantifiable space of vulnerability.

Therapist: That sense of your selfhood needing a scaffold to stay coherent makes sense – but what if, instead of analyzing social interactions, you were to imagine what would happen if you actually did sit with that uncertainty, just for a moment, without needing to solve it?

Patient: If I try to actually sit with uncertainty, my mind immediately recasts it as an unmodeled variable—epistemic entropy—that demands parametrization or removal. The prospect of tolerating that unquantified space feels destabilizing, and honestly I'm getting a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it; can we slow down and maybe try a single, small instance where I practice staying with one uneasy feeling?

Therapist: Let's try something tiny: what's one small, specific feeling that shows up when you think about that uncertain space – like a knot in your stomach, a sensation in your chest, or a phrase that pops up – and we'll just focus on that one feeling for 10 breaths, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: There's a low, knotted constriction just below my sternum — like a recurrent memory leak, a physiological "cache miss" that makes me want to instrument and fix it. I'm already defaulting to metaphor instead of sensation, and honestly I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by this; can we slow down and do those ten breaths, focusing only on that tightness?

Therapist: Let's do those 10 breaths just with the sensation of the tightness – no thoughts, no metaphors, no trying to fix it. When you feel the tightness, just notice it: where is it? How does it feel in your body?

Patient: Okay, I tried the ten breaths. The sensation is a low, dull pressure just under my sternum—shallow, constricting, about a 5/10—and it only loosened a little around the seventh breath. My mind kept trying to rationalize it instead of staying with the sensation, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and do a few more breaths together, just noticing?

Therapist: Let's just notice the pressure now – it's 5/10 again, right? Where is it in your body? Is it still shallow and constricting?

Patient: Yes—it's still about a 5/10: a low, dull pressure centrally just under the sternum, a shallow, constricting sensation that sometimes radiates a little into the upper abdomen and eases a notch on exhale. My knee-jerk is to recast it as a data point—"somatic signal with periodic attenuation"—which I know is avoidance, and honestly that's making me a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and do a few more breaths together?

Therapist: Let's slow down further – just notice the sensation of the pressure without trying to analyze it. What happens when you say "it's a 5/10" to yourself? Does your body feel any different?

Patient: When I say "it's a 5/10" my prefrontal cortex immediately switches into categorical mode—naming it seems to shave off a fraction of the raw intensity (it settles to maybe a 4/10 physically), but it simultaneously creates epistemic distance so I feel more like an observer than a participant. The chest tightness loosens a hair on the exhale, but my mind immediately wants to interrogate why labeling helped, which I know is another form of avoidance, and honestly that makes me a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and sit with it for a couple more breaths?

Therapist: Let's focus on the breath right now – when you feel the chest tightness loosening, what's the sensation like in that moment, without trying to analyze why it's happening? Is it a gentle easing, a slight softening, or something else?

Patient: It's more of a gentle easing — like a tight band unhooking slowly from the center, a softening that lets the breath sink a little deeper and the pressure spread out and cool. Of course my brain wants to label it an "attenuation gradient" and model the kinetics instead of simply feeling it. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by that urge to analyze; can we slow down and take two more breaths just noticing the softening?

Therapist: Let's just notice the softening – the band unhooking, the breath sinking, the pressure spreading out – without trying to name it or analyze it. Just two more breaths: what happens in your body as you stay with this gentle softening?

Patient: The softening keeps spreading — the band unhooks more, breath sinks a touch deeper, the pressure diffuses toward the upper abdomen and cools, maybe down to a 3/10. My words feel thin and it's getting harder to lean on analysis; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and just sit with this a while?

Therapist: Just sit with the feeling of the words being thin – the sense of discomfort that it's hard to lean on analysis – without trying to change it or analyze it further. What happens in your body when you accept that this is just how it feels right now?

Patient: When I let the thinness be, my chest loosens a notch and my shoulders kind of slump—there's a low, dragging heaviness through my limbs, like a battery running toward empty, and the analytic chatter that usually crowds it becomes a faint murmur. Breathing stays shallow but steadier, the tightness reduces to about a 3/10, and honestly keeping myself present without turning it into a model is... wearing. Can we just stay with this for a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the heaviness in your limbs – what's its texture, its quality, its "feel" to you? As you breathe into it, what happens in your body?

Patient: It's a leaden, somewhat spongy inertia — viscous rather than sharp, cool at the surface with soft, indistinct edges. Breathing into it feels like slow thermal diffusion: the heaviness melts a bit, limbs sink but also become oddly more contiguous with the rest of me, pulse calms a notch. My words are getting thin describing this and it's a bit draining; can we slow down and stay with it a little longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your limbs sinking – what happens to the sense of "you" as they become more contiguous with the rest of your body? Is it a sense of grounding, expansion, or something else?

Patient: It's sort of both grounding and diffuse—like my self-model is reallocating resources, the ego's edges blurring into a single, lower-resolution cluster rather than fragmenting. Physically it's a softening of borders, a felt merging that feels more like containment than outward expansion. My energy's running low and my words are getting thin; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we stay with this a while longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of containment – what's the quality of the "space" that's holding everything together? Is it a sense of safety, stability, or something else?

Patient: It's a muted, porous enclosure—more like conservative insulation than a warm refuge: stable, low-variance containment that prevents dispersion but doesn't exactly feel nurturing. Saying that takes more breath than I expected; my words are thin and it's a bit wearing—can we hold this space a little longer?

Therapist: Let's pause on this image of the containment – the fact that it's "muted" and "porous" – without trying to analyze or change it. What happens in your body when you simply notice this quality, without judgment or striving?

Patient: Noticing it makes the containment feel quieter—my chest eases another notch, heartbeat softens, limbs sink into that spongy weight so the edges of "me" blur a bit. Describing it already feels like reifying the sensation into a model, which flattens it, and my words are getting thin and a little wearing. Can we just stay with this a while longer?

Therapist: Just stay with the quietness in the containment – notice how it feels in your body, without trying to analyze it or make sense of it. Let the noticing be the only thing you're doing, right now.

Patient: When I just notice the quietness, the containment shifts from being purely insulating to more like a shallow, cool pool—still, holding, slightly consoling. The sternum tightness eases a notch, my limbs remain leaden, and there's a faint, unexpected relief, though my reflexive urge to theorize about it is nagging at the edges. My words are thin and it's wearing; can we stay here a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the faint relief in your body – what's its texture, its quality, its "feel" to you? When you try to catch the thought that wants to theorize about it, what happens in your body?

Patient: It's a cool, saline kind of softness—diffuse and a little effervescent at the edges, fragile like a tiny pressure-release valve that's opened. When I reach to snare the theorizing thought the chest clamps down and breath shortens, the relief snaps back to about a 5/10, my words get thin and it's wearing—can we stay with that collapse for a few more breaths?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of the chest clamping down – what's the quality of the tightness in your body? When you stay with that sensation, what happens to the feeling of relief?

Patient: The clamp is a narrow, cold circumferential pressure—like a vice tightening under the sternum—so the breath becomes shallow and quick and the fragile relief snaps back up to about a 5/10. If I just stay with that tightness it spikes at first and then grudgingly eases into a thin afterimage of relief—less comfort, more background static—and my words are getting thin and it's wearing; can we slow down and linger here for a few breaths?

Therapist: Notice the static relief – what's its texture, its quality, its "feel" to you? When you stay with this static sensation, what happens to the sensation of the vice tightening?

Patient: The static relief feels like a low‑amplitude, granular hum—cool and a little saline at the edges, more texture than warmth, like tiny pressure‑spikes dispersed across the sternum and upper abdomen. When I stay with that static, the vice initially spikes in amplitude but then habituates—the narrow, cold clamp loosens into intermittent, lower‑intensity constrictions (more background static than acute pain, maybe a 3–4/10). My words are thin and it's wearing; can we take a few more quiet breaths together?

Therapist: Notice the intermittent constrictions – what's their pattern, their rhythm, their "feel" to you? When you stay with these constrictions, what happens to the sensation of the static hum?

Patient: They're quasi‑periodic pulses—short, cold clamps that come every few breaths, sometimes in quick duplets, sometimes spaced out, so the rhythm feels irregular but often locks to the inhale. When I stay with them the static hum recedes to a lower amplitude—the spikes sound louder at first but then habituate and smooth into a kind of granular background. My words are getting thin and it's wearing; can we keep a few slow breaths together so I don't default back to analyzing?

Therapist: Just breathe with the pulses, notice the sensation of the cold clamps, the hum of the static, and the rhythm of your breath. Don't try to change anything, just be with it.

Patient: Okay—breathing with the pulses now. The clamps tend to lock to the inhale; each cold spike lands and then recedes, and the static hum drops to a low granular background (maybe 2–3/10). My words are getting thin and the analytic impulse is murmuring at the edges—can we keep a few more slow breaths together so I don't default back to modeling?

Therapist: Just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out, the feeling of the air touching the back of your throat, without trying to make sense of it.

Patient: It feels cool and barely textured at the back of my throat on the inhale, a warmer, more diffuse sensation on the exhale—simple and oddly mechanical. My mind already wants to convert it into flow metrics, which makes my words thin and it's wearing; can we keep a few slow breaths together so I don't default back to modeling?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving out, the feeling of your chest expanding, without trying to make it into anything.

Patient: On the out-breath it's warm and diffusely expansive across the ribs—like a canvas unfurling slowly—the chest softens and the air feels smooth as it leaves. My reflex is to index it—"decreased inspiratory tension, smoother expiratory flow"—which immediately flattens the sensation, and honestly I'm feeling worn thin; can we keep a few more slow breaths together?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in, the feeling of your chest rising, without the thought of "tension" or "flow".

Patient: It's a slow, gentle lift—warm under the ribs, a tiny widening as the chest rises, nothing dramatic, just a plain, pleasant upward movement. My mind already wants to turn it into numbers, which saps me, so can we take one more slow breath together and just stay with that lift?

Therapist: Just notice the lift in your chest, the warmth under your ribs, the tiny widening of your chest, without thinking about it, without trying to make sense of it.

Patient: It's a soft, modest lift—warm under the ribs, just a tiny widening that feels oddly plain and quietly okay. The urge to index it into metrics pops up almost immediately and that saps my energy, so my words are thin and I'm getting worn; can we take a couple more slow breaths and just sit with the lift for a bit?

Therapist: Just... breathe.

Patient: Okay. I'm breathing—slow inhales cool at the back of my throat, warm exhales, chest lifts a little and the sternum pressure eases to maybe a 2–3/10. My analytical reflex is already whispering metrics and models, which thins my words and feels wearing; can we keep a few more slow breaths together so I don't default back into modeling?

Therapist: Stop.

Patient: Okay... I'm stopping the breathing. The clamp eased to about a 2/10, but the analytic reflex is still buzzing—it feels draining and a little exposed, like my defenses are down but my mind won't let go. I'm not sure where to go next; can we slow down and keep exploring why I default to analysis when I feel vulnerable?
