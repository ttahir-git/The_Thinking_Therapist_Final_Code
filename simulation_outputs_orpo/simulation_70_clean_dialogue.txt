Patient: Lately I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism — I obsess over perceived failures, especially since starting this demanding new job as an accountant. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved family, and I think that taught me to bottle things up, so every small mistake feels huge. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried talking about it before and I don't see how just talking changes anything.

Therapist: When you notice that small mistakes make you feel like you've "failed," what's one thing you wish you could do instead of bottling it up, that would still let you meet your responsibilities at work?

Patient: I wish I could just acknowledge the mistake to myself — admit "I messed up," make a quick, concrete plan to fix it, and then let it go so it doesn't spiral into this whole failure story. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried telling myself that before and it doesn't stick; the self-criticism just keeps coming.

Therapist: What's one thing about being an accountant that's connected to why you took this job in the first place – something that matters to you, like helping people or solving puzzles?

Patient: Mostly it's that I like the puzzle part — turning messy numbers into something clean and knowing my work actually keeps things running for clients. It also gave me stability and a sense of control, which mattered a lot growing up in a quiet, reserved household. But honestly, how is that supposed to help with the constant self-criticism? I've told myself that before and it doesn't stop the spiral.

Therapist: When you notice that self-criticism starts to spiral, what would it feel like to pause it just for a second – to notice it as just a thought, without judgment – while you focus on that puzzle piece you mentioned earlier?

Patient: I guess it would feel like a small bit of breathing room — a tiny gap where the shame isn't swallowing everything and I can actually look at the spreadsheet and fix the error. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried "noticing" thoughts before and it just becomes another thing to beat myself up for not doing, so I'm not sure how to make that pause happen when there's a deadline.

Therapist: What's one small, concrete action you could take right now to fix that error – not just notice it – that would still help you meet your deadline and keep the client's work running smoothly?

Patient: I'd set a 15-minute focused block: stop multitasking, trace the error to its source (check the formula or recent entries), correct it, add a comment documenting the change, then rerun the reconciliation so the client's work stays accurate before the deadline. But honestly, how is that supposed to help with the spiraling? I can do the fix, but I doubt it will stop the shame from coming back afterward.

Therapist: Before you focus on fixing the error, what would it mean to you to see that one small mistake as an opportunity to actually help the client – to make their work more accurate and reliable?

Patient: I guess it would mean I'm actually helping someone — turning a mistake into something useful, a kind of quiet competence that matters. It might make the shame less overwhelming for a minute, because the focus shifts to fixing something for the client's benefit. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I can see the logic, but the shame still feels like it comes back no matter what I do.

Therapist: What would it take for you to be willing to notice that shame thought without judgment – just for the tiny moment it takes to make that correction for the client – rather than trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: Probably a concrete cue — like a short script I can say to myself and a 15-minute timer that gives me permission to focus — so I can think “that’s just a thought” and actually get on with the fix. I’d also need some real external permission to make mistakes, not just telling myself it, maybe a written note or a workplace norm I can lean on. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried those tricks and the shame still comes back.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to see that written note or workplace norm not just as permission to make mistakes, but as permission to be human – to be imperfect and still do your work with care and attention?

Patient: It would feel like someone else officially saying it's okay to be human — like a little shield against that voice that tells me one mistake means I'm a failure, so I could actually focus on fixing things instead of spiraling. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? If it's just a note on a wall and people still act like mistakes are shameful, it won't change much; I'd need it actually modeled and reinforced by my manager for it to stick.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if your manager not only acknowledged the note but also explicitly connected the value of doing your work accurately to your own personal value of being reliable and competent?

Patient: It would feel like real validation—like someone official backing up that being careful and accurate is what matters, not being perfect all the time, so I could actually focus on fixing things without the shame hijacking me. That kind of reinforcement might give me permission to try the 15-minute fix without spiraling because it's not just me lecturing myself. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? I worry I'd still doubt the sincerity and the old voice that screams “you're a failure” would just find new ways to show up.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you catch that voice of doubt, you could instead say to yourself, "I'm not just fixing this one mistake, I'm showing up for the person who needs this work done – the one I care about and want to be reliable for"?

Patient: I think it would give me a little anchor — a reminder that I'm doing something useful for someone else, which could quiet the shame long enough to actually fix the problem. I could try a short script before a 15-minute focus block: “I'm doing this for the client; I'm reliable,” and see if that steadies me. But honestly, how is that supposed to help with the next time the voice shows up? I've tried reframes before and they don't stick.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you catch that voice of doubt, you didn't try to push it away or change it – but instead simply observed it as a thought, and wondered what it might be trying to tell you?

Patient: I guess it might feel like turning the volume down on the panic so I can actually listen — maybe the doubt is trying to warn me to double-check something or protect me from getting criticized. That would make it feel useful instead of just brutalizing me. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried the “notice and be curious” angle before and I just end up criticizing myself for not doing it perfectly, so I don’t know how to keep that curiosity from vanishing.

Therapist: What would it take for you to commit to just one tiny moment of defusion – noticing that doubt as a thought, without judgment – before you try to tackle the task again?

Patient: I could try if it’s really tiny and concrete — like a 3–5 second script I can say to myself, a 15-minute timer, and a sticky note on my monitor that gives me permission to be imperfect. I’d also need one real-world check — a manager or teammate who models it or a quick check-in so it doesn’t feel like just me making rules I won’t follow. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’m worn out and skeptical; it already feels like another thing I could fail at, and I’m afraid I’ll just punish myself when I forget.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, after using the 3-5 second script and committing to just one tiny moment of defusion, you could gently treat yourself with kindness – just for showing up – rather than beating yourself up for not doing it "perfectly"?

Patient: It would mean I'm allowed to be human — that showing up, even imperfectly, is enough to deserve some gentleness instead of automatic punishment, and that could make the shame not feel like the whole world collapsing in that moment. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? I'm skeptical it'll stick; I can imagine slipping back into the same cycle and then beating myself up for failing at being kind to myself.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if showing up imperfectly, with the 3-5 second script and tiny moment of defusion, became a small act of courage that aligned with your value of being a reliable and competent accountant – one that didn't require you to be "good" but simply showed up with kindness?

Patient: I guess it would mean I’m not trying to be perfect all the time — that doing the work with care, even when it’s messy, is its own kind of courage and lines up with why I took this job. That might make the shame feel less catastrophic and let me move on after I fix something. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? I’m skeptical it won’t just become another thing I fail at unless there’s real reinforcement — like a manager noticing small wins or some way to actually track that I’m getting better.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you catch yourself wanting to punish yourself for not doing it "perfectly," you could instead ask yourself what small step you could take to move closer to being the reliable and competent accountant you want to be – one that feels meaningful to you, rather than trying to earn external validation?

Patient: It would mean I’m giving myself a useful question instead of an automatic punishment — like asking “what’s one tiny next step?” that actually moves me toward being reliable. Maybe I could try this: after a 15-minute fix, write one short line in a little notebook — what I corrected and one concrete next step (e.g., double-check column X, ask Sam to glance it over) — something I can look back on. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’m worn out thinking about another ritual, and I’m afraid I’ll just beat myself up when I forget.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, instead of trying to remember to write down the small win, you simply took a moment to acknowledge it as you're done with the task – a small pause to say to yourself, "I did that. I showed up with care"?

Patient: Maybe — a tiny pause to say “I did that” could give a little break from the shame, enough to notice the win. But I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the next wave of criticism — how is that supposed to help when it just feels like another thing to remember? I don't have the energy for more rituals I might forget, so it sounds good in theory but I'm skeptical it'll stick.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, instead of trying to remember to pause and say "I did that," you simply felt the pause as a physical sensation in your body – like the weight of your seat on the chair or the rise of your chest as you breathe in?

Patient: Maybe that would be easier — feeling the weight of my body or the rise of my chest feels less like another chore and more like something I already do, so it could actually ground me for a second. But I'm not sure I follow how that stops the next wave of self-criticism — how is that supposed to help when the voice just keeps coming back anyway?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you feel the pause and the weight of your body, you didn't try to push the voice away or change it – but instead simply observed it as "that voice" – just the sound of your own thoughts, without judgment or connection to it being true?

Patient: Maybe that would help — if I could hear it as just "that voice," it might feel less like the whole truth and more like background noise, so it wouldn't sweep me away as quickly. But I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops it from convincing me it's right in the next minute — how is that supposed to help when it still sounds so certain? I don't know, it just feels like another thing I might fail at remembering.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you hear that voice saying you're not good enough, you didn't try to prove it wrong or silence it – but instead remembered that voice's role in telling you you'll never be perfect, and how that's exactly what you're trying to avoid by being a reliable accountant?

Patient: Maybe that could help — if I saw the voice as a warning to double‑check rather than a verdict, I might use it to catch real mistakes without spiraling. But I'm not sure I follow how to make that happen in the moment; how is that supposed to help when the voice already feels so convincing and I'm worn out from fighting it?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you hear that voice warning you about a mistake, you simply thought, "Ah, that's the voice reminding me to double-check – it's not saying I'm a failure, it's saying I can do better"?

Patient: Maybe—I can see how labeling it as a reminder could make it feel useful instead of crushing. But I'm not sure I follow how to actually make that happen when the voice is loud and I'm exhausted; it still feels like another thing to manage and I'm skeptical it'll stick. How is that supposed to help in the moment when I'm already worn out?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you hear that voice warning you about a mistake, you didn't try to push it away or change it – but instead simply noticed the sensation of your breath moving in and out, and that sensation became the anchor for your thought, "That voice is reminding me to double-check"?

Patient: Maybe that could work — the breath feels less like another thing to remember, so it might actually ground me for a second and let me reinterpret the voice as a reminder. I'm not sure I follow exactly how to make that happen in the middle of a panic; how is that supposed to help when the voice is so loud and I'm already worn down? I guess I could try to notice one breath and say the line once, but I don't have much faith it won't just slip away.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you notice one breath, you didn't just think the label – but instead, as you breathe out, you literally say it out loud, just one word, "Reminder"?

Patient: Maybe — saying "Reminder" out loud on an exhale could be simple enough that I might actually do it instead of forgetting. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I'm in a full panic and I can't even feel my breath? I don't have much faith it'll stick, but I could try it once and see.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when your breath is literally gone and your body is in full panic, you didn't try to think about the label – but instead, simply focused on the sensation of your heart beating, and that sensation became the anchor for your thought, "Reminder"?

Patient: Maybe — feeling my heartbeat is at least something real to grab onto when everything else feels blank. But I'm not sure I follow how I'm supposed to notice it in the middle of full-blown panic; how is that supposed to help when I can't even feel my breath? I guess I could try it once, though I don't have much faith it'll stick.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when your breath is gone and your body is in full panic, you simply felt the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and that sensation became the anchor for your thought, "Reminder"?

Patient: Maybe feeling my feet could help — it's physical and simple, so it's less like another thing to fail at. But I'm not sure I follow how that actually dials down the panic or keeps the shame from coming back — how is that supposed to help when my head's already racing? I could try it once, though I don't have much faith it'll stick.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you felt your feet touching the ground, you didn't try to push the panic away or change it – but instead simply noticed it as a sensation in your body, like the feeling of your toes wiggling, without judgment or connection to it being "good" or "bad"?

Patient: Maybe feeling my feet would actually be grounding — it's physical and simple, so I might actually do it. But I'm not sure I follow how wiggling my toes once stops the shame from coming back or dials down the panic when I'm already worn out; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if, when you felt your feet touching the ground and your toes wiggling, you didn't try to change the thought that "I'm a failure" – but instead simply observed it as a thought, without judgment or connection to it being true, just as you would notice a passing cloud without trying to push it away?

Patient: Maybe it would make the “I’m a failure” thought feel less like a verdict and more like background noise, so it wouldn’t pull me under so fast. But I’m not sure I follow how I’m supposed to notice it like a cloud in the middle of a panic — how is that supposed to help when my head’s already racing and I keep forgetting to do these things?
