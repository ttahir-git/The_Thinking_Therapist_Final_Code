Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed — since losing my job the sadness and lack of motivation have gotten worse and it's starting to mess with my relationship. I try to stay upbeat and keep busy with school, but I get distracted and I'm not sure what to do about it, I don't know.

Therapist: When you say you're overwhelmed, what's one thing you've been putting off because of it? For example, is it reconnecting with your partner, responding to job applications, or something else?

Patient: I guess the biggest thing is reconnecting with my partner — I keep putting off the conversation about how my mood and the job situation are affecting us. I don't know, it just feels really awkward and I end up changing the subject or doing something else instead.

Therapist: Reconnecting with your partner matters deeply to you, and it's not about fixing everything right now – it's about showing up together with a willingness to work through this tough time. What would happen if, instead of avoiding it, you made a small commitment to just have one conversation with them – say, "I'd like to talk about how we're doing together for just 10 minutes tonight"?

Patient: I guess I could try saying that, but I'm worried it'll turn into this huge thing and I'll just freeze up. I don't know, I'm really bad at bringing it up — I end up changing the subject or scrolling my phone. Could we maybe… practice what I'd say first, or is that silly?

Therapist: It's not silly at all – in fact, it's a great way to build courage. Let's try something tiny: just say "I'd like to talk about us" without adding any expectations or goals. Just those two words. No agenda, no problem-solving. Just "I'd like to talk about us."

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "I'd like to talk about us." I don't know, saying it out loud already makes my chest tight — what if they ask "what about?" and I just freeze? Could we practice a simple follow-up for if they say that?

Therapist: If they ask "what about?", you can pause and say "That's a great question, let me think about it for a moment." Then, take a deep breath, and instead of trying to come up with an answer, notice what happens in your body. Where do you feel the tightness in your chest? That's your mind trying to prepare for a problem – but you can observe it without acting on it.

Patient: I guess my chest already feels tight just thinking about it — my hands get clammy and I start scrolling my phone to avoid it. I don't know if I'll actually notice anything else besides that, but okay, I'm willing to try. Can we do a roleplay where you say "what about?" and I try the pause line?

Therapist: Let's try it. I'll say "what about?" and you respond with the pause line. Remember, it's just a phrase – you're not trying to answer anything. Go ahead and say "That's a great question, let me think about it for a moment."

Patient: "That's a great question, let me think about it for a moment." Okay... I can already feel my chest tightening and my hands getting clammy. I don't know, I keep wanting to reach for my phone.

Therapist: You paused and noticed the physical sensations, which means you're still present with your words. That takes courage. Now, when you were about to reach for your phone, what was your partner doing? Were they looking at you with kindness or concern?

Patient: I guess they were kind of looking concerned, like they wanted to help but didn't know how. I don't know, it makes me feel... small, and then I just reach for my phone to not have to deal with it. Can we not get too deep into that yet?

Therapist: Let's stay with the physical sensations. You paused, noticed the tightness in your chest, and the clammy hands. Those sensations are physical – they don't have to be connected to a story or emotion just yet. Can you just notice them, without judgment, for one more breath?

Patient: Okay... I took a breath. I can feel the tightness in my chest and my hands are clammy, and my mind just hops straight to my phone. I don't know, it's really hard to sit with it — can we maybe do a quick trick for when I start reaching for my phone?

Therapist: When you catch yourself reaching for your phone, just say "phone" to yourself out loud. That's it – just the word "phone". It's a tiny pause that gives you a moment to choose what you do next.

Patient: Okay, I'll try saying "phone" out loud — I guess it feels kind of silly but maybe it'll interrupt the habit. I don't know, what if I say it and still end up scrolling? Could we brainstorm one more backup, like putting the phone in another room or having a small object to hold instead? Also… I already feel weird talking about this, like I'm almost trying to change the subject.

Therapist: It's totally normal to feel weird about talking about this – it's actually a sign that you're willing to challenge your habits. You're not trying to change the subject; you're trying to change what happens when you reach for your phone. Regarding the backup plan, I like the idea of having a small object to hold instead of your phone. What if you choose a small notebook or pen that's nearby? That way, when you catch yourself reaching for your phone, you can swap it for that object and create a new habit.

Patient: I guess a small notebook or a little stress ball might work — probably a notebook I can hold. I worry I'll still reach for my phone or forget to grab it, though. I don't know, could we pick a spot to keep the notebook before the conversation so it's easy to reach? I'm already feeling weird about getting into this.

Therapist: That's a great idea about keeping the notebook in an easy-to-reach spot. Why don't we identify a specific place where you can keep the notebook right now, before we even talk to your partner? That way, when you catch yourself reaching for your phone, you can grab the notebook instead. It doesn't have to be perfect – just a spot where it's likely to be within arm's reach.

Patient: I guess I could keep the notebook on the coffee table by the couch where we usually sit — it's easy to reach. I don't know, I worry I'll still grab my phone or forget to pick it up; could we maybe practice that quick reminder one more time? I'm already feeling weird about this.

Therapist: Let's try the quick reminder one more time. When you catch yourself reaching for your phone, you'll say "phone" out loud. And then, as soon as you say it, you'll pick up the notebook instead. That's it – just a tiny step to create a new habit. You've got this.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "phone" out loud and grabbing the notebook supposed to help? I guess it might break the habit, but I already feel weird doing that in front of them and I don't know if I'll remember or if it'll just look odd.

Therapist: When you catch yourself reaching for your phone, the goal isn't to say "phone" out loud (that's just a habit-breaker). The goal is to actually pick up the notebook instead. Think about what's holding you back from doing that – is it the phone because it's comfortable, or is it because you're worried you'll forget? If it's the comfort of the phone, then the notebook is a better choice. So, when you feel the urge to grab your phone, what would happen if you chose the notebook instead?

Patient: I guess if I grabbed the notebook instead I'd at least stop scrolling — maybe I'd fidget with it or doodle instead of spiraling. I don't know if it'd actually calm me or just make me feel awkward and self-conscious. Can we slow down a bit? This is getting kind of heavy.

Therapist: Let's simplify this. When you feel the urge to reach for your phone, what's one thing you can do instead of scrolling? Just one thing. Can you hold the notebook in your hand? That's it. No judgment, no fuss. Just holding it.

Patient: I guess I could hold the notebook. I don't know, it feels weird and my chest's already tight — this is kind of wearing me out. Can we slow down and maybe just practice it once more, really slowly?

Therapist: Let's do it one tiny step at a time. Just hold the notebook in your hand for a second. Not to do anything with it, not to think about it, just to hold it. Like you're holding a small, soft toy. Just the weight of it in your hand.

Patient: Okay... I held the notebook for a second. It felt a bit grounding but my chest's still tight and I kept wanting the phone — I guess it helped a little, but I don't know. Can we try it again, slower?

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. Just look at the notebook in your hand. Notice the shape, the weight, the feel of it against your palm. Don't think about holding it, just be with it. Just look at it.

Patient: Okay... I'm looking at it. It's small and worn, kind of heavier than I expected, and my chest is still tight — my mind keeps bouncing to the phone. I don't know, I guess it helped a little, but I feel weird doing this; could we maybe practice the next line after "I'd like to talk about us"?

Therapist: Let's practice the next line: "When I think about us, I feel..." Just pause there, and don't say anything. Take a deep breath, and notice what happens in your chest.

Patient: When I think about us, I feel sad and... I don't know, kind of stuck and useless. My chest is tight and I keep wanting to look at my phone — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's pause on the phrase "sad and..." Just notice the sensation of the tightness in your chest. It's like a small, steady hum. Can you feel the weight of it in your body, without trying to move or change it?

Patient: I can feel it — this heavy pressure under my ribs, my breath gets shallow and my heart feels a bit fast. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to sit with that; can we slow down and do a quick grounding thing or go back to practicing the "phone" trick for a minute?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your feet on the ground. Just notice the sensation of the floor beneath you, the feeling of your feet touching it. When you're ready, we can come back to the notebook, or we can try the "phone" trick again – what feels most important to you right now?

Patient: I guess the "phone" trick feels more doable right now. Can we practice it really slowly — you say "phone," I say it back, then pick up the notebook and just hold it for one slow breath? I don't know, I'm already a bit shaky, so can we keep it tiny and go at my pace?

Therapist: Let's do it. I'll say "phone," and you say it back to me. Then, you'll pick up the notebook and hold it for just one slow breath. Ready? Here we go: "phone".

Patient: phone. Okay... I said "phone" and picked up the notebook — held it for one slow breath. My hands are still clammy and my chest is tight, but I didn't reach for the phone, so I guess that's something. I don't know, can we do that one more time, really slowly?

Therapist: That was amazing – you stayed with the notebook for just one breath! Let's do it again, really slowly. I'll say "phone," and you say it back to me. Then, you'll pick up the notebook and hold it for another slow breath. Are you ready?

Patient: Okay... phone. phone. I picked up the notebook and held it for one slow breath. My chest's still tight and my hands are clammy, but I didn't grab the phone, so... I don't know, can we do it again, really slowly?

Therapist: That's it! Just "phone" again. You can do this. I'll say it: "phone". Then, pick up the notebook and hold it for another slow breath.

Patient: phone. phone. I picked up the notebook and held it for one slow breath — my chest's tight and my hands are clammy, but I didn't grab the phone. I don't know, can we do it one more time, really slowly? I'm feeling kind of shaky, so let's keep it tiny.

Therapist: Just one more tiny step. Say "phone" to me, and then pick up the notebook and hold it for one slow breath. That's it. You're almost done.

Patient: phone. I picked up the notebook and held it for one slow breath — my hands are still clammy and my chest's tight, but it feels a tiny bit calmer, I guess. Can we do another one? I don't know, I'm still kind of shaky.

Therapist: You're doing amazing. One more tiny step. Hold the notebook in your hand and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose. As you exhale, say "phone" to me one more time.

Patient: phone. I said it and held the notebook as I exhaled — my chest's still tight and my hands are clammy, but I guess it feels a tiny bit less frantic. I don't know, I'm kind of shaky and this is wearing me out; can we slow down and maybe practice the next line I'd say after "I'd like to talk about us" one small step at a time?

Therapist: Let's start small. You said "phone" and held the notebook. Now, I want you to notice the feeling in your chest when you think about the next line: "When I think about us..." Just notice the sensation without trying to do anything with it. Can you stay with that feeling for just a tiny moment?

Patient: I can try to stay with it for a tiny moment... my chest feels tight and heavy under my ribs, my breathing's shallow and my heart's a bit fast. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable and I keep wanting to reach for my phone — can we slow down or maybe go back to the "phone" trick for a minute?

Therapist: Let's go back to the "phone" trick, but this time, when you say "phone", I want you to pause just for a second before picking up the notebook. Just hold the word "phone" in your mind for a second, without moving or looking at the notebook. Can you do that?

Patient: I can try. Okay — phone. ...I held the word for a second before moving, and my chest got tighter and my hands felt clammy; I almost just grabbed the phone. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable — can we keep the pause short or do it one more time slowly?
