Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of tearing myself down over small mistakes, like I'm always failing even though I struggled in school but somehow found my footing as a chef. It feels tied to those academic failures — I keep expecting to mess up and then I punish myself when I do. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change the way I already criticize myself?

Therapist: Those feelings of failure and self-criticism must be really painful for you, especially since you've found success in your work as a chef. Can you imagine what would happen if, just for a moment, you stopped believing that those mistakes are proof of your worthlessness? What might be different about how you treat yourself if you didn't tie those mistakes to your past failures?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I'd be less brutal about burning a sauce or screwing up a shift, and not automatically assume it proves I'm a failure. Maybe I'd give myself space to learn instead of punishing myself, like treating mistakes as practice instead of proof I'm worthless. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried reframing before and it never sticks — I just end up back at square one.

Therapist: It sounds like reframing isn't just about changing the story you tell yourself, but also about actually doing something differently when that story comes up. What would it take for you to commit to one small thing, like taking a deep breath before reacting to a mistake, just for the next time it happens?

Patient: I can try to take a breath next time, but I won't promise it'll do anything — in a busy shift I'll probably forget or it won't drown out the immediate self-berating. It just feels too small compared to the whole story in my head; how is that supposed to help when the voice comes back anyway?

Therapist: It's understandable that the self-criticism can feel overwhelming. But what if, instead of trying to make the voice go away, you simply noticed when it showed up? What if you made taking that one breath the smallest act of kindness to yourself, because it shows you're willing to be gentle with yourself even when the voice gets loud?

Patient: I get the idea of noticing it and taking a breath, but honestly I’ve tried that and it never sticks — in a busy shift I go on autopilot and the critic just drowns everything out and I end up overwhelmed. How is a single breath supposed to change that avalanche of self-hate in the moment? If you’ve got concrete, simple steps that actually work in a kitchen, fine — tell me, but I’m skeptical they’ll make much difference.

Therapist: In that moment of overwhelm, when the critic is loudest, what if you just noticed the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away? That's it – just noticing the physical sensation of the breath. No trying to make it work, no pushing it away, just observing it.

Patient: I mean, I can try to notice the breath, but in the middle of a service it just feels impossible — there’s too much noise and pressure and the critic’s shouting. How is that supposed to help when I’m juggling pans and someone yells my name? If you want me to actually try, give me a concrete, three-second thing I can do on the line — a short phrase or a tiny physical anchor — otherwise I’ll probably just forget and go back to beating myself up.

Therapist: When someone yells your name, as you're about to answer, take just 3 seconds to touch the back of your hand to your thigh. That's it – just a quick, tiny touch. No thinking, no trying to change it, just the physical sensation of your hand touching your thigh.

Patient: I guess I could try that—three seconds touching my thigh when someone yells my name seems doable. But I'm doubtful it'll actually cut through the chaos on a busy shift; sometimes I don't even register stuff like that. Could we pick something even more kitchen-friendly, like a quick thumb-press to the palm or a tap on the counter that doesn't look weird? Honestly, I've tried anchors before and they never stick—how is this really supposed to help when the critic's already screaming?

Therapist: When someone yells your name, as you're about to answer, just press your thumb lightly onto the palm of your hand, just for a second. That's it – no looking, no thinking, just the gentle pressure of your thumb on your palm.

Patient: Alright, I can try the thumb-press — sounds less weird than touching my thigh. But I'm still skeptical it’ll cut through a panicked rush; my hands are usually greasy, hot, or full and I just blank out. If we’re doing this, tell me how to practice it so it actually becomes automatic on the line, because I’ve tried anchors and they didn’t stick. And honestly, how is a thumb-press supposed to change the whole loop of me calling myself a failure?

Therapist: Here's a practice: as you're about to answer someone's name, press your thumb lightly onto your palm, and say to yourself, "I've got this." Just that one sentence, with the physical anchor of the thumb-press. Start with a low volume, so it doesn't distract from the task. Practice this a few times a shift, without expecting it to work, just to get the physical sensation of the thumb-press and the value statement connected.

Patient: Alright, I’ll try the thumb-press with “I’ve got this,” but I’m honestly worn out from techniques that don’t stick. How do I make this practical when my hands are full, greasy, or I’m panicking mid-service — do you want me to practice a certain number of reps each shift or do it off-shift too? And more importantly, how is that supposed to change the whole loop of me beating myself up later when the critic keeps replaying mistakes?

Therapist: For the next shift, practice this: when you press your thumb lightly onto your palm, say "I've got this" while focusing on the sensation of your thumb on your palm. Then, as soon as you're done with the shift, take a minute to write down one thing you're proud of accomplishing, no matter how small it seems. This is not about analyzing mistakes, but about acknowledging a tiny win. Next shift, we'll explore how to connect that win to the critic.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try the thumb-press and I can write one thing after the shift, but I’ll probably do the practice reps off-shift since my hands are greasy or full during service. How many reps do you want me to do each shift or off-shift, and how long should that jotting be—one line, a sentence, more? Also, honestly, how is this supposed to connect to the critic that replayed mistakes later and makes me feel worthless—seems like a tiny band-aid unless we tie it to something else. I'm already kind of worn out by all this—can we slow down and figure out a realistic routine that might actually stick?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, practice this: each shift, when you're done with your tasks, jot down one thing that feels like a tiny win (e.g., "I made a great sauce," or "I stayed calm during a chaotic moment"). Don't analyze it, just acknowledge it. Then, when you're off-shift, take 2 minutes to look at your journal entries from the past week. Notice one thing that shows up repeatedly, like a pattern of tiny wins. Ask yourself: "What would it mean for the critic to see this pattern? What would it say about my value to myself?"

Patient: Alright—I’ll give the thumb-press and the one-line win a shot for two weeks, but I need it made realistic. Do you want me doing reps off-shift, like 10 quick presses while I’m waiting for something, or a few reps at the start/end of each shift? And the jotting—one sentence or a short bullet? I’m tired of techniques that don’t stick—how is this actually going to change the critic that replays every mistake and ruins my evenings? Can we slow down and set a plan I can actually follow on the line?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: each shift, press your thumb lightly onto your palm **1** time when you're done with a task or before you answer a name. Then, when you're off-shift, take **1 minute** to jot down one thing that feels like a tiny win (e.g., "I made a great sauce" or "I stayed calm during a chaotic moment"). Just write it down, no analysis or reflection. We'll explore how this pattern shows up to the critic later.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the one thumb-press and the one-minute jot after shifts for two weeks, but I’m already drained and not sure I’ll remember on the line. What exactly counts as “done with a task”? I can’t press my thumb every time I finish plating — that’s dozens of times in a service. And honestly, how is this supposed to actually change the critic that keeps replaying my mistakes later?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: each shift, press your thumb lightly onto your palm **1** time when you **ask for a new order** or **hand someone a dish**. This small action happens about every 30-60 seconds, so it's a manageable and timely trigger. The one-minute jot after shifts will still happen, and we'll explore how this pattern shows up to the critic.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try, but that frequency feels kind of insane. My hands are usually greasy or full — how am I supposed to press my thumb every 30–60 seconds without contaminating things or just forgetting? Also, what exactly counts as “asking for a new order”? Is tapping when I call out a ticket okay?  

And honestly, how is doing that so often supposed to actually stop the critic from replaying my mistakes later? Can we slow down and make a realistic version I can actually stick to on the line?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: each shift, press your thumb lightly onto your palm **1** time when you **take a pause to breathe** between tasks. This pause happens naturally when you're transitioning between tasks, and it's a small moment of stillness in the midst of chaos. We'll explore how this pattern shows up to the critic. This revised trigger is more practical and accurate, and it creates a small space for reflection between tasks.

Patient: Okay… I can try the thumb-press during a pause, but shifts are nonstop and I get jumpy—sometimes there literally isn't a pause. How long does a pause have to be to count, and if there's no pause is a quick mental anchor okay so I don't contaminate anything or drop plates? And honestly, how is that supposed to help the critic that replayed everything and zaps me later?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: each shift, as soon as you notice your hand **starting to move towards a task**, press your thumb lightly onto your palm **1** time. This tiny trigger happens just before you start working on a task, and it's a small moment of awareness that can help you connect to your breath and value. If there's no pause, a quick mental anchor like "I've got this" or "Stay calm" can help you transition smoothly without contaminating anything. This revised trigger is more flexible and practical, and it creates a small space for self-awareness even in the midst of chaos.

Patient: Alright… I can try to catch the moment my hand starts to move, but in the middle of service I’m on autopilot — how am I supposed to feel that split-second? If my hands are dirty or full, you said a mental anchor’s okay — what exact phrase should I use so it’s not cheesy and actually works? I’ve done anchors and little rituals before and they fade — how is this supposed to actually change the critic that replays every mistake later, not just give me another thing to forget?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: whenever your hand is dirty or full, as soon as you **reach for a towel or clean your hands**, say to yourself "I've got this" (no need to add anything else). This anchor is concrete and easy to do, even when you're on autopilot. The phrase "I've got this" is a simple, value-driven statement that acknowledges your ability to handle whatever comes next. This anchor is not about being perfect, but about acknowledging your strengths and values in the midst of chaos.

Patient: Okay... I can try saying "I've got this" when I reach for a towel, but my head's all over the place right now so this feels kind of shaky. Do you want it said out loud or is a quiet thought okay? Also what exactly counts as "reach for a towel" — like wiping a plate vs actually washing my hands? And honestly, how is this supposed to change the loop that keeps replaying every mistake after the shift? Feels like another thing I'll forget or mess up.

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: whenever your hand is dirty or full, **reach for a towel or wash your hands** without thinking about it. Just do the action. Say to yourself "I've got this" as soon as you start the action (e.g., "I've got this" as you wipe a plate or start washing your hands). This anchor is concrete and easy to do, even when you're on autopilot. The phrase "I've got this" is a value-driven statement that acknowledges your ability to handle whatever comes next. This anchor is not about stopping the critic's loop, but about creating a small space for self-awareness that can help you connect to your values.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try saying “I’ve got this” when I reach for a towel or start washing, but I’m shaky about whether to say it out loud or just think it—which do you want? Also, what counts as “reach for a towel” — wiping a plate vs actually washing hands? And honestly, how is this supposed to stop the critic that replaying every mistake after the shift? I’m worn out and worried I’ll just forget or do it half-assed and then beat myself up for that too.

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: whenever your hand is dirty or full, **reach for a towel to wipe a plate or bowl**, and say the phrase "I've got this" out loud. This anchor is concrete, easy to do, and specific enough to create a reliable habit. Saying it out loud makes it more tangible and less likely to get lost in your thoughts. The goal isn't to stop the critic entirely, but to create a small moment of self-awareness that can help you connect to your values and move forward, even after the shift. Remember, this is a tiny anchor, not a magic solution. The focus is on the small act, not the outcome.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try it, but I’m already wiped and my head’s jittery. Saying it out loud feels weird and risky — people hear me, it’s loud, and I don’t want to look like I’m losing it; is a quiet whisper or mouthing it okay? Also wiping plates is nonstop—do you actually mean every single wipe? I’ll forget and just beat myself up for forgetting, so can we pick a realistic target (like 3 times a service or only after a stressful moment)? And honestly, how is saying it out loud supposed to stop the critic replaying my mistakes later? I'm skeptical this will stick.

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: whenever you **take a brief break from wiping plates or handling a task that feels stressful**, whisper the phrase "I've got this" to yourself. This anchor is specific enough to create a small moment of self-awareness, and whispering it out loud is a gentle way to make it tangible. Wiping plates isn't necessary – just focus on taking breaks from tasks that feel overwhelming. This anchor is not about stopping the critic entirely, but about creating a small space for self-compassion and connection to your values. Remember, this is a tiny anchor, not a magic solution. The focus is on the small act, not the outcome.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try whispering it during brief breaks, but I’m already wiped and I keep worrying I’ll forget and then just beat myself up for forgetting. What exactly counts as a “brief break” — two seconds, five? If there literally isn’t a break, is mouthing it or thinking it okay? And honestly, how is whispering this actually supposed to stop the critic replaying my mistakes later?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: **during your next brief break from wiping plates or handling a task that feels stressful**, whisper the phrase "I've got this" to yourself. A brief break is simply a moment when you take a pause from the task, no matter how short – 2 seconds, 5 seconds, or more. If there isn't a break, mouthing or thinking the phrase is okay too. This anchor is not about stopping the critic entirely, but about creating a small moment of self-compassion to help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. Remember, this is a temporary experiment – we're not trying to solve the critic's loop, just create a small space for self-awareness.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try whispering it during the next brief break, but I’m already wiped and my head’s jittery so I’ll probably forget half the time. Can we make this realistic — like a target of 2–3 whispers per shift so it’s not dozens of times? And if I’m non-stop, mouthing it is okay, right — will that actually do anything for the critic that keeps replaying mistakes later, or is this just another thing I’ll beat myself up for forgetting?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: **whisper "I've got this" to yourself 2-3 times during your next shift**, focusing on brief breaks from wiping plates or handling a task that feels stressful. If you're non-stop, mouthing the phrase is okay too. This anchor is not about stopping the critic entirely, but about creating a small moment of self-compassion to help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. Remember, this is a low-stakes experiment – we're not trying to solve the critic's loop, just create a small space for self-awareness. If you forget, that's okay. Just acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the present moment.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try whispering “I’ve got this” 2–3 times per shift, but honestly I’m already wiped and I know I’ll forget. Do you want them at specific moments—like one during a stressful pause and one after service—or just whenever I remember? If I miss them, do I still do the one-line jot afterward? And seriously, how is whispering this supposed to help the critic that keeps replaying my mistakes later?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: **whisper "I've got this" 2-3 times during your shift**, whenever it feels like you need it – during a stressful pause, after service, or whenever you remember. If you miss one, you still do the one-line jot afterward. This anchor is not about stopping the critic entirely, but about creating a small moment of self-compassion to help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. Whispering "I've got this" is not a magic solution, but rather a tiny reminder that you've got this – even when you forget. By doing the one-line jot afterward, you're creating a small space for self-awareness and connection to your values, which can help you move forward even when you miss the whisper.

Patient: Alright… I’ll try the 2–3 whispers and the one-line jot after shifts for two weeks, but I’m already wiped and I know I’ll forget a lot. Quick questions — do you want the jot right as I clock out or is later that night okay? If I miss a whisper or a day, does that screw up the experiment? And honestly, how is whispering twice a shift supposed to make the critic stop replaying my mistakes later — seems like a tiny thing that won’t stick.

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: **write down the one-line jot as soon as you can after your shift**, even if it's 30 minutes, 1 hour, or later that night. Don't worry about missing a whisper or a day – just acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the present moment. Whispering twice a shift might seem like a small thing, but it's not about changing the critic's voice; it's about creating a small space for self-awareness that can help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. By doing the one-line jot, you're anchoring the phrase "I've got this" to your values and creating a tangible connection to your worth – even if the whisper itself doesn't stick.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try to do the jot within an hour after a shift and use my phone so I don’t have to carry stuff, but I’m already jittery about forgetting. What counts as a double shift or day off — one jot per shift still, or do I do one for the whole day? And can we set a realistic fallback if I miss a bunch (like a single weekly recap), because I’ll probably beat myself up otherwise. Also, seriously — how is this actually supposed to stop the critic replaying mistakes later?

Therapist: For the next 2 weeks, commit to this: **write down the one-line jot once per shift**, even if you have a double shift or day off. Don't worry about the entire day – just focus on one shift at a time. If you miss a jot, that's okay. For each missed jot, **commit to doing a brief weekly recap** (e.g., 5-10 minutes) the next day to acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the present moment. This recap is not about changing the past; it's about creating a small space for self-awareness that can help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. As for stopping the critic's replay, this experiment is not about erasing the critic entirely; it's about creating a small space for self-compassion that can help you move forward even when the critic shows up. By doing the jot and recap, you're anchoring the phrase "I've got this" to your values and creating a tangible connection to your worth – even if the whisper itself doesn't stick.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the one-jot-per-shift and the weekly recap, but I’m already wiped just thinking about it. Quick things: the weekly recap—do you want it written or can it be a voice memo? And if I’m blank on a jot, give me a couple of ready-made example lines I can use so I don’t stall (like “kept calm at rush” or “sauce hit right”). Also… I still don’t get how this actually gets at the critic that replays everything — what am I supposed to notice in the recap that would make a dent in that loop?

Therapist: For the weekly recap, **write it down** in a journal or on your phone. This will help you reflect on your shifts and jot without distractions. If you're blank on a jot, **use these ready-made example lines**:

* "Stayed calm during a chaotic moment" (when you handled a difficult customer or situation)
* "Focused on the plate, not the crowd" (when you stayed present and attentive)
* "Kept my cool under pressure" (when you maintained your composure despite stress)

These lines are not about changing the critic's voice; they're about acknowledging the small moments of self-awareness that can help you shift your focus from mistakes to what you can do next. When you do the weekly recap, **look for the tiny threads of self-compassion** that emerged during the shift. These might be small actions, thoughts, or physical sensations that showed up when you handled a challenging situation. Notice how those threads made you feel – less stuck, more connected to your values, or more confident. By noticing these tiny threads, you're creating a small space for self-awareness that can help you break the critic's loop.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to write the weekly recap, but I’m already wiped just thinking about it. Can we make the recap something I can actually do when I’m tired: three short bullets per week (1 line per shift if I manage it) — 1) the tiny win, 2) one-word how it felt, 3) one thing I want to notice next shift? That feels doable instead of a paragraph.

Also give me two more ready-made jot lines I can paste when I’m blank. And tell me one concrete question to ask myself during the recap that actually targets the critic (not vague stuff) — like something that helps me see a pattern that contradicts “I’m worthless.” I’m skeptical this will stop the replaying at night, but I’ll try the bullets and the weekly sentence fallback if I miss too much.

Therapist: For the weekly recap, **try this 3-bullet system**:

* **Tiny Win**: Write down one small thing that went well during the shift (e.g., "made a great sauce" or "stayed calm during a chaotic moment").
* **One-Word Emotion**: Write down one word that describes how you felt during the shift (e.g., "grateful" or "frustrated").
* **Next Shift**: Write down one thing you want to notice or do differently next shift (e.g., "pay attention to my breathing" or "ask for help when needed").

When you're blank, **use these two ready-made jot lines**:

* "Kept my cool under pressure" (when you handled a difficult situation)
* "Focused on the plate, not the crowd" (when you stayed present and attentive)

During the recap, **ask yourself this question**:

"What would the critic say if I noticed the exact moment I started to doubt myself?" (e.g., "What would they say if I saw that 'I'm not good enough' thought pop up right before I messed up?" This helps you see how the critic's voice contradicts your values and creates a pattern that you can challenge.)

Patient: Okay… I’ll try the three-bullet recap — that feels doable. But that question about “what would the critic say” worries me: doesn’t naming it just give it more ammo and make me ruminate? How is that supposed to help me challenge it instead of just hearing it louder at night? Can you give me 2–3 concrete examples of critic lines I might notice and a short way to jot a response that actually pushes back, so I don’t just stew over it?

Therapist: When you notice critic lines, **try these 2-3 examples**:

* "You're such a failure for messing up that sauce" -> **Jot**: "That sauce was hard, but I learned from it. I can try again tomorrow."
* "You're not good enough to work in this kitchen" -> **Jot**: "I've worked hard to get here, and my team trusts me. I'll focus on what I can control."
* "You're just like all the others, always making mistakes" -> **Jot**: "I'm not just one mistake, I've made progress since last week. That matters."

Notice how these responses **acknowledge the thought, then gently push back** by adding context, reframing the thought, or focusing on what you can control. This helps you challenge the critic's narrative without getting stuck in rumination.

Patient: Okay… those rebuttals are a bit better, but they still feel too wordy for when I’m wiped or spiraling. Can you give me 4 ultra-short, kitchen-friendly one-liners I can jot fast (like one or two words) that actually feel like something I’d say — not cheesy — and a single, concrete rule for the weekly recap that keeps me from ruminating (how is that supposed to help if I just rehash things?). 

And when the critic’s replaying at night and I can’t sleep, give me one 30-second thing I can actually do that might blunt the loop enough to get rest. I’m skeptical, but I’ll try.
