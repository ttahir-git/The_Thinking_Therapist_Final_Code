Patient: I'm a chef in my early thirties, been dealing with social anxiety and job instability, and lately I'm stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism whenever something goes sideways. My mind is like a faulty fortune-telling machine that immediately predicts the worst—one bad shift or one argument and I see myself fired, homeless, and alone forever. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop believing those stories and they feel inevitable to me.

Therapist: When you say "I see myself fired, homeless, and alone forever," what's one specific thing you do or one small action you've taken in the past that still feels connected to that possibility, even though it might not be working out right now?

Patient: I bailed on a trial shift once — told them I was sick and left because I froze under the pressure. Now I don't apply to places because I'm certain I'll do the same thing, get branded as unreliable, get fired after one screw-up, lose my savings, and end up not being able to pay rent. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't picture any other realistic chain of events.

Therapist: You mentioned the trial shift where you froze under pressure – what's one tiny thing you could do differently in a similar situation now, just to make room for taking that risk again?

Patient: I could call ahead and be honest that I'm nervous and ask for a shorter, low-pressure trial or to start with simple prep work instead of right in the middle of service. But honestly, even if I do that, they'll mark me as fragile, I’ll still freeze when it matters, they’ll stop trusting me, I’ll get canned, lose my savings, and then everything spirals — I can't picture any other realistic outcome.

Therapist: That thought about being marked as "fragile" feels like a story you're telling yourself – what if that label wasn't true? What would it be like to show up to that trial shift with a small, honest risk, even if it felt scary?

Patient: I could try that — call ahead and ask for simpler tasks — but honestly my brain immediately goes to the worst: they label me fragile, I choke during service, they replace me, I lose my savings, and I'm out on the street. I know it sounds paranoid, I just can't picture any other ending right now.

Therapist: What's the value that's most important to you right now – being able to pay rent, or something else? When you imagine losing your savings, what's the thought that's really driving that fear – is it that you'll be able to take care of yourself, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's about stability — being able to pay rent and not having to scramble for a place to sleep. But underneath that, the fear driving it is shame and worthlessness: losing my savings would feel like proof that I'm unreliable and broken, that people (and partners) will bail on me, and that I'll end up abandoned and alone — I can't picture any other realistic outcome.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to be able to pay rent without needing to scramble for a place to sleep – is it about having freedom to pursue opportunities, being able to show up for yourself and others, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's about stability and not feeling like I'm one mistake away from collapse — being able to pay rent would feel like some basic proof I can keep myself together. But even that turns into a test in my head: if I slip once, it proves I'm unreliable, they pull support, I lose the job, the savings, and I'm back on the street and alone — I can't imagine any other realistic outcome.

Therapist: When you imagine yourself losing the job, savings, and being on the street, what's one tiny thought that's driving that fear – is it "I'm not good enough" or "I'll never be able to take care of myself"?

Patient: It's "I'm not good enough." The tiniest slip becomes proof to my brain that I'm unreliable — so they fire me, people bail, my savings evaporate, and I'm alone on the street, and I just can't picture any other ending.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to be good enough – not just to others, but to yourself – if you were able to take that one step into the unknown trial shift? What would you be holding onto – is it hope, self-worth, or something else?

Patient: I guess "good enough" would mean holding onto a tiny sliver of proof that I'm not completely broken — something I could point to when the self-hate kicks in. It would feel like maybe I deserve stability and I'm not just a walking disaster. But even picturing that, my brain immediately says it's meaningless — they'll still call me fragile and it'll all collapse.

Therapist: What if that "sliver of proof" wasn't about convincing anyone else, but about convincing yourself – what would that look like?

Patient: Maybe it's something stupidly small — like one completed trial shift I can point to, a pay stub, or a note I write that says "you showed up today." Something that's just for me to prove I didn't totally implode. But even if I had that, my head says it's a fluke they'll see through it, label me fragile, and everything still collapses — so I can't see it actually convincing me.

Therapist: What is it about writing that note ("you showed up today") that feels like it matters to you – is it about honoring your own courage, acknowledging the tiny step forward, or something else?

Patient: Because right now I have nothing concrete to hold onto except these catastrophic stories, that note would be a tiny, private piece of evidence that I actually showed up and didn't implode. It's about honoring that sliver of courage for myself so when the self-hate starts I can point to something real. But even saying that, my brain jumps to: it's a fluke, they'll see me as fragile, I'll choke later, lose the job and savings, and end up back on the street — so it still feels pretty useless.

Therapist: What if, instead of waiting for the note to "prove" something, you simply wrote it and then... what?

Patient: I'd write it, stick it on the fridge or my mirror, and read it before a shift so there's at least one tiny, real thing to point to. But honestly, even if I did that, my brain would call it a fluke, I'd still choke during service, they'd label me fragile, I'd get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street — I can't see any other ending. I don't know what would break that loop; it just keeps replaying the same disaster story and it makes me feel stuck.

Therapist: What's the physical sensation in your body right now when you're imagining yourself stuck in this disaster story – is it tension in your shoulders, a knot in your stomach, or a heaviness in your chest?

Patient: My chest feels like it's being squeezed, there's a knot in my stomach and my hands get clammy — my breathing gets shallow and my jaw tenses up. When my body does that, it feels like proof the disaster is already happening, so the worst-case story just gets louder and more real. I get overwhelmed by it and then stuck, like there's no way out of that loop.

Therapist: When your chest feels squeezed and your jaw tenses, what if, instead of believing that's proof the disaster is happening, you simply noticed it as a physical sensation – without judgment or story?

Patient: I can try to just notice it—call it "tight chest" or "clenched jaw"—but honestly when I do that my brain just treats the sensations as proof the disaster's already happening and the worst-case story gets louder. It feels like labeling it won't stop the predictions; I don't know how noticing would actually change anything, and that makes me frustrated and stuck.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to notice the physical sensations as "just a tight chest" without the story of the disaster – what small, concrete thing might you be willing to try or notice in that moment that feels like a tiny step towards changing the loop?

Patient: I could try something tiny: put my hand on my chest, take three slow, deliberate breaths, and quietly say to myself "tight chest" to name the feeling. I'll try that, but honestly my brain will still read the sensation as proof the disaster's already started — they'll call me fragile, I'll choke during service, get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street. I'm frustrated and overwhelmed by how stuck this feels—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: What's one tiny, tiny thing that's actually happening in your body or mind right now, without any story or judgment – is it just the sensation of your breath moving in and out, or something else entirely?

Patient: Right now it's just my breath—shallow, mostly in my chest—and my heart is thudding. There's a tightness under my sternum and a little metallic taste, but the minute I notice any of it my brain turns it into proof the disaster's already happening, and I get stuck and frustrated.

Therapist: When you notice the metallic taste, instead of saying "I'm going to get fired", what if you simply labeled it – "metallic taste" – without any story or judgment?

Patient: I can say "metallic taste," and I do—but within a second my brain turns it into "that's the panic before I mess up, they'll call me fragile, I'll get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street." I'm trying to notice it without the story, but I'm stuck and overwhelmed by how fast the disaster train starts up—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: When you notice the metallic taste, before your brain starts the "disaster story", what if you simply held onto the sensation for one tiny breath – just the sensation of the taste, without trying to label it or change it – and then, if you felt like it, you could say "metallic taste" to yourself?

Patient: Okay—I tried it. I held the metallic taste for one slow breath, felt it like a cold weight on my tongue and my chest tightened, and I whispered "metallic taste," but before the exhale was done my brain had already run the whole movie: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street. I'm trying to do the exercise but it just feels useless when the disaster train starts so fast—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: When you notice the metallic taste, before you say "metallic taste", what if you simply held onto it for the space of a single heartbeat – just the sensation of the taste, without trying to label it, without thinking about it, without even noticing it as "metallic taste" – just the sensation itself?

Patient: I tried holding it for one heartbeat — a cold, flat taste and my heart jumped. Before I could even notice it properly the whole movie was on: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke, get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street. I'm jittery and scattered and it's getting hard to slow the train down — can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: Before you noticed the metallic taste, what was your body doing?

Patient: I was basically holding my breath, shoulders hunched, jaw tight and my hands clenched—like ready to bolt. As soon as my body did that my brain spun the movie: I'm already failing, they'll mark me fragile, I'll choke during service, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street. I'm jittery and distracted right now — can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: What is your body doing right now, without trying to change it or label it?

Patient: My breathing's shallow, my chest's tight, shoulders hunched, jaw locked, and my hands won't stop fiddling with my sleeves—my eyes keep darting like I'm ready to bolt. The moment I notice any of it my brain's already playing the whole disaster: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke, get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street. I'm feeling jittery and really scattered—can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your fingers fidgeting with your sleeves, without trying to stop it or change it – just the feeling of the fingers moving, the sensation of the fabric, without judgment.

Patient: They're doing that weird little picking at the cuff thing—fingertips rubbing the fabric, a tiny, repetitive tug like I'm trying to anchor myself. But the second I feel it, my brain turns it into proof the panic's already won: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke during service, get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street. I'm jittery and scattered and it's getting hard to keep doing these exercises—can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your fingers picking at the cuff, without trying to change it or label it as "trying to anchor yourself" – just the feeling of the fingers moving, the sensation of the fabric, without judgment.

Patient: They're doing that repetitive little rub—fingertips dragging the cuff, a tiny tug that kind of repeats without me realizing. But the second I feel it my head's already racing: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke in service, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street. I'm jittery and scattered—can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your fingers dragging the cuff, without trying to understand what it means or what it's "doing" – just the physical sensation of your fingers moving, the feeling of the fabric, the sensation of the touch.

Patient: It's a thin, slightly rough pull under my fingertips—little catches and releases, a steady, automatic tug I hardly notice until I focus on it. But the second I feel it my head's already sprinting: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke in service, get fired, lose my savings, and end up on the street. I'm jittery and scattered—can we actually slow down a bit?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your fingers dragging the cuff, and then pause for just a tiny breath before thinking – just breathe, without trying to change anything, without trying to push the thought away.

Patient: I tried to pause and take that tiny breath—my chest jumped, my breathing stayed shallow, and my fingers kept tugging the cuff—but before the exhale was done my brain was already on full replay: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke in service, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street. I'm really jittery and scattered right now—can we actually slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your chest jumping, without trying to change it or stop it – just the feeling of your chest moving, the sensation of your breath staying shallow. Where else in your body is noticing this tension, without trying to fix it?

Patient: My shoulders are locked, my jaw's clenched, there's a knot in my stomach and a hollow heaviness under my ribs, and my hands are twitchy—fingers still picking at the cuff. The second I feel any of it my brain flips to the disaster movie— they'll call me fragile, I'll choke, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street—so I can't seem to slow it down. I'm really jittery and scattered right now; can we actually slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your shoulders locking, without trying to relax them or fix it – just the feeling of your shoulders being tight, the sensation of your breath staying shallow. Where is the knot in your stomach, exactly? Is it a hard lump or a soft ache?

Patient: It's a hard, tight ball right under my ribs, a bit to the left—like something clenched and won't let go. It feels cold and tense and as soon as I notice it my brain screams the whole movie: they'll call me fragile, I'll choke, get fired, lose my savings, end up on the street. I'm jittery and scattered and it's getting really hard to sit with this—can we slow down a bit?
