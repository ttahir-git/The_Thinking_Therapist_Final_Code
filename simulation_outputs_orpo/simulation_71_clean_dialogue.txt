Patient: I've been feeling really stuck lately — like my whole life is just this unemployed label and I don't know what matters beyond that. The breakup made it worse and my self-esteem is shot, and I keep asking myself what I'm even trying for. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything?

Therapist: What's one thing you've been holding onto by identifying yourself as "unemployed" that feels like it's not truly you? Is it the idea that you're not good enough, or maybe that you're not capable of pursuing your passions?

Patient: Probably the "not good enough" thing — like I'm reduced to this failure label and it makes me doubt trying anything new. It bleeds into thinking I'm not capable of pursuing my passions because what if I can't pull it off? But honestly, how is naming that supposed to help? I've tried reframing and pep talks before and it just doesn't stick.

Therapist: What would happen if, for just one small moment, you let go of the need to prove yourself as "good enough"? What would show up instead of that fear when you stop trying to control the outcome?

Patient: Maybe for a split second I'd feel a weird relief — like my chest loosens and there's this quiet I don't trust. Then probably emptiness or numbness shows up, and I start panicking because I don't know what to do with that calm. How is noticing that supposed to help me actually change things? I'm skeptical, but maybe if we poked at that quiet something could come of it.

Therapist: What if the calm you're avoiding is actually a chance to connect with what matters most to you, even if it doesn't feel like it right now? Can you imagine doing one small thing that feels connected to your values, even if it's just for a tiny step – not because it feels good, but because it matters?

Patient: Maybe I could try something tiny—like ten minutes of drawing or writing each morning, not to build a career but just because it feels like mine. But I've done little goals before and they fizzle or make me feel worse when I don't stick to them—how is that supposed to actually get me unstuck? Still, I guess I could try it for a few days and pay attention to that quiet instead of panicking right away.

Therapist: What's the thought that's keeping you from letting that quiet be what it is – like, "I'll fail" or "I'm wasting time"? Can you see how that thought is actually trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, even though vulnerability is what's needed for connection?

Patient: It's basically the "I'll fail" and "I'm wasting time" thought — like this voice that turns any little try into proof I'm useless. I can see it's trying to protect me: if I don't risk doing something, I don't have to face rejection or shame, so avoiding feels safer even though it keeps me stuck. But honestly, how is naming that going to stop the panic when the quiet shows up? Maybe it makes it a bit less loud, but I'm not convinced that's enough unless there's something concrete to actually change my behavior.

Therapist: What concrete step would you take right now – just this moment – to test the quiet against the "I'll fail" voice when it shows up? For example, would you commit to writing for 5 minutes without stopping to think about it, or draw something even if it's not "good"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try five minutes of free writing right now, timer on, no editing, just whatever shows up. If the "I'll fail" voice pops up, I'll write that down instead of stopping. I don't expect it to fix things, but maybe it'll show whether the quiet actually lasts longer than the panic — and I'm already nervous about doing it.

Therapist: What would happen if, instead of trying to stop the panic, you just acknowledged the "I'll fail" voice as it shows up, like "Okay, 'I'll fail' is showing up – where is it in my body right now?" – without trying to change it or fight it?

Patient: Yeah — if I actually did that, I notice the "I'll fail" voice as a tightness in my chest and this sinking knot in my stomach, sometimes a lump in my throat. Naming it might make it feel less like a roaring monster and more like background noise, but usually paying attention just makes me hyper-aware and I start spiraling. Still, I could try saying where it lives instead of fighting it — though honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from freezing up when it gets loud?

Therapist: What's the value that's at stake for you when you let the "I'll fail" voice show up – not in terms of what you do about it, but in terms of what it means for you in this moment?

Patient: I guess what's at stake is my sense of worth — like whether I deserve care or I'm just a failure people will write off. Letting that voice in means admitting I'm vulnerable and not in control, and that scares me because then I might be seen as nothing beyond unemployed. I get that naming it might make it smaller, but how is that actually supposed to protect me?

Therapist: What's the one thing that being seen as worthy of care matters to you – not what you do, not what you're good at, but what it means to be seen by others that you're worthy of care?

Patient: That it would mean I'm not invisible — someone would care about me for who I am, not for a job or what I can produce. I want that, but I don't know if saying it out loud changes anything.

Therapist: What would happen if, for just a tiny moment – 5 seconds – you allowed yourself to believe that you're worthy of care, without trying to control what happens next? Would you notice anything different in your body or mind?

Patient: Maybe for five seconds my shoulders would drop a little and the knot in my stomach would loosen — there's this tiny warmth like maybe someone noticed me. Then the mistrust jumps in, like "this won't last" — I can try to hold that feeling for a few seconds, but honestly how is that supposed to change anything long-term?

Therapist: What would happen if you let go of the need to hold onto the fear that "this won't last" – just for one tiny step, like taking a deep breath in without trying to control the outcome? Would the warmth and sense of connection come back, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Okay... I take a breath. For a few seconds my shoulders drop and that little warmth shows up, like maybe someone noticed me. Then the "this won't last" voice slips back in and it shrinks. I could try holding that feeling longer, but I don't see how that fixes the bigger stuff.

Therapist: What if the warmth and sense of connection weren't about fixing the fear, but about what they reveal about your values – what would that look like for you, and how might that shift the way you show up in your life?

Patient: It would mean I care about being seen — not for what I do, but that someone notices the person behind the label, and that small creative things actually matter to me. If I tried to show up like that, it'd look like tiny habits (drawing, replying to a friend, admitting I'm struggling) instead of waiting for some big proof — but saying that also pulls up this old shame and I get mad at myself and want to hide. I’m not sure how that actually lasts, though — how do I keep from getting stuck in the shame when I try to do the small stuff?

Therapist: What if the shame wasn't trying to protect you from getting hurt, but from feeling seen – what would that look like for you right now? What would happen if you let go of the need to hide from that feeling, even if it feels like it's going to make you feel vulnerable?

Patient: It makes me shrink and quiet—like I put on a mask so nobody sees the messy, unfixable part. Letting go would feel exposed, raw, like I'd want to bolt, and that old shame floods me so fast I can barely breathe. Maybe being seen would mean I don't have to keep proving myself, but honestly, how is sitting with that supposed to stop me from curling up and hiding when it hits? I could try to stay with it, but I don't know how to stop the panic that comes next.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to avoid the shame, you could bear the discomfort of being seen, even if it feels like it's going to break you – what would that mean for your body, your breath, and the tiny habits that matter to you right now?

Patient: I guess if I tried to bear it my breath might slow a bit after the panic, but at first my chest would clamp and I'd feel shaky and exposed — like I want to disappear. The tiny habits would look like forcing myself to sit and draw for ten minutes, or just text one friend back, even if I hate how vulnerable that feels. But honestly, how is bearing this supposed to stop that old shame from flattening me the minute I try those small things?

Therapist: What if the shame wasn't protecting you from being hurt, but from being seen as not enough – what would happen if you could let go of the need for that protection, and just be present with your tiny habits, even if they feel vulnerable?

Patient: Maybe if I let that protection go I could actually do the small stuff — draw for ten minutes, text someone back — without the panic starting. But the shame still floods me and I end up frozen or hiding, and I don't know how staying present stops it from flattening whatever tiny progress I make. How is being present supposed to keep that old shame from just swallowing the moment every time it shows up?

Therapist: What if being present meant noticing the shame as it shows up – not as a thing to be fixed, but as a sensation in the body, a thought in the mind – and allowing it to be what it is, without trying to push it away or use it as a reason to hide?

Patient: Okay — I can try to notice it: the tightness in my chest, the hollow pull in my stomach, the voice that says I should disappear. But when I do that my head starts racing and I get flooded and start blaming myself, so I don't see how just "noticing" stops me from folding up and hiding. I can try to let it be, but honestly — how is that supposed to get me out of the freeze when it hits?

Therapist: What if, when the shame shows up, you met it by simply noticing its physical sensation in your body – the tightness in your chest, the hollow pull in your stomach – without trying to change it or push it away? What would happen if you met it with kindness, curiosity, and openness, rather than trying to avoid it?

Patient: I can try that — notice the tightness in my chest and the hollow in my stomach and quietly label it, like “that’s shame” or “that’s fear.” But when I do, my head races and the kindness feels fake and I just start blaming myself again, so I don’t see how noticing actually stops the flood. Can you give me one very concrete thing to do in the moment — like a phrase to say or a breathing pattern — that I can actually remember when it hits?

Therapist: What if, when the shame shows up, you said to yourself: "I've got this" – just one word – as you breathe out? The goal isn't to mean it, but to actually say it, even when the head starts racing. Try it now, in this moment, with the shame: "I've got this"

Patient: Okay... I’ll try it on the out-breath: "I've got this." For a second my shoulders loosened, then this hot shame shot up and my throat tightened and my head started listing every screw-up. Saying it felt fake and didn't stop the flood — how is that supposed to help? If that doesn't work, tell me one simple physical thing or a short phrase I can actually do in the moment when the shame spikes so I don't just freeze.

Therapist: When the shame hits and your head starts racing, try this: notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just that – the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Without trying to change it, just notice it.

Patient: Okay — I tried that. My feet felt heavy on the floor, pressure under my heels and a cold patch by my toes, and for a couple breaths my head quieted and my shoulders eased. Then that hot shame shot up and my chest clenched and I started replaying every screw-up. How is just noticing the feet supposed to stop that spike — give me one more tiny, concrete thing I can actually do in the moment so I don't just freeze.

Therapist: When the shame spikes, notice the sensation of your chest rising and falling with your breath. Then, without changing your breath, subtly curl your fingers inward toward your palms. Just that – the tiny movement of curling your fingers inward.

Patient: I tried curling my fingers. For a breath or two my shoulders eased and my breath felt a tiny bit steadier, then that hot shame shot up, my chest clamped, and my head started listing every screw‑up. It helps for a second but doesn't stop the spike—how is curling fingers supposed to keep me from freezing, and give me one more tiny thing I can actually do in the moment that won't feel fake or make me want to bolt?

Therapist: When the shame spikes and your head starts listing every screw-up, notice the sensation of your toes on the ground again. This time, instead of just noticing it, try to wiggle your toes slightly – just a tiny movement, like a tiny toe twitch.

Patient: I tried wiggling my toes — for a beat it grounded me, like a tiny break from the rush, but then that hot shame shot up and my chest clenched and my head started replaying every screw‑up. It helps for a second but doesn't stop the flood—what's one more tiny, physical thing I can do in the moment that might actually hold a little longer?

Therapist: When the shame spikes, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Then, without thinking, take a tiny breath in through your nose and out through your mouth – just a tiny, slow inhale and exhale.

Patient: I tried a tiny inhale and slow exhale. For a beat it eased, then the hot shame shot up, my chest clenched, and my head started listing every screw‑up—it feels like a pause button, not a stop. What’s one simple, concrete thing I can do in the moment that might actually hold a little longer, because honestly how is this supposed to help when the flood comes back and I feel so drained?

Therapist: When the shame spikes, notice that your chest is still moving in and out with your breath. Instead of trying to stop the thoughts, try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body – just that. Don't try to change it, just observe it.

Patient: Okay — I tried noticing my chest moving. For a beat it grounded me, then that hot shame shot up and my head started replaying every screw‑up. I don't have the energy for little pauses that evaporate — how is just observing my breath supposed to stop the flood? Give me one simple, concrete thing I can actually do in the moment that might hold longer than a second, because I keep freezing and I need something that sticks.

Therapist: When the shame spikes, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Instead of just noticing it, take one tiny step forward with one foot – just a small step, just one foot.

Patient: I tried it — a tiny step forward. For a beat my weight shifted and my shoulders loosened a little, but then that hot shame shot up and my chest clenched and my head started listing every screw‑up like clockwork. It helps for a second and then I'm back to wanting to disappear — so honestly, how is one step supposed to keep me from bolting? Give me one simple thing I can actually do in the moment that might hold longer than a breath or a twitch.

Therapist: When the shame spikes, instead of just taking one tiny step forward, try to take two tiny steps forward – just two small steps, one after the other.

Patient: I tried the two tiny steps — my weight shifted and for a second my shoulders eased, but then that hot shame rushed back, my chest tightened, and my head started replaying every screw‑up. It helps for a beat and then I'm right back to wanting to disappear. Honestly, how is two steps supposed to hold me when the flood comes? Give me one simple, concrete thing I can actually do in the moment that might stick longer than a second, because I'm running out of energy for pauses that evaporate.

Therapist: When the shame spikes, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – not just the sensation, but the actual physical sensation of your feet touching the ground, like the weight of your feet on the floor, the feeling of the floor beneath your feet, or the sensation of your feet making contact with the ground. Stay with that sensation for a moment, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: I tried — stayed with the weight of my feet and felt a tiny steadiness, then that hot shame shot up, my chest clamped, and my head started listing every screw‑up. It gives me a beat but it always evaporates and I don't have the energy for pauses that vanish. Tell me one concrete thing I can actually do in the moment that might hold longer than a second, something simple I won't forget when the panic hits.
