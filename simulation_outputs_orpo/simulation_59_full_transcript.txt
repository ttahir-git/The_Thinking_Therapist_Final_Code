--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I get really anxious in social situations, so I avoid gatherings with friends and mostly rely on myself. Being an artist and dealing with PTSD and job instability has made it harder to be around people and I'm feeling pretty stuck. I don't know, I guess talking about it feels uncomfortable, but I wanted to try.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express feeling "stuck" with anxiety in social situations, linked to PTSD and job instability as underlying themes. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Explore the tangible context of "stuck" to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of being stuck and anxious in social situations sounds really draining. When you say you avoid gatherings with friends and mostly rely on yourself, what's one specific thing you miss about being around others - something that feels valued to you?

Patient: I guess I miss the little, ordinary things — someone noticing my work or laughing at a dumb joke, just feeling seen. I don't know, it's hard to put into words, but those moments made me feel like I wasn't just... invisible.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a core value of feeling "seen" and connected with others, linked to moments of shared experience (noticing work, laughing at jokes) that made you feel less invisible. Goal: Connect this value to a specific, valued action (e.g., taking small steps towards socializing).

Therapist Answer:
Those small moments of connection feel like a lifeline, don't they? What would it take for you to notice someone laughing at a joke you told, even if it was just in a small group - would it be okay to say hello to a friend first, or just attend one gathering this month?

Patient: I guess saying hello or sending a short message might be doable — I don't know if I could handle a whole gathering. Maybe I could try showing up for just a little while, or agree to stay near the door so I can leave if it gets too much. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about it, can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to start small with a low-stakes action (saying hello, sending a message, staying near the door), but feeling overwhelmed when thinking about bigger steps (whole gatherings). Goal: Introduce defusion by acknowledging the thought "it's overwhelming" without acting on it.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of overwhelm is just a thought, like a cloud passing by - it doesn't have to dictate what we do. What would happen if, for just one minute, you focused on your breath while thinking about showing up for that gathering - would it make the thought less sticky?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I focus on my breath the panic dulls for a bit, like it's not as sharp. But it doesn't last — the worry sneaks back and I start thinking of excuses to leave. I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that focusing on breath helps dull the panic, but it doesn't last - the worry creeps back in. Goal: Introduce a small defusion technique to work with the thought "I'm overwhelmed" rather than against it.

Therapist Answer:
When that thought "I'm overwhelmed" shows up, what if you gently labeled it as "overwhelmed" - just noticed it, like a phrase on a piece of paper - without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess labeling it as "overwhelmed" might make it feel a little less sharp for a moment. But then I start thinking about leaving early and worrying they'll call me flaky or rude, and that feeling comes back. It's kind of embarrassing to say out loud—can we maybe talk about what to say to a friend if I only stay a little while? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to explore what to say to a friend if you only stay a little while, which is a small step towards committed action. Core emotion is vulnerability, linked to fear of judgment. Goal: Connect the willingness to stay for a short time to a valued action, not just avoiding embarrassment.

Therapist Answer:
When you say you're feeling overwhelmed, you might say something like, "Hey, I'm really grateful to be here, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed - can we grab a snack/coffee outside for a bit?" - how does that sound?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that line sounds okay on paper, but saying it out loud feels awkward and obvious. I'm worried they'll think I'm being flaky or making excuses and I'll just freeze. Can we practice a few different ways to say it if someone asks why I need to step out? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're worried about how others might interpret your words, linked to fear of being judged. Goal: Practice small, authentic responses that connect to your value of staying a short time without using phrases that might trigger avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a few small responses together. When someone asks why you need to step out, what if you simply say, "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now, can I take a break?" or "I'm not feeling my best today, can I step outside for a bit?" - how do those feel?

Patient: I don't know... I guess they sound okay on paper but saying "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" out loud makes me feel exposed and obvious. Maybe something shorter would be easier, like "I'm going to step outside for a minute"—less to explain. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we practice that one first?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a shorter phrase that feels more manageable, linked to a desire to avoid exposing yourself. Goal: Practice using that phrase in a low-stakes context to build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it in a quiet moment - when you're not feeling overwhelmed, but you're still in this conversation. Can you say "I'm going to step outside for a minute" and then take a deep breath - how does that feel?

Patient: "I'm going to step outside for a minute."

I don't know... I guess saying it out loud made my chest tighten and felt awkward, like I was admitting something. The deep breath helped a little — it eased the edge for a moment — but then the worry popped back up and I started imagining them thinking I'm flaky. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and maybe try a couple more shorter lines?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've practiced saying "I'm going to step outside for a minute" and it still triggered tension, linked to fear of being judged. Goal: Explore even shorter phrases to reduce the mental load.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try just one word - "Outside" - what if you simply say that without explanation, just to get the words out?

Patient: "Outside."

I don't know... I guess saying it felt weird, like admitting something, and my chest tightened. It helped a bit, but then I started worrying they'd think I was flaky — I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensation of tension and the thought pattern that followed, linked to avoidance. Goal: Use defusion to notice the thought without acting on it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the thought "they'll think I'm flaky" as a thought - what would it look like if it were a cloud passing by, just a fleeting thought - can you observe it without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to watch it like a cloud it just gets louder instead of quieter. My chest tightens and I immediately start thinking they'll call me flaky, and then I want to leave. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're trying to defuse the thought, but it's getting stuck in a cycle of avoidance. Goal: Introduce a small physical anchor to interrupt the cycle before the thought gets louder.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that thought "they'll think I'm flaky" getting louder, notice the sensation in your chest - can you touch it lightly, just with your finger, for a second before the thought takes over?

Patient: I don't know... I tried touching my chest lightly like you said. It felt tight and sort of warm, my breath got quicker for a second, and it dimmed the thought a little but then the worry about being flaky came back. I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've practiced touching the physical sensation in your chest, and it helped interrupt the cycle of avoidance for a brief moment. Goal: Explore the small window of time when the thought dimmed to see what happens when you gently acknowledge it.

Therapist Answer:
When you felt the thought "they'll think I'm flaky" dim a bit, what would have happened if you simply said "that thought" without judgment - no action, just a gentle acknowledgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I said "that thought" out loud it'd make it feel less like me — I tried it in my head and it dulled the panic for a second. But then it felt a bit silly and the worry about being flaky crept back in. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small success in acknowledging the thought without judgment, but it triggered self-judgment ("it'd feel silly"). Goal: Connect this moment to a value, rather than the thought itself.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happened when you acknowledged the thought - it was a tiny step away from the panic. What value was at stake for you in taking that tiny step?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it mattered because I want to feel seen and not judged — some kind of connection and acceptance, and maybe a bit of safety too. Saying it out loud feels exposed, and I'm kind of getting overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the tiny step of acknowledging the thought to a core value of feeling seen, accepted, and safe. Goal: Use this value to anchor the moment, rather than the thought.

Therapist Answer:
Right now, when you feel overwhelmed, what would it mean to you to hold onto that value of feeling seen and accepted - even if the thought "they'll think I'm flaky" is still there?

Patient: I don't know... I guess holding onto that value would mean letting myself be vulnerable enough to stay a little longer, to let someone actually notice me instead of ducking out. It feels really scary — like I'm risking being judged, but it would mean choosing connection over hiding. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed saying this; can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the value of vulnerability as a choice that aligns with connection over hiding, and it's scary. Goal: Explore the physical sensations in your body when you think about staying a little longer, rather than fleeing.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical sensations in your body when you imagine staying a little longer - what does it feel like to hold onto that value of being seen, even if it's scary? Can you stay with that feeling, without judgment, for just a breath?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I picture staying a little longer my chest tightens, my shoulders hunch, my stomach knots and my breath gets shallow. There's a tiny, warm flicker — like maybe someone might notice me — but it's so faint and the panic rushes back and I suddenly want to leave. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations of tension and panic, and the tiny spark of possibility - the warm flicker. Goal: Notice the tiny spark, without judgment, and explore what it might mean for you to hold onto it.

Therapist Answer:
The warm flicker is a tiny spark of possibility - what would it mean to you to hold onto that spark, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean letting myself be vulnerable for a second — hoping someone might notice my work or my joke and it not feel like a fake thing. For me as an artist, that little spark feels like a bit of validation and not being invisible, but saying that out loud makes me tense. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the spark as a tiny validation for your art and a desire to be seen as an artist, and it's making you tense. Goal: Explore the tension in your body when you think about holding onto that spark, without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the tension in your body when you think about holding onto that spark - where do you feel it most? Can you bring your attention to that spot, without trying to change it, just to see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's mostly in my chest and a tight knot in my stomach. When I sit with it, this shame and frustration comes up — like some past screw‑up is pressuring me — and I just want to clamp down and disappear. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations of tension and the emotional charge of shame and frustration, linked to a past experience. Goal: Notice the thought "I want to clamp down and disappear" without judgment, and explore what it might mean to stay with the physical sensations instead.

Therapist Answer:
When you think "I want to clamp down and disappear," notice what happens in your body - what's the sensation of that thought? Can you stay with that sensation, even though the thought is trying to push you away, without trying to change it or push it away yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a heavy weight in my chest and a tight, burning knot in my stomach. My shoulders tense, my hands go cold, and there's this hot shame and frustrated heat that makes me want to clamp down and disappear. I try to stay with it but it just pushes me to pull away. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the sensation of the weight and knot, and the push to clamp down and disappear - it sounds like you're trying to escape the emotional pain. Goal: Explore the idea of "disappearing" as a thought, rather than a physical action.

Therapist Answer:
When you say "I want to disappear," notice what happens in your body when you imagine that thought - what does it feel like to imagine yourself disappearing, without actually doing it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess imagining disappearing makes me go kind of numb — my chest sinks, my stomach drops, and my voice feels thin like it's fading. My hands go cold and there's this hot shame and frustration that tightens my throat and makes me want to clamp up and run. I'm really feeling overwhelmed right now; can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the sensation of numbness and disconnection when imagining disappearing, and how it triggers shame and frustration. Goal: Notice the thought "I want to clamp up and run" without judgment, and explore what it might mean to stay with the physical sensations instead of the thought.

Therapist Answer:
When you think "I want to clamp up and run," notice what happens in your body - what's the sensation of that thought? Can you stay with that sensation, even though the thought is trying to push you away, without trying to change it or push it away yourself? What would it mean to simply be with that feeling, without trying to escape it?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to stay with it it just gets heavier — this hot shame and frustrated heat like something's pressing on my chest and I want to disappear. I don't want to hurt myself, I guess, but it makes me feel numb and useless and I feel really ashamed about that. I'm feeling really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're trying to stay with the physical sensations, but the shame and frustration are intensifying. Goal: Introduce a small act of kindness to yourself, rather than trying to escape the emotions.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the weight of shame and frustration, notice what you would do to a friend in this same moment - would you offer them kindness, or try to escape? Can you offer yourself the same kindness, even if it's just a tiny breath, a small gesture of kindness towards yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess offering myself kindness feels foreign, like some old failure is pressing on me and makes it hard to believe. I put my hand on my chest and took one slow breath — it eased the edge a little, but then the shame flared and I wanted to clamp up and disappear. I'm feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small step towards kindness, but the shame is still present. Goal: Explore the thought "I want to clamp up and disappear" without judgment, and notice what happens when you stay with the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
When you think "I want to clamp up and disappear," notice what's happening in your body - what sensations arise when you imagine that thought? Can you bring your attention to the physical sensations, without trying to change the thought? What would it mean to stay with the feeling of heaviness in your chest, rather than trying to push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I imagine staying with it the chest gets heavy, the knot in my stomach tightens and this hot shame prickles like a bruise. It feels embarrassing and angry at the same time — like that old screw‑up is sitting on my chest — and if I try to stay with it it just presses harder. Maybe staying would mean tolerating that awful heat long enough for it to lose some of its grip, but I'm really feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've vividly described the physical sensations of shame and anger, and how they feel like a weight on your chest. Goal: Introduce a small willingness to experiment with staying with the sensations, rather than pushing them away.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the thought "tolerating that awful heat" - what would it mean to tolerate the sensation of that heat, even if it feels like it's still pushing you away? Would it be just a tiny step, like holding your breath for one more second? Can you imagine doing that small step, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can imagine holding that one extra breath, like forcing myself to stay with the hot pressure for a second. When I try, the shame and frustration get louder — like a burning flush that makes me angry at myself for not being stronger. It helps a tiny bit, the grip loosens for a moment, but then it snaps back and I want to clamp up and disappear. I'm really feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small step towards experimenting with staying with the sensations, but the shame and frustration are still intense. Goal: Explore the thought "I want to clamp up and disappear" without judgment, and notice what happens when you stay with the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
When you think "I want to clamp up and disappear," notice what's happening in your body - what sensations arise when you imagine that thought? Can you bring your attention to the physical sensations, without trying to change the thought? What would it mean to stay with the feeling of the flush, rather than trying to push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess staying with the flush feels like letting that shame sit on my chest — it's hot and raw and makes me want to clamp up. When I try to breathe into it my shoulders hunch and my hands go cold; I can hold it for a breath or two but then the shame and frustrated heat spike and I want to run. I'm really feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the physical sensations of shame and frustration, and how they feel like a weight on your chest. Goal: Introduce a small act of kindness to yourself, rather than trying to push the shame away.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the thought "letting that shame sit on my chest" - what would it mean to simply acknowledge that feeling, without trying to change it? Can you imagine saying to yourself, "I'm feeling this shame right now," without judgment, just to acknowledge the physical sensation?

Patient: I tried saying "I'm feeling this shame right now" quietly to myself, and for a second my chest eased and my breath slowed. Then this sudden hot shame and frustration rushed back — my face got hot, my throat tightened, and I felt small and like I wanted to disappear. I don't know... I guess it helps a little sometimes, but I'm really feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small step towards acknowledging the shame without judgment, but it's still triggered a strong reaction. Goal: Notice what happens when you acknowledge the shame without judgment, and explore if it's possible to stay with the feeling for a longer moment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice what happened when you said "I'm feeling this shame right now" - your chest eased, and your breath slowed. What would happen if you stayed with that feeling for just a tiny bit longer, like 3-5 seconds? Can you imagine holding onto that sensation, without trying to change it, just to see what it would feel like?

Patient: I don't know... I tried holding it for a few seconds and, for a tiny moment, my chest loosened and my breath slowed — it felt like a small relief. But then the shame and that hot, frustrated rush came back harder, my face heated, and I just wanted to disappear. I'm feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down?
