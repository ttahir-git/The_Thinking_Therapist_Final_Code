Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and this total lack of motivation lately — feeling so isolated is starting to mess up my relationship. I keep picturing it spiraling: my partner leaving, me failing at work, losing everything and ending up completely alone, and I honestly can't see any realistic way that won't happen.

Therapist: That spiral sounds incredibly exhausting. When you say "losing everything," what's one thing you're holding onto that might not be as fragile as you think?

Patient: Maybe the one thing I tell myself isn't totally fragile is my job — I keep saying I'm competent and that people rely on me. But then I immediately picture one mistake, a bad review, getting fired, not paying the bills, my partner leaving because of the stress, friends drifting away, ending up alone — and honestly, I can't see any realistic way that doesn't happen.

Therapist: That thought about your job is like a story you're telling yourself – "If I get fired, everything falls apart." Can you look at that story as a thought, not the truth about your job or your life, without judgment?

Patient: I can't really do that — when I call it a "thought" it feels like a headline: one bad review proves I'm doomed. My mind immediately stitches that into the full disaster timeline — fired, bills unpaid, my partner leaving, friends drifting, me completely alone — it's not just a thought, it's the future I keep seeing. I know that sounds irrational, but considering any other outcome feels like pretending; I just can't take that seriously.

Therapist: You're right that seeing this thought as a headline feels like the future itself. What's one value that matters to you more than "not getting fired" – something that would feel important to you even if that headline showed up?

Patient: I care a lot about being dependable — being a good partner, showing up, providing emotional and practical support. But even that turns into another headline in my head: one screw-up at work means I can't provide, they get tired of it, we fight, they leave, and suddenly I'm not dependable at all — it's like that value just gets erased, and I can't take any other outcome seriously.

Therapist: Dependability feels like a core part of who you are – being there for your partner. What would it look like for you to show up and support them in one small, imperfect moment today, without having to "not fail" at work?

Patient: I guess I could do something small — like make dinner or actually ask how their day went and try to listen for five minutes. But my head immediately says they'll see it as me being needy or manipulative, they'll get cold, we'll argue about my stress and my job, and before I know it they're ready to leave and all my 'being dependable' goes out the window. I know you're probably going to tell me that sounds unlikely, but any other outcome feels like pretending and I can't take it seriously.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about the story you're telling yourself about how they'll react. Can you try to listen to that story without judgment, and then ask yourself: What's one thing you can do in this moment that feels connected to your value of being dependable – not about avoiding a fight or proving something, but just about being present with your partner?

Patient: I could try something small — like asking how their day was and actually listening for five minutes. But my brain immediately turns that into a headline: they see me as needy, we argue about my job, they get distant, start packing, and I'm back to being utterly alone. I don't know how to do the small thing without my mind inflating it into that whole disaster — it feels impossible to believe any other outcome.

Therapist: Can you notice what's happening in your body right now when you imagine doing that small act of listening? What physical sensations show up in your body when you picture yourself asking their day question?

Patient: My chest goes tight and there's this big knot in my stomach, my heart starts racing and my throat closes up like I might cry or choke. My hands get clammy, I feel shaky and my voice feels stuck, and as soon as that starts my brain spits out the headline that I'll look weak, they'll get fed up, and everything falls apart — which just makes the sensations worse. I don't know how to do the small thing without it turning into that whole disaster.

Therapist: Those physical sensations you're noticing – the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach – are showing up right now when you think about doing something small. Can you notice what's present in your body, even if it feels uncomfortable? What's one tiny part of you that's still holding onto that value of being dependable – even if it's just a tiny spark?

Patient: I can feel the tightness in my chest, the knot in my stomach, and this shallow, fast breathing when I even imagine being present. There's a tiny, stubborn bit of me that still wants to show up — I remember little things like making their coffee, grabbing their favorite snack, or shooting a quick "you okay?" text — those feel like proof I'm dependable. But my brain immediately turns those into evidence they'll see me as needy or pathetic, they'll resent me for it, and it'll push them away — I can't seem to believe any other outcome.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "prove" it, you simply noticed that tiny spark of being dependable – the thought that making their coffee feels like a small act of care? Can you hold onto that tiny sensation, even if your brain starts to predict the worst?

Patient: I can hold onto that tiny spark for a few seconds — I even notice my chest ease a bit when I imagine making their coffee — but it never lasts. The moment I try, my brain screams that them accepting it will just be the start: they'll resent me later, pull away, we'll fight about my dependence, and then they'll leave and I'm right back alone. I'm trying to keep it, but I'm frustrated and don't know how to stop my mind from blowing it up into the whole disaster.

Therapist: Can you make a tiny commitment to yourself, just for 5 seconds, to notice that spark of being dependable when you think about making their coffee – not about the outcome, but about the sensation in your chest right now? What would it take for you to just hold onto that tiny bit of care for 5 seconds, without judgment?

Patient: Maybe if I take one slow breath, focus on the warmth of the mug or the tiny lift in my chest, I could try to hold that spark for five seconds. Okay, I'll try now — one... two... three... four... five. I did feel it ease a little, but my brain's already yelling that it's just a setup for them to resent me and leave, so I don't know how to keep it from collapsing back into the disaster story.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "not" let the disaster story show up, you simply noticed what's happening in your body when your brain starts to predict the worst – what sensations do you notice when you feel that familiar knot in your chest, the tightness in your throat? Can you hold onto just that physical sensation, without trying to push away the story?

Patient: My chest tightens, there's that big knot in my stomach, my breathing gets shallow, and my throat feels pinched like I might start crying. I can hold onto that feeling for a few seconds, but then my mind immediately stitches the whole disaster: them getting fed up, leaving, me failing at work, and being completely alone — and that just makes the physical stuff worse. I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with the sensations a bit, because I don't know how to stop the story from taking over.

Therapist: Let's focus on that knot in your stomach for just one moment longer. As you feel that knot growing, can you notice the sensation of the knot itself – not the thought about it, not the story, just the physical sensation of the knot? What happens when you focus on that knot, without trying to push it away or make it disappear?

Patient: When I focus on the knot it's this hard, heavy ball under my ribs, like cold lead; my breaths get shallow and my throat feels like it's closing. The second I notice it my brain turns it into a headline — that's the exact moment they decide they're done, we fight, they leave, and I'm ruined — which just makes the knot tighten more. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer? I don't know how to stop the story.

Therapist: Instead of trying to "stop" the story, can you imagine a tiny "stop sign" right next to that knot in your stomach? Just imagine a small, thin line that says "STOP" in a tiny voice. What happens to the knot when you imagine that stop sign? Does it change size, color, or shape?

Patient: For a split second the stop sign makes the knot feel a little less heavy — like there's a sliver of room to breathe — but my brain instantly screams that it's fake: the sign will disappear, they'll still get fed up, we'll fight, they'll leave and I'm back to square one. I can feel the tightness snap back when that thought hits, and it's so frustrating — can we slow down and sit with that snap for a bit? I don't know how to keep the sign from being erased by the disaster story.

Therapist: When you feel the knot snap back to its old size and tightness, can you notice what happens in your body when it does? What sensations do you feel in your chest, throat, or belly? Just observe those sensations without judgment – don't try to push them away or change them. Notice if there's any subtle difference between this snap back and the one that happened when you imagined the stop sign.

Patient: When it snaps back the chest just clamps down harder, the knot goes icy and denser, my breathing gets razor-thin and my throat shuts like I'm about to cry or choke — my hands go cold and my voice catches. The difference from when I pictured the stop sign is that the snap-back now feels faster and meaner, like it spreads into my shoulders and jaw right away instead of letting me breathe even a little; the stop sign gave a tiny, brief looseness, this one slams it shut. My brain immediately narrates the disaster louder — they're already packing, I'm already alone, I'm already failing — and I get really overwhelmed; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take the exact phrase you used just now: "the snap back now feels faster and meaner, like it spreads into my shoulders and jaw right away." Can you repeat that phrase to yourself, exactly as you said it, without judgment or trying to change it? As you say it, notice what happens in your body when you feel that phrase – is it the same clamping down, icy knot, or razor-thin breathing?

Patient: "the snap back now feels faster and meaner, like it spreads into my shoulders and jaw right away." Saying it makes my chest clamp hard, the knot goes icy and denser, my breathing gets razor-thin, my shoulders and jaw seize up, and my hands feel cold and shaky. My mind immediately screams the worst — they're already packing, I'm already failing — and I feel more scattered and on-edge; can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice that when you say the phrase, the physical sensations are happening in your body, but they're not happening in your mind – they're happening in your chest, shoulders, and hands. What would it be like to focus just on that physical sensation, without trying to push it away or change it? Can you imagine being present with that sensation, without trying to make it go away or become something else?

Patient: When I try to focus on the sensation it’s this cold, hard knot under my ribs and my shoulders and jaw clench even more, my breathing gets razor-thin — but as soon as I notice it my brain screams the disaster again: they’re already packing, I’m already ruined. I’m feeling really jumpy and scattered right now, so it’s hard to stay with the body without the story hijacking me — can we slow down and just sit with the knot a bit more, because I don’t know how to stop the predictions from taking over.

Therapist: Let's take that knot under your ribs – the one that's cold and hard – and imagine it's a tiny, curious observer. What if, instead of trying to push it away or change it, you simply asked it: "What is it feeling right now?" Can you imagine that knot as a tiny, neutral observer, watching itself without judgment or reaction?

Patient: When I ask the knot what it's feeling it answers like an alarm—terrified, cold, heavy, like someone's already slammed the door and they're packing. My chest clamps, my jaw and shoulders tighten, and it shouts that I'm already failing, they're already gone, and I can't see any other outcome. I'm really jumpy and overwhelmed by that voice—can we slow down and sit with the knot a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice that the knot's response is like an alarm – it's reacting to the story, rather than the present moment. What would it be like to imagine that alarm as a signal, rather than the story itself? Can you picture the knot saying, "I'm scared, I'm cold, I'm heavy" – and instead of being the story, it's just a sensation in your body?

Patient: I can, sort of — picturing it as the knot saying "I'm scared, I'm cold, I'm heavy" makes it feel like a body thing instead of a prophecy, and that gives a tiny bit of distance. But the second I do, a wave of shame and that old failure flashes up and my brain instantly turns the alarm into a headline: they're packing, I'm fired, I'm alone. My chest tightens, my hands shake, I'm really jumpy and distracted — can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's go back to that knot – the one saying "I'm scared, I'm cold, I'm heavy". What if, instead of trying to push away the shame and failure story, you simply said to the knot: "You're scared. That makes sense. What's that feeling like in your body right now?" Can you imagine that knot responding with curiosity, rather than judgment?

Patient: I try to imagine it answering with curiosity—like a small voice asking "what hurts?"—and for a split second it softens and there's almost warmth under the ribs. But then that flash of shame from that old failure crashes in, my chest clamps, my hands go cold, and my brain yells they're already packing and everything's ruined. I'm really jumpy and overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with the knot a little longer?

Therapist: Notice the warmth under your ribs – the tiny spark that's present for just a moment. What would it be like to hold onto that warmth, even when the shame story tries to come in? Can you imagine it as a small flame, just beneath the surface of your chest? Try to keep that flame present, even if it feels tiny, without trying to fan it or make it grow – just notice it's there.

Patient: I can catch that tiny flame for a second — a little warmth under my ribs — but the moment I notice it my mind slams the door: they're already packing, I'm already fired, I'm alone. My chest tightens, my hands go cold, my throat closes, and I'm really jumpy and distracted. Can we slow down and sit with that little flame a bit longer? I don't know how to stop my mind from snuffing it out.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and notice that you're already feeling the tension in your chest, the coldness in your hands, and the tightness in your throat. That's what happens when your mind slams the door on the warmth. Can you simply acknowledge that sensation, without trying to push it away or change it? You can say to yourself: "My mind just slammed the door on the warmth. That's okay. It's just a thought."

Patient: "I can say, 'My mind just slammed the door on the warmth. That's okay. It's just a thought.' — but the second I say it my chest clamps, my hands go cold, and a wave of shame flashes through me, and my brain screams they're already packing, I'm already fired, I'm alone. I'm really jumpy and distracted right now; can we slow down and actually sit with the knot for a bit longer? I don't know how to stop the story from taking over.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "That's okay, it's just a thought". What's the sensation in your body when you say those words? Can you stay with that sensation, rather than the thought itself? For example, instead of thinking "They're already packing", you could say "I'm saying 'they're already packing' because that's what I'm thinking". Can you anchor the present moment in your body, just by noticing what's happening when you speak those words?

Patient: When I actually say "they're already packing" it lands like a punch in my throat — my chest clamps, my breathing goes razor-thin, my voice catches, my hands go icy and my heart jumps. If I try to stay with just those sensations — noticing the tightness, the short breath — there’s a tiny sliver of distance where it feels like noise, but shame floods in fast and the mind immediately stitches it back into the whole disaster. I'm feeling really jumpy and distracted and it's frustrating — can we slow down and sit with the sensations a bit longer? I don't know how to stop the story from taking over.

Therapist: Notice that when you try to stay with the sensations of the tightness and short breath, there's a tiny sliver of distance where it feels like noise – like the thought itself is becoming a little less real. What would it be like to explore that noise further, without trying to push it away or change it? Can you imagine it as a tiny whisper, saying "I'm not really in charge here"?

Patient: I can almost hear that whisper for a split second — "I'm not really in charge here" — and it gives me a sliver of relief, but my brain immediately calls it a lie and stitches it into the headline: they're already packing, I'm already fired, I'm already alone. My chest clamps, my throat tightens, my hands go cold and I feel jumpy and scattered, and the shame from that old failure rushes in. Can we slow down and actually sit with that tiny whisper for a bit longer? I don't know how to keep the catastrophe from taking over.

Therapist: Let's go back to that tiny whisper: "I'm not really in charge here". What would it be like to explore that thought fully, without trying to judge it or push it away? Can you imagine sitting with it, like you're holding a small, fragile thing in your hand? Notice what it feels like to hold that thought, without trying to change it or make it go away.

Patient: Holding that whisper feels fragile — like a tiny paper boat in my hands that could sink any second. The moment I focus, a flash of shame from that old screw-up hits and my chest clamps, my hands go cold, and my brain yells the worst — I'm fired, they're already packing, I'm alone — so it's almost impossible to just hold it. I'm really jumpy and frustrated right now; can we slow down and sit with that little thing a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice that the whisper feels fragile, like a paper boat. What if you simply anchored it to that fragile feeling, without trying to change it? You could say to yourself: "I'm holding onto this fragile thought that I'm not in charge – and it feels like it's about to sink." Can you hold onto that phrase, just for a tiny moment, without trying to change the thought or push it away?

Patient: Okay, I'll try saying it: "I'm holding onto this fragile thought that I'm not in charge — and it feels like it's about to sink." For a heartbeat it feels a little steady, but then my chest clamps, the knot goes icy, my hands go cold, and my brain screams they're already packing, I'm already fired, I'm already alone — and shame floods in. I'm really jumpy and distracted right now; can we slow down and actually sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you try to hold onto the phrase, just for a tiny moment. What's happening in your body when you say "I'm holding onto this fragile thought"? Can you notice any sensations, like tension or relaxation, when you try to hold onto the phrase, even though your mind is trying to push it away?

Patient: When I say "I'm holding onto this fragile thought" my chest tightens and that cold, heavy knot digs in deeper, my breathing goes razor-thin, my throat catches and my hands go icy. There's a tiny, almost-steady sliver for a second, but then shame flashes and my mind immediately stitches it into the whole disaster — they're already packing, I'm fired, I'm alone — and I get scattered and jumpy. Can we slow down and actually sit with the sensations a bit longer? I don't know how to stop the predictions from hijacking me.
