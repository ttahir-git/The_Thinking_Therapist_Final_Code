Patient: I've been feeling stuck and directionless since my breakup — most days I just go to work as a developer and then nothing else seems to matter. I don't know who I am beyond that job and it's been wearing me down. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything?

Therapist: What is it about your work as a developer that gives you a sense of purpose? Is it the problem-solving, the creativity, or something else?

Patient: It's mostly the problem-solving and the small wins — building something that works gives me a sense of competence. There's also the routine and predictability; at least work has clear expectations when everything else feels messy. But how is that supposed to help me figure out who I am beyond that? I've tried hobbies and meeting people and it just doesn't stick.

Therapist: What's one small thing you do when you're building something that works that feels most connected to what matters to you? For example, is it the feeling of being fully engaged when you're coding, or the sense of pride in a well-designed system?

Patient: It's the immersion — hitting that flow state when a tricky bug falls into place or a system finally clicks together. In those moments I feel competent and like what I'm doing actually matters. But how is that supposed to help me build a life outside work? I've tried forcing that into hobbies and it just doesn't stick.

Therapist: Those flow moments in work are actually a glimpse of what matters to you – the feeling of being fully engaged, competent, and making a difference. What if those values weren't limited to just work? What would your life look like if you started to bring that sense of purpose and flow into other areas, like relationships or personal projects?

Patient: I guess it'd mean seeking out other things where I can disappear into the work — like side projects, tinkering with electronics or woodworking, or mentoring someone where the problem-solving actually matters. In relationships maybe it would look like deep, curious conversations or shared projects instead of small talk, but honestly that feels abstract — I'm skeptical it would stick. How is picturing that actually supposed to help me make it happen?

Therapist: What's one tiny thing you can start doing this week to bring that sense of purpose into one area of your life – not a whole new project, just a small, specific action? For example, could you dedicate 10 minutes on Saturday to tinkering with electronics, or have a friend over for a deep conversation about something that matters to you?

Patient: Okay, I could try 20 minutes on Saturday to tinker with that old Raspberry Pi I've been hoarding — low commitment, concrete. But I've set timers for stuff like that before and stopped after one go, so I'm skeptical this will stick — how is 20 minutes supposed to turn into anything meaningful? If I'm going to try, I'd need something that reduces the chance I'll bail — what would realistically help me follow through?

Therapist: What if you tied the 20 minutes of tinkering to something you already do on Saturday mornings – like checking social media or having breakfast? That way, the action isn't a new habit to start, but rather a small addition to an existing routine.

Patient: That actually sounds doable — I usually have breakfast and mindlessly scroll for a bit, so I could set the Pi on the table and say I’ll do 20 minutes right after I eat. But how is that supposed to stop me from bailing? I always get distracted or feel it’s pointless after one try — what would actually keep me accountable beyond just saying I will?

Therapist: What would happen to you if, after those 20 minutes, you didn't feel the urge to scroll through social media but instead had a clear thought about how that time with the Pi connected to your value of problem-solving and competence? Would that give you a sense of purpose that's more powerful than just avoiding procrastination?

Patient: Maybe it would help — if that 20 minutes left me with a clear thought that tied to problem-solving, I might feel less like my only worth is at work and more like there's something else that matters. But I'm skeptical it'll stick; I've had those little sparks before and they just fizzle, so one session or one 20-minute try feels insufficient. If this is going to work, I need something concrete — like a scheduled check-in or someone to report to — otherwise how is that supposed to make me follow through when I feel drained and indifferent?

Therapist: Instead of relying on a scheduled check-in or someone to report to, what if you gave yourself a simple "report to" – a journal or a note on your phone – after those 20 minutes? That way, you're not waiting for someone else's approval, but rather acknowledging your own willingness to explore problem-solving outside of work.

Patient: Alright — I could try leaving a quick note on my phone after those 20 minutes, like two lines: what I did and one sentence about whether it felt meaningful. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from just shrugging it off when I'm tired? If I'm going to do this, it needs to be stupidly easy — a voice memo or a one-tap template so it doesn't feel like another task. Do you think that actually counts as accountability, or am I just fooling myself?

Therapist: What if the only thing you cared about was writing down "I spent 20 minutes tinkering with the Raspberry Pi"? That's it – not "it was meaningful," not "I felt accomplished," just "I did it." That's a tiny, almost ridiculously simple step that takes away the judgment and makes it feel more like a habit than a task.

Patient: Okay — that actually sounds less annoying than trying to judge whether it was “meaningful.” I could do a one-tap voice memo or a single-line note like “20min Pi” right after I stop a timer. But honestly, how is that supposed to help me stay motivated when I'm exhausted and indifferent? Habit trackers just become another checkbox I ignore. 

If I'm going to try, I'd make it automatic — an alarm that opens the voice recorder, or a tiny script that logs when I stop a timer so I don't have to think about it. Would that count as “stupidly easy,” and what would you suggest to make that log feel like more than meaningless data?

Therapist: What if the log wasn't just about "20min Pi," but about "I'm one minute closer to not being stuck"? That's a tiny, incremental step that connects the action to your value of progress, not just a checkbox. To make it feel more meaningful, you could use a phrase like "small win" or " tiny step" when you log it. For example, "small win: 20min Pi" or "tiny step: one minute of flow".

Patient: Okay — "small win: 20min Pi" sounds tolerable, less pressure than judging whether it was “meaningful.” But I'm skeptical it’ll actually pull me out of this rut; logging feels like collecting meaningless data when I'm tired and still raw from the breakup. If this is supposed to help me stop being defined by my job, how exactly does that tiny log turn into anything more — and what would realistically make me come back and look at the log later instead of scrolling past it?

Therapist: What if the log wasn't just about logging 20 minutes of Pi tinkering, but about using that tiny moment to imagine what else could be possible for you? You could write a brief sentence like: "If I wasn't stuck in this job, what would I be doing with my skills?" or "What's one thing I've always wanted to try that I've been too afraid to attempt?" That way, the log becomes a tiny spark that connects your current action to your future possibilities.

Patient: I could try that — like logging “small win: 20min Pi — If I wasn't stuck, I'd…” as a one-line prompt. But how is imagining possibilities supposed to not just feel like another lost daydream? When I'm still raw from the breakup, picturing some alternate life just makes me feel worse, not hopeful. If we're doing this, give me a stupidly simple template I can use when I'm exhausted, and tell me what to do with those lines afterward so they don't just disappear into my phone.

Therapist: What if you just logged "20min Pi — one thing that would feel good right now"? That's it – no "if I wasn't stuck" or "what I'd do" questions. Just a single sentence that focuses on what would feel good in that exact moment. When you log it, take a deep breath and then look at that sentence for 30 seconds before closing your eyes. Notice how it feels to say it out loud, and what physical sensation it brings. Then, do one tiny thing – like taking a sip of water or stretching your hand – to make that feeling a little more real.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is writing one sentence and breathing for 30 seconds supposed to help when most days I feel numb and nothing registers as "good"? 

Okay, if I have to pick something stupidly simple, I could log: "20min Pi — small comfort: warm tea" right after the session and actually take a sip. 

But if I still can't think of anything that feels good, how am I supposed to pick something without turning it into another pointless chore?

Therapist: What if, when you log "20min Pi — small comfort: warm tea", you actually take that sip of tea *right now*, not just think about it? That way, you're not just writing a sentence, you're experiencing it in the moment. It doesn't matter if it's a small comfort – the act of doing it is what matters.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is sipping tea right now supposed to change anything? I could take a sip, but when I'm numb that just feels performative and I usually go straight back to scrolling. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — if I do it and nothing changes, what do you want me to notice or do next?

Therapist: What if, when you take that sip of tea, you notice the sensation of it touching your tongue, or the warmth spreading through your hand? That's not about changing anything; it's just about being present with the experience. When you're numb, those small sensations can be a tiny crack in the numbness. Notice what happens when you focus on that tiny moment – does it shift your attention for a second, or does it stay the same?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried taking a sip just now. The warmth hit my tongue for a second and my hand relaxed a bit, but it didn't break the numbness; I just drifted back to thinking about work and scrolling. If the idea is to chip away at feeling stuck, how is noticing a sip supposed to scale into real change? I'm trying to see the point here, but I'm struggling — what do you want me to notice next?

Therapist: What if, just for a tiny moment, you wondered what it would be like to notice the warmth of a sip of tea in a different context – like during a conversation with a friend, or while working on a creative project? You're not trying to change the tea or your work; you're just exploring what it would be like to bring that sense of warmth to a different part of your life.

Patient: I can kind of picture it — like if I noticed the warmth while actually talking to someone or while coding, maybe the moment would feel less...empty. But how is imagining that supposed to get me out of feeling stuck? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.  

If you want me to try, give me one stupidly small, concrete step I can do during the 20min Pi slot that actually practices bringing that warmth into something else — not a feeling exercise, an action I won't bail on.

Therapist: What if, during the 20min Pi session, you commit to using the warmth of the tea to *warm up your hands while you're typing the next line of code*? That's a tangible action that connects the warmth to your current work, and it's something you can't bail on because it's a concrete physical action.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is warming my hands on the keyboard while I type the next line supposed to change anything real? I can try it during the 20min Pi slot and set a timer that reminds me to take a sip and rest my hands there before typing, but it still feels like a gimmick. If that doesn't help, what's one more stupidly small, concrete backup I can do right after the session so it doesn't just fizzle?

Therapist: If warming your hands on the keyboard feels like a gimmick, what if, right after the 20min Pi session, you simply *write down one thing you're looking forward to doing tomorrow night*? That's a tiny action that connects to your value of planning, and it's something you can't ignore because it's a concrete, written commitment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is writing one thing to look forward to not just another checkbox I ignore? 

I could try it: pick something tiny like "watch one episode of X tomorrow night," put it in my calendar with a 30‑min reminder, and have a one‑tap voice note ready to record "did it" when it's done so I don't have to think. If I still bail, what's a realistic backup you actually recommend that won't feel like more chores?

Therapist: If writing one thing to look forward to still feels like a checkbox, what if, right after the 20min Pi session, you simply *make a cup of tea for tomorrow night*? That's a concrete, practical action that connects to your value of planning, and it's something you can't ignore because it's a tangible, physical act that requires you to take action.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is making a cup of tea for tomorrow night supposed to help me not feel stuck? I could put a mug and teabag on the counter now so it's harder to ignore, but I'm skeptical that'll actually change anything. If I still don't follow through, what's a realistic backup that isn't just another chore?

Therapist: If making a cup of tea feels like another task, what if, right after the 20min Pi session, you simply *take care of your physical need for water by getting a glass and filling it with water from the fridge*? That's a basic, necessary action that connects to your physical survival, and it's something you can't ignore because it's a fundamental human need.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just getting a glass of water supposed to change anything about feeling stuck? I mean, I can fill a glass after the 20min Pi slot (or leave one out beforehand), but I already feel that familiar twinge of shame like I’ll forget or bail, and that just makes me want to scroll instead. If this is meant to be "stupidly easy," I need something automated — an alarm that opens the voice memo or a pre-filled glass — not another thing to remember. If that still fails, what's a realistic backup you actually recommend that won't just feel like another chore?

Therapist: If you need something automated, what if, right after the 20min Pi session, you simply *set an alarm on your phone to open the voice memo app and say "I did it"*? Or, if you prefer a glass of water, you could set an alarm to automatically fill a glass with water for you. That way, the action is literally automated, and you can't ignore it because it's too easy.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — alarms and a voice memo feel like things I just dismiss or fake to make the noise stop. If anything would work for me it has to be hands‑off: a tiny script that logs the timer stop as "small win: 20min Pi" automatically, so there's no chance to lie to myself. Even saying that brings up the same shame about not following through before, so if that fails what's a realistic backup that doesn't rely on me remembering or policing myself?

Therapist: If you need something that doesn't require you to remember or police yourself, what if you simply *place a sticky note on your desk with the phrase "20min Pi" on it*? When the timer stops, the note is already there, and you can't ignore it because it's a physical object that's already been set up.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — a sticky note is easy, but it already brings up that familiar shame and frustration like I’ll set it up and still ignore it. I could put one on the desk, but honestly what I want is that tiny script that logs "small win: 20min Pi" automatically so I can't lie to myself. If that still doesn't work, what's a realistic backup that doesn't rely on me remembering or policing myself?

Therapist: If you want a solution that's completely hands-off, what if you *use an app like Google Keep or Any.do to create a note that automatically logs "small win: 20min Pi" as soon as the timer stops? That way, you can't ignore it because it's already been logged and you can't erase it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — auto‑logging sounds doable (I could even script something to hit an API when the timer stops), but part of me thinks that's just a clever way to fake productivity. It brings up that same stupid shame where I set up systems and they still prove nothing, so I can already picture myself ignoring the logs or deleting them. If the log exists and I still feel the same, what's a realistic backup that doesn't rely on me policing myself, and how am I supposed to make those logs actually mean something later instead of just more data to ignore?

Therapist: If you want to make the log meaningful without relying on self-policing, what if you *actually put a small stone or a pebble in a jar every time you log a small win?* That way, you're not just logging it in a virtual space, but you're physically moving something into a jar, making it a tangible representation of your progress.

Patient: I don't know — that idea makes my chest tighten with that stupid, familiar shame like I've tried symbolic stuff before and it never stuck. How is moving stones into a jar supposed to be different from another checkbox I set up and then ignore? If we're gonna try a physical thing, give me a realistic backup that doesn't rely on me policing myself — what would actually stop me from just resenting the jar and scrolling instead?

Therapist: What if you *already have a jar or container on your desk or workspace, and you simply *put a small stone or pebble in it every time the timer stops*? You're not setting it up or trying to control yourself; you're just using an existing object to mark the passage of time. The jar is already there; you're just adding to it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is adding stones to a jar any different from another checkbox I set up and then resent? Saying the jar's "already there" just makes my chest tighten; that stupid flash of failure pops up and I already feel like I'm setting myself up to fail. Tell me specifically what would actually stop me from ignoring the jar and scrolling — how is that supposed to help when I'm the one who usually sabotages this stuff?

Therapist: What if you *put a sticky note on the jar with a single phrase: "I'll look at it tomorrow"*, but then you **don't move it**? That way, the jar is still there, but you're not adding anything to it. You're not setting up a new task or checking a box; you're simply acknowledging that you'll look at it tomorrow, without committing to it. The jar is no longer a source of shame or pressure; it's just a physical object that's already there, waiting for you to do nothing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — just leaving a note that says "I'll look at it tomorrow" and then doing nothing already feels like setting a trap. My chest tightens just thinking about it; that same shame of setting things up and failing flashes up. How is that supposed to help when what usually happens is I set the system and then scroll myself into oblivion? If you're serious about something that might actually stop me from ignoring it, propose one concrete, hands-off step that can't be overridden by my tiredness.

Therapist: What if you *put a post-it note on the jar with a single word: "Look"*? That's it. Just a word. You can't ignore it because it's a physical object that's already there, waiting for you to look at it. You don't need to think about it or plan anything; you just need to physically look at the note.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — a sticky note that just says "Look" feels like the same setup that always makes my chest tighten; I can already picture myself looking away and scrolling. How is that supposed to stop the cycle when the thing that usually trips me up is me, not the reminder? If you're serious about something that can't be overridden by my tiredness, give me one concrete, hands‑off step — like the tiny script that auto‑logs the timer stop — that actually forces a traceable action without me deciding to bail. What would you actually recommend as a backup if the note just becomes another thing I resent?
