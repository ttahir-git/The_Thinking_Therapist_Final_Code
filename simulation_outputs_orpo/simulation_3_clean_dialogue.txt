Patient: I'm a small business owner and lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little setback feels like proof I'm failing, which I think comes from growing up with inconsistent, chaotic parenting. It's been making social situations and the instability with work feel unbearable at times. Honestly, I've tried therapy stuff before and I'm skeptical — how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That sense of being stuck in self-criticism when setbacks happen sounds really painful. When you notice yourself getting caught in that loop, what's one thing you wish you could do differently – not to change the thought itself, but to make room for it without getting sucked in?

Patient: I wish I could actually step back and notice the thought as just a thought — maybe take a breath and name it instead of letting it turn into a full-blown meltdown. But I've tried labeling thoughts and breathing before and it never sticks when I'm panicking — how is that supposed to help when everything feels urgent?

Therapist: That's a common challenge – when panic sets in, it can feel like everything is urgent. What if, instead of trying to make the thought go away, you simply noticed it as a thought that's showing up right now – without trying to change it, just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I get what you mean—like stepping back and watching it—but in the moment there’s no room to step back; the thought’s loud and my chest tightens. I’ve tried labeling and breathing and it helps for, like, five seconds, then the panic pulls me right back in—how is noticing it for a “tiny moment” supposed to actually stop that? Can you give me something concrete I can do when it’s already ramping up?

Therapist: When panic starts to tighten your chest, what's one tiny physical sensation you notice in your body that you can acknowledge without trying to change it – like the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sound of your breath?

Patient: Usually it’s this tightness across my chest and a buzzing in my stomach — sometimes my hands go numb and I hyper-focus on the fabric under my fingers. I can try to notice my feet on the ground, but when it’s ramping up that feels useless. If I do pay attention to a sensation, how is that actually gonna stop the crash of thoughts?

Therapist: When your chest tightens and thoughts crash, what's one small, valued action you'd like to take if you weren't fighting that buzzing in your stomach – like making a phone call to a friend or taking a few steps outside?

Patient: If I could, I'd force myself to step outside for five minutes and just walk — or at least send one short text to a friend saying I'm having a rough day. But I've done those things before and it only quiets things for a minute; then the crash and the self-criticism come back—how is that actually going to stop the pattern for good?

Therapist: Rather than trying to make the buzzing stop with actions, what would it mean for you to be willing to feel that tightness in your chest while you're walking outside – not to avoid it, but to see what's possible when you don't fight it?

Patient: I mean, I get the idea in theory — maybe noticing it while I walk could show it’s not permanent — but I’m really skeptical. It feels like if I don’t fight it, it’ll just take over and I’ll spiral into a full panic, and with how things were at home, showing I’m upset felt unsafe, so sitting with it feels risky. If I tried it, what does that actually look like step-by-step, and what do I do if the panic spikes instead of fading? How is that supposed to help me when it’s already overwhelming?

Therapist: Let's start with something tiny: as soon as you feel that tightness in your chest, what's one thing you could say to yourself without judgment – just one word or phrase – that acknowledges the physical sensation without trying to change it?

Patient: Maybe I'd say, "This is anxiety" or just, "That's tightness." I mean, I've tried saying that before and it settles me for like five seconds, then the panic drags me back in. How is a little phrase actually supposed to help when it keeps returning?

Therapist: Notice how you're using the phrase "that's tightness" – you're still describing the sensation, which might actually reinforce the idea that it's something to be controlled. What if, instead, you simply said the phrase without analyzing or labeling it – just the word itself, without judgment?

Patient: Okay, I can try just saying "this is anxiety" without thinking about it, but I'm skeptical — when I do that my brain just argues back and it feels pointless. So if I say the word, what do I actually do next when the panic spikes and my body goes into overdrive?

Therapist: When you say "this is anxiety," what's one tiny physical action you can take right away – not to change the thought, but just to acknowledge it – like taking a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth?

Patient: I guess I'd try one slow, deliberate breath—inhale for four, exhale for six—and notice my feet on the ground. But I'm skeptical: breathing calms me for maybe five seconds and then the panic ramps back up and my chest just locks, like it makes it worse. If that spike happens, what am I supposed to do next—how is one breath supposed to stop the whole cascade?

Therapist: Notice that when your chest locks, what's the sensation in that tight spot – is it pressure, tightness, or something else? Instead of trying to breathe it away, what if you simply noticed it as a sensation in your body, without judgment – just that "pressure" or "tightness" – and then took a tiny step away from it physically, like shifting your weight onto the other foot?

Patient: It's more like a hard, burning pressure across my sternum—tight and heavy. Shifting my weight might break the loop for a second and feel a tiny bit grounding, but honestly I'm skeptical—usually I either freeze or get the urge to bolt, and a little shift feels too small. If the panic spikes instead of fading, I clench up and want to escape; what am I supposed to do then? I keep trying these small things and they end up feeling pointless.

Therapist: When the pressure spikes, instead of trying to shift or breathe away the sensation, notice what happens if you simply acknowledge it – without judgment or trying to change it – as the "hard, burning pressure across your sternum". What's the physical sensation of that pressure? Is it a sensation of your body, not your thoughts?

Patient: It's a hot, squeezing band right under my ribs — heavy, like my breath is shallow and my heart's pounding. I can feel it clearly in my body, not just in my head, but when I try to name it my mind immediately starts arguing and racing. I don't get why noticing it wouldn't just give the panic more to latch onto — how is that supposed to keep me from spiraling when it spikes? What do I do if acknowledging it just makes everything go louder?

Therapist: When your mind starts arguing, instead of trying to stop the thought, notice the sensation of the argument happening – is it a physical sensation in your chest, like a knot or a buzzing? What if, in that moment, you simply acknowledged the argument without trying to "fix" it or change it – just the sensation of the argument, like a "voice in the background"?

Patient: Yeah — it's like a buzzing behind my teeth and a knot in my throat, my jaw tightens and my heartbeat goes loud. I can try to hear it as a background voice saying "you're failing" instead of buying into it, but usually that just makes it angrier and it pulls me in faster. So okay, I'll try to notice it as a voice in the background — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop it from getting louder, and what do I actually do next when it does?

Therapist: When you notice the voice as a background buzz, instead of trying to "stop" it, notice the physical sensation of your body – the tightness in your jaw, the buzzing behind your teeth, the knot in your throat. What's one tiny physical action you can take in that moment, without trying to change the thought – like taking a tiny breath, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I could press my thumb and forefinger together and focus on the tiny pressure and the texture of my skin — something concrete to anchor to. I’ll try that, but I’m skeptical: usually it distracts me for a few seconds and then the panic gets louder. If that spike happens instead of fading, what do I actually do next?

Therapist: When the panic spikes and you press your thumb and forefinger together, instead of trying to stay focused on the sensation, notice the tiny bit of space that opens up between your thumb and finger. What's one tiny thing you can do with that tiny space – like letting your thumb relax slightly, or noticing the sensation of your breath moving through that tiny gap?

Patient: I can try letting my thumb relax a bit and notice the tiny warmth or the air in that gap while taking one slow breath. But honestly, I’m frustrated — that usually calms me for five seconds then the panic comes back louder, so how is this really supposed to help when it spikes, and what do I do if that happens?

Therapist: When the panic spikes and your thumb relaxes, notice what's happening in your body – the tightening, the racing, the knot. Instead of trying to calm it down, what if you simply acknowledged it as a physical response – like your body's way of saying "I'm scared"? What if, in that moment, you chose to notice the sensation of your body, without trying to change it or fight it?

Patient: Okay—I can try to see it as my body's "I'm scared" signal—it's that hot, crushing band under my ribs, my jaw locks, and the thought loop "you're failing" gets loud. I'll try to let it be a sensation instead of something to fix, but honestly every time I do that my brain argues and it just escalates—how is that supposed to help when it usually makes the panic louder? If I'm supposed to notice it without fighting, what concrete next step do I actually take when it spikes so I don't end up bolting or shutting down?

Therapist: When the panic spikes and the thought loop "you're failing" gets loud, notice the physical sensation of your jaw locking – it's a specific, tangible thing that happens in your body. Instead of trying to "stop" the thought, what if you simply took a tiny, tiny step away from it – a single, small movement of your head or body, just to create space?

Patient: I guess I could try a tiny head turn or a slow shoulder shrug — maybe even shift my weight a little to create that sliver of space. But I'm frustrated and skeptical: usually I either freeze or bolt, and a small movement feels pointless when the panic spikes. How is that tiny step supposed to stop things from escalating, and if it gets worse after I do it, what am I actually supposed to do next so I don't end up running or shutting down?

Therapist: When the panic spikes and you feel like you're about to bolt or freeze, notice what's happening in your body – the physical sensations, the racing thoughts. Instead of trying to "fix" the situation, what if you simply acknowledged the overwhelm itself – the crushing weight of the panic, the tightness in your chest, the knot in your throat? What if you chose to notice the overwhelm, without trying to change it, just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "noticing" the overwhelm supposed to help when it usually makes everything louder? When I try to sit with that crushing weight it just ramps up and I get this urge to run or go numb, so I end up panicking more. If I actually try to notice for a tiny moment and it spikes, what do I do next so I don't bolt or shut down?

Therapist: When the panic spikes and you feel like you're about to bolt or freeze, notice what's happening in your body – the crushing weight, the tightness, the urge to run. Instead of trying to "fight" it, what if you simply took one tiny breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, you made a tiny physical movement – like rolling your shoulders, or uncurling your toes – that says "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm not going anywhere"?

Patient: I can try that — one slow breath and a shoulder roll or uncurling my toes — but I'm not convinced. Usually those tiny moves just make me more aware and the panic gets louder, and if it spikes I end up wanting to run; how is that supposed to help when the urge to bolt kicks in? If I do it and it doesn't work, what am I actually supposed to do next so I don't spiral or shut down?

Therapist: When you roll your shoulders or uncurl your toes, notice what happens in your body – does your chest loosen up a bit? Do you feel a tiny bit more grounded? Instead of trying to "fix" the panic, what if you simply allowed yourself to be with that tiny sense of grounding – like noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sound of your breath moving in and out – for just a tiny moment longer?

Patient: Okay... I can try holding the grounding — feet on the floor, one slow breath — but it often feels like a tiny bandage when everything's crashing. When that doesn't work and I still want to bolt, what am I actually supposed to do then? I don't know, it's a lot to keep doing the same little tricks and getting pulled back in.

Therapist: Instead of trying to "hold" the grounding or perform a specific trick, what if you simply let go of the idea that you need to "fix" the panic? What if you allowed yourself to be with the crushing weight of the moment, without judgment or expectation – just as it is? This isn't about avoiding the panic, but about noticing that you've been trying to control it all along.

Patient: I hear you, but I'm really worn out by all the "allowing" stuff — it sounds okay in theory and then feels like another thing to do when I'm already drained. Letting it be feels risky for me — with how chaotic and unsafe it was at home, if I stop trying to fix it, won't it just swallow me? If I try this and the panic spikes, what's one concrete next move that doesn't feel like another useless trick?

Therapist: When you feel the panic spike and you're worried it will overwhelm you, what's one tiny physical thing you can do to create space – like taking a tiny sip of water, or noticing the sensation of the air on your skin? This isn't about fixing the panic, but about creating a tiny gap between you and it.

Patient: Maybe a tiny sip of water or feeling the air on my skin — I can try that, I guess. But I don't know, it usually just buys me a few seconds before the panic gets louder; how is a sip of water actually supposed to stop me from bolting? If that doesn't work, what am I supposed to do next so I don't just run or shut down?

Therapist: When you take a sip of water or feel the air on your skin, what's one tiny physical thing you can do with your body that says "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm not going anywhere"? For example, you could slowly put one foot down on the ground, or take one slow, deep breath in through your nose. This isn't about stopping the panic, but about creating a tiny anchor in your body that says "I'm safe enough to pause".

Patient: I can try putting one foot down slowly and taking a long, slow breath—something tiny to anchor me. But I'm skeptical: that usually just gives me a few seconds before the panic ramps back up and I either want to run or go numb. If that anchor doesn't hold, what do I actually do next so I don't bolt or shut down?

Therapist: When you put one foot down and take a slow breath, what's one tiny thing you can do with your body that says "I'm safe enough to try something else"? For example, you could slowly look around the room, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or take one small step forward. This isn't about "doing" something, but about creating a tiny gap between you and the panic.

Patient: Maybe slowly look around the room and name three things I can see — like "chair, poster, window" — while keeping that slow breath and my foot down. But I'm skeptical: that usually buys me five seconds and then the panic spikes — if that happens, what do I actually do next so I don't bolt or shut down?

Therapist: When you slowly look around the room and name three things you can see, what's one tiny thing you can do with your body that says "I'm in control of my next move"? For example, you could slowly, deliberately put the other foot down beside the first one, or take another slow, deep breath in through your nose. This isn't about "doing" something, but about creating a tiny sense of agency in the moment.

Patient: Alright — I can slowly put the other foot down and take another long breath, maybe drop my shoulders a little so it feels deliberate. It might give a sliver of control, but honestly it usually only buys me a few seconds before the panic ramps back up — how is that supposed to help long-term, and if it fails, what do I actually do next so I don't bolt or shut down?

Therapist: When you put the other foot down and take another breath, what's one thing you can do with your body that says "I'm not trying to control the panic, I'm just trying to be present"? Instead of trying to "fix" the panic, what if you simply allowed yourself to feel the physical sensations without judgment – the tightness in your chest, the racing in your head, the urge to run? This isn't about "doing" something, but about noticing that the panic is already happening, and that you've been trying to avoid it all along.

Patient: I get the idea in theory, but honestly I'm worn out by all the "just notice" stuff — it feels like another thing to fail at. Letting the panic be usually just makes it louder and I either bolt or go numb; with how unsafe it felt growing up, "allowing" it feels like surrender. So what do I actually do, step-by-step, in the first 30 seconds if it spikes when I'm trying to allow it — I need something concrete that isn't another useless trick.

Therapist: When the panic spikes and you feel like you're going to bolt or shut down, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Without judgment, simply ask yourself: "What is one tiny thing I can do right now to keep my feet on the ground?" For example, you could take a tiny pinch of your foot between your thumb and index finger, or press your heel gently into the floor. This small action connects to physical safety and provides a tangible anchor in the moment.

Patient: Okay — I can try pressing my heel or pinching my foot, but honestly that usually just distracts me for a few seconds and then it’s back. If I do that and the panic still spikes, what exactly do I do next — step-by-step for the first 30 seconds? Like: press heel (0–5s), take one breath (5–10s), then what? If none of that works and I still want to bolt or shut down, do I leave, call someone, or keep trying these tiny anchors? How is that actually supposed to keep me from running or going numb?
