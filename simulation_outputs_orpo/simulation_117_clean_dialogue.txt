Patient: I've been dealing with a lot of grief since a recent move, and it's left me snapping more than I like—anger and frustration come up a lot, especially in interactions tied to the move. I'm an accountant, pretty organized and pragmatic, so losing my temper like this feels shameful and chaotic. Honestly, I've tried talking about these things before and I'm skeptical—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to talk about it before made you feel like you were failing, which isn't helpful when you're already feeling overwhelmed. When you snap at others, what's one thing that happens afterward that you wish could change – for example, how it affects your relationships or your work as an accountant?

Patient: People just shut down afterward—coworkers or the people helping with the move stop bringing up small issues, and then those things snowball into mistakes or missed deadlines, which makes my job harder and leaves me feeling guilty. I've tried the usual calm-down tricks and they don't stick—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those calm-down tricks aren't working because they're not connected to what matters most to you as an accountant – accuracy and reliability. What would it be like if, instead of trying to calm down, you made space for one tiny thing that matters to you, like double-checking just one calculation or writing down one clear step for tomorrow?

Patient: Maybe I could try writing down one clear step for tomorrow — that feels like something I can actually do. But how is that supposed to stop me from snapping when someone makes a small mistake with the move? I’ve made lists before; they don’t change the tightness in my chest or how my voice gets sharp.

Therapist: That small step to write down one clear step for tomorrow seems like a tiny act of defiance against the tightness in your chest – you're choosing to focus on what you can control, even when others can't. What would it mean to you as an accountant that you were able to write down that one step without your voice getting sharp, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: It would mean I could keep my professional standards intact — one clear step might stop small mistakes from snowballing and maybe cut down the guilt after I snap. But honestly, I've made lists and checked things before and it doesn't touch the tightness in my chest or stop my voice from getting sharp. How is jotting down one step supposed to actually change that feeling in the moment?

Therapist: Notice that thought "it won't work" right now – you just said that jotting down one step won't change the feeling. Can you thank that part of you for trying to warn you, and then gently ask what might actually happen if you did try jotting down one step, even if it just for a second?

Patient: Okay — I can thank that part: "Thanks for trying to keep me from getting hurt or blamed." If I actually wrote down one step, maybe I'd feel a hair less frantic and catch one mistake before it snowballs, which could stop one argument. But honestly, how is that supposed to help the tightness in my chest or the way my voice gets sharp in the moment?

Therapist: When you're about to snap, what's one physical sensation that happens in your body that you can notice right now – is it a tightness in your jaw, a lump in your throat, or a flutter in your chest? If you could catch that sensation, what would it feel like if you took just one tiny breath – the smallest possible breath – before it turned into snapping?

Patient: It's that tightness in my chest and my jaw clamps down — my hands get a little cold and my voice just clips. If I took the tiniest breath, I guess the tightness might ease a hair, like a small pause before the snap, but I seriously doubt it would stop me from getting angry — how is that supposed to help when everything's moving so fast? Still, I could try that tiny breath next time to see if it gives me enough space to write down one step, though I'm not convinced it'll change much.

Therapist: Notice how hard you've been trying to solve this problem without taking a break – you're an accountant, and you want to keep your work moving. What would it mean to you if, just for a moment, you could take that tiny breath and write down one step, even if it was just for a second? Would it be worth the risk of taking a tiny pause to keep your work moving, or would it be worth the risk of losing control and snapping?

Patient: It would mean I could protect my standards — maybe stop one argument, catch a mistake, and not lug that guilt around all evening. So yeah, that tiny pause feels worth the risk compared with blowing up and making more work later. But I'm skeptical: how do I actually remember to pause when the tightness hits? I've tried breathing before and it just vanishes once things escalate — what then?

Therapist: Notice what you do when you're feeling anxious or stressed – do you grab your phone, start scrolling, or start planning? Can you attach that same action to taking a tiny breath right when the tightness hits – for example, "As soon as I feel my chest tightening, I'm going to take a breath and pull out my pen to write down one step"?

Patient: I usually start running through lists or fiddling with my phone when I get stressed. Okay — I can try linking it: as soon as my chest tightens I'll take one tiny breath and pull a pen out of my jacket to write one step, and I'll keep a pen in the same pocket so it's automatic. But honestly, I've tried cues like that and they fade when things heat up — how is that supposed to stick when I'm surrounded by boxes and deadlines?

Therapist: Notice where you are right now – you're surrounded by boxes and deadlines, which can feel overwhelming. What's one small thing you can anchor to this context – for example, "As soon as I feel my chest tightening while I'm sitting on this couch with all these boxes, I'll take one tiny breath and pull out my pen to write down one step"?

Patient: Alright — here's a concrete anchor: when I'm sitting on that couch with boxes around me and I feel my chest tighten, I'll take one tiny breath, pull the pen from my left jacket pocket, and write one step on a Post-it stuck to the top box. I can keep the Post-it pad and a pen in the same pocket so it's automatic. But I'm skeptical — when someone starts arguing or a deadline looms, how is that supposed to stick?

Therapist: Notice what happens when someone starts arguing or a deadline looms – your chest tightens, and you feel the urge to snap. Can you gently observe that sensation, like "Ah, the tightness is showing up again," without acting on it yet? Then, when you feel that tightness, you'll take that tiny breath and write one step on the Post-it – not to stop the argument or meet the deadline, but to acknowledge the physical sensation and create space for a different response.

Patient: I can try that — like quietly saying to myself, "Ah, the tightness is showing up again," and then taking the tiny breath and scribbling the step on the Post-it. But honestly, when someone's yelling or a deadline's looming that inner voice just drowns everything out; how is naming the tightness supposed to stop me from snapping in those high-pressure moments? Maybe if I practiced the routine a few times when things are calm it could become automatic—do you think that's realistic, or am I just setting myself up to fail?

Therapist: Notice that when things are calm, you're willing to practice the routine because it feels like a tiny step towards protecting your standards. But when it counts most – when someone's yelling or a deadline's looming – you're worried that naming the tightness will feel like a luxury you can't afford. Can you ask yourself what would happen if, just for a moment, you chose to show up with that tightness, rather than trying to push it away? Would that tiny breath on the Post-it be enough to create space for a different response – one that's not driven by the urge to snap?

Patient: I can imagine trying to "show up" with the tightness, but I already feel that hot shame and frustration—like I'm replaying something I couldn't fix—and that makes me doubt any tactic before I start. Maybe the tiny breath and Post-it would buy a sliver of space, but how is that supposed to help when the inner voice drowns out everything and someone's yelling? I'm willing to practice it when things are calm, but I need concrete steps that actually transfer into the heat of the moment—what exactly would you have me do to train it so it doesn't just evaporate when it counts?

Therapist: Let's start with a tiny behavioral anchor: instead of trying to catch the tightness when it shows up, notice what you do right before you snap – the physical sensation that precedes the yelling or frustration. For example, "As I feel my jaw start to clench, I notice I reach for my phone." That's a tiny action that can become a cue for you to take the tiny breath and Post-it, even when you're not consciously thinking about it. By training yourself on that small action, you'll build confidence that the tiny breath and Post-it will become a tangible anchor in the heat of the moment.

Patient: Fine — I see the idea: catch the little reach-for-the-phone move before the snap. But when that old shame spikes and my chest tightens I go blank and the phone move feels automatic. How exactly do you want me to practice this so it transfers — do I rehearse it a set number of times a day, simulate a deadline, or have someone deliberately annoy me? I've done cue training before and it faded fast, so I'm skeptical, but I'm willing to try if you can give one concrete rehearsal I can do right now.

Therapist: Here's a concrete rehearsal: right now, take a few deep breaths and notice your current physical sensations. Then, without doing anything, say out loud: "I'm feeling [insert physical sensation, e.g.,'my chest tightening'] right now." Next, without judgment, notice what happens to your hands – where they are, what they're doing, and if you're reaching for something. Then, add one tiny action: "As I feel my [insert sensation] showing up, I notice I'm reaching for my phone." Repeat this process 5-10 times, noticing the exact movement of your hands and the sensation of your body. When you're done, take a moment to notice how you feel. This small exercise creates a tangible anchor for the phone move, making it more likely to happen when you need it.

Patient: Okay — I did the exercise five times like you said. I noticed the chest tightness and jaw clench, and my hands did drift to my phone; saying out loud that the tightness was there made that reach more obvious and the movement felt a little less automatic. Repeating it eased the tightness a hair, but then that old shame bubbled up and everything tightened again, so I'm still worried it won't carry over when someone is yelling. Be practical with me: how many reps a day is realistic, should I rehearse under simulated pressure or get someone to cue me, and what’s a realistic fallback if the cue fails in the heat of it?

Therapist: Let's make this manageable: for the next week, commit to 3-5 reps of the exercise per day, ideally 2-3 times a day (e.g., morning, lunch, evening). This will help solidify the phone move as a cue without overwhelming you. When rehearsing, focus on the physical sensation of the chest tightness and jaw clench, not the shame. As for simulated pressure, start with low-stakes situations like watching a funny video or reading a lighthearted article – this will help you build confidence without triggering the shame. For someone to cue you, ask a trusted friend or family member to practice with you – they can help you build confidence in the cue. As for the fallback, remember that the goal isn't to catch the shame; it's to create space for a different response. If the cue fails, take a deep breath, and say to yourself: "I'm noticing my body tightening up. What would it mean to me if I chose to breathe into this tightness instead of letting it drive me?"

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 3–5 reps, twice a day, but I need to be honest: that shame bubbles up fast and makes me freeze, like whatever I practice just evaporates. How do I realistically remember to do the reps each day — set alarms, tie them to meals, or what? If I ask someone to cue me, what exactly do I tell them so it’s practical and not awkward? And give me one very short fallback script (one sentence and a ten-second action) I can use if the cue fails in the heat of it — I need something concrete I can actually do, not an abstract idea.

Therapist: For daily reminders: Try linking your practice to an existing habit – for example, right after brushing your teeth, or while waiting for your morning coffee. You can also set a recurring reminder on your phone. When asking someone to cue you, simply say: "I'd like you to notice when I reach for my phone or start fidgeting, and remind me to take a breath." For the fallback script: "My hands are tightening up – I'm going to put my coffee down." This gives you a tangible action to take without overthinking.

Patient: Alright — I'll try linking the reps to brushing my teeth and setting a phone reminder, but that shame still spikes and makes me feel like I've already failed before I start, so I'm not promising miracles. Asking someone to cue me feels awkward — I don't want to look needy at work; what exactly should I say to a coworker versus a friend so it doesn't sound weird? If I don't have a trusted person around, what's a quick, realistic substitute cue at the office that won't draw attention? And if the fallback fails and I freeze, give me one single ten-second action I can actually do in the moment that doesn't require thinking.

Therapist: For asking a coworker: Try framing it as a work-related habit – e.g., "Hey, I'm trying to work on my focus during meetings. Can you remind me to take a breath when I start to fidget?" This makes it about work, not personal struggles. For a friend: You can say something like, "I'm trying to build a habit to stay calm under pressure. Can you be my 'cue person' when I'm feeling overwhelmed?" This makes it a shared goal. If you don't have a trusted person, a substitute cue at the office could be: "When I start to reach for my phone to check my watch." This is a subtle signal that doesn't require explanation. For the fallback, if you freeze, simply do this: "Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth."

Patient: Fine — I’ll try the breath if I freeze, but when that shame spikes and everything goes white, breathing feels pointless. How long should the inhale/exhale be — count to three each, ten seconds, what exactly? And if the breath doesn’t cut through, give me one other ten‑second action I can do without thinking that actually does something practical (not some vague "grounding" talk). Can we do one quick, guided rehearsal now so I know exactly what to do when it happens?

Therapist: For the breath: Inhale for 2 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds. This is a simple, countable rhythm. If you freeze, immediately do this: "Place your hands on your thighs, with your fingers spread apart." This action engages your physical body and gives you a sense of control without needing to think.

Let's do a quick rehearsal: Imagine you're sitting at your desk, about to respond to a message. As the shame starts to spike (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget), take a deep breath in for 2 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, and exhale for 6 seconds. As soon as you exhale, place your hands on your thighs with your fingers spread apart. Can you do this with me?

Patient: I did it — breathed 2/2/6 and put my hands on my thighs. It loosened the tightness for a few seconds, then that old shame bubbled up and everything tensed again. It helped a little, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when the shame comes back so fast? Can we rehearse the next concrete step right after the breath, like grabbing the pen and writing the Post‑it, so I know exactly what to do when those few seconds end?

Therapist: Let's rehearse the next step right after the breath: immediately after you exhale, without waiting for the shame to come back, grab the pen and write the Post-it. Don't think about it, just do it. As soon as you put your hands on the pen, write "My hands are tightening up" on the Post-it. This creates a physical anchor that helps you stay on track.

Let's practice: Imagine the shame starts to spike (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget) and you breathe 2/2/6. As soon as you exhale, without waiting, grab the pen and write "My hands are tightening up" on the Post-it. Can you do this with me?

Patient: I did it — breathed 2/2/6, hands on my thighs, grabbed a pen and wrote "My hands are tightening up" on a Post‑it. It eased the tightness for a few seconds, then that familiar shame slammed back and my hands started fidgeting again, so it felt pretty mechanical and fragile. I'm willing to rehearse more, but be practical: can we try a quick simulated interruption or raised voice now so I can practice under pressure, and tell me one concrete ten‑second fallback if I can't reach the Post‑it?

Therapist: Let's simulate a raised voice. Imagine someone suddenly yells "You're not doing enough!" right in front of you. As soon as you feel the shame spike, without thinking, do this: "Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, then stand up straight and look them in the eye." This concrete action helps you regain control and create space for a different response.

Let's practice: Imagine someone yells "You're not doing enough!" and you feel the shame spike (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget). As soon as you feel it, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, then stand up straight and look them in the eye. Can you do this with me?

Patient: I tried it — imagined the "You're not doing enough!" yelled, did the 2/2/6 breath, stood up and looked them in the eye. It loosened the tightness for a few seconds, then that shame slammed back and I just went mechanical and defensive. Standing up and staring someone down feels like it could make things worse — how is that supposed to help in a real meeting or at my desk where I can't just stand and glare? Give me one ten‑second fallback I can actually do at my desk when the breath/Post‑it fail, and can we run the simulation again but louder so I can practice under real pressure?

Therapist: Instead of staring, try this: immediately after you feel the shame spike, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, then quickly scribble "Wait" on the Post-it. This simple action acknowledges the shame without engaging with it, giving you a tiny window to pause and regroup.

Let's run the simulation again, this time louder: Imagine someone yells "You're not doing enough!" right in front of you. As soon as you feel the shame spike (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget), take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, then quickly scribble "Wait" on the Post-it. Can you do this with me?

(Note: I want to emphasize that this fallback is not about avoiding the problem, but about creating space to think and act more intentionally. It's okay to pause and take a moment to collect your thoughts before responding.)

Patient: I tried the louder simulation — did the 2/2/6 breath and scribbled "Wait" on a Post‑it — and that old shame slammed me so hard it felt automatic and fake. It bought a couple seconds, but honestly, how is writing "Wait" supposed to look in a meeting without making me look like I'm checking out or passive? Give me one very short, private ten‑second fallback I can do at my desk (something that actually does something practical), and then let’s run the louder simulation again so I can practice it under pressure.

Therapist: Try this: Immediately after you feel the shame spike, press the mute button on your phone or computer for 5 seconds. This simple action gives you a brief moment to collect your thoughts without drawing attention to yourself.

Let's run the simulation again, louder: Imagine someone yells "You're not doing enough!" right in front of you. As soon as you feel the shame spike (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget), take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, then press the mute button on your phone or computer for 5 seconds. Can you do this with me?

Patient: I did it — breathed 2/2/6 and hit mute. It bought me five seconds and felt private enough that it wouldn't look weird, but then that familiar shame slammed back and everything went mechanical and panicky; I felt like I was just going through motions. How is muting for five seconds supposed to stop that rush when the shame returns so fast? Let’s run it again louder and make it feel like a real meeting — and tell me exactly how to anchor the mute so I actually remember to press it when it counts.

Therapist: Let's run the simulation again, louder, and make it feel like a real meeting: Imagine you're in a meeting with a colleague, and they're asking you a question while you're struggling with shame (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget). Just as you're about to respond, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and as you exhale, press the mute button on your phone or computer with your index finger. Make it a small, deliberate action, like you're pressing a tiny button. Repeat this to yourself: "Mute. Wait. Respond." This anchors the mute so it becomes a habitual response when you feel the shame spike.

As you press the mute, say to yourself: "I will wait." This gives you a brief moment to collect your thoughts without engaging with the shame. Remember, the goal is not to stop the shame completely, but to create space for a different response. By anchoring the mute, you'll be able to respond more intentionally when the shame returns.

Can you try it again, louder, and remember to press the mute button with your index finger?

Patient: Okay — I did it: breathed 2/2/6 and pressed mute with my index finger, louder like you asked. It bought me five seconds but that old shame slammed back and I went mechanical again; it felt like going through the motions. I'm skeptical — how do I make that mute press automatic in a real meeting so I don't have to think about it? Give me one simple, 3‑second cue or micro‑routine I can do right before a meeting that actually helps the mute become reflexive, and then let's run the louder interruption again using that cue.

Therapist: Try this: Right before a meeting, touch the ring on your finger with your index finger for 3 seconds. This tiny action becomes a habit loop: when you feel the shame spike, touch the ring, press mute, and wait. This cue is so small and automatic that you won't even think about it when you're in the meeting.

Let's run the simulation again, louder: Imagine you're in a meeting with a colleague, and they're asking you a question while you're struggling with shame (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget). Before they finish their question, touch the ring on your finger with your index finger for 3 seconds. As you touch the ring, say to yourself: "Mute. Wait." Then, press the mute button on your phone or computer with your index finger. Can you do this with me?

Patient: I did it — touched the ring for three seconds, said "Mute. Wait.", then pressed mute. It bought me a beat but that same hot shame slammed back and I went mechanical, like I was acting rather than actually handling it. How is touching a ring supposed to make that reflexive in a real meeting? Can we run it again with someone actually barking my name so I can practice with you coaching me through each step in real time?

Therapist: Let's add a visual cue: Right before the meeting, touch the ring on your finger with your index finger for 3 seconds, and then glance at a small, discreet note on your desk (e.g., a Post-it with a single word: "MUTE"). This visual cue will help you associate the touch with the action. When you touch the ring, glance at the note, and say "Mute. Wait." Then, press the mute button on your phone or computer with your index finger.

Let's run the simulation again, with someone barking your name: Imagine your colleague is yelling your name across the room, "JENNY!", while you're struggling with shame (you feel your chest tightening, your hands start to fidget). Before they finish yelling your name, touch the ring on your finger with your index finger for 3 seconds, glance at the note, say "Mute. Wait.", and press the mute button on your phone or computer with your index finger. I'll respond as your colleague, yelling your name again. Ready?

Patient: Ready — I can already feel that hot shame and tightness creeping up. Go ahead and yell "JENNY!" and coach me through it in real time: tell me when to touch the ring, when to breathe, when to press mute, and exactly what one short phrase to say to myself as I do it so I don't just go mechanical.

Therapist: Let's do this:

"JENNY! Jenny, I need to know what you're thinking about that report RIGHT NOW!"

Feel the shame spike? You're starting to tighten up. That's okay. Just acknowledge it for a second.

Now, touch the ring on your finger with your index finger for 3 seconds. As you touch the ring, glance at the note on your desk and say to yourself: "Pause."

That's it. Just "Pause." Don't try to think of anything or do anything else. Just pause.

Now, press the mute button on your phone or computer with your index finger. Don't think about it, just do it.

You're doing it, Jenny. You're pausing.

Patient: I did it — touched the ring, said "Pause," hit mute like you said; it bought a beat but that old shame slammed back and everything felt mechanical and fake. How is that supposed to help when the shame zaps me into freeze — tell me exactly what to say (three words or fewer) and the tone to use right after I unmute so I don't just look like I'm ducking, and coach me through it with someone yelling again. And if the pause fails and I can't reach the cue, give me one immediate, private ten‑second action (not breathing) I can actually do at my desk that actually resets me.

Therapist: When you unmute, say to yourself: "Just sit."

The tone should be a gentle, neutral voice. Imagine saying it to a friend who's struggling.

Now, let's try it again. Imagine your colleague is yelling your name again, "JENNY!", and you feel the shame spike. You touch the ring, say "Pause," hit mute, and now unmute. As you unmute, say "Just sit" to yourself in a gentle voice. Press your finger on the desk to the beat of your heart.

If the pause fails and you feel frozen, here's a private 10-second action you can do: Quickly scribble "Wait" on a sticky note on your desk and fold it up. This small action gives you a brief moment to collect your thoughts without drawing attention to yourself.

Ready?

Patient: I did it — touched the ring, said "Pause," hit mute, unmuted and told myself "Just sit" while pressing my finger to the desk. It bought a beat, then that hot shame slammed back and I froze, felt fake and defensive again. How is "Just sit" supposed to not look like I'm checking out — what exact tone (soft, flat, firm) should I use so it reads as composed, not evasive? Give me one alternate, private ten‑second desk action I can do with my hands under the table if the mute/Post‑it fails, and coach me through it with someone yelling my name again so I can practice each beat.
