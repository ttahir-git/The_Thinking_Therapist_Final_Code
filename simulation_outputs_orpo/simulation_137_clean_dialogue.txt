Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — anytime I remember struggling in school I tell myself I'm still a failure. I keep seeing the worst: if I make one mistake at work I'll definitely get reported, lose my job, then lose my home and end up completely isolated and ashamed. I know it sounds extreme, but my mind just keeps playing that story on repeat.

Therapist: That sounds like a really painful pattern. When you notice yourself thinking "I'll lose my job, home, and everything," what's one thing you'd have to do differently to take just a tiny step away from that thought?

Patient: I guess the smallest thing would be to pause and name it — like say to myself, "that's the fortune-telling voice," and take a slow breath before I act. But honestly that feels pointless; my head will just keep spinning the disaster story and acting like pausing changes nothing.

Therapist: I hear you saying that pausing feels like a Band-Aid – it doesn't stop the story, but it's a start. What's one thing you value about being able to act with more clarity, like staying connected to your work or being able to show up for a friend?

Patient: I really value being someone my patients and coworkers can rely on — it's proof I wasn't a total failure in school and that I can do important work. But the thing is, my mind immediately jumps to, "one mistake and a patient gets hurt, someone files a complaint, I get reported and fired and lose everything," so that value just feels fragile and pointless. I know that sounds over the top, but my fortune-telling brain won't let me believe anything less catastrophic.

Therapist: It sounds like the value of being someone others can rely on feels like a lifeline for you. When your mind starts spinning that "one mistake" story, what would it take for you to notice just one tiny difference between what you're imagining (e.g., getting reported and losing everything) and the reality of what might actually happen?

Patient: Maybe the tiny difference is that, realistically, most mistakes get talked through with a supervisor and fixed — people get feedback, not instant firing. But honestly that sounds like wishful thinking; my brain won't buy it — it insists one slip will trigger a complaint, an investigation, my license on the line, then everything collapsing exactly like I picture.

Therapist: That's a really brave attempt to think about what might actually happen – your brain just got stuck in the "worse-case scenario" loop. Can you thank your mind for that story, even though it feels like wishful thinking? What's one thing you can do with that story, instead of letting it control your actions?

Patient: Okay — thank you, mind, for trying to keep me safe by pointing out the worst. Maybe I can say the story out loud, write it down, and set it aside before I act, or bring it up with a trusted coworker so it doesn't just loop in my head. But honestly that already feels naive; my brain will just rewind the whole "complaint → fired → everything lost" movie and won't be convinced.

Therapist: That's a great start – acknowledging the story's function and finding ways to take a step back feels like a small victory. What's one thing you value about taking care of yourself and your relationships right now, like showing up for that coworker or taking a walk with a friend?

Patient: I value being someone others can count on — it proves to me I wasn't the failure I felt like in school and it helps me keep some dignity. But the moment I try to take care of myself or reach out, my mind screams that showing any vulnerability is the first step to people noticing, filing complaints, getting me fired, losing my home, and ending up totally alone, so most of the time I just freeze and don't do the self-care.

Therapist: That's a really tough spot to be in – feeling like vulnerability is the first step toward disaster. What if, just for a tiny moment, you were to say to yourself, "I'm choosing to take care of myself because it matters to me, not because it's safe"?

Patient: I can try saying that to myself, but the second I do my mind starts sprinting — it says being vulnerable makes me a target, someone will notice, file a complaint, HR will dig up my past mistakes, my license will be at risk, and everything will collapse just like the movie in my head. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that story feels louder and more real than any gentle sentence. It pisses me off because saying it feels like pretending, like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Therapist: That sounds like a really raw feeling – like you're stuck between the need to take care of yourself and the fear of being "found out". What's one tiny thing you could do in the next 30 seconds that feels like it matters to you, even if it doesn't feel safe or practical?

Patient: I could take 30 seconds to write the worst story down and put it in a drawer so it's not replaying in my head. But honestly, my mind already says that'll backfire — someone will find it, they'll use it as proof I'm unstable, HR will dig into my past, and that'll kick off the whole complaint → fired → homeless spiral, so even that feels like setting a trap.

Therapist: That's a brave attempt to take control of the story – writing it down might feel like a small act of defiance against the "worst-case scenario" movie playing in your head. What's one value that would be worth risking that tiny act of writing it down, even if it feels like setting a trap?

Patient: I guess the value is holding on to my reliability and dignity — proof to myself that I wasn't a total failure and that I can still be someone people count on. But my mind immediately screams that if I write it down someone will find it, use it to prove I'm unstable, HR will dig up my past, my license will be questioned, I'll get fired and end up completely alone, so it still feels like a trap I shouldn't set.

Therapist: That's a really tough spot to be in – feeling like writing it down would be a trap. What if, instead of writing the whole story down, you just wrote the one sentence that triggers the worst-case scenario (e.g., "Someone will find it and use it to prove I'm unstable") on a sticky note?

Patient: I could try that—stick a single line like "Someone will find this and say I'm unstable" on a note—but my brain already yells that's no different: someone will see it, they'll use it as proof, HR will dig into my past, an investigation will start and then I'm fired and everything falls apart. I know it sounds paranoid, but that disaster-movie just feels louder and more real than the idea of a tiny note.

Therapist: That's a small step to acknowledge the thought – writing just that one sentence on a note feels like a tiny act of honesty. What's one tiny thing you value about holding onto that honesty, even if it feels like a tiny step toward disaster?

Patient: I guess what I value is keeping that honesty because it's proof to myself that I'm not a total failure and it helps me stay grounded in who I am. But the second I let that honesty out it turns into proof—someone will find it, call me unstable, HR will dig up my past, they'll threaten my license, I'll get fired and end up alone—so it feels like I'm handing them the evidence to ruin me. I know it sounds paranoid, but my mind is absolutely convinced that's what will happen.

Therapist: That's a really important value to hold onto – staying grounded in who you are. What if, instead of avoiding the thought, you were to say to yourself, "I'm choosing to hold onto this honesty because it matters to me, even if it feels like it might get used against me"?

Patient: I can try saying that, but it already feels hollow — the moment I do my head starts the same tape: someone finds it, calls me unstable, HR digs into my past, my license is threatened, and everything collapses. It just feels like more noise I have to carry, and I don't see how a sentence will stop that.

Therapist: That sounds really hard – it feels like you're stuck in this cycle. What's one tiny thing you can do right now, without thinking about the outcome or the thought, that feels like it matters to you?

Patient: Maybe I can just sit down, put my hand on my chest, and breathe for 30 seconds. I don't know — it already feels pointless because my head will just start the "they'll find out → HR → fired" movie again, but I'll try.

Therapist: That sounds like a tiny act of kindness to yourself – sitting down and breathing, just for 30 seconds, feels like it matters to you. What's one value that's worth taking care of right now, even if it's just for 30 seconds?

Patient: Being reliable for my patients — proving to myself I'm not that failure from school and holding on to some dignity — feels like the thing worth protecting, even for 30 seconds. But honestly, even that feels like a trap; my head says the minute I try to care for myself someone will notice, call me unstable, HR will dig up my past, and it'll start that whole complaint → fired → homeless spiral, and I'm just kind of worn out by it.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in – feeling like even trying to care for yourself might lead to that cycle. What would you notice about what's already happening right now when you sit down and breathe, without trying to change it?

Patient: My chest feels tight and my thoughts are already sprinting — even as I breathe I can see the whole collapse: someone notices, a complaint gets filed, HR digs into my past, my license's at risk, I'm fired and end up alone. It makes it hard to just notice my body because the movie's louder than the breath.

Therapist: That's a really vivid picture – the chest tightness and the mental movie are both happening right now. Can you notice the breath itself, without trying to stop the story or change it? What's one tiny sensation in your body that's not the story, but just exists alongside it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when I try, I just notice a dull pressure in my chest and a faint tingling in my fingertips. But how is that supposed to help? My brain will just turn any small sign into proof I'm losing it and someone will notice, file a complaint, HR will dig up my past, and everything will fall apart.

Therapist: That's a really small, tiny sensation – the dull pressure in your chest and the tingling in your fingertips. Can you just acknowledge that sensation without trying to label it or make it mean anything? For example, you could say to yourself, "My chest feels tight," without adding a story to it.

Patient: My chest feels tight and my fingertips tingle. But even saying that just becomes another piece of evidence in my head — someone will notice, file a complaint, HR will dig up my past, my license could be threatened, and everything falls apart. I don't really see how just naming it helps.

Therapist: Let's try something different. What happens to the tightness in your chest when you stop paying attention to it?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to stop paying attention the tightness loosens for a few breaths, but only briefly—my brain drags it back and immediately layers on the whole complaint → fired → homeless movie. It ends up feeling pointless, like muting a siren that always turns itself back on.

Therapist: That sounds like a really hard pattern to break – the siren feeling that always turns itself back on. What's one tiny thing that happens right now, while you're noticing the tightness in your chest, that doesn't involve trying to stop it or make it mean anything?

Patient: My shoulders are hunched, my jaw's tight, and my breathing's shallow — my heart's a bit faster too. But even noticing that just turns into more proof in my head that someone will see I'm unsteady, file a complaint, HR will dig up my past, and the whole collapse will start again.

Therapist: Those physical sensations sound really familiar – the hunched shoulders, tight jaw, shallow breathing, and racing heart. Can you notice just one of those sensations, without trying to change it or make it mean anything? For example, you could say to yourself, "My jaw feels tight" – just that one thing – without adding any story to it.

Patient: My jaw feels tight. But the moment I notice that, my mind turns it into proof I'm falling apart and someone will see, file a complaint, HR will dig up my past, and everything will start collapsing again.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is already making the connection between the tight jaw and the story. What if, instead of trying to change the story or fight it, you simply paused for a tiny moment – just one second – before it starts playing out again?

Patient: I could try pausing for a second, but it already feels like the breath before the drop — my head's got the whole complaint → fired → homeless movie queued up and one second won't stop that. I'm kind of worn out from even trying; it feels like pretending a tiny pause will change the outcome. I guess I can try it, but I don't have much hope it'll actually help.

Therapist: That's exactly what it feels like – trying to hold back a storm. Just because you don't think it will make a difference, doesn't mean you shouldn't try. What would it be like to pause right now, just for that one second, without thinking about what happens next?

Patient: If I actually pause, it's like a tiny, fragile silence — my jaw relaxes a hair, my breath catches for a moment. But even then my brain is already narrating the next scene: someone notices, a complaint gets filed, HR digs up my past, and everything starts to fall apart, so the pause feels almost meaningless.

Therapist: That pause was tiny, but it's interesting that it felt fragile. What would you notice about the pause itself, without trying to change the story or think about what happens next? For example, what's the sensation of the breath catching, or the feeling of your jaw relaxing?

Patient: It's a faint catch in my chest and my jaw actually loosens a bit — a tiny hollow quiet, nothing dramatic. But even that gets twisted by my brain into proof I'm falling apart and someone will notice, file a complaint, HR will dig, my license will be at risk, and everything collapses, so the pause already feels pointless.

Therapist: That pause felt small, but it's interesting that your brain immediately tried to turn it into proof. What if, instead of thinking about what happens next, you simply noticed the pause itself – the feeling of the breath catching, the looseness in your jaw?

Patient: I can feel the breath catch and my jaw loosen a little, but it just feels like another tiny crack — my mind immediately slides to someone noticing, a complaint, HR digging up my past, my license being threatened, and then everything collapsing. I don't really get how sitting in that pause is supposed to help; it just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable.

Therapist: When you feel that breath catch, what's the physical sensation of it, just for a moment?

Patient: It's a hollow catch — like my chest drops a little and my throat tightens, breath shallow for a beat, a dizzy little blur. But as soon as I notice that, my brain turns it into proof I'm falling apart and the whole complaint → HR → fired → lose everything movie starts up again.

Therapist: The physical sensation of the breath catch is a bit like a pause in the music – it's a small moment where the rhythm stops. What would it be like to notice just that pause, without thinking about what happens next?

Patient: It's just a tiny hollow second — a quiet, empty pause. But it doesn't help; the moment I feel it my head's already on the movie — someone notices, files a complaint, HR digs up my past, my license's at risk, I'm fired and end up alone — so I don't see how noticing that pause changes anything.
