--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been thrown into a pretty demanding new role as an accountant, and it's been tougher to adjust than I expected. I've been burying myself in hobbies — woodworking, puzzles, gardening — to avoid the stress, but I don't know, I guess it's starting to feel less like relaxing and more like numbing.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes feeling overwhelmed and using hobbies as avoidance, which is a common pattern. Core emotion is likely frustration/numbness. Goal: Explore the tension between using hobbies as avoidance and the underlying value that might be driving this behavior: What's the value that's making you feel like you need to escape into hobbies when you're stressed about your new role?

Therapist Answer:
When you're stressed about work, what's one value that comes up for you that you feel like these hobbies are helping you connect with, even if it feels like you're escaping instead of facing it?

Patient: I guess it's about control and competence — finishing a woodworking project or a puzzle feels like something I can actually manage when work's all over the place. I don't know, it still feels like I'm dodging the messy stuff instead of dealing with it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reveals a key value (control/competence) and how it's driving avoidance. They acknowledge dodging the issue (work stress) instead of facing it. Goal: Pivot from avoidance to action by exploring what "managing" really means in this context: What's the specific behavior they'd need to take towards work to feel like they're managing their stress, rather than just escaping it through hobbies?

Therapist Answer:
When you're working on a project and you feel like you're managing your stress by focusing on it, what's one small thing you could actually do with that same energy towards your work right now, without putting it off?

Patient: I guess I could set a timer for 20 minutes and just tackle one small thing — like reconciling last week's invoices or making a quick checklist for tomorrow — instead of disappearing into woodworking. I don't know, it feels small, but maybe it'd make work feel a bit more under control.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient starts to move towards action by identifying a small, specific behavior they can take (setting a timer for 20 minutes). They also acknowledge the value of feeling "under control" at work. Goal: Refine this action by making it more ACT-aligned: What's the willingness behind this small action, and how might it connect to the value of control/competence they mentioned earlier?

Therapist Answer:
You're willing to take control of your work by tackling one small thing. What would it mean to you to actually feel like you're in charge of your work, not just by checking off a task but by being able to show up with confidence and focus, even when it's hard?

Patient: I guess it would mean not waking up with that knot in my stomach and actually being able to handle emails or a meeting without spiraling. It'd feel like I could speak up when something's off instead of hiding behind a project, and not need to escape so often. I don't know, it's a bit embarrassing to admit, but maybe it'd feel like I'm reliable — to myself.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient connects their small action to a specific emotional benefit (not waking up with a knot in their stomach) and values (being able to handle emails/meetings, speaking up, and feeling reliable). Goal: Reframe this emotional benefit as a tangible, observable behavior (what would "not waking up with a knot" look like in their daily life?).

Therapist Answer:
When you're able to tackle that one small thing without feeling like you're escaping, what would you notice about your body and mind – what would you see, hear, or feel that says you're actually showing up with control and confidence?

Patient: I guess I'd notice that knot in my stomach loosening and my breathing being a bit steadier, and my hands not feeling so restless. My mind would be less jumpy — I might actually finish a thought without it wandering, and there'd be less background worry noise. I don't know, it's just... things would feel smaller, I suppose.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient vividly describes the physical sensations (knot loosening, breathing steadier, hands not restless) and mental shifts (less jumpy mind, finishing thoughts) that would accompany their small action. Goal: Connect these sensations/mind shifts to the value of reliability they mentioned earlier: What would it mean to you to be able to show up with confidence and control, like being able to speak up when something's off, without that knot in your stomach?

Therapist Answer:
When you're able to tackle that small task without escaping, what does it mean to you to be reliable – to yourself, to your work, to the people you care about – that you're not just showing up, but actually being present and capable?

Patient: I guess it would mean I could trust myself — not bailing when things get hard and actually following through on what I say I'll do. To other people, it might mean I'm not constantly cancelling or hiding in a project, like I actually answer emails and show up on time. I don't know, it's a bit embarrassing to say, but maybe it'd take some of this fake-it-until-it-feels-real weight off.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reveals the core value of self-trust and reliability they're striving for. Goal: Connect this value to the small action they've identified: What would it mean to actually trust themselves when they're taking that small task, and how would that change their behavior (showing up on time, answering emails)?

Therapist Answer:
When you're able to take that one small task without escaping, what's the tiny voice that might whisper "you can't do this" – what would it sound like to you to actually challenge that voice and say, "I can trust myself to get this done"?

Patient: It sounds like this quiet, nagging voice saying, "You'll screw it up, you're behind, what's the point?" Challenging it would be more like, "Okay — one small step, you've managed hard stuff before, set a timer and trust yourself to finish it." I don't know, saying that feels a little awkward, like I'm bluffing.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient identifies the nagging voice and the challenge to trust themselves by reframing it with a positive, specific thought ("one small step"). Goal: Explore the feeling of "bluffing" and how it connects to their value of reliability: What would it mean to actually believe in their ability to take that one small step, despite feeling like they're bluffing?

Therapist Answer:
When you say that thought to yourself, what would it feel like to actually mean it – not just as a phrase, but as a lived experience – that you've got this? Would it feel like you're not just pretending, but like you're actually standing in your own strength?

Patient: I don't know, it's hard to picture actually meaning it. I guess it'd feel like a quiet relief — my chest loosening, breathing steadier, less of that buzzy worry, and maybe actually believing I can handle things instead of faking it. I'm getting a bit uncomfortable talking about this — can we also go over how I'd actually start that 20-minute timer thing?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to visualize the feeling of actually meaning it, and it's connected to physical sensations. Goal: Reframe the discomfort of talking about it as an opportunity to practice the very thing they're working on: How would they show up with that quiet relief, chest loosening, and steadier breathing in the moment of starting that timer?

Therapist Answer:
When you sit down to start that timer, what's one tiny thing you can notice about your body that's already changed – something that shows you're not just sitting there, but actually showing up with that quiet relief? (pause) And what if you say to yourself, "I'm starting now, with this breath," and you actually mean it?

Patient: I guess I notice my shoulders drop a little and my breath gets a bit slower, and my hands stop fiddling with my pen. If I say, "I'm starting now, with this breath," I don't know — it feels awkward, but also kind of like I'm giving myself permission to begin instead of running. I guess I could actually try that now and hit the timer, though I'm a bit nervous about whether it’ll stick.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified the physical sensations (shoulders dropping, breath slowing, hands stopping) and is connecting them to their willingness to start with that breath. Goal: Normalize the awkwardness of giving themselves permission and pivot to the action: What's the smallest, most tangible next step to actually start that timer?

Therapist Answer:
Let's make a tiny commitment: You'll just hit the timer for 20 seconds, and that's it. No thinking about the rest of the task, no worrying about getting it "right." Just the timer going off, and you noticing what happens in that moment. Can you do that with me?

Patient: I guess I can try. Okay, I'm starting the timer now — I notice my shoulders drop a bit and my breath slows. I don't know if it'll stick, but I'll wait and see.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking and Answer keywords missing]

Therapist Answer:
That's it. You started.

Patient: I guess that was...surprisingly okay — my shoulders really did loosen a bit and the thought noise quieted. I don't know, I'm nervous about doing the full 20 minutes, but maybe we could pick one tiny, specific task I can try next? I guess I'd rather have something concrete than just a vague plan.


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is acknowledging the small success and seeking concrete action: a specific task to build on the momentum. Goal: Identify a tiny, tangible task that's connected to their values and is low enough to build confidence: What's one tiny step they can take next that feels concrete and manageable?

Therapist Answer:
Let's choose something that's already on your plate tomorrow. What's one small thing you need to do to move your project forward – just one thing, like checking a specific email or making a quick call?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I guess one small thing could be replying to Mr. Harper's email about the missing invoice and attaching the reconciliation I already started — just a quick draft and send. I don't know, it feels a bit exposing to say I'll do it, but I can try.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a specific task (replying to Mr. Harper's email) and is willing to try it, despite some self-protection. Goal: Reframe the "exposure" as a necessary step to build trust in themselves: What would it mean to actually commit to this small action, and how might that connect to their values?

Therapist Answer:
When you reply to Mr. Harper's email with that quick draft, what would you notice about your body – your posture, your breathing – as you're sending it out?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my body supposed to help? I guess I'd notice my shoulders pull back a tiny bit and my breath slow a notch, and my hands stop hovering and actually press the keys. I don't know, it's awkward to say, but when I hit send there'd be this little flutter in my chest—half relief, half "what now"—and I might immediately want to dive into a hobby to avoid feeling it.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified the physical sensations (shoulders pulling back, breath slowing, hands pressing keys) and is connecting them to the mixed emotions (relief and anxiety) that come after hitting send. Goal: Normalize the emotional response and pivot to the action: What would it mean to actually notice and ride that flutter without immediately escaping into a hobby?

Therapist Answer:
When that flutter shows up, what would you say to it – not as a thought, but as a tiny phrase that you notice yourself saying?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying a phrase supposed to help? I guess I'd hear myself whisper something like "just one step" or "you can handle this," but I don't know, saying it feels a bit fake and I'm getting uncomfortable talking about it.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to connect with the phrase ("just one step" or "you can handle this") as a potential anchor, but is struggling with the discomfort of saying it out loud. Goal: Reframe the discomfort as a sign of progress: What would it mean to actually pause, notice the discomfort, and say that phrase to yourself – and what might that do for the nervous flutter?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something small: when that flutter shows up next time, instead of pushing it away, what if you just paused for a tiny second – just one second – before saying "just one step" to yourself?

Patient: I guess I could try pausing that one second before saying "just one step." I'm not sure it'll feel real — I don't know, it might still feel fake — but maybe the pause could stop me from sprinting into a hobby. Honestly, I'm getting a bit uncomfortable talking about this; can we try it once now, like practice the pause here?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to take small action and practice the pause, despite feeling uncomfortable. Goal: Create a moment of tangible practice: What's the exact action they can take in this moment to practice the pause?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it right now. When you feel that flutter in your chest after hitting send, I want you to pause for just one second before saying "just one step" to yourself. That's it. One second. As soon as you feel that flutter, take a tiny breath in and out, and then pause for one second before saying those words.

Patient: Okay — I'll try it now. I feel that flutter in my chest, I take a tiny breath in and out, I pause one second... "just one step." I don't know, that did make the urge to dive into a hobby a bit quieter, but I'm still uneasy and kind of embarrassed — can we do that again? I guess I'd like to practice it a couple more times.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken small action (practicing the pause) and noticed a subtle shift in their physical response (the urge to dive into a hobby quieted). Goal: Build on this small win by adding a new layer of self-compassion: What would it mean to acknowledge their own nervousness and uncertainty as a natural part of this process?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it again. When you feel that flutter in your chest this time, notice how your body feels, and then say to yourself: "I'm feeling nervous right now, and that's okay. It's normal to feel this way when I'm taking small steps outside my comfort zone."

Patient: I don't know… I feel that flutter—my chest tightens, my shoulders tense, and my hands get a bit shaky. "I'm feeling nervous right now, and that's okay. It's normal to feel this way when I'm taking small steps outside my comfort zone." I guess saying that felt awkward but a little calmer — I'm getting uneasy talking about this; can we do it once more or maybe try drafting that quick reply to Mr. Harper now?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has practiced self-compassion and acknowledged their nervousness, which has helped calm their physical response. Goal: Connect the emotional shift with the tangible action of drafting the reply: What would it mean to take action while holding this new awareness?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it one more time. When you feel that flutter, remember that you're taking small steps outside your comfort zone, and you've got this. Now, take a moment to think about drafting that quick reply to Mr. Harper. What's one thing you can say to him that feels authentic and takes action towards moving forward?

Patient: I don't know, maybe something simple and to the point like: "Hi Mr. Harper — thanks for flagging the missing invoice. I've attached the reconciliation for last week and the updated invoice; please let me know if you need anything else. I’ll follow up by end of day if I don’t hear back."

I guess that feels a bit exposing, but I can try drafting and sending it now if you want to keep me on track — I'm nervous about hitting send.


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has drafted a clear and concise reply, which shows they're taking action while holding the new awareness of their nervousness. Goal: Practice the final step of sending the email while acknowledging their nervousness: What would it mean to actually send the email and see the outcome?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it. You've drafted the reply, and now it's time to send it. As you hit send, remember that you've taken a small step outside your comfort zone, and you've done it with awareness and self-compassion. What do you think might happen next?

Patient: I don't know... if I hit send I might feel a small relief, then that old shame flares up — like I did something wrong before and everyone's going to notice. I guess I'll either obsessively check my inbox and then disappear into woodworking to numb it, or maybe I'll sit with the uneasy feeling and actually wait for a reply. I'm really nervous about doing it — can you stay with me while I send it?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is anticipating the mixed emotions that might follow sending the email, including the risk of shame. Goal: Offer a gentle, present moment accompaniment while they take action: What would it mean to stay with the nervousness as they send the email, without judgment?

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you. As you hit send, I'll be right here, noticing your nervousness with you. When you feel that shame start to rise, I want you to pause with me for just a tiny breath – one second – before letting it go. We can sit with that uneasy feeling together, without trying to push it away or numb it. You're taking a small step towards moving forward, and I'm here to support you.

Patient: I hit send, and I don't know — that shame just washed over me like I did something stupid, like everyone will see right through me. I'm kind of confused about why an email makes me feel that way, and I guess that confusion just makes it worse. Can you stay with me and do that tiny one-second breath pause together before I check my inbox? I'm nervous and embarrassed saying this, but I need you to stay with it.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with shame and confusion after sending the email, and is reaching out for support to stay with the moment. Goal: Create a tiny, tangible pause by anchoring it in the breath, while acknowledging their vulnerability: What would it mean to stay with this moment of nervousness, without judgment, and find a way to observe it without getting caught up in shame?

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you. Let's take just one tiny breath together – one second – and notice how your body feels, without trying to change it or push it away. I'll breathe in with you, and when we're done, we can look at your inbox together, but for now, let's just stay with this feeling. Can you feel your chest, your shoulders, your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay… I can feel my chest tight and my shoulders up by my ears, my breath is shallow but it's slowing a bit, and my feet are planted. There's this familiar heat of shame bubbling up — I don't know, like something I've done before — and it makes me want to bolt to the woodworking bench. I guess I can stay with you for now, but I'm nervous and might clam up if it gets too close.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is noticing the physical sensations and the familiar heat of shame, and is willing to stay with it for now, despite the discomfort. Goal: Reframe the heat of shame as a signal that they're actually close to the thing they've been avoiding, and gently challenge the urge to bolt: What would it mean to notice the shame without trying to escape, and see what happens when they actually stay with it?

Therapist Answer:
That heat of shame feels familiar, doesn't it? Like it's something you've felt before. What if, instead of trying to escape to the woodworking bench, you noticed what's really going on with that heat? What if you allowed it to be there, just as it is, without trying to change it? Can you imagine what might happen if you just stayed with that feeling, without pushing it away or trying to distract yourself?

Patient: I don't know… staying with that heat feels risky, like if I look at it it'll swallow me whole. I guess part of me thinks if I let it sit for 30 seconds it might ease, but I'm embarrassed — that old failure keeps coloring everything and makes me want to bolt to the woodworking bench. Can we try a very short practice together, like 30 seconds of noticing with you right there?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to take a tiny risk and try a short practice to see if they can tolerate the heat of shame without bolting. Goal: Create a tiny, tangible commitment to stay with the feeling for just 30 seconds, while acknowledging the underlying fear of failure: What would it mean to notice the shame without trying to escape, and see what happens when they commit to just 30 seconds?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it. We'll sit with that heat for just 30 seconds, right here, right now. I'll notice it with you. When you feel that urge to bolt, we'll pause together and breathe. Just 30 seconds. That's it. We'll count it down together: 30, 29, 28... and when we're done, we'll look at your inbox.

Patient: Okay… I can try. I don't know, there's this hot shame in my chest and I really want to bolt to the woodworking bench — it feels like that old mess is sitting on me. I guess I can sit for 30 seconds if you count with me, but if it gets too much say so and we’ll stop; I'm nervous and might clam up.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking a tiny risk and committing to stay with the heat of shame for 30 seconds, while acknowledging their underlying fear of failure. Goal: Create a safe space for them to notice the shame without judgment, and gently introduce the concept of "as it is" without pushing it away: What would it mean to notice the shame exactly as it is, without trying to change it, and see what happens when they acknowledge it with just one word?

Therapist Answer:
30... 29... 28... Let's say it with me: "This shame is here." That's it. Just those two words: "This shame is here." No judgment, no interpretation. Just noticing it exactly as it is.

Patient: I don't know... "This shame is here." Saying that makes my face hot and I feel that old failure wash over me — I'm suddenly angry at myself and embarrassed, like I want to run to the woodworking bench. I guess I can try to stay with it, but it's hard; can we keep counting or do another tiny breath together?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with intense shame and anger, and is having trouble staying with the tiny anchor of "this shame is here". Goal: Introduce a small shift in language to help them stay with the feeling without getting caught up in the shame story: What would it mean to change the way they're talking to the shame, from "I'm a failure" to something more neutral, and see what happens when they stay with it?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try one tiny shift. Instead of saying "This shame is here", let's say "Shame is here". No judgment, no interpretation. Just noticing that the word "shame" is present. Can you stay with that tiny phrase for just one more breath?

Patient: "Shame is here." I can feel my face go hot and my chest tighten, my hands want to move — I want to bolt to the woodworking bench. I don't know, I'm getting embarrassed — can we do another breath or keep counting? I guess I need you to stay with me because I might clam up if it gets too close.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the small shift in language, and is starting to feel overwhelmed again. Goal: Create a sense of safety and containment by acknowledging their physical tension and offering a gentle pause: What would it mean to acknowledge their physical tension without pushing it away, and see what happens when they take a tiny pause?

Therapist Answer:
You're feeling the physical tension, and that's okay. It's like your body is saying, "Whoa, this is uncomfortable." Let's take a tiny pause right there. Just one second, without trying to change it or push it away. Can you breathe with me, and notice what's happening in your body, exactly as it is?

Patient: Okay… I can try to breathe with you. My shoulders are up, my chest feels hot and tight, and my hands are a bit shaky — I don't know, it actually loosens a notch when I slow my breath, but I'm nervous it’ll get worse and I'll bolt to the woodworking bench. I guess I can stay for one more breath if you keep counting with me.
