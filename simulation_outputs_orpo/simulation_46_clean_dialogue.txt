Patient: Honestly, what's been circling my thoughts is this pervasive sense of being stuck—like my identity has calcified around being the business owner and I don't recognize anything beyond that. I've been dealing with burnout and a persistent loneliness, but when I try to talk about it I default to analyzing systemic pressures and narrative identity instead of naming the simple feelings. I want to find what actually matters to me beyond the company, but I have a habit of intellectualizing to avoid feeling the fear or grief underneath.

Therapist: When you say "I don't recognize anything beyond the business," what's the sensation like in your body when you imagine not being that person? For example, what happens to your chest, stomach, or breath if you try to imagine yourself not being defined by the company?

Patient: Physically it’s like a clamp across my chest—tight, like anxiety—but my instinct is to label it as an anticipatory stress response rather than sit with it. My breath shortens and I notice a hollow, knotted feeling in my stomach that I tend to intellectualize as “existential vacuity” instead of admitting it feels like grief or loss. Then I immediately start theorizing about identity foreclosure and role-based selfhood to keep some distance.

Therapist: The physical sensation of the clamp across your chest is really present right now, isn't it? Without trying to label it or change it, can you just notice it as you exhale, letting the breath fill your chest and loosen that knot in your stomach a tiny bit?

Patient: I try to do that, and when I exhale I notice a tiny release—the clamp loosens maybe a hair, my breath goes a bit deeper, the knot in my stomach doesn't vanish but it shifts. But almost immediately my head kicks in and starts labeling it—“somatic markers of role-loss” and all that—rather than just feeling it, which is frustrating. Can we slow down? It's hard to stay with this without retreating into theory.

Therapist: What's the one thing you'd notice about this knot in your stomach if you weren't thinking about it at all? What would it be if you just let it be, without trying to change it or understand it?

Patient: If I let it be, the one thing I'd notice is a heavy, dull pressure low in my stomach—like a small, cold stone sitting under my ribs. It sort of pulses with my breath, makes swallowing feel tight, and there's this blank, exhausted ache to it; my brain wants to call it “existential vacuity,” but it just feels like grief.

Therapist: That heavy, dull pressure feels like it's been there a long time. What would you do with a small piece of paper and a pen if you were to write down just one word that feels connected to that pressure right now, without trying to change it or understand it?

Patient: I'd write "loss." My reflex is to dress it up as "existential vacuity" or "identity foreclosure," but stripped down it's just loss—and admitting that feels oddly vulnerable.

Therapist: What would you lose if you weren't holding onto the identity of being the business owner? What value might be connected to that part of you that's now feeling empty?

Patient: You'd lose a lot of scaffolding—the day-to-day purpose that structures my time, the authority that validates my competence, and the financial and social security that feels like a safety net. What I actually value is responsibility, stewardship, autonomy, and the tangible sense of efficacy—those are the things tied up in being the owner, so when the company feels empty those values feel unmoored and it shows up as grief and fear, even though I immediately reframe it as a question of role-integration. Admitting that feels risky, like if I stop intellectualizing I might have to sit with how small and exposed I feel, and I can already feel the urge to retreat into analysis.

Therapist: What's the smallest, most concrete action you could take today to hold onto the value of responsibility, without needing to fix the company? For example, if you're in a meeting, what's one tiny thing you could do to stay connected to that sense of responsibility, even if it feels small?

Patient: Maybe the smallest thing is to send one sincere, two-sentence message to a team member right now—acknowledge a specific thing they did and say you noticed. It’s concrete, enacts stewardship, and doesn’t try to “fix” anything, though I can already hear myself wondering if it’s performative instead of real. Can we unpack how to make that feel less like a gesture and more like something that actually steadies me?

Therapist: What's the one thing that would happen to your physical body or emotional tone if you sent that message and it didn't feel like it was "me" (i.e., not performative)? What would you notice about your chest, stomach, or breath if you let go of the need for it to be authentic, and just focus on the action of sending it?

Patient: If I actually sent it and dropped the need for it to prove anything, I'd notice my chest loosen a hair and my breath get a bit steadier—like the sharpness of that hollow eases. My stomach would still have that cold pebble, but it might stop pulsing so insistently. Then my head jumps in with an authenticity checklist—“Is this performative? Is this reputation management?”—and that thought tightens everything again. I don't know, I'm having a hard time just trying it without it feeling staged; can we slow down so I don't retreat into analysis?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the cold pebble in your stomach right now, without trying to change it or question it. Just acknowledge it as it is, without judgment. Can you hold onto that sensation for just one more breath, without adding any thoughts or questions to it?

Patient: I'm trying to hold it—on this breath I actually notice the cold pebble, a slight loosening in my chest and a deeper exhale. But almost immediately my head slaps a label on it—"somatic echo of role-loss"—and that label pushes the feeling away, which makes me frustrated and a little embarrassed. Can we stay with it more slowly? I don't want to intellectualize this into oblivion, but I'm struggling not to.

Therapist: Instead of labeling the sensation as "somatic echo of role-loss," what if you just said to yourself, "This is what's happening right now"? Just that one simple phrase, without adding any judgment or interpretation to it. Can you hold onto that phrase for just one more beat, without adding anything else to it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I tried saying the phrase to myself and for a brief beat the clamp eased and my breath deepened, but then my brain immediately intellectualized it—turned it into a script to perform—so it felt fake instead of felt. Can we slow down? I want to stay with it but I keep retreating into analysis and it's getting frustrating.

Therapist: Let's go back to the moment when the feeling was present before the label came in. Remember how it felt to notice the cold pebble in your stomach and the slight loosening in your chest? Can you simply notice that sensation again, without trying to change it or question it?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try, but I'm not sure I follow how this actually helps long-term. I bring my attention back to the cold pebble in my stomach and the clamp in my chest; on this breath the clamp loosens a fraction and the pebble feels colder and more distinct, like something sitting there that wants to be noticed. But almost immediately my mind generates a taxonomy—“defensive intellectualization,” “protective dissociation”—and that taxonomy pushes the feeling away, which makes me annoyed and a little ashamed. Can we slow down so I can practice staying with it without your prompts triggering my analytic reflex?

Therapist: Just notice the cold pebble in your stomach, the clamp in your chest, and the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Don't try to change it, don't try to label it. Just be with it as it is.

Patient: I'm trying—there it is: the cold pebble low in my stomach, the clamp in my chest, my breath a bit clipped. But I'm not sure I follow—how is "just be with it" supposed to help? That phrasing feels vague and my mind immediately turns it into an analysis to manage, so can we slow down and you give me one tiny, concrete thing to do with my body so I don't retreat into theory?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet.

Patient: Okay—I notice the soles of my feet on the floor, a steady pressure under my heels and the balls of my feet, and it's oddly stabilizing; my chest eases a fraction. But I'm already narrativizing it as "embodied anchoring," which immediately pulls me out of the felt experience. Can you give me one tiny, concrete instruction to keep my attention there—like count three slow breaths with each exhale focused on the feet—so I don't drift back into analysis?

Therapist: As you exhale, notice the sound of your breath leaving your body. Try to listen to the exact sound of it leaving your mouth, without thinking about it or labeling it.

Patient: I can hear the soft whoosh as the air leaves my mouth and for a beat my chest loosens, but my head immediately labels it an "auditory somatic marker" and everything gets distanced again. I'm not sure I follow how listening to that helps—it's getting frustrating—can we slow down and try something concrete, like five slow exhales where I quietly say "out" each time so I have a simple anchor that doesn't invite analysis?

Therapist: Make a small "out" sound with each slow exhale: "out... out... out... out... out." Say it quietly, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: Okay—I did five slow "out" exhales: out... out... out... out... out. For a few breaths my chest loosened and the cold pebble in my stomach quieted a little, my breath felt deeper, but almost immediately my head called it a "vocal anchor" and started critiquing whether it was authentic, which tightened me again. Can we slow down and do another round where you guide me to pair each "out" with a brief note of where my feet are, so I have something concrete to hold onto instead of drifting into analysis?

Therapist: As you exhale, notice your feet again: the weight on the balls of your feet, the pressure under your heels. Say "out" as you exhale, and notice that sound: "out... out... out... out... out." Focus on the sensation of your feet and the sound of your breath leaving your mouth.

Patient: Okay—I did it: five slow "out" exhales while paying attention to the weight under my heels and the balls of my feet. For a couple breaths my chest loosened and that cold pebble in my stomach quieted a notch, but almost immediately my mind called it a "vocal‑kinesthetic anchoring" and started critiquing whether it was contrived, which tightened me again. Can we slow down and do another round where you help me keep attention on the feet between exhales? I'm worried I'll just slip back into analysis if it's too abstract.

Therapist: Notice the word "sole". Say it to yourself as you inhale: "sole". Hold onto that word for a beat. Now, exhale slowly: "out... out... out... out... out." As you say "out", notice the weight on the balls of your feet.

Patient: Okay—I inhaled the word "sole" and held it, then did five slow outs: out... out... out... out... out. I felt the weight on the balls of my feet and a brief easing in my chest, but almost immediately a hot rush of shame and self-criticism tightened my throat and made my breath shallow again. My brain wants to relabel that rush as "perfectionistic monitoring" instead of just feeling how embarrassed and frustrated it is, so can we slow down and keep a simple, concrete cue between exhales so I don't slip back into critique?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Between each exhale, pause for a brief moment to notice this sensation. No thinking, just noticing.

Patient: I did what you asked—I noticed the soles of my feet and paused between exhales, and for a couple breaths it actually felt steadier. Then a hot spike of shame and frustration rushed up—my throat tightened, my shoulders hiked, and my breath clipped—and my reflex is to reframe it as "perfectionistic residue" instead of just admitting I feel small and embarrassed. I don't want to escape into analysis again; can we keep doing that grounding exercise but with one tiny, concrete cue (like tap the floor once between exhales) so I have something to come back to when the critique pulls me away?

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", tap the floor with your big toe once. Just a small tap. Hold onto that sensation for a beat. Now, exhale slowly: "out... out... out... out... out." As you say "out", notice the weight on the balls of your feet.

Patient: I did it—I inhaled “sole,” tapped my big toe once, and did five slow “out” exhales while noticing the weight on the balls of my feet. For a breath or two my chest eased and the pebble in my stomach quieted, but then a hot spike of shame and self‑criticism rushed in—throat tight, shoulders up, breath shallow—and my head immediately labeled it so I could distance from feeling it. I'm frustrated and embarrassed by how fast I slip into analysis; can we keep doing another round but with one tiny concrete cue between exhales (like a gentle tap under my heel) so I have something physical to come back to when the critique pulls me away?

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", gently press the heel of your foot into the floor, just below your ankle. Hold onto that pressure for a beat. Now, exhale slowly: "out... out... out... out... out." As you say "out", notice the weight on the balls of your feet.

Patient: I did it—I inhaled “sole,” pressed my heel into the floor, and did five slow “out” exhales while noticing the weight on the balls of my feet; for a breath or two my chest eased and the pebble quieted. Then a hot flush of shame and frustration surged—throat tight, shoulders up, breath shallow—and my reflex was to label it “perfectionistic residue” instead of just admitting I feel small and embarrassed. Can we slow down and do another very slow round, with a single concrete cue I can use when the critique pulls me away (like holding the heel press for three full seconds between exhales)?

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor and hold it for three full seconds. Don't release it yet. Now, exhale slowly: "out... out... out... out... out." As you say "out", notice the weight on the balls of your feet.

Patient: I did it — inhaled “sole,” pressed my heel for three seconds, then exhaled the five “outs” while noticing the weight on the balls of my feet. For a couple breaths the chest eased and the pebble quieted, but then a hot spike of shame and that old failure‑rush tightened my throat and shoulders and made my breath shallow, and my head immediately tried to recast it as “perfectionistic monitoring” so I wouldn’t have to feel how small and embarrassed I am. Can we slow down and do another very slow round where I keep the heel press and, between exhales, quietly whisper “here” as a single, concrete anchor so I don’t slip back into analysis?

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor and hold it for three seconds. Now, exhale slowly: "out...". As you exhale, whisper "here" to yourself, just one word, without thinking about it. Now, exhale again: "out...". Whisper "here" again, without judgment.

Patient: I did it—I inhaled “sole,” pressed my heel, and whispered “here” on each exhale. For a breath or two my chest softened and the pebble quieted, but then a hot rush of shame slammed in, my throat tightened, and my reflex was to call it “perfectionistic monitoring” so I could distance from feeling small and embarrassed. Can we slow down and try another very slow round where I keep the heel press and whisper “here,” but pause for three full seconds between exhales so I can try to notice the shame without my head turning it into theory?

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor and hold it for three seconds. Now, exhale slowly: "out...". As you exhale, whisper "here" to yourself, just one word. Take three full seconds to notice the sensation of the shame in your body, without thinking about it or labeling it. Just notice it. Now, exhale again: "out...". Take three full seconds to notice again.

Patient: I did it — inhaled “sole,” pressed my heel, whispered “here” and tried to hold those three seconds; when I deliberately noticed the shame I felt a hot flush in my face, my throat tightened like there was a lump, my shoulders went up, and that cold pebble seemed to shift into a constricting ache. Almost immediately my brain tries to reframe it as “perfectionistic monitoring” to avoid the embarrassment, which makes me annoyed with myself and then more ashamed. Can we slow way down and do it one exhale at a time with you counting aloud the three seconds so I have a concrete container, because if I’m left to my own devices I’ll just intellectualize again?

Therapist: Let's start with the first exhale. As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor. When you exhale, I'll count aloud: "One...". Take three full seconds to notice the sensation of the shame in your body. Just notice it, without thinking about it or labeling it. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Two...".

Patient: I did the second exhale when you said "Two..." — holding those three seconds made the shame surge hotter, my face flushed, throat tightened into that familiar lump and my shoulders shot up, and then my mind immediately recast it as "perfectionistic monitoring" to avoid just feeling small and embarrassed. I'm not sure I follow how labeling helps; can you keep counting slowly through "Three" out loud so I have a concrete container, because if it's left abstract I just retreat into analysis and get more frustrated.

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor. When you exhale, I'll count aloud: "One...". Take three full seconds to notice the sensation of the shame in your body. Just notice it, without thinking about it or labeling it. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Two...". Your face is flushed, your throat is tight, and your shoulders are up. Just notice that. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Three...".

Patient: When you said "Three..." the shame spiked—hot in my face, throat like a lump, shoulders shot up, breath went shallow, and that cold pebble tightened into a knot. My head immediately wanted to rename it "perfectionistic monitoring" so I could step back from feeling small, which only makes me more annoyed and ashamed. Can we keep going with another very slow round where you count me through five and tell me exactly when to release the heel press? I'm trying not to default to analysis but I feel overwhelmed and need that concrete container.

Therapist: As you inhale the word "sole", press your heel into the floor. When you exhale, I'll count aloud: "One...". Take three full seconds to notice the sensation of the shame in your body. Just notice it, without thinking about it or labeling it. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Two...". Your face is flushed, your throat is tight, and your shoulders are up. Just notice that. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Three...". The knot in your stomach is getting tighter. Just notice it. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Four...". Your breath is shallow, and you're feeling small. Just notice that. When you're ready, exhale again, and I'll count: "Five...".

Patient: When you hit "Five..." the shame hit full force—hot face, lump in my throat, shoulders up, breath practically stopped and that pebble tightened into a knot; I almost want to cry and then immediately get embarrassed about wanting to cry. My head immediately tries to rename it "perfectionistic monitoring" so I can step back, which just makes me more ashamed and frustrated. Can we do another very slow round right now where you count me through one to five and say "release" out loud when I should let the heel press go, and please go slower so I have a real container so I don't slip into analysis?
