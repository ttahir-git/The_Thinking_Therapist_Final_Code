Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this weird loop of pervasive sadness and motivational anhedonia since the breakup — I can't seem to muster the energy to ship features at work or even follow through on small plans. My OCD makes it worse: I get hyper-analytical, replaying scenarios and interrogating every decision instead of actually feeling anything. I realize I'm explaining and theorizing about my emotions more than sitting with them, which I think is part of the stuckness.

Therapist: When you notice yourself getting stuck in hyper-analysis, what's the smallest, most concrete thing you'd need to do right now to take one tiny step towards your values (e.g., "What would it be like to write just one line of code, even if it's imperfect?")?

Patient: In theory, the minimal viable action is a micro-commit: open the editor, set a five-minute timer, and type one line — a console.log, a TODO comment, or a tiny function stub — then save and commit. That single, bounded behavior is enough to bypass the decision-paralysis loop my OCD loves to manufacture. I can talk about it like it's a neat intervention, but honestly I'm already feeling a bit shaky at the idea of actually doing it.

Therapist: What's the smallest value that would show up if you took that one tiny step of opening the editor, setting the timer, and typing one line – something that feels almost silly, but could be worth risking a tiny bit of imperfection to move towards?

Patient: Maybe "consistency" or "integrity" — basically honoring the commitment I make to myself, even in microscopic doses. It sounds a bit grandiose for one line of code, but it would be proof-of-concept that I can complete something, which chips away at the OCD story of perpetual failure; I'm mostly saying that as analysis because actually admitting how anxious and sad that feels is harder.

Therapist: That value sounds important, but what if, instead of "honoring consistency," you just noticed what would happen if you typed that one line without judgment – what's the physical sensation in your body, the thought that shows up, or the tiny spark of curiosity?

Patient: Physically it’s like a low, dull pressure across my chest and a tightening in my throat; my shoulders tense and my fingers go a little numb, like anticipation recast as discomfort. The immediate thought is this recursive narrative — “if I do this it’ll either validate me or expose my incompetence” — followed by a cascade of hypotheticals and logistical minutiae. Still, there’s a tiny, almost mischievous curiosity — “what if I deliberately write something crappy and see what happens?” — and that ember feels like the only plausible thing to nudge with a five-minute timer, even though admitting that makes me jittery.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to push through the discomfort, you just leaned into that tiny, mischievous spark – what if you allowed yourself to write something "crappy" (whatever that means) for just one line, and saw what happens to the narrative in your head when you did?

Patient: If I actually typed that crappy line and made a micro-commit, I think it would create a tiny prediction error that undermines the all-or-nothing script my OCD runs — like evidence that imperfection doesn't equal catastrophe, which could loosen the loop of rumination. My body would probably react with that same chest-tug and jittery palms, though there might also be a weird little relief, like pressure released in small increments. I could try it now — I'm anxious just saying that, but also oddly curious.

Therapist: With that tiny line of code, what's the one tiny thing you could do to make it just a little bit more manageable – what's the smallest, most absurdly easy action that would make you say, "Okay, I'll try"?

Patient: The absolute bare minimum that would get me over the hump is this: open the editor, create or open any file, set a 60‑second timer, and type a single character — a semicolon or console.log('hi') — then save and close. I know that sounds almost performative, and my brain already wants to philosophize about why micro‑commitment works, but saying that out loud makes my chest tighten and my palms warm, and weirdly that tiny, defined boundary feels doable.

Therapist: Instead of saying "I'll open the editor and type a semicolon," what if you simply noticed what happens when you opened the editor – what's the sensation in your fingers, the thought that shows up, or the tiny shift in your body?

Patient: My fingers get a little tingly, like a low electrical buzz, and my palms warm up when I open the editor — there's a subtle tremor as I hover over the keys. The thought that pops up is this rehearsed critique: "Is this good enough? Will this one line out me as a fraud?" and I catch myself engaging in meta‑cognition instead of actually experiencing the feeling. Physically my chest tightens for a beat and then, if I let it, there's a tiny loosening in my shoulders and a guilty spark of curiosity that wants to push a key just to see what happens.

Therapist: That rehearsed critique – what role does it play in the story you're telling yourself about this moment? What would happen to the tension in your chest if you didn't let that thought get to be the boss for just one second?

Patient: It functions like a gatekeeper in the story I tell myself—everything becomes a pass/fail exam where messing up would 'prove' I'm incompetent, so the critique protects me by freezing me into analysis instead of risk. If I let that thought stop running the show for even one second, the pressure in my chest would probably loosen a notch, my hands would unclench, and a small, stupid curiosity would get through — which feels equal parts hopeful and terrifying. I'm trying to picture that looseness, but already I'm arguing with myself about whether it's safe, and that argument makes me jittery.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "let go" of the critique or worry about safety, you simply noticed what happens when you pause from that thought for just one breath – what's the sensation in your chest, the feeling in your hands, or the tiny shift in your body that shows up when you stop trying to analyze it?

Patient: When I pause for a single breath the chest pressure attenuates a notch — like someone loosened a belt — and my fingers unclench so the micro‑tremor quiets. Cognitively the metacognitive commentary loses a little volume and a small, embarrassed curiosity creeps in, but my reflex is to translate that sensation into an explanation instead of inhabiting it. I can say all that, but honestly I still feel wary of staying with the quiet; my brain immediately wants to theorize about why I'm avoiding it.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to explain why you're staying with the quiet, you simply noticed the quiet itself – what does it feel like to be without the commentary, without the critique, without the need to "make sense" of it?

Patient: It’s like a thin, cool pocket behind my sternum — not empty, just attenuated pressure, like sound turned down instead of off. My shoulders drop a hair and my fingers feel less electric; there's a fragile, embarrassed curiosity poking through. I want to immediately theorize — attachment schemas, predictive error, self‑esteem heuristics — and I'm doing that now, but the quiet itself is just lighter and oddly vulnerable, and that makes me both relieved and on edge.

Therapist: That fragile curiosity – what would it take for you to stay with this quiet, even if it's just for a moment, without trying to analyze it away – what's the value that shows up when you let it be vulnerable, like that cool pocket behind your sternum?

Patient: I guess the value is something like authenticity or relational courage — permission to be small and allowable rather than performatively competent. Practically, it'd take a tiny scaffold: set a 30‑second timer, take one grounding breath, and commit to staying curious for that one window; even saying that makes my chest loosen a bit, and then my brain wants to narrate why it's safe or not. I'm trying to feel that looseness instead of explaining it, but I'm already slipping into analysis because being vulnerable feels risky.

Therapist: What if, instead of explaining why the chest is loosening, you simply noticed that it's loosening – what does that feel like, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: It’s a small, cool space under my sternum — like the belt loosened a notch — and my breath feels a bit fuller, my shoulders down a hair. But my attention’s jumpy now; the OCD brain launches into a ricochet of what‑ifs and to‑dos, so the looseness feels slippery and I'm anxious about losing it. I want to stay with it for a single breath, but already I’m making a checklist instead of just being there.

Therapist: Instead of "I'm losing it," notice what happens to the breath when you let go of the "to-do" list – what's the sensation in your body, the thought that shows up, or the tiny shift in your chest as you just breathe?

Patient: When I let go the breath actually lengthens—a slower in and a longer out—and the chest relaxes like someone loosened a belt notch. But my attention instantly ricochets to a checklist and worst‑case scenarios, so the looseness feels fragile and I get anxious about losing it. I'm trying to stay with the breath, but the OCD part of me starts narrating and planning, and that makes me jittery and distracted—how do I keep from getting pulled back into the story?

Therapist: Notice what happens to the breath when you say to yourself, "Just this breath," – what's the sensation in your body, the thought that shows up, or the tiny shift in your chest as you say that simple phrase?

Patient: When I tell myself "just this breath" the inhale slows a notch and the exhale stretches out, and there's a tiny unclenching under my sternum with my shoulders dropping half a degree. But almost instantly a meta‑narrative whispers, "Are you doing this right or just avoiding work?" and that thought yanks my attention back into planning, so the ease feels very provisional.

Therapist: Instead of "Am I doing this right or just avoiding work?", notice what happens when you say to yourself, "What's the thought that just showed up?" – what's the sensation of that thought in your body, or the words themselves that came up?

Patient: It showed up as, pretty bluntly, "Are you avoiding this? Are you wasting time?" — the words feel accusatory and tinny. In my body it's a leaden knot under the sternum and a hollow in my throat, and I can feel myself sliding into meta‑analysis to avoid sitting with that.

Therapist: Notice the leaden knot under your sternum – what would it look like if you just acknowledged it, without trying to change it or make sense of it?

Patient: It looks like a small, dense pebble — dull gray and lodged under my sternum, pressing into the hollow. I can say it's there and let it be, even though my brain instantly wants to slap a label on it (“avoidance,” “failure”) and start strategizing; acknowledging it like that feels a little relieving and also kind of draining, and I can feel myself teetering back toward analysis.

Therapist: What would it take to simply say to yourself, "This thought is here" – without trying to change it, without trying to label it, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: Probably I’d have to actually say it out loud — “This thought is here” — while resting a hand on that pebble under my sternum and taking one slow, deliberate breath. It feels embarrassingly simple and my brain’s already drafting a million contingencies, but maybe the bare minimum is the phrase + the hand + that one breath.

Therapist: Say the phrase out loud: "This thought is here" – without adding anything else, just let it be the simple statement that acknowledges the thought's presence.

Patient: This thought is here

Therapist: You've spoken the phrase out loud, and now you're noticing that the leaden knot under your sternum is still there, pressing into the hollow. But something else has shifted – you're no longer trying to change it, no longer trying to make sense of it. You're just resting in the presence of the thought, like you've placed a small, gentle hand on it. What's the sensation of that hand on the thought?

Patient: Like a warm, firm palm — grounding in a weird way but also accusatory, as if it highlights that dull shame lodged under my sternum. My breath shortens, my throat tightens, and my knee‑jerk is to start explaining everything (metacognitive defense) instead of just feeling it. I can hold my hand there for a beat, though it already feels like effort and my words are getting thin.

Therapist: Notice the effort it takes to speak – how your words feel like they're struggling to come out. What happens if you simply allow that struggle to be, without trying to fill the silence with explanation?

Patient: My words get thin and halting, like they're moving through treacle; that pebble in my chest heats up into a sharp, embarrassed shame that immediately wants a defense or an explanation. If I let the struggle just be, the urge to narrate quiets a bit and the ache loosens—it's awkward and tiring to stay here, but I can hold the silence for another breath.

Therapist: Notice the heat in your chest – what's the sensation of that shame in your body? Instead of trying to push it away, what if you simply let it be, like a warm spot in your chest that's just there?

Patient: It’s a hot, heavy press under my sternum that climbs into my throat and makes my cheeks warm—like embarrassed heat, a nudge that says “you messed up.” I want to start explaining or dissecting why it’s there, but if I just let that warmth sit for a moment it dulls a little; staying with it feels draining, though, so my sentences come out thin and halting.

Therapist: What happens if, instead of trying to explain the shame, you simply acknowledge the exhaustion that comes with holding it – what's the physical sensation of that exhaustion in your body?

Patient: It’s like my limbs and chest are weighted down—leaden, slow, like moving through molasses—and my speech feels thin. Cognitively there’s a fog and a low-voltage anxiety that keeps my attention pinging to a checklist, so staying with the sensation feels effortful and depleted. The metacognitive churn still wants to narrate, but it’s quieter and even that takes energy.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to push through the exhaustion, you simply allow yourself to rest in the weight of your limbs for just one more breath – without trying to do anything else, just noticing the sensation of your body being heavy?

Patient: I let my limbs sink for that breath—the inhale stays small, the exhale stretches, and my shoulders drop a hair. But my mind immediately starts listing tasks and that embarrassed heat creeps back, so staying with the weight feels possible for a beat and then it slips away, which is exhausting and makes me jittery.

Therapist: Notice the heat again – what's its physical sensation in your chest? Instead of trying to "do" something with it, what if you simply allowed it to be there, like a small, steady hum in the background of your body?

Patient: It’s a low, electric hum under my sternum—warm and prickly, like a phone vibrating against skin. If I let it be it fades into background static—annoying but manageable—but my brain immediately starts narrating reasons and judgements, which jerks my attention away. I can keep the hum for a breath, though saying that already feels like effort and my focus keeps skittering.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to name the hum, you simply noticed its texture – what does it feel like in your body, like a sensation of skin touching skin?

Patient: Like a damp, clammy fold of skin rubbing under my sternum — warm, a little gritty, oddly intimate and embarrassing. My brain immediately wants to translate that texture into meaning (“you screwed up”), which pulls me out of the moment and leaves me flat and a bit irritable, like I don't have the energy to argue with the thought.

Therapist: Notice how flat you feel, like you're just going through the motions – what's the physical sensation in your body that shows up when you're not even trying to think about the shame?

Patient: It feels like a washed‑out numbness—my limbs are a little heavy, my breathing shallow, and my face feels slack like I'm mouthing words without energy. I can already hear my brain narrating that this numbness proves I'm failing, which makes me quietly angry and ashamed at myself, and then I start explaining why instead of actually sitting with the flatness.
