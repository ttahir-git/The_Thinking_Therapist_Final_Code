Patient: Lately I've been feeling really low and unmotivated since the move — even at the restaurant I can't get the same drive, and it's exhausting. It's bleeding into my relationship; I pull away or get short and it hurts both of us. How is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: That exhaustion is really draining, both physically and for your relationship. What's one thing you value about being with your partner, doing things together, or feeling connected that feels lost when you're feeling this way?

Patient: I guess what I miss most is us cooking and laughing together — that easy teamwork and the little routines that made us feel like a team. Now I just withdraw or snap, and it makes everything feel distant. Okay, but how is just naming that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like cooking and laughing together was a way to feel like a team and connected – that teamwork feels really important to you. When you withdraw or snap, what's one tiny thing you could do instead – just a small step – to make that "us" feel like a team again, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: Maybe I could ask them to help with something tiny — like taste a sauce or hand me a pan — something that forces us to be in sync for a minute. I've tried little stuff like that before and it just… fizzles or I end up snapping, so it feels pointless. How is that supposed to actually make a difference when I'm this drained?

Therapist: It takes courage to try tiny steps when you're feeling drained – that willingness already feels like a huge act of kindness toward yourself. What would it be like to not try to force connection this time, but instead just be willing to be present with your partner, even if it's just for a deep breath together, without needing to "fix" the moment?

Patient: I get the idea — just being present sounds nice and simple. But when I try to "just be," my brain dives into the checklist from the move or the restaurant, or my OCD makes me start counting or checking, and before I know it I'm annoyed or snapping. How is that actually supposed to help when I'm wired to fix things or get irritated in a minute?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is already trying to fix things by doing the checklist or counting – that's not the problem. What would it be like if, instead of trying to stop those thoughts, you simply noticed them as thoughts, without judgment: "Ah, my mind is jumping to the checklist again"?

Patient: Maybe I could try that — saying to myself "there's the checklist" — but honestly it usually just makes my hands start moving before I even finish the sentence. How is naming it supposed to stop the urge to check or fix things when my brain's already halfway into the ritual? I don't know, it just feels like a neat idea that never holds up when I'm actually in it.

Therapist: It makes sense that labeling the thought doesn't stop your brain from moving – it's like trying to stop a river with a paddle. What if, instead of stopping the thought, you noticed its purpose: what's the function of checking the checklist right now – is it to feel safe, in control, or relieved?

Patient: Yeah — I think it's about control and safety, like if I tick the boxes I can prove I didn't screw something up, and that gives a split-second calm. But even when I can name that, my hands are already doing the ritual before I finish the thought. How is recognizing the function supposed to actually stop me from doing it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already getting close to what we're aiming for – noticing that checking is linked to control and safety. What if, instead of just noticing that function, you started acting as if it wasn't true right now: what would you do if your control wasn't working, and you couldn't tick those boxes to feel safe?

Patient: If I couldn't tick the boxes I'd probably freeze or do something impulsive — either storm out or start cleaning like a maniac just to get that tiny calm. Sometimes I want to hand control to my partner and let them say "it's okay," but that scares me because what if it's fake and everything falls apart. I've tried "letting go" before and it just spiraled — how is picturing losing control supposed to help when I always end up back in the ritual?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already aware of what's driving the urge to control – the fear of being abandoned or rejected. What's the value of having that tiny calm with your partner that's worth risking, just for a moment, when you could have connection with them instead of trying to control the outcome?

Patient: Honestly, that tiny calm would mean we’re not strangers in the same house — it’d be proof we’re still a team and that I’m not just spiraling alone. But when I try to hand over control it often feels fake or just kicks my checking into overdrive, so how is risking that supposed to help when it usually just backfires? I'm tired from the move and all this grief, and I don’t know if small risks will hold up when my brain’s already worn out.

Therapist: It takes courage to admit that small risks might not hold up right now – that's not about failing, it's about being honest with yourself. What if, instead of waiting for a perfect moment, you took that tiny risk – handed control over for just one deep breath – and said to yourself, "I'm enough right now"?

Patient: I can try to imagine handing control over for one breath, but honestly — how is that supposed to help? Every time I try breathing or telling myself "I'm enough," my hands are already grabbing a pan or starting the checklist before I finish the sentence. If I actually try it, what do I do in the second it starts — ask my partner to say it out loud, or is there some concrete thing I can do that won’t just leave me feeling foolish and exhausted?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already getting close to what we're aiming for – imagining handing control over for one breath. When you feel that physical urge to grab the pan, what's one tiny thing you could do instead of checking – like taking a small step back, noticing the sensation in your hand, or making a tiny sound like "ah" – that doesn't require doing anything else, just being present with the moment?

Patient: Maybe I could set the pan down, take one small step back and let out a short sound like "ah" while saying to myself "there's the urge" — just one stupid little pause so my hands don't keep going. But I've tried pausing before and it just makes me simmer until I snap or I do the whole ritual anyway — how's a tiny sound or step really supposed to stop the urge when it's already in my muscles?

Therapist: It makes sense that a tiny sound or step might not stop the urge right away, but what if, instead of trying to stop the urge, you defused it – noticed it as just an urge, without judgment? When you say "there's the urge," what if you paused just for a moment, and instead of trying to do something, you simply noticed the sensation of that urge in your body, like the feeling of your hand moving or the sound of your breath – without trying to change it, just observe it?

Patient: I can try to notice it — like the tightness in my shoulders, the twitch in my fingers, the quick shallow breath — and say "there's the urge." But honestly, by the time I notice I'm already halfway into the ritual. How is noticing the sensation supposed to stop my hands? In the middle of service when orders are piling up, a pause feels impossible — won't that just make me more panicked or make me snap at my partner?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already getting close to what we're aiming for – noticing the physical sensations. When you notice your hands moving, instead of trying to stop them, what if you simply said to yourself, "there's the urge" – without trying to do anything else? You don't have to pause or change anything; you can just observe the sensation of that urge in your body, like a thought passing through your mind, without judgment – "just the urge, just the thought, just the movement."

Patient: Yeah, I get the idea — “just the urge” — but honestly that feels like telling me to stop a train once it’s already left the station. In service, by the time I notice, my hands are already moving and my head’s racing, and a beat of noticing just turns into simmering anger or the ritual anyway. What am I actually supposed to do in that half-second so I don't end up snapping or doing the whole thing?

Therapist: It sounds like you're right – trying to stop the train by noticing isn't working. What if, in that tiny moment, you took a tiny, gentle action that wasn't trying to control anything – like opening your mouth to breathe out slowly, or rolling your eyes up towards the ceiling, or making a tiny sound like "hmm"? Something small and gentle that doesn't try to stop your hands, but just allows you to be present with the urge – not fighting it, not trying to change it, just noticing it.

Patient: I could try that—like a tiny exhale or a little "hmm" while my hands keep moving—because honestly I can't afford to stop in the middle of service. But how is making a small noise or rolling my eyes supposed to change the momentum of the ritual when my body’s already committed and orders are piling up? I'm skeptical, but if I were to try one concrete thing to practice first, what should it be so it actually might work during a rush?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for something concrete to try in service. What if, instead of trying to stop your hands, you focused on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – just the physical sensation of that exhale or inhale? You could do that without stopping your hands, just noticing the movement of your breath, even if it's just for a tiny fraction of a second. That's a tiny action that doesn't try to change your hands, but just acknowledges the physical sensation of your body moving.

Patient: Alright — I'll try to notice the exhale while my hands keep moving, just a tiny fraction of a second. But seriously, how is paying attention to my breath supposed to break the momentum when I'm already mid-ritual and orders are piling up? If I try it during a rush and it doesn't do anything, what do I actually do next that won’t make me look like I’m falling apart or snap at my partner?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that paying attention to your breath won't work in the heat of the moment. What if, instead of trying to change your hands or break the momentum, you just committed to the tiny moment of noticing your breath for that fraction of a second? You wouldn't have to do anything else – just acknowledge that tiny moment of awareness. Then, you could immediately move forward to the next task, not thinking about the breath at all – just doing the next thing that needs to be done. That's how you can take small action without getting caught up in the ritual – you don't need to stop the momentum, just move forward from the tiny moment of awareness.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice the exhale for that split second, but I'm really skeptical it'll stick in a rush. How am I actually supposed to remember to do it when my hands are already moving and orders are piling up? If that tiny awareness doesn't change anything, what's the next least-dumb thing I can do in the moment that won't make me look like I'm falling apart or snap at my partner? Also, how do I practice this at home without turning my partner into a coach — I'm tired of feeling like an experiment.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that you'll forget to notice the exhale in the midst of a rush. What if, instead of trying to remember to notice your breath, you simply acknowledged the thought "I need to focus on the orders" as you did it – without judgment, just observing that thought as it arises? You wouldn't have to do anything else, just let that thought pass without trying to change it. Then, you could immediately move forward to the next task, not thinking about the breath at all – just doing the next thing that needs to be done. This way, you're not trying to control your hands or break the momentum, but simply moving forward from the tiny moment of awareness.

Patient: Okay, I can try saying "I need to focus on the orders" — that feels less weird than trying to breathe in the middle of a rush. But honestly, how am I supposed to remember that split-second when my hands are already on a pan? If that tiny notice doesn't do anything, I want a backup I can use by myself — like snapping a rubber band on my wrist, twisting a ring, or a one-word whisper I can practice at home without making my partner into a coach. I'm tired of feeling like an experiment, so give me something concrete I can actually try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a backup plan to help you remember the tiny notice. What if, when you feel the urge to check, you simply twisted your wedding ring on your finger – just a tiny, automatic movement that doesn't require thinking? That way, when you're in the middle of a rush, you can do that small action without even realizing it, and it can help you stay present with the task at hand. You don't need to tell yourself to do it or remind yourself to notice – just the physical action itself can be a gentle reminder to stay connected to the present moment.

Patient: Maybe twisting my wedding ring could work since it’s something private and I wouldn’t have to rope my partner into coaching, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when I’ve tried fidget tricks before and they just morphed into new rituals? Also, in the kitchen my hands get greasy, I don’t always wear the ring, and the last thing I need is another thing for my OCD to latch onto or to forget in the middle of a rush. Give me a concrete alternative I can practice alone at home that won’t feel like an experiment, and tell me the first tiny step I should actually try tonight.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that twisting your ring will just become another thing for your OCD to latch onto. What if, instead of trying to change your behavior, you simply noticed when your hands start to get greasy in the kitchen? That's it – just noticing that sensation, without trying to do anything about it, is a tiny step that you can take right now. It's not about changing your behavior or trying to control your hands; it's just about acknowledging the physical sensation. Can you take a minute tonight, right after dinner, to notice when your hands get greasy in the kitchen, without doing anything about it?

Patient: Okay — I can try that tonight. I'll set a 60‑second timer after dinner and just notice the grease on my hands without doing anything. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when usually it just makes me more wound up and cleaning starts — I'm tired from the move and really don't want this to be another failed experiment, so if it backfires what's the next least‑dumb thing I can do on my own?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing the grease will just lead to cleaning, which is not what you want right now. What if, instead of trying to stop the cleaning instinct, you simply acknowledged that you noticed the grease, and then... paused for a single breath? Just one breath, without trying to do anything else. That's it – just the sensation of the breath, without judgment. You don't have to worry about the timer or cleaning; you just focus on the breath. If you get stuck, you can start again tomorrow, but for tonight, can you just commit to that one tiny breath?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that one breath tonight and I’ll set the 60‑second timer after dinner. But I can already feel that old shame and frustration bubbling up, like I’m bracing for it to fail — how is one breath supposed to stop my hands once they’re moving? If that split‑second doesn’t do anything, give me one concrete backup I can do alone that won’t feel like another ritual, and tell me the very first tiny step I should practice tonight.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that the shame and frustration will overwhelm the tiny step of noticing the breath. What if, instead of trying to stop the physical movement, you simply acknowledged that you're feeling that shame and frustration right now – without judgment? You can do that without doing anything else. Can you take a minute tonight, right after dinner, to notice exactly where that shame and frustration are sitting in your body, without trying to change it or fight it? Just notice it – "where is it in my body?" – without trying to push it away or distract yourself.

Patient: Yeah — I’ll try that tonight. Right after dinner I’ll set the timer and see where the shame and frustration live in my body — already feels like a tightness in my chest and a knot in my stomach. But I’m skeptical: how is just noticing that knot supposed to stop it from turning into cleaning or snapping when it’s already got me by the throat?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing the knot won't be enough to stop the automatic reaction. What if, instead of trying to stop the knot itself, you simply observed it as a sensation – without judgment or trying to change it? Just notice that knot, and then ask yourself: "What's the story this knot is trying to tell me?" What's it trying to say or protect? Is it trying to keep you safe from what's happening right now?

Patient: It feels like that knot is yelling that I messed up before and I’ll mess up again — like it’s trying to protect me from being judged or abandoned, so it makes me fix things fast. It tightens my chest and makes my hands move before my head catches up, and there’s this shame under it that just fuels the whole thing. Okay, but how is naming that story actually supposed to stop me mid-ritual? If that noticing doesn’t work in the moment, give me one concrete backup I can do alone that won’t feel like another ritual.

Therapist: It sounds like naming the knot's story is helpful, but it's not enough to stop the physical reaction in the moment. What if, when you notice the knot's story, you simply took one tiny step away from the physical reaction? Just one tiny step – like taking your hand off the pan or pausing for a single breath – without trying to stop it entirely. That's it – just one tiny step to create some space between the knot's story and the automatic reaction. Can you practice that tiny step tonight, when you notice the knot's story, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay — I can try that: when I notice the knot’s story I’ll take one tiny step away, like sliding my hand off the pan and letting out one breath. But I’m already bracing — there’s this shame and frustration that makes me doubt it’ll work in the heat of service; how is a single breath supposed to stop the momentum? If that split‑second doesn’t do anything, give me one concrete backup I can do alone that won’t feel like another ritual (e.g., a two‑count hum or pressing my thumb into my palm), and tell me exactly what to practice for 60 seconds tonight.

Therapist: It sounds like you're right that a single breath might not be enough to stop the momentum, especially when you're already bracing. What if, instead of trying to stop the momentum entirely, you focused on creating a small gap between your breath and the physical reaction? That's it – just a tiny gap, like the space between your exhale and the next thing you do. For tonight's practice, I want you to focus on creating that gap by pressing your thumb into your palm. Not just a tiny press, but a gentle, deliberate press that lasts for 60 seconds. When you notice your hand moving or the knot's story starting, gently press your thumb into your palm and hold for one second. Then, pause for one second before releasing. Repeat this process for 60 seconds, without trying to change anything or stop the momentum entirely.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it. After dinner I’ll set the timer and do the one‑second press, one‑second pause for 60 seconds. But I can already feel that old shame and frustration bubbling up, like this is going to be another failed trick — how is pressing my thumb actually supposed to make space in the middle of a rush, and if this doesn’t do anything, what’s the simplest backup I can do alone that won’t just become another ritual?

Therapist: It sounds like you're right that pressing your thumb might not be enough to make space in the middle of a rush, especially when you're already feeling shame and frustration. What if, instead of trying to make space with physical action, you simply acknowledged the shame and frustration as it arises? That's it – just a tiny acknowledgment, without judgment or trying to change it. You can do that without taking a breath, without moving a muscle, just by noticing the shame and frustration as it shows up. For tonight's practice, I want you to focus on that tiny acknowledgment. When you notice your hand moving or the knot's story starting, just say to yourself: "Ah, I'm feeling shame and frustration again." That's it – just the words, without judgment or trying to change it.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try that tonight: after dinner I’ll set the timer and, when I notice the hand moving or the knot starting, I’ll say to myself, “Ah, I’m feeling shame and frustration again.” But honestly I can already feel that hot shame bubbling up and I’m bracing for it to just turn into more cleaning or snapping — how is saying that one sentence supposed to stop my hands mid-ritual? If it doesn’t do anything, give me one single, concrete backup I can do alone that won’t become another ritual (tell me exactly what to do and how to practice it for 60 seconds), and tell me whether I should say the phrase out loud or just whisper it to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like you're right that saying the sentence might not be enough to stop your hands, especially when you're already bracing. What if, instead of focusing on the sentence itself, you simply allowed yourself to be present with the physical sensation of the shame and frustration? That's it – just the sensation, without judgment or trying to change it. For tonight's practice, I want you to focus on that sensation. When you notice your hand moving or the knot starting, simply notice the physical sensation of the shame and frustration in your body – the feeling of tightness, the sensation of heat, the pressure in your chest. Don't try to say anything, just observe the sensation. Practice noticing it for 60 seconds, without moving or speaking – just the sensation. You can do this by noticing the sensation in your hands, your chest, your face, or anywhere else in your body where you feel it.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 60‑second noticing practice after dinner. I can already feel that hot shame and frustration bubbling up, like I'm bracing for it to fail — my chest tightens and my hands start to twitch just thinking about it. But honestly, how is feeling the knot for 60 seconds supposed to stop my hands in the middle of a rush? If it doesn't work, give me one single, concrete backup I can do alone (exact steps to practice for 60 seconds) that won’t turn into another ritual — and tell me whether I should say anything out loud or just think it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're right that noticing the knot might not be enough to stop your hands, especially when you're already bracing. What if, instead of focusing on the knot, you simply took a tiny, physical action that doesn't require attention or control? That's it – just a tiny action that requires minimal effort. For tonight's practice, I want you to try a simple "small movement" – a tiny, tiny action that doesn't require thinking or control. Here's what to do: As soon as you notice your hand moving or your chest tightening, take a tiny finger movement – just a small, gentle curl of your finger – without looking or thinking about it. That's it – just a tiny finger movement. Don't try to change anything or stop it; just focus on the small movement itself. Practice this tiny movement for 60 seconds, without thinking or controlling it – just let your finger move on its own.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the tiny finger curl for 60 seconds after dinner, but I’m already bracing and that hot shame’s starting up, so I’m skeptical this won’t just turn into another stupid ritual. Quick clarifying questions: which finger do you want me to use (dominant or non‑dominant), should I do it completely silently or whisper anything, and if this doesn’t break the momentum in a rush what’s the one single backup I can do alone that won’t become another compulsive thing?
