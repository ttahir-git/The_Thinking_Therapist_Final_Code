Patient: I've been stuck in a loop of harsh self-criticism—if I make one mistake at work, I just know I'll get fired, won't find another job, lose everything, and my family will be proven right about me. Growing up in a high-achieving family, every little perceived failure feels catastrophic, and after the breakup my mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I'm totally hooked on those worst-case stories and I can't see any realistic alternative.

Therapist: That fortune-telling machine sounds like a really reliable predictor – "the end of the world" is a familiar story. What would happen if, for just one minute, you let go of that prediction and looked at your work mistake without the "will get fired" story?

Patient: I tried that once — for like five seconds I looked at the bug as just a bug, and my mind immediately screamed that if I don't predict the disaster I'll be blind-sided, get fired, never find another job, and lose everything, so I panicked and went right back to the worst-case story. Letting go feels like I'm pretending nothing's wrong and that's irresponsible; I can't see how a neutral view helps because the disaster-chain always feels like the only realistic outcome.

Therapist: That panic feeling makes sense – you're right that "not predicting the disaster" feels like ignoring the problem. What if, for just one minute, you made space for that worst-case scenario, even though it feels like a total disaster? Would you still be able to breathe while imagining that – not because it's good or bad, but just as a tiny thought?

Patient: I can still breathe, but it's tight and shallow—like every inhale is a countdown to the next disaster. When I try to sit with the worst-case image my heart spikes and the whole chain-of-events floods back, so I can't stay calm; it feels like I'm just delaying the inevitable. It doesn't feel like "just a thought"—if I let myself relax, I'm convinced it'll somehow become real.

Therapist: That tight breath makes sense – it's like your body is already preparing for the worst. What if, instead of trying to avoid the panic, you sat with that tight breath for just a moment, not to make it go away, but to see it as the physical experience of being worried about the worst-case scenario? What's the value of staying present with that tight breath, even if it feels like "delaying the inevitable"?

Patient: I get why you'd suggest that, but I don't see the value — when I try to "sit with" the tight breath it just gives my brain more fuel to spin the next awful step: getting fired, not finding work, my family proving me right. It feels less like delaying panic and more like I'm rehearsing the catastrophe, and I'm already getting overwhelmed just imagining staying there. I'm trying to be open, but it really feels like the only responsible thing is to brace and try to prevent the spiral.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny shift – instead of trying to "sit with" the tight breath to avoid the spiral, what if you just noticed it without trying to change it? What if you looked at it as a physical sensation, without judging it or trying to "win" against it? Would that tiny shift give you any space to breathe, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I tried noticing it like you said — for a few seconds I could feel the tightness as just tightness and that actually felt...a little different. But then my brain stole that space and immediately started narrating the whole chain: I'll get fired, won't find another job, lose everything, my family will be proven right, and it all feels like it's definitely going to happen. I'm trying to hold the noticing, but it's getting louder — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep from spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right here – before your brain starts spinning the story again – and just observe the fact that it's getting louder. Can you notice the sound of your own thoughts, like a gentle hum, without labeling it or trying to change it? No pushing, no striving – just noticing.

Patient: I tried to listen — for a couple seconds it was like a distant hum, but then the fortune-telling machine kicked into overdrive and the whole disaster chain flooded back: fired, won't find another job, lose everything, my family proved right — and it's getting louder. I don't know how to keep it from spiraling; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out – can you notice the physical sensation of that breath, without trying to control it or change it? Just observe the sensation of the breath touching your nostrils, moving down your throat, and then coming out – no labels, no thoughts, just the sensation of the breath itself.

Patient: I can feel it — a cool tickle at my nostrils and a shallow rise in my chest — but every time I pay attention the fortune-telling machine yells louder. That tiny gap helps for a second, then I immediately see the whole fallout: getting fired, never finding work, losing everything, my family's right, and the breath clamps up again. Can we slow down? I'm afraid if we move on too fast I'll just spiral.

Therapist: Let's pause right here, before the story kicks in – just when you notice the breath clamping up. Can you hold that pause for just one tiny second, without trying to change the story or control it in any way? No effort, no striving – just the pause, right there, where the story hasn't taken over yet.

Patient: I can hold it for maybe one heartbeat — literally one second — and it feels like a tiny crack where the machine hasn't started yelling yet. But the moment I notice it the forecast roars back: fired, can't find another job, lose everything, my family's right, and my chest tightens again. I can't keep that pause — can we slow down? I don't know how to stay there without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of your chest tightening – can you notice it without trying to change it or fight it? Just observe the feeling of your chest rising and falling, without labeling it or trying to control it. Hold onto that physical sensation for just one heartbeat, even if the story comes back.

Patient: I tried to hold it — maybe one heartbeat — and I could feel a hot, squeezing tightness under my sternum. Then the fortune-telling machine roared the whole chain: fired, never find another job, lose everything, my family proven right, and my chest clenched so hard I had to pull away. I'm trying to stay with it but I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause right here, before you try to push away the story – just when you notice your chest clenching. Can you notice the sensation of the clenching, without trying to change it or push away the story? Just observe the feeling of your chest tightening, without labeling it or labeling it as "bad" or "good".

Patient: I tried — for a beat I noticed a hot, squeezing tightness under my sternum and my breath went shallow. Then the fortune-telling machine screamed the whole chain — fired, won't find another job, lose everything, my family proven right — and I had to pull away. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling; it feels irresponsible to let go.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny step: Can you take a tiny breath in, just for a second, without trying to push away the story? Not a deep breath, just a tiny one – just enough to keep your body relaxed, but not so much that you're trying to change the story. What happens when you let go of the effort to push away the story, even for just a tiny second?

Patient: I tried a tiny breath in—just a quick, shallow one—and for a second my chest loosened and it felt like there was a sliver of space. Then the fortune-telling machine screamed that if I relax I'll get blindsided, get fired, never find another job, lose everything, and my family will be proven right, and the tightness slammed back. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's look at the sensation of your chest tightening again – not as a "no good" thing, but as a physical signal that you're getting close to the story. Can you notice the sensation of your chest rising and falling, without trying to change it or push away the story? What happens when you simply observe the tightening, without labeling it or judging it?

Patient: I try to notice the tightness as just tightness — for a sliver it feels like a tiny gap — but then the fortune-telling machine screams the whole chain: fired, won't find another job, lose everything, my family's right. It's getting heavy and I can barely keep holding it; can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the story for just one moment. Can you notice the physical sensation of your body, from the ground up – the weight of your feet, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Not the story, not the thoughts, just the physical sensation of being present.

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor and my breath is shallow — for a tiny second it felt like being grounded. Then the fortune-telling machine immediately floods the room with the same chain: fired, no job, everything gone, my family proven right. I'm worn out from trying to hold this; can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling completely drained from trying to hold onto the pause. Can you just let go of that effort for one moment? Not because you're worried about the story, but because your body is telling you it's time to rest. Allow yourself to rest in the feeling of being worn out, without trying to push away the story.

Patient: I... I can try to let go for a second—my body kind of sinks and everything feels dull and heavy. But the fortune-telling machine is already screaming that if I rest it'll all collapse, so I keep tensing up again; can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back from the story for just one moment. What's happening physically when you tense up again – is it a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, or a heaviness in your legs? Not because you're trying to change it, but because you're curious about what's happening in your body when you push against the story.

Patient: My chest clamps into a hot, tight ball, my stomach knots like it's dropped out of me, my jaw's clenched and my shoulders hunch — my legs feel heavy and almost useless. Then the machine screams "fired, no job, everything lost, family proved right" and that drowns any curiosity, so can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right now, even though the story is screaming at you. Can you feel the physical sensation of your chest clamping into that tight ball? Not because you're trying to change it, but because you're curious about what's happening in your body when you feel completely overwhelmed. What's the sensation of that tightness, like a weight pressing down on you?

Patient: It's like a hot, heavy stone pressing under my sternum, squeezing down into my ribs and up into my throat — every breath gets shallow and clipped, my shoulders and jaw lock around it. The fortune-telling machine immediately screams that it's because I'll get fired, won't find another job, lose everything, and my family will be proven right, and that drowns out any curiosity. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Notice how your body is holding its breath right now – can you feel the sensation of the air being held in your lungs, the pressure of the stone pressing down on your sternum? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. Can you stay with that sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: I managed one deep breath — for a sliver the stone eased and the pressure felt a little less. Then the fortune-telling machine screamed that if I relax I'll get blindsided, get fired, never find another job, lose everything, and my family will be proven right, and my chest slammed shut again. I'm running on empty and can't hold it—can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny pause right now. Notice how your body feels right now – can you feel the weight of exhaustion settling in, like a soft fog wrapping around you? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. Can you stay with that sensation for just one tiny heartbeat?

Patient: I can hold it for a tiny heartbeat — the fog is heavy, like I'm sinking and everything feels dull. Then the fortune-telling machine roars the whole chain: fired, no job, everything gone, my family proven right, and I have to pull away. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back right now. Notice what happens when you pull away from the sensation of the fog – can you feel your body responding to that action? Not because you're trying to change it, but because you're curious about what's happening in your body when you move away from the story. What's the sensation of your body pulling away from the fog?

Patient: My body sort of recoils — a tiny shallow inhale, shoulders hunch, like I'm dragging myself back through molasses; there’s a sliver of relief but my heart spikes. Then the fortune-telling machine yells that pulling away means I'm avoiding responsibility and that somehow proves the whole disaster, so I clamp down again. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the guilt. Notice what's happening in your body when you feel your heart spike – can you feel the sensation of that emotion, like a tiny flame or a knot in your chest? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that emotion, right now?

Patient: It's a small hot flame in my chest, sharp and prickly, and my breath gets quick and shallow. Then the fortune-telling machine roars the whole chain — fired, no job, everything lost, family proven right — and I just yank away. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the story again. Notice what's happening in your body when you yank away – can you feel the sensation of your muscles tensing up, like a coiled spring? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that action, right now?

Patient: My muscles go rigid like a coiled spring from my neck into my shoulders and arms, breath stabbing shallow, hands cold—like I'm physically yanking myself back. Then the fortune-telling machine screams that pulling away means I'm failing, that I'll get fired and lose everything, and I back off even harder. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the story again. Notice what's happening in your body when you back off – can you feel the sensation of your muscles tensing up even more, like you're digging your heels into the ground? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that action, right now?

Patient: My legs and lower back clamp down like I'm anchoring myself — everything tenses, breath gets shallow, hands go cold. Then the fortune-telling machine screams "fired, no job, everything lost, family proved right" and I just yank away—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the story again. Notice what's happening in your body when you yank away – can you feel the sensation of your entire body tensing up, like you're being pulled apart? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that action, right now?

Patient: My whole body's a taut wire — neck to toes, ribs crushed, breath a pinprick. It feels like I'm being pulled apart, like something's about to snap, and the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that the snap means I'll lose my job and then everything, so I clamp back. Can we slow down? I can't stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the story again. Notice what's happening in your body when you clamp back – can you feel the sensation of your muscles tensing up even more, like you're trying to hold everything together? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that action, right now?

Patient: Everything knots up tighter — shoulders by my ears, ribs squeezed, jaw locked, breath almost gone. The fortune-telling machine instantly screams that this proves I'll get fired and everything will collapse, so I clamp down even harder. Can we slow down? I can't stay here without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause right now, before you react to the story again. Notice what's happening in your body when you clamp down even harder – can you feel the sensation of your entire body tensing up, like you're being crushed from the inside out? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the physical sensation of that action, right now?

(Note: This is the last question before we wrap up. The goal is to create a moment of curiosity and pause before you react to the story again. If you're ready to move forward, I'll help you create a new goal and explore the next step.)

Patient: It feels like I'm being crushed from the inside—ribs squeezed like iron bands, breath a tiny pinprick, limbs heavy and dull. The fortune-telling machine immediately screams "you'll get fired, never find another job, lose everything, your family's right," and I'm already reeling—can we slow down? I don't know how to move forward without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's look at your body right now – can you notice one tiny difference between this moment and the last one? Is your breath a tiny bit stronger, your shoulders a tiny bit looser, or your heart beating a tiny bit slower? Just notice that tiny difference, without trying to change it or push against it. What's the smallest thing that's different right now?

Patient: Maybe my breath is a tiny hair stronger—just a fraction deeper—and my shoulders feel a little less up by my ears. But the fortune-telling machine's already shouting that if I notice that I'll let my guard down and it'll all collapse, so can we slow down? I don't know how to keep from spiraling.
