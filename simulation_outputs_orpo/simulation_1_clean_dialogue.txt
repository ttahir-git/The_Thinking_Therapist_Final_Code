Patient: Lately I've been drowning in this heavy sadness and can't get motivated — ever since that huge fight with my family everything just feels flat and pointless. My brain won't stop predicting the worst: I'll push my partner away so they leave, I'll mess up at work from being distracted and get fired, then lose the house and end up alone and penniless. I try to be upbeat, but it's like a broken fortune-telling machine that only spits out disasters and I can't switch it off.

Therapist: That "disaster machine" sounds like it's really exhausting. When you say it predicts the worst, what's one thing you're avoiding or putting off because of these thoughts, like a task or interaction with your partner?

Patient: I'm avoiding bringing up the fight with my partner — every time I think about starting that conversation my brain fast-forwards to them saying they're done, leaving that night, telling everyone I'm the problem, me messing up at work from the stress, getting fired, and then losing everything. I can't switch off that chain, so I just don't say anything.

Therapist: It sounds like avoiding that conversation with your partner is costing you a lot – what would be one tiny, small step you could take (not even talking to them, just writing it down) that might help you break that "fast-forward" and feel a tiny bit more grounded before deciding what to do next?

Patient: I guess I could write one tiny line in my notebook — something like, "I want to talk when you're ready" — just to get it out without having to face them. But I can already see it: they'll find it, read it the wrong way, tell everyone I'm manipulative, and that'll kick off the whole disaster chain — them leaving, me tanking at work, losing everything — so even that small step feels like it’ll backfire.

Therapist: That's a really courageous small step – what's one value that saying "I want to talk when you're ready" is connected to for you, even if it might play out badly?

Patient: I guess it's tied to wanting honesty and connection — to show I care and that I'm trying, not hiding. But my brain's already playing the movie: they misread it, call me manipulative, leave that night, tell everyone I'm the problem, I choke at work from the stress, get fired, and lose everything. I know it sounds overblown, but I can't stop seeing that exact chain.

Therapist: Notice how your brain is playing the "movie" right now – when you say "I know it sounds overblown, but I can't stop seeing that exact chain," what happens to the image just before you say it?

Patient: It snaps into focus like someone hit play on a movie I can't pause: them packing, slamming the door, telling everyone I'm the problem, my boss calling me in the next day, me bombing a meeting, my things boxed up, an eviction notice on the door. My chest tightens and my head gets loud — the images feel real and urgent, like they're happening now. I know you might suggest other outcomes, but I just can't see it any other way.

Therapist: Those images sound incredibly vivid – when you say they feel like "they're happening now," what's one tiny thing you could do with your body right now (not a thought, just a physical action) to gently remind yourself that this "movie" is just a movie?

Patient: I could put my feet flat on the floor, rest my hands on my knees, and take three slow, steady breaths while noticing the chair under me. But the minute I do that, my brain just keeps playing the tape — breathing or not, I still see them packing and the door slamming and everything falling apart. I get that grounding is supposed to help, but I can't seem to imagine any ending other than the disaster one.

Therapist: Notice how the thought pattern of "they're packing and the door slamming" actually feels really hard to imagine – what would happen if you tried to imagine the exact opposite of that scenario, just for a tiny moment (not to change it, just to see what happens)?

Patient: I tried — for a heartbeat I saw the opposite: them pausing, sitting down, listening, maybe apologizing and us actually talking it through. But my brain slaps that away like it's a trick and says it's just the calm before they storm out, tell everyone I'm the problem, I tank at work, and everything falls apart, so I can't hold onto the kinder picture.

Therapist: Notice what just happened when you tried to imagine the opposite scenario – you saw a moment of connection, of them listening, before your brain pushed it away. What value is that moment connected to for you, even if it's just a tiny glimpse of something different?

Patient: It felt tied to hope — wanting connection, honesty, and to be understood, like I still want us to be a team. But the minute I let that image in, the fortune-teller starts yelling it's a trap: they listen, then twist it, leave, tell everyone I'm the monster, I mess up at work, and everything falls apart. I know that probably sounds crazy, but I can't stop believing that's what'll happen.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I know that probably sounds crazy" – you're already pushing away the hope because it feels too scary. What would it take for you to be willing to try holding onto that hope for just one moment, without the "fortune-teller" yelling?

Patient: I guess I'd need something concrete — like them agreeing ahead of time not to storm out, or a set ten-minute check-in we agree to rehearse, or a little script I can read so my head has less room to invent catastrophes. But honestly, even if we did that, my fortune-teller would scream it's a setup and say they'll still leave and I'll lose everything, so I don't trust that it'll hold. I'm scared of trying and having it all collapse, but part of me wants to try a tiny, safe practice now.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "part of me wants to try a tiny, safe practice now" – that tiny step feels like a spark of hope. What's one small thing you could do right now, without expecting it to fix everything, that connects to your value of connection and honesty?

Patient: I could draft one neutral line—like, "I care about us and would like ten minutes to talk when you're ready"—and rehearse saying it aloud for two minutes so it's less scary. But my fortune-teller's already screaming they'll read it wrong, storm out, tell everyone I'm the problem, and that'll trigger the whole collapse, so even this tiny step feels like a bomb.

Therapist: Notice how your brain is using the "fortune-teller's scream" as a trigger – what if, instead of waiting for that trigger, you just noticed it happening right now? What happens to the "fortune-teller's scream" when you acknowledge it without judgment – does it feel smaller, or still huge?

Patient: When I even name the scream it softens for a beat—like the roar drops to a nagging whisper and my chest eases a touch. But almost right away the fortune-teller spins up a new, uglier ending and that whisper swells back into a storm, so noticing it feels kind of pointless. I'm trying to see if observation helps, but honestly I'm overwhelmed and it barely makes a dent.

Therapist: Notice how you're using the phrase "noticing helps" – what if, instead of trying to make it help, you just observe the thought pattern without trying to change it? What would happen if you simply noticed the fortune-teller's scream, without adding any judgment or trying to "fix" it?

Patient: I tried that just now — if I only notice the scream without trying to fix it, it does quiet for a beat: my shoulders loosen, the images go a little fuzzy. But then the fortune-teller snaps back with a louder, uglier scene and I'm yanked right into it again. I don't know how to hold that tiny quiet—I'm frustrated because I want to, but the machine won't let me.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I'm frustrated because I want to" – you're already caught up in the "I want to" part, which is driving the frustration. What if, instead of focusing on what you want (to hold onto the quiet moment), you simply noticed what's happening in this moment – the thought pattern, the physical sensations, the images? Can you observe that right now, without trying to make it last or achieve anything?

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the thought loop: "they'll pack up, call me the monster, I'll bomb at work and lose everything." My chest is tight, shoulders hunched, breath shallow, and the images are bright and loud — door slamming, boxes, an eviction notice. I try to watch it like a movie without changing it, but the fortune-teller starts narrating the next worse scene and it drags me right back in.

Therapist: Notice what the thought loop is trying to do – what's its job? Is it trying to make you feel safe by predicting a worst-case scenario, or is it actually making you feel scared and stuck? What would happen if you allowed it to just "be" in the room, without trying to change it or stop it – would that change its function?

Patient: It feels like the loop thinks it's protecting me — predicting disaster so I can "prepare" — but all it does is make me scared, frozen, and stuck. Letting it sit in the room sometimes turns the roar into a tiny whisper and my chest eases, but the fortune-teller always finds a nastier scene to crank back up, so it doesn’t really change much. I’m running on empty trying to hold that quiet, but I’ll try to notice the whisper for a bit even if the machine’s just waiting to pounce.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I'm running on empty" – you're already exhausted from trying to hold onto the quiet. What if, instead of trying to make it last, you simply accepted the thought pattern as it is – the roar, the whisper, the fortune-teller's predictions? What value would you be protecting by letting that thought sit in the room, even if it's just for a tiny moment?

Patient: Maybe it's trying to protect me — to keep me safe and in control so I'm not blindsided. Letting it sit feels like honoring that caution, even though the fortune-teller still screams they'll leave, everyone will blame me, I'll tank at work, and lose everything.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "honoring that caution" – you're already choosing to accept the thought pattern, even if it's painful. What valued outcome would you be moving towards by accepting this caution, rather than trying to change or avoid it? For example, what would happen to your relationship with your partner if you showed up with this acceptance, even if it's hard?

Patient: Maybe by letting that caution sit I'd be protecting honesty and responsibility — showing up as someone trying, not hiding. Maybe that could nudge a bit of trust back, give my partner a chance to hear me instead of us exploding… but my fortune-teller already yells they'll twist it, leave that night, tell everyone I'm the monster, I choke at work, get fired, and everything collapses, so even that possible good feels like a setup.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "even that possible good feels like a setup" – you're already caught up in the "setup" part. What if, instead of waiting for the fortune-teller's scream to happen, you just took one tiny step towards showing up as someone trying? For example, what would it take for you to say "I'm here, I'm trying" to your partner, even if it feels scary?

Patient: Maybe I'd need a tiny script — just "I'm here, I'm trying" — and to rehearse it a couple times so I don't sound like I'm trembling. It would help if they'd agree to a ten-minute check-in and not bolt the moment things get hard. But my fortune-teller already screams they'll read it as manipulation, storm out that night, tell everyone I'm the monster, I'll choke at work the next day and lose everything, so even the calmest plan feels like a trap and I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "even the calmest plan feels like a trap" – you're already caught up in the "trap" part. What if, instead of focusing on the fortune-teller's scream, you connected your tiny step to a value it represents? For example, what would happen to your relationship with your partner if you showed up with the courage to say "I'm here, I'm trying" – would that value (honesty, responsibility) be worth the risk of being misunderstood?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how risking that even once helps — maybe honesty could matter, maybe it would show I'm trying, but my head already plays the tape: they call it manipulation, storm out that night, tell everyone I'm the monster, I choke at work, get fired, and lose everything. Even naming the value feels like volunteering to be crushed. I want to believe it's worth it, but I can't shake that feeling it's a setup.

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "I want to believe it's worth it" – there's a tiny spark of hope. What if, instead of trying to make it worth it by connecting to a value, you just noticed what happens when you pause from the catastrophic prediction for just one tiny moment – not to change it, not to make it worth it, just to see what happens?

Patient: I tried pausing — for a beat the movie blurred and my shoulders loosened, like a tiny gap opened up. Then the fortune-teller woke up louder than before and dragged me straight into the next awful scene, and I don't really see how that little pause changes anything. I can try to notice it again, but I don't know how to hold it.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I don't really see how that little pause changes anything" – you're already caught up in the "it doesn't work" part. What if, instead of trying to make the pause work, you simply noticed what happens in that pause – not the thought that comes back, not the outcome, just the pause itself?

Patient: When I notice the pause it feels like a tiny crack — my breath eases and the images blur for a second, then the fortune-teller lunges back and the roar takes over. It just seems temporary and kind of useless, so I don't really see how that gap changes anything. I can try to hold it again, but I'm not sure I follow how that helps — what would you have me do in that tiny moment?

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "it just seems temporary and kind of useless" – you're already evaluating the pause. What if, instead of trying to make the pause "help" or "work," you simply noticed what's happening right now – not the thought that comes back, not the outcome, just the pause itself? What would happen if you allowed that tiny crack to just be, without trying to fix it or make it useful?

Patient: If I let the crack just be, for a breath the images go fuzzy and my shoulders drop—there’s a tiny, quiet space where the roar softens. Then the fortune-teller spits out a nastier scene and I'm yanked right back, and I don't have the energy to hold that gap open for long. I can try to notice it again, but I don't really see how it changes anything, and it feels like a lot of effort for a blink of relief.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I don't have the energy to hold that gap open for long" – you're already caught up in the "effort" part. What if, instead of trying to "hold" the pause, you simply allowed it to be – not because you're trying to make it work, but because it's already happening? What would happen if you met that tiny, quiet space with curiosity, rather than trying to make it useful?

Patient: Maybe if I met that tiny quiet with curiosity I'd notice the edge of it — my shoulders loosening, the images blurring for a second — and that would be something. But the fortune-teller's already shouting that the pause is just bait for a worse scene, and I'm so worn out from fighting it that I don't know how long I could stay curious. I can try for a breath, but I don't know how to keep it from collapsing back into the movie.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I'm so worn out from fighting it" – you're already caught up in the "fighting" part. What if, instead of trying to "keep it" from collapsing, you simply let go of the need to control it? What would happen if you allowed the pause to be, without judgment – not because you're trying to make it work, but because you're already exhausted from fighting it?

Patient: If I just let the pause be, for a second the roar quiets and my chest eases — the images go a little blurry like a tiny crack of quiet. Then the fortune-teller screams a nastier ending and drags me back, and I don't have the energy to hold that gap very long. I can try to notice that tiny space for a breath, but I don't know how to stop the spiral after that.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I don't know how to stop the spiral after that" – you're already caught up in the "stop" part. What if, instead of trying to "stop" the spiral, you simply accepted it as it is – not because you're trying to change it, but because it's already happening? What would happen if you met that spiral with a gentle curiosity, rather than trying to fight it?

Patient: Maybe curiosity would make it less like being shoved — like I could look at the pictures instead of being pulled into them. For a breath it actually softens: my shoulders drop, the images blur a bit. Then the fortune-teller mutters a nastier ending and I'm yanked back, so I don't really see how staying curious stops the spiral — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I don't really see how staying curious stops the spiral" – you're already caught up in the "stop" part. What if, instead of trying to "stop" the spiral, curiosity simply watched it happen – not because it was trying to control it, but because it was already happening? What would happen if curiosity met that spiral with a gentle "I see" – not as a reaction, but as a simple observation?

Patient: For a beat it quiets — my breath eases and the pictures blur, like a little window opens. Then the fortune-teller spits out a nastier scene — they pack up, tell everyone I'm the monster, I choke at work, lose the job and the house — and I'm yanked straight back. I don't really see how that "I see" changes anything long-term; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you say "I don't really see how that 'I see' changes anything long-term" – you're already caught up in the "change" part. What if, instead of wondering "what's it for?" (how will it change the outcome?), curiosity simply noticed what's happening right now – the pictures blurring, the breath easing, the window opening? What would happen if curiosity met that moment with a simple "this is what's happening" – not as a question, but as an observation?

Patient: When I actually say "this is what's happening" for a beat the pictures blur and my chest eases — like a tiny window opens — but then the fortune-teller screams a worse scene and I'm yanked right back: them packing, calling me the monster, me bombing at work, losing everything. I can try to hold that plain observation, but it feels like slapping a bandage on a dam that's about to blow, and I don't really see how it helps.
