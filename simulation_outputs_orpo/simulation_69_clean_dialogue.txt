Patient: Lately I've been getting intense anxiety in social settings — even small dinners with friends or visits with family make me shut down, so I've started avoiding most gatherings. I'm an older manager and it's felt worse since the kids left; I overthink everything and feel out of practice around people. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried things before and they didn't work, so how is talking about it supposed to change anything?

Therapist: That sense of overwhelm when socializing feels like it's completely shutting down your life right now. When you say you avoid these gatherings, what's one thing you notice happens to your thoughts and feelings when you try to participate (e.g., do you feel more anxious, numb, or frustrated)?

Patient: Mostly I get this tightness in my chest and my mind fills with worst-case thoughts — that I’ll say something stupid or bore people, and then I go kind of numb, like I’m watching myself. Afterward I feel frustrated and ashamed and promise I’ll do better next time, which never helps. People tell me to "notice" those thoughts, but how is that supposed to help? I've tried that and it just felt pointless.

Therapist: Those worst-case thoughts sound like they're fueling a fire – they make you feel like you're stuck in a cycle of self-criticism and avoidance. What would it be like if, instead of trying to change those thoughts, you made space for one small thing you actually value about yourself (e.g., being present with friends, sharing a meal)?

Patient: I guess I value being attentive and offering quiet support — that's the kind of person I want to be. But when I try to hold that in mind in a room full of people, it just feels like another thing I'm failing at; I've tried focusing on values before and it didn't stop the panic. How is reminding myself of that supposed to help when my chest tightens and my brain goes blank?

Therapist: When your chest tightens and you feel like you're blanking out, what's one tiny thing you can do with just your breath to make room for that value of quiet support? For example, can you take just one deep breath in without trying to control it, and then slowly let it out?

Patient: I can try that — okay, I take a deep breath in and let it out slowly. It does ease the tightness for a few seconds, but then the worst-case thoughts rush back and I feel just as panicky. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny break?

Therapist: That tiny break with the breathwork is actually a moment when you can test the value of quiet support – like, what would it be like if you simply showed up with that quiet support, even if it's just for a second? Instead of trying to control the thoughts, what if you just gave yourself permission to be present with that one person (e.g., a friend, family member) for just 5 seconds?

Patient: Okay, I can force myself to be present for five seconds — it does calm the tightness a little, but only briefly before the thoughts roll back and I go numb. How is stretching five seconds supposed to change anything when I always end up panicking afterward? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: When you say the thoughts roll back and you go numb, what's one thing you notice about your body that happens right before you numb out? (e.g., does your jaw tighten, your legs feel heavy, or do your eyes glaze over?)

Patient: Usually my jaw clenches first and my shoulders hitch up, my breathing gets shallow and my vision goes a bit fuzzy. Then I go flat, like I'm watching myself from the outside and can't pull back in. I know you're asking me to notice this, but how is noticing my clenched jaw supposed to stop the panic? I've tried being aware and it just feels like labeling the problem without fixing it.

Therapist: Those physical sensations sound like a physical response to the panic – like your body is trying to protect itself. What if, instead of trying to stop the sensations, you simply noticed what they were telling you? What if your clenched jaw was saying, "I'm holding space for something important, but I'm not sure what"?

Patient: I suppose it could be saying that — like I'm bracing for judgment, afraid I'll seem irrelevant or boring, or that people will see me as a faded version of myself since the kids left. But honestly, labeling it as a “message” doesn't make the panic stop — how is that supposed to help beyond a neat sentence? If noticing is step one, what's a practical step two that actually helps me stay present for longer than five seconds?

Therapist: Those physical sensations – the clenched jaw, hitching shoulders, shallow breathing – what's one tiny thing you can do with your body right now to make room for that fear? Instead of trying to stop the fear, what if you just made space for it by taking one small physical action that's opposite of what you're doing now?

Patient: Alright — I can try relaxing my jaw, dropping my shoulders, and breathing into my belly, letting my hands rest open on my lap. Doing that now does ease the tightness for a few seconds, but the panic and numbness still rush back — how is that supposed to help me stay present for more than a moment? I'm willing to try it again if you can give me a clear, practical next step for when the numbness returns.

Therapist: As you breathe into your belly and relax your jaw, what's one value you're holding onto right now that feels true for you, even if it's just for a moment? For example, is it the value of being present with your friend, or the value of taking care of your own body? When the numbness returns, notice that value – don't try to change it, just notice it.

Patient: I suppose the value is being quietly supportive and present — that still feels true, even if only for a moment. But right now my chest sped up and my mind's scattering; I'm more anxious and distracted than a minute ago, and I'm honestly doubtful that just noticing will stop me from going numb. How is that supposed to help me stay present longer — what's a concrete next thing I can do when it slips away?

Therapist: When you notice your chest speeding up and your mind scattering, what's the tiny physical action that connects to being quietly supportive and present? For example, is it making a small breath into your belly, or gently placing your hand on your knee? When you notice that value again, what's the smallest thing you can do to take care of it?

Patient: The smallest thing I can do is put my hand flat on my knee, relax my jaw, and take one slow belly breath — maybe quietly say to myself, “I’m here,” under my breath. It pulls me back for a few seconds and calms the tightness, but then the racing chest and scatter come right back and I drift. Okay, I’ll try that again — but honestly, how is that supposed to add up to staying present for more than a moment? What's the next concrete thing I do when that slip happens?

Therapist: When you put your hand flat on your knee, relax your jaw, and take one slow belly breath, what's the next thing you could do with your hands that's connected to being quietly supportive and present? For example, could you gently press your palm into your knee, or make a small fist? This action is small, but it's something you can do right now that's connected to your value. When the slip happens again, what's the smallest thing you can do to stay with that value?

Patient: I can press my palm into my knee and make tiny circles with my thumb — it’s subtle and feels like something steady to hang on to. It does pull me back for a few seconds, but right now my chest is racing and my mind’s all over the place, so it still slips away — how is that supposed to add up to staying present longer? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: When you make those tiny circles with your thumb, what's one physical sensation that's happening in your body that's connected to the racing chest and mind's scatter? For example, is it a knot in your chest, or a heaviness in your shoulders? When you notice that sensation, what's the one tiny thing you can do to acknowledge it without trying to change it?

Patient: It's a tight knot in my chest, my head's buzzing and my shoulders feel heavy, and my thoughts are jumping all over the place. I can put my hand on my chest and quietly say, "This is anxiety," just to name it without trying to fix it. But I've done that before and it only buys me a beat — how is that supposed to help me actually stay present longer when it just slips away?

Therapist: Instead of trying to "fix" the anxiety by naming it, what if you simply used that moment to notice how the naming feels in your body? For example, what happens to your hand when you touch your chest and say "this is anxiety"? Does it feel heavy, tense, or light? By noticing that physical sensation, you're not trying to change the anxiety, you're just paying attention to the sensation of paying attention.

Patient: My hand feels heavy and a bit clammy — touching my chest makes the knot feel more real for a second, and my fingers tremble a little. Noticing it calms me for a beat, then my thoughts leap to worst‑case stuff and the panic ramps up again. How is paying attention to that supposed to stop the slide back into numbness — it just feels like another thing I'm failing at.

Therapist: When your thoughts leap to worst-case scenarios, what's one tiny thing you could do with that thought that doesn't try to change it? For example, could you simply acknowledge it with a small phrase, like "That's a thought"? Or could you look at it as a tiny, fleeting thought that's already passing? By doing that, you're not trying to "stop" the thoughts, you're just paying attention to the fact that you're thinking them.

Patient: I can try whispering "that's a thought" and keep making the little thumb‑circles on my knee to let it float by. It does pull me back for a couple of seconds, but right now my chest's racing, my hands feel cold, and my focus is scattered so it slips away almost immediately. I've done the labeling before and it just feels like a band‑aid — how is that supposed to help beyond a brief pause, and what do I actually do the instant it slides away?

Therapist: When the thought "that's a thought" slips away, what's the smallest action you can take to actually hold onto the pause, even if it's just for a micro-second? Instead of trying to label it again, what if you simply... look at the sensation of your hand on your knee? Notice the weight, the pressure, the texture? That's it – just notice that. It's not about changing anything, just observing the physical sensation of presence.

Patient: I do try to feel the weight and texture — my thumb‑circles and the pressure on my knee feel real for a second, but then my chest tightens, my hands go cold, and my thoughts bolt. It calms me only for a beat — how is noticing the hand supposed to keep me from sliding into numbness? I need a clear, concrete thing to do the instant it slips away — what do I actually do then?

Therapist: When your chest tightens, your hands go cold, and your thoughts bolt, what's the first tiny thing you can do with your gaze that doesn't try to change anything? Look at the space around your hand on your knee – notice the edge of the table, the texture of the fabric, the color of the wall. That's it – just look at the immediate environment. It's not about changing anything, just noticing the concrete, tangible world around you.

Patient: I try that — I look at the edge of the table and the fabric by my hand. It pulls me back for a breath, the colors and texture feel real for a second, but then my chest starts pounding and my mind bolts away again. I'm more anxious and distracted right now, so how is just staring at the wall supposed to do more than give me a tiny pause? Give me a concrete thing to do the exact instant it slips — not another idea to try that fades in seconds.

Therapist: When your chest starts pounding and your mind bolts away, the exact instant it slips, you will: slowly, without thinking, draw your finger to the tip of your thumb and touch it to your wrist. That's it. Just touch your wrist with your finger.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to touch my fingertip to my thumb and then my wrist? How is that supposed to help when my chest's already pounding and my head's all over the place? I can try it — okay, I did it and it calmed me for a beat, but then the panic rushed back. If that doesn't hold, what exactly do I do next? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling and honestly skeptical it'll do more than a tiny pause.

Therapist: When you touch your fingertip to your thumb and your wrist, what happens right then? What physical sensation do you notice in your body? Do you feel any change in your breathing, your heartbeat, or your posture? That's what you're aiming for – not to stop the panic, but to notice the tiny shift in your physical experience.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I do it I get a tiny, grounding sensation: my fingertip feels a little warmer, my breath eases for a second and my shoulders drop a bit. My hands still feel cold and clammy, my heart's still pounding, and within a few breaths the knot in my chest and the panicky thoughts rush back. It helps for a beat, but I don't see how noticing that shift actually keeps me from slipping into numbness — what exactly am I supposed to do the instant the panic floods back?

Therapist: When the panic rushes back, the instant you feel your body tighten up again, you will: take a tiny breath into your belly, without trying to control it. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. That's it – just the sensation of the breath, not the thought of breathing.

Patient: Okay — I try that tiny belly breath and I can feel my shoulders drop for a second and the air move in and out, but now my chest's racing again and my thoughts are scattering. I'm not sure how that one breath is supposed to do more than give me a beat — what exactly do I do the instant it floods back? I'm jittery and distracted right now and honestly skeptical this will hold.

Therapist: When your chest starts racing again and your thoughts scatter, the exact instant it floods back, you will: notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. That's right – just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight, the pressure. Don't try to change anything, just notice that.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to just notice my feet? I tried it and it did ground me for a second: I felt the weight on my heels and a tiny sense of contact, my breath eased for a beat. But then my chest's still pounding, my mind bolts, and the panic rushes back; I'm jittery and distracted and honestly skeptical this will do more than another short pause. How is noticing my feet supposed to help me stay present longer, and what's the exact, concrete thing I do the instant it slips again? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: When your chest starts pounding again and your thoughts scatter, the exact instant it floods back, you will: pause for a tiny fraction of a second (about 1/10th of a second) before taking your next breath. That's it – just pause for a moment before inhaling. This creates a small gap between the panic and your next breath, giving you a tiny window to notice what's happening just before you breathe again.

Patient: I can try pausing for that fraction of a second — I did it just now and it made a tiny gap, my shoulders eased a hair, but my chest is still racing and my thoughts bolt right away. How is that supposed to help when it always floods back? Tell me the exact thing I do the instant that little gap closes — I need something that lasts more than a beat because I'm jittery and can't seem to hold on.

Therapist: When the pause closes and your chest starts racing again, the exact instant it floods back, you will: place one finger on the wrist of the hand that's touching your knee. That's it – just place your finger on the wrist, without thinking. This creates a small, physical anchor that you can focus on, even when the panic returns.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to place one finger on my wrist? Okay, I did it and it gave a tiny grounding sensation: my shoulder eased and my breath slowed for a beat. But then the chest pounding and racing thoughts rushed back and it felt like another brief pause that doesn't stick. How is that supposed to help me stay present longer, and what exactly do I do the instant that anchor fails? I'm jittery and distracted and honestly skeptical this will add up to anything useful.

Therapist: When the chest pounding and racing thoughts return, the exact instant it floods back, you will: speak the anchor phrase out loud, just to yourself, without trying to control the words. It doesn't matter what the phrase is – just say it. For example, "I've got this" or "I'm here". This creates a small, audible gap between the panic and your next breath, giving you a tiny window to notice what's happening.

Patient: Say the phrase out loud? I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "I'm here" out loud supposed to be different from thinking it? I tried whispering "I'm here" and it gave me a tiny gap: shoulders dropped, breath eased for a beat, then the panic surged back and my hands went cold. If that only buys me a breath, what's the exact, concrete thing I do the instant that beat ends? I'm jittery and honestly starting to feel like this is just another band‑aid.

Therapist: When the beat ends and the panic returns, the exact instant it floods back, you will: make a tiny, specific movement with your non-dominant hand. It doesn't matter what the movement is – just make something. For example, tap your non-dominant foot, wiggle your non-dominant finger, or rotate your non-dominant wrist. This creates a small, physical anchor that you can focus on, even when the panic returns.

Patient: I can try that — I wiggled my non‑dominant finger just now and it grounded me for a split second, then the panic rushed right back. I'm jittery and distracted and honestly none of these tiny anchors seem to stick — how is a finger wiggle supposed to add up to staying present for more than a breath? Tell me the exact, step‑by‑step thing I do the instant that little anchor fails, because right now this just feels like another string of band‑aids.

Therapist: When the panic returns, the exact instant it floods back, you will: **pause before taking your next breath**. Not just a tiny pause, but a deliberate pause that lasts until you feel the breath move in and out of your body. Don't try to control the breath, just notice the sensation of the breath moving. This creates a small, tangible gap between the panic and your next action, giving you a chance to stay present.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I did the deliberate pause and it made a tiny gap, my shoulders eased for a moment, but then my chest started racing and my mind scattered. I'm jittery and distracted right now and honestly skeptical this will hold; if that deliberate pause collapses, what exactly do I do the instant it floods back? I need a clear, step‑by‑step thing I can do in that exact second, not another idea that fades after a beat.

Therapist: When the panic returns, the exact instant it floods back, you will: **take one slow, deep breath into your belly**. Not just any breath, but a slow, deliberate breath that focuses on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, say to yourself: "In." As you exhale, say: "Out." This creates a small, physical anchor that grounds you in the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I tried the slow belly breath, saying "In" on the inhale and "Out" on the exhale. It eased the pounding for a second and my shoulders dropped a bit, but then my chest started racing again and my mind scattered — I'm jittery and distracted right now. How is that supposed to help me more than a tiny pause, and what exactly do I do the instant that breath‑gap collapses? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling and honestly skeptical this will do more than another band‑aid.
