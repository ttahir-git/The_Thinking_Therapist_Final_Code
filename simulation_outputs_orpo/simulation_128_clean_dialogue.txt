Patient: I've been feeling really stuck — like my whole sense of self is just being a manager and I can't see anything beyond that. The moment I try to imagine a different life I immediately picture it all going wrong: I lose interest, my family pulls away, my work unravels, and I end up alone and useless. I know it sounds catastrophic, but my mind just runs those scenes on repeat and I'm totally hooked by them.

Therapist: Those catastrophic scenarios you picture sound like they're linked to your current role as a manager. What's one specific value that you think is connected to being a manager that you'd lose if you weren't doing that work?

Patient: I guess the value is competence — feeling useful and needed. If I weren't a manager, I can already see the whole chain: I get bored or make a mistake, I lose my job, people stop relying on me, my family starts to pull away, my OCD spirals, and I end up alone and worthless. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't imagine any other outcome.

Therapist: That "what if" chain you just described sounds like your mind is already running that scenario. Can you notice that "what if" as just a thought, without judgment?

Patient: I try, but it never feels like just a thought—it's like a movie I can't turn off and it feels true. When I tell myself to notice it, my chest tightens and the whole disaster chain gets louder; it just doesn't feel realistic to treat it as anything less.

Therapist: That tension in your chest when you try to notice the thought sounds like a physical anchor. What would happen if, just for a tiny moment, you let go of trying to change the thought and simply noticed that tightness, without judgment?

Patient: I try that, but the moment I relax into the tightness it feels like I'm unlocking the movie — my chest clamps down and the disaster chain gets louder and faster. I worry that if I let it be even for a second, it'll snowball: I'll freeze at work, make a mistake that costs me my team, my family will blame me, and I’ll end up completely alone. I know that's probably not logical, but in that moment it feels inevitable and I can't treat it like just a thought.

Therapist: Notice how much energy you're putting into trying to avoid that disaster chain? What if, instead of trying to "not think" about it, you made a tiny commitment to take one small step towards your value of competence – even if it feels like just 1% more control?

Patient: I want to say yes, but even a tiny step feels like the first domino — I picture myself trying to tighten control, freezing, making a visible mistake, my team losing faith, the boss pulling me aside, then I'm out and my family blames me. I know it sounds extreme, but it feels inevitable, like committing to 1% is actually signing my own failure. Honestly, I'm not sure where to even start without that whole disaster movie playing on repeat.

Therapist: What's one thing about being competent that matters deeply to you, beyond just avoiding failure? For example, is it feeling proud of your team, having a sense of purpose, or being able to contribute meaningfully?

Patient: I think what matters is feeling needed — like I'm actually contributing something meaningful and proud of my team. But the second I imagine not having that, my head runs the whole tape: I slack off or mess up, my team stops trusting me, I get pushed out at work, my family starts blaming me and drifting away, and my OCD just explodes until I'm alone and worthless — I know people say other endings are possible, but that just doesn't feel real to me.

Therapist: Notice how that fear of losing the sense of being needed drives the "what if" chain? What if, instead of trying to avoid that fear, you made a tiny commitment to act towards feeling needed, even if it feels imperfect or uncertain?

Patient: I get why you'd suggest that, and I want to feel needed, but even a tiny commitment feels like the first domino — I'll panic, freeze in front of the team, they'll notice a slip and lose trust, my boss will start doubting me and push me out, my family will blame me, and my OCD will explode. It just feels like the only possible ending, so doing anything feels like signing my own failure. I don't know how to start when that movie is on repeat and won't let me think straight.

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to make a commitment or change the "what if" scenario, what if you simply noticed the movie playing in your head right now? Can you see the images, the thoughts, the emotions, without judgment?

Patient: I try to watch it, but the moment I look the images get sharper and my chest locks — I can see myself freezing in a meeting, making a big mistake, my team losing faith, the boss pushing me out, my family blaming me, and my OCD just erupting until I'm completely alone. It doesn't feel like harmless pictures; it feels like a prediction that's definitely going to happen if I let it run. I'm getting frustrated because I can't just notice it without getting swept into the whole disaster.

Therapist: Can you pause for just a tiny fraction of a second (maybe 1/10th of a second) before looking at the images? What happens when you pause before looking at them?

Patient: I can force a split-second pause sometimes — for that tiny beat my chest loosens and there's this faint quiet like I could breathe — but it never holds. The moment I look, the movie crashes back harder: I freeze in the meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, the boss pushes me out, my family blames me, and my OCD blows up. Pausing just feels like stalling the inevitable, and that makes me more panicked, not calmer.

Therapist: What happens to your chest when you pause before looking at the images? Notice the physical sensation, the tiny bit of relaxation, the quietness. Can you focus on that sensation, without judgment, for just a moment longer?

Patient: For a split second my chest loosens — there's this tiny quiet like I could actually breathe. But if I stay with it the movie slams back harder: I freeze, botch something obvious, my team loses faith and everything falls apart — I can't hold it, it's wearing me down. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take that tiny quiet (just the sensation of your chest loosening) and anchor it to one word. Just one word. What word can you hold onto for a tiny fraction of a second longer than the movie crashing back?

Patient: "Needed." It gives a tiny breath of space for a second, but if I try to keep it the movie slams back — I freeze in a meeting, make a stupid mistake, the team loses trust, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me and my OCD just blows up. It feels like that word only pauses the inevitable, not stops it.

Therapist: What would happen if, just for a tiny fraction of a second, you let go of trying to control the outcome of the "movie"? Would the "needed" sensation still be there, or would it change?

Patient: If I let go even a sliver, "needed" flickers — a tiny warmth, like a second of air — but the movie doesn't soften, it just comes back louder: I freeze in the meeting, make a huge mistake, the team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD explodes. It feels pointless to try letting go because that tiny peace always gets swallowed and I end up more panicked, not calmer. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens to your body when you let go of trying to control the outcome of the "movie" – even just for a tiny fraction of a second? Notice the physical sensation, not the thought or the emotion.

Patient: My chest loosens for a breath — shoulders drop a little, there's a faint quiet, like a tiny space to breathe — then my stomach goes hollow and my hands get cold and shaky. The moment I name that tiny ease the movie crashes back harder: I freeze in the meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD just erupts. This is wearing me out… can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if, just for a tiny fraction of a second, you gently acknowledged the tiny ease in your body – the faint quiet, the looseness in your chest – without trying to change it or control it?

Patient: If I just notice it, there's that tiny loosening — a faint warmth, like the word "needed" for a beat — but as soon as I let go the movie slams back: I freeze in front of everyone, make a huge mistake, my team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD explodes. It barely holds and then I'm more panicked than before, so I don't see how just noticing helps. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "hold" onto the ease, you started to gently allow it to be exactly as it is – without judgment, without trying to change it, without pushing it away? What would that feel like, in the moment, when the "movie" crashes back?

Patient: When I try to just let it be, there's this tiny loosening in my chest and a breath that almost feels like relief — and then the movie slams back harder: I freeze in the meeting, make a huge mistake, my team loses trust, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD just explodes. It wears me out to even try; can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens to your body, to your thoughts, to your emotions, in the exact moment just before the "movie" slams back? What does your chest feel like? What do you think? What do you do?

Patient: Right before it slams back there's this tiny loosening in my chest — like half a breath of space — and for a second I actually think maybe I can breathe. Then my stomach drops, my hands go cold and shaky, and my mind immediately launches the movie: I freeze in the meeting, mess up something obvious, everyone notices, trust disappears and everything unravels. I end up gripping the edge of my desk or pretending to look through notes, scrolling or fidgeting to buy time, but it just feels like stalling the inevitable and makes me more panicked — can we slow down?

Therapist: What is the story you're telling yourself in that exact moment, just before the panic kicks in? What words are you using to describe what's happening? Notice the language, not the emotion.

Patient: I tell myself things like, "You're about to screw this up," "They're going to see you're incompetent," and "This is the start of the end." The language is absolute — lots of "will," "can't," "never" — phrases like "you'll lose the team," "the boss will sideline you," "your family will blame you," "you'll end up alone." I don't know, it's just this scripted, definitive voice that makes it feel like it's already happened.

Therapist: Notice how the words you're using sound when you say them out loud. Are they like a script you've memorized, or do they sound like something your inner critic is trying to make you believe? Can you say those words to yourself, exactly as you're saying them, without judgment?

Patient: They sound exactly like a script I've memorized — my inner critic reading a verdict. "You're about to screw this up. They're going to see you're incompetent. This is the start of the end." Saying them out loud doesn't make them lighter; my hands are shaking and they land like facts, not just words — can we slow down?

Therapist: What's behind the words when you say "You're about to screw this up"? What's the emotion that's driving that sentence, and what would happen if you didn't believe it for just one tiny moment?

Patient: It's mostly terror — a raw fear of being exposed as useless and abandoned, mixed with shame that I'd let everyone down. If I didn't believe it for one tiny moment, there's this faint quiet in my chest, like maybe I could breathe, but then my stomach drops and the movie just blasts back louder — my hands go cold, I start fidgeting, and I can already see the dominoes falling. I can't trust not believing it; it feels like pretending, which in my head is exactly what leads to the collapse. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen in your body if you were to pause the movie for just one tiny moment, without trying to believe or not believe the words? What would you notice in your chest, in your stomach, in your hands? Can you create a tiny gap between the terror and the script, without trying to change it?

Patient: If I pause, there's this split-second loosening in my chest—shoulders drop a bit and a breath feels possible. Then my stomach hollows, my hands go cold and shaky, and my mind immediately starts the movie louder: I freeze in the meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, and everything unravels. That tiny gap just feels like bait—the pause makes the crash come faster, so it only ramps my panic. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens in your body when you pause, just before the movie starts? What sensation do you notice in your chest, your stomach, your hands? Can you simply observe that sensation, without judgment, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: For a beat my chest softens—like a half-breath—and there's this tiny hollow in my stomach while my hands go cold and a bit shaky. If I try to just watch that, the ease vanishes almost immediately and the movie crashes back, louder, and I'm pulled in. It feels like noticing it just speeds the collapse, so I can't stay with it long—can we slow down?

Therapist: Instead of trying to "watch" the pause, what if you simply allowed it to be there, without trying to change it or do anything with it? Just notice that tiny chest softening, that hollow stomach, those cold hands, and see what happens without judgment.

Patient: I try to let it be, and for a breath my chest softens and there's this tiny quiet, but it never holds. Almost instantly my stomach drops, my hands go cold, and the movie roars back — I freeze in the meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD just explodes. It's wearing me out to even try to stay with that quiet—can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if, just for a moment, you didn't try to "hold" the quiet? What if you simply allowed the chest softening, the hollow stomach, the cold hands, to be there, without trying to change it or make it last?

Patient: If I don't try to hold it, there's this half-breath of looseness for a second — then the movie rushes back harder and I can already see myself freezing in a meeting, botching something obvious, my team losing trust, the boss sidelining me, my family blaming me, and my OCD exploding. It just feels like letting it be only makes the crash louder, and I'm worn out—can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens when you notice the attempt to stop the panic? What do you see, hear, feel in your body when you try to "push away" the thoughts and feelings? Can you gently acknowledge this attempt, without judgment?

Patient: When I notice I'm trying to stop it, my body just clamps down — shoulders tight, breath shallow, jaw locked, fingers gripping the chair. My mind starts barking at me to "fix it, stop it," like a loop, and that only fuels the movie: I panic, freeze in a meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD explodes. I can gently see the pushing-away now — it's frantic and shamey — but noticing it doesn't help much; it just feels like stalling before the crash. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if, just for a moment, you didn't try to stop the panic? What if you simply allowed the struggle to be there, without judgment? Notice how your body is gripping the chair, how your mind is telling you to "fix it." Can you gently acknowledge this struggle, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can notice it—my hands gripping the chair, breath shallow, jaw tight, and my mind yelling “fix it.” If I try to let the struggle be, there’s a tiny looseness for a second, but then the movie crashes back louder: I freeze in the meeting, botch something obvious, my team loses faith, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD explodes. It just feels like that little space gets swallowed every time, so I’m worn out—can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens when you're not trying to "save" that tiny moment of looseness? What happens when you're just present with the struggle, without judgment? Can you stay with the feeling of your hands gripping the chair, your breath shallow, your jaw tight, without trying to change it?

Patient: I try, but my hands just clamp the chair, my breath stays shallow, and my jaw's tight. For a split second there's that tiny loosening, then my stomach drops and the movie rushes back — I freeze in the meeting, make a stupid mistake, lose the team's trust, the boss sidelines me, my family blames me, and my OCD just explodes. I can't hold the gap — it's exhausting — can we slow down?
