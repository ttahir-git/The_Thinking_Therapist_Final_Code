Patient: I started a demanding new accounting role and I can't stop worrying I'll make a mistake or look incompetent, which just makes me put things off until the last minute. I keep ruminating over every detail and then freeze instead of starting the task. I guess — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That cycle of worrying and putting off work sounds really draining. What's one small task you've been putting off that's been weighing on you, and what would happen to you if you just committed to doing it for 2 minutes, even if it felt "imperfect"?

Patient: I'm avoiding reconciling a client's quarter-end ledger—it's so detailed and I keep fearing one missed entry will make me look incompetent. If I forced myself to work on it for 2 minutes I'd probably just open the file, get overwhelmed by how messy it looks, and freeze because it feels too imperfect to continue. I've tried doing tiny chunks before though—how is that supposed to help when the anxiety just shuts me down after a minute?

Therapist: The value you mentioned earlier about doing good work for your client seems connected to your anxiety about this ledger. What would it mean to you to actually reconcile that ledger, not just for the client, but for yourself as a competent professional?

Patient: I guess it would mean I can actually handle complicated stuff and maybe stop telling myself I'm incompetent all the time. But I'm also afraid that even if I do it, one tiny mistake will blow it all up and the doubt will come back tenfold. I don't see how that really helps though — even when I prove I can do something, the worry just shifts to the next task; how is this supposed to fix that?

Therapist: That fear of making one mistake seems to be a story you're already living – telling yourself that it will blow everything up. Can you notice the thought "one tiny mistake will blow it all up" as just that – a thought, not a prediction?

Patient: I can kind of notice it as a thought — like a voice that always goes to worst-case — but it still feels like a fact in my chest. Labeling it doesn't stop my heart or the urge to avoid the task. How is that supposed to help when the feeling stays the same?

Therapist: Even though the thought stays with you, what if, while you're still sitting with that ledger, you just make room for the story to be there, without trying to change it or avoid it? Can you try to notice your breath, or the sensation of your feet on the floor, right where your mind is telling you you're stuck?

Patient: I’ve tried that breathing/grounding stuff — when I sit with the ledger and try to notice my breath I get maybe ten seconds of calm, then my chest tightens and my brain goes straight back to “what if I miss something.” It doesn’t stop me from freezing or opening the file and closing it five minutes later. How is that supposed to help when it just feels like stalling?

Therapist: What would it mean to you to actually take one small step towards reconciling that ledger, just to prove to yourself that you can do it? Would it be to open the file, scan the first page, or type a single sentence?

Patient: Okay — maybe I could just open the file and reconcile the first account, like match the first five entries, for two minutes and stop there if I need to. But I’m skeptical: I’ve tried tiny steps before and the anxiety kills me after a minute — how is that supposed to keep me going past that one-minute freeze?

Therapist: Matching the first five entries isn't about avoiding the anxiety, but about taking action with the value of doing good work for your client in mind. What would it mean to you to have done that work, even if it felt imperfect or rushed?

Patient: Maybe it'd feel like a small win — proof I can handle the detail and not be totally incompetent. But honestly, I've finished messy stuff before and my brain just hunts for the next flaw, so the relief never lasts. I get the values thing, but how is doing one imperfect reconciliation supposed to actually break the pattern of freezing when the anxiety spikes?

Therapist: The relief from completing that first reconciliation might be fleeting, but what if, right after you finish, you just acknowledge the anxiety without judgment – no thought about the flaw, no story about why you're not good enough. Can you take that moment to simply notice it, without acting on it?

Patient: I can try to notice it after I finish, but when I do that it just feels like I'm mentally cataloguing every fear instead of actually calming down — the thought stays loud and my body stays keyed up. How is that supposed to stop my brain from immediately hunting for the next mistake or freezing the next time I open a file? If you mean for me to try it, can you tell me what that actually looks like in the moment, step by step, because vague "notice without judgment" hasn't helped me.

Therapist: Let's try this: When you notice your mind racing about the next mistake or flaw (noticing it as "the thought"), what happens right after that? What physical sensation does it create in your body? (e.g., tightness in your chest, shoulders, or jaw).

Patient: Right after the thought pops up my chest goes tight, my breathing gets shallow, my shoulders hike up, and my jaw clenches — my heart starts racing and my hands feel a bit tingly like I should get away from the screen. It happens so fast that my brain just locks and I either stare at the file or close it and scroll my phone until the feeling fades. I can name those sensations, sure, but I don't see how noticing them stops the freeze — how is that supposed to help me actually keep working?

Therapist: Notice that your chest tightness, shallow breathing, and jumpy heart are physical sensations that happen when the thought "I need to avoid this" shows up. When you feel that tightness in your chest, what happens if you actually acknowledge it, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: When I try to just notice it, it actually feels like the feeling gets louder — my chest tightens more, breathing speeds up, and my mind immediately starts listing every possible consequence. That usually makes me shut the file or scroll my phone because I can't focus. How is acknowledging it supposed to stop that cascade when it feels like I'm just making the alarm louder?

Therapist: Instead of saying "I'm avoiding this," what if you say to yourself, "My chest is tight" – just that one phrase, without judgment? Notice how the thought doesn't come up again when you say "my chest is tight" – the focus is on the physical sensation, not the idea of avoiding it.

Patient: I tried saying stuff like that before — "my chest is tight" — and it felt like I was just labeling the alarm and it got louder a few seconds later. It just ends up feeling like I'm annotating the panic instead of stopping it, and then I still shut the file. How is that actually gonna keep me from freezing or hunting for mistakes?

Therapist: Let's try a tiny tweak: instead of saying "my chest is tight," try saying "the tightness in my chest is here" – just that phrase, without judgment or explanation. Notice what happens when you say it with a completely neutral tone, without trying to change it or do anything with it.

Patient: I actually tried saying "the tightness in my chest is here" out loud when I opened the ledger just now — for about ten seconds it dulled the edge and my breathing eased a bit, but then the worry came back louder and I felt the pull to close the file. I still ended up shutting it after a few minutes because my brain started cataloguing every possible mistake. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a tiny pause before the panic wins?

Therapist: Notice that you were able to stay with the phrase "the tightness in my chest is here" for a few seconds, even after the worry came back. What if, while you were saying it, you also noticed what was physically happening in your body, like the sensation of your feet touching the floor or the sound of your breath moving in and out?

Patient: I could feel my feet planted, a bit heavier on the floor, like I'm bracing; my breath was quick and shallow, my shoulders and jaw tensed, and my hands felt tingly—my eyes kept darting to my phone. Noticing that dulled it for a few seconds, then my brain just started cataloguing mistakes and I froze—how is that supposed to help me actually keep working past that one‑minute shutdown? If we're doing this in the moment, what's the step‑by‑step: say "the tightness in my chest is here," notice my feet, then... do I go back to the file or keep staying with the sensations?

Therapist: Here's the step-by-step: 
1. Say "the tightness in my chest is here" with a completely neutral tone.
2. Notice your feet on the floor, even if it feels like they're bracing (e.g., "My feet are planted").
3. **Don't** try to change the thought or go back to the file. Just stay with the sensations (e.g., "My shoulders are tense").
4. Keep going like this for as long as you can, even if it feels uncomfortable – no judgment, no struggle.

Patient: Okay — I tried those steps just now. Saying "the tightness in my chest is here" in a flat voice and noticing my feet did dull it for maybe 15–20 seconds, and I could feel my shoulders and jaw relax a bit, but then my brain started cataloguing mistakes and the pull to close the file came back hard. So when that cataloguing starts, what do I actually do next — keep naming each thought, go back to the file, or something else? Because honestly this feels like a bandaid that only buys me seconds, and I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed by how fast it falls apart. How is this supposed to get me past the freeze for real?

Therapist: When the cataloging thought returns, **don't** try to name each thought (that's just fueling the cycle). Instead, **pause again** – just take a brief breath, notice the physical sensations, and **look around** the room. That's it. No thinking, no judgment, no struggle. Just noticing the surroundings.

Patient: I tried that just now—paused, took a breath, and looked around the room. It did pull me out for like 10–20 seconds, but then my brain immediately started listing mistakes again and the urge to close the file came back hard. How is that supposed to help me keep working when the pause only lasts a few seconds? If the urge to escape wins over the pause, what do I actually do next—force myself back to the file or keep repeating the pause until it sticks?

Therapist: When the urge to escape returns, **don't** try to force yourself back to the file or repeat the pause. Instead, **do** one tiny step that connects to the value you mentioned earlier (e.g., "doing good work for my client"). What's a **single action** you can take right now that aligns with that value?

Patient: I can try this right now: open the ledger and reconcile the first five entries for two minutes, set a timer, and stop when it goes off. My chest's tight, my heart's racing, my hands feel jittery and my mind keeps darting to other things, so I'm already shaky about it. But honestly—how is that supposed to help when I usually freeze within a minute and the anxiety just wins?

Therapist: When you say "I'll open the ledger and reconcile the first five entries for two minutes," notice that you're not saying "I'll do this perfectly" or "I'll avoid any mistakes." Just focus on the **specific action** you're taking: "I'll open the ledger and start reconciling the first five entries for two minutes."

Patient: Okay — I'll open the ledger and try to reconcile the first five entries for two minutes, not worrying about perfection. Honestly, my chest's already tight and I can feel myself gearing up to freeze in like 30 seconds — how are you supposed to help when that happens? If I start to close the file, tell me exactly what to do next step-by-step.

Therapist: As you feel yourself gearing up to freeze, notice your chest tightness, and just **stop**. Don't try to push through or make a decision yet. Instead, look at the **first five entries on the screen** and **say aloud**, "I see the first five transactions." That's it. Just acknowledge the words "I see the first five transactions" without judgment, without thinking about what they mean.

Patient: I said it out loud—“I see the first five transactions”—and for a couple seconds my chest eased and my hands steadied a bit, but then my brain started cataloguing mistakes and the urge to close the file hit hard. When that happens, what exactly should I do next—say the phrase again, stare at the entries, or actually start matching them? Because honestly that pause only lasts seconds and I usually freeze; how is this supposed to get me past the freeze when I'm already jittery and distracted?

Therapist: When the cataloging thought hits, don't try to repeat the phrase or stare at the entries. Instead, **choose one small step** to match the first transaction. Just pick one – say "I'll match this first account" or "I'll start reconciling this one." That's a tiny action that connects to the value, and it gives you a **small reason to keep going**.

Patient: Alright — I'll try to match the first transaction, just confirm the date and amount and tick it off. I'm already shaky — chest tight, hands jittery — so how is that supposed to help when I usually freeze in like 30 seconds? If I do freeze, tell me the exact thing to do in that moment so I don't just shut the file and scroll my phone.

Therapist: As you're matching the first transaction, **just notice your hand on the mouse**, not the transaction itself. Say to yourself, "My hand is on the mouse." That's it. **Don't** think about the transaction, the file, or anything else. Just notice the physical sensation of your hand on the mouse. This small act of attention will **block** the freeze, and you'll have a chance to continue matching the transaction without getting stuck.

Patient: I said it out loud — “My hand is on the mouse” — and it calmed my fingers for maybe 5–10 seconds, like they weren’t shaking as much. Then my chest tightened again, my eyes kept darting away, and I felt the pull to shut the file. 

If I do freeze there, tell me the exact next step — one sentence and one physical action I can do in the moment (don’t give options). Be specific because I’m already jittery and I don’t trust vague stuff — how is that supposed to help me when the pause only lasts seconds?

Therapist: When your chest tightens and you feel the urge to shut the file, **look directly at the screen with your eyes and say "I see the cursor"**.

Patient: I looked at the screen and said “I see the cursor” out loud — it steadied my eyes and fingers for maybe five seconds. Then my chest tightened again, my hands started trembling, and I felt the pull to close the file and reach for my phone. If that only buys seconds, tell me one exact sentence and one physical action to do next — be specific, because I'm already jittery and skeptical this will stop the freeze.

Therapist: As your hands tremble, **place your dominant hand lightly on top of your mouse**, without pressing anything, just resting your hand.

Patient: I put my hand lightly on the mouse like you said — it steadied my fingers for maybe five seconds, then my chest tightened and I started eyeing my phone. I'm more jittery and distracted right now, honestly. Give me one exact sentence to say and one physical action to do next — one clear thing, no options — because these little tricks only buy seconds and I need something that actually stops the freeze. How is that supposed to help when it never lasts?

Therapist: When you feel the urge to look at your phone, **say "I will look at my screen again in 30 seconds"** and place your hand on the mouse again.

Patient: I said “I will look at my screen again in 30 seconds” and put my hand back on the mouse. It helped for like five, maybe ten seconds, then my chest tightened, my eyes kept darting to my phone, and my finger started twitching to pick it up. I’m really jittery and distracted right now — honestly, I’ve tried all these micro‑steps before and they just postpone the panic.

If that 30‑second thing fails and I’m about to shut the file, give me one exact sentence to say and one physical action to do in that moment — no options, no vague stuff. How is that supposed to actually stop me from freezing when the panic just comes back louder?

Therapist: When your finger twitches to pick up your phone, **say "I have my phone" and place your finger on the mouse instead**.

Patient: I said “I have my phone” and put my finger back on the mouse like you told me — it steadied my hand for maybe five seconds, then my chest tightened worse and my finger started twitching toward the phone again. I’m more jittery and distracted than before and honestly, this just feels like stalling. If that fails and I’m about to shut the file, give me one exact sentence to say and one exact physical action to do in that moment — no options, no vague stuff — because I need something that actually stops the freeze.

Therapist: When your finger twitches toward the phone, **pinch the bridge of your nose between your thumb and index finger**.

Patient: I pinched the bridge of my nose like you said — it calmed me for maybe five seconds, my breathing slowed a bit, but then my chest tightened again and my finger started twitching to the phone. Honestly, this just feels like another quick patch—how is that supposed to help when the panic comes back louder? If that fails and I'm about to shut the file, give me one exact sentence to say and one exact physical action to do in that moment — no options, no vagueness.

Therapist: When your finger twitches toward the phone, **touch the wristband or cuff of your watch with your thumb**.

Patient: I touched my watch like you said — it calmed me for maybe five seconds, then my chest tightened worse and my finger started twitching toward my phone again. I'm more anxious and distracted right now; if that fails, give me one exact sentence and one physical action to do in that moment — be specific, no options — because I need something that actually stops the freeze.
