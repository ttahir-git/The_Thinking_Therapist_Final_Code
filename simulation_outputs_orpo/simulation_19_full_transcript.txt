--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been burned out and my anger keeps flaring up in money-related interactions lately. The moment someone calls about a bill I can already see it — I blow up, get reported at work, lose my job, default on loans, lose the house, and end up alone and broke; that's definitely what's going to happen. People say it might not be that bad, but that just feels unrealistic, and I'm stuck predicting disasters over and over.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe an escalating cycle of anger triggered by bills, predicting catastrophic outcomes (losing your job, home, and relationships). Core emotion is panic. Goal: Examine the tangible function of this "disaster prediction" process to understand what it accomplishes (or doesn't).

Therapist Answer:
When you see that bill coming, what's one specific thing you're trying to protect or control by imagining all the bad things that could happen?

Patient: I guess I'm trying to protect myself from being blindsided and humiliated — if I can picture losing my job, house, everything, then at least I feel like I've anticipated it and won't be completely powerless. I know that sounds alarmist, but imagining the worst is the only thing that makes me feel like I've got any control.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the "worst-case scenario" to feel in control, but this avoidance strategy creates a paradox: the more you focus on what could go wrong, the more you're likely to be caught off guard. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to powerlessness.

Therapist Answer:
That sense of control sounds like it's rooted in avoiding feeling powerless, but what if, instead of waiting for the worst to happen, you could practice being present with the bill right now, without the need to predict disaster? What would it feel like to take one small step, just one tiny action, without having to imagine the worst?

Patient: Maybe the tiny step would be just opening the bill and reading the due date — I can almost imagine a little relief, like I actually know what I'm facing. But the instant I do, my head fills with the same chain: I blow up, someone reports me, I lose my job, default, lose the house — it's automatic and feels inevitable. I can't really see how staying with the bill without that catastrophe running on loop is possible; it just feels like lying to myself.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the tiny step (opening the bill) triggers the automatic catastrophic narrative, which feels like "lying" to yourself. Goal: Challenge this "inevitability" story by exploring what's actually happening when you stay present with the bill.

Therapist Answer:
When you say the catastrophic chain plays out automatically, what happens right before that mental movie starts? What physical sensation or thought shows up just before you start imagining the worst?

Patient: Right before it starts there's this sharp tightening in my chest and my stomach drops — my hands get clammy and my jaw clenches, like my body's bracing for impact. Then one thought pops up, clear as a bell: "This call/bill/etc. is the thing that ruins everything," and that sentence flips a switch. After that the disaster movie runs on loop and I can't seem to turn it off; breathing or telling myself other outcomes feels naive and doesn't cut through it. It just feels automatic, like those physical cues trigger the prediction and lock me into it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations (chest tightening, stomach drop, clammy hands, clenched jaw) and the thought ("This call/bill/etc. is the thing that ruins everything") that trigger the catastrophic narrative. Goal: Introduce a defusion technique to break the automatic loop.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how your body's physical response (the tightening chest, clammy hands) shows up before the thought ("This call/bill/etc. is the thing that ruins everything") appears. Can you gently acknowledge that thought as just that – a thought – without identifying with it or letting it take over?

Patient: I can try to call it "just a thought," but it feels hollow—saying that doesn't change how my chest tightens or how the sentence "this bill ruins everything" flips the switch. Even if I label it, the movie starts anyway; it feels like pretending everything's fine when I'm trying not to get blindsided. I don't know how to make that acknowledgment actually land—I'll say it, and I'm already picturing the chain of disasters.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that labeling the thought ("just a thought") feels superficial when the automatic loop still starts. Goal: Connect the defusion technique to the physical sensations, not just the thought.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different: while you notice the thought ("This bill ruins everything") popping up, what happens to your body right before it does? Is your chest tightening, your stomach dropping, your hands getting clammy? Can you pause there, without even trying to change the thought, and simply be with that physical sensation?

Patient: If I pause I can feel the chest tighten more, my breath gets shallow, my jaw locks and my hands go cold — it's like everything gets narrower and louder. Trying to just be with that feeling doesn't calm it; it almost feeds the movie: I can already see myself snapping on the call, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house — it's like the body sensations push me into that chain. I don't know how to stay with the tightness without the disaster following it—how do I stop getting pulled into that loop?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to stay with the physical sensations without getting pulled into the catastrophic narrative. Goal: Introduce a small act of defusion that doesn't require changing the thought, but rather working with the body's sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that the physical sensations (chest tightening, shallow breath, locked jaw, cold hands) are not thoughts, but rather what's happening in your body. What if, instead of trying to change the thought ("This bill ruins everything"), you simply asked yourself: "What's the sensation of my chest tightening right now?" or "What's happening to my body when I breathe in?"

Patient: When I try that, my chest feels like a heavy band squeezing, my breath gets tiny and fast, my jaw locks and my fingers go cold and tingly. Naming it for a second sometimes makes me feel a little less frantic, but almost immediately the disaster voice gets louder — noticing seems to hand it more ammo. I want that simple curiosity to work, but I keep getting hijacked: "I'll snap on the call, get reported, lose everything" plays on repeat and there's no room for just the body. I don't know how to stay with the tightness without the movie starting.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're seeing how noticing the physical sensations is actually making the catastrophic narrative more accessible. Goal: Shift the focus from what's happening (the chest tightening, etc.) to what's holding you back from staying with the sensations (the need to change the thought).

Therapist Answer:
What happens when you notice that the disaster voice gets louder, and you feel yourself getting pulled into the movie? What is it about that moment that feels so compelling, that makes you want to jump into the story instead of staying with the physical sensations?

Patient: Because that voice feels like it's giving me certainty — if I can name the disaster now, at least I'm not caught off guard later. It feels like armor against feeling powerless or humiliated, so even though it's awful it also strangely soothes me; any suggestion that it might not happen just sounds naive and unrealistic. Physically the threat response snowballs — my chest clamps down, thinking narrows, and then snapping at the caller feels inevitable. I'm pissed off and exhausted by how automatic it is and I don't know how to make myself stay out of that loop.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the underlying value driving the catastrophic narrative: the need for control and certainty. Goal: Introduce a willingness to work with the uncertainty, rather than trying to control the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the voice is not just about predicting the future, but also about what you're doing in the present moment. When you feel that urge to "snap on the call" because you're "not caught off guard," what's the value of that action to you? What would you be holding onto by acting on that impulse, even though it feels like it's just about avoiding the disaster?

Patient: Mostly it's about control and dignity — if I snap first, at least I'm the one doing the damage, not the one being humiliated later. It feels like a preemptive defense: I get to show I'm not a pushover, I get a blast of release, and I avoid the imagined scene of being blindsided and exposed. I know that sounds toxic and probably self‑sabotaging, but it still feels like the only realistic option; the idea that I could calmly handle it just doesn't feel true to me.

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've pinpointed the core value driving the behavior: dignity and control. Goal: Introduce a willingness to work with the tension between these values and the uncertainty of the situation.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical sensation of your chest clamping down when you think about not snapping – it's a tightness that feels protective, but also limiting. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you were to ask yourself: "What would happen to my dignity if I didn't snap first?" or "What would it mean to me if I let go of the need to control this moment?"

Patient: If I don't snap I feel like I'm handing over my dignity — they'll think I'm weak, people will push harder, a supervisor will notice me backing down and that'll be the start of getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. Letting go of control doesn't feel like bravery to me; it feels like opening the door to humiliation and everything falling apart. I'm trying to sit with that idea, but my chest is already clamping down and my head's racing — it all feels like it's already happening.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the paradox of letting go of control feeling like bravery, but actually increasing the fear of being vulnerable. Goal: Introduce a small act of willingness that doesn't require taking control, but rather simply acknowledging the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical sensation of your chest clamping down – what happens when you breathe into that tightness, without trying to change it? Can you simply observe the sensation of your chest tightening, without judgment, for just one breath?

Patient: I try to take a slow breath into the tightness, but it feels like the band squeezes harder, my breath gets tiny and fast, my jaw locks and my hands tingle — and the disaster voice just roars louder: I'm already picturing snapping on the caller, getting reported, losing the job, then everything else. I'm getting really overwhelmed and jumpy right now; can we slow down? I don't know how to keep just breathing without the whole chain kicking in.

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're getting overwhelmed by the physical sensations and the catastrophic narrative. Goal: Introduce a pause to create space before trying to breathe into the tightness.

Therapist Answer:
Take a moment to acknowledge the overwhelm – notice how your body is reacting to the tightness and the disaster voice. Can you simply say to yourself: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now" – just those five words? No need to try to breathe or change anything, just observe the statement as it is.

Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Saying it out loud doesn't stop the band in my chest — it's tighter, my breath's shallow, and the disaster voice is already louder, picturing me snapping on the caller, getting reported, losing the job, defaulting, losing the house. I don't know how to hold the breath without the movie taking over — can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're trying to hold the breath while the catastrophic narrative is still playing – that's creating more tension. Goal: Introduce a pause before trying to breathe into the tightness.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your body is already moving towards the "movie" – you're picturing the snap on the caller, getting reported, losing the job... Can you pause that thought for just one second? Before you do, notice what's happening in your body right now – the tight chest, the shallow breath... just acknowledge that sensation without trying to change it.

Patient: I try to pause, but my chest immediately tightens into this band, my breath gets tiny, my jaw locks and my fingers tingle — then the movie starts: I snap at the caller, someone reports me, I'm written up, fired, default on loans, lose the house. I'm feeling jumpy and kind of distracted right now; can we slow down and do something concrete I can actually do in the moment?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're getting jumpy and distracted by the catastrophic narrative. Goal: Introduce a concrete action that doesn't require changing the thought, but rather working with the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your hands are tingling – what's one small physical action you can do with your hands right now that doesn't involve trying to control the situation? Can you simply pick up your pen, not to write, but just to hold it?

Patient: Okay... I pick it up. It's cool and hard in my fingers, the tingling eases a bit and my hands feel a little steadier. But the band in my chest is still there and the disaster voice is already shouting — I'm picturing snapping at the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. Holding the pen helps a touch, like something to hang onto, but I can't see how that actually stops the movie; can we slow down and do another small thing?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Holding the pen helped a bit, but the catastrophic narrative is still driving the movie. Goal: Introduce another small action that works with the physical sensations, rather than trying to change the thought.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your hands are holding the pen – what's one small thing you can do with your feet right now that doesn't require moving? Can you simply lift your foot off the ground, just a little, without putting weight on it?

Patient: Okay — I lift my foot a little. It feels strangely heavy, my toes tingle, and that tiny movement steadies it a bit, but the band in my chest is still there and the disaster voice is already louder — I can see myself snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I don't have much energy for long stuff right now; can we try another small, very concrete thing I can do here?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using small actions to work with the physical sensations, but the catastrophic narrative is still driving the movie. Goal: Introduce a tiny, concrete action that requires zero energy and focuses on the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your toes are tingling – what's the smallest sensation you can notice right now, just in that one toe? Can you simply focus on the sensation of that one toe touching the floor?

Patient: Just the pad of my left big toe — a dull pressure, a tiny warmth where it meets the floor. It steadies me a little, but the band in my chest is still clamped and the disaster voice is already back — me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, losing the house — feels like it's already happening. I don't have much in me right now; can we try another very small, concrete grounding thing?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're focusing on the sensation of your toe touching the floor – that's a small victory. Goal: Introduce an even smaller grounding action that doesn't require thinking or energy.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your nostrils. Can you simply notice the sensation of that one breath as it leaves your body right now?

Patient: I notice it — a cool little whoosh at the tip of my nose as the breath leaves, just one small thing. But the band's still clamped and the disaster voice is already yelling: me snapping on the caller, getting reported, written up, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I don't have much left in me right now — can we slow down and do another tiny grounding thing I can actually do here?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the sensation of the breath leaving your body – that's a tiny anchor. Goal: Introduce another tiny grounding action that requires zero effort.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of the air on the tip of your tongue. Just notice it.

Patient: It's a cool, slightly wet tickle on the tip of my tongue — barely there. It helps for a breath, but the band's still clamped and the disaster movie's already back: me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I don't have much energy — can we do another tiny grounding thing?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the sensation of the air on your tongue – that's a tiny anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires even less effort, focusing on the physical sensation.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just that.

Patient: They're flat on the floor, a dull, even pressure that steadies me a little. But the band in my chest is still clamped and the disaster voice is already back — me snapping at the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house — I don't have much left; can we try another tiny grounding thing and go slower?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor – that's a solid anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires no effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "go slower" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go even slower. Take a deep breath, and notice the sensation of your feet being flat on the floor. No need to do anything with your feet, just be with that sensation for a moment.

Patient: I take a slow breath — my feet feel steady and flat, but the band in my chest is still tight and the disaster voice is already back, picturing me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, then losing the house. I don't have much energy right now; can we try another tiny grounding thing and go even slower?


--- Turn 20 ---

You're taking slow breaths and noticing your feet feeling steady – that's a good anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires no effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "go even slower" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go even slower. Before you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body for just a tiny second. No need to think about anything else, just be with that sensation.

Patient: I notice it — a brief cool pull at my nostrils as the air leaves, just for that tiny second. It calms me a hair, but the band in my chest is still tight and the disaster voice is already yelling — me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I'm kind of wiped; can we go even slower and do another very small grounding thing?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the brief cool pull at your nostrils – that's a tiny anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires no effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "go even slower" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go even slower. Before you breathe in, notice the sensation of your nostrils closing for just a tiny fraction of a second. No need to think about anything else, just be with that sensation.

Patient: There's a faint pinch as my nostrils close for that tiny fraction — it's almost nothing, but it steadies me a little. Still, the band in my chest won't loosen and the disaster voice is loud: me snapping on the caller, getting written up, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I don't have much energy right now; can we go even slower and try another very small grounding thing?

You're noticing the faint pinch as your nostrils close – that's a tiny anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires no effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "go even slower" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go even slower. Right before your nostrils close, notice the sensation of the air getting ready to leave your body. It's just before the pinch, before the cool pull. Can you notice that sensation just before it happens?

Patient: There's this barely-there gathering — a tiny lift in my chest and a faint pressure at the back of my throat just before the nostrils pinch. But the moment I notice it the band clamps down and the disaster voice is already blasting: me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I'm pretty wiped out — can we go even slower or try another very small grounding thing?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the tiny gathering just before the nostrils pinch – that's a tiny anchor. Goal: Introduce an action that requires no effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "go even slower" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go even slower. Right before the gathering happens, before you even notice it, can you just be with the sensation of your chest feeling the air move in? Not trying to notice anything, just existing with that sensation as it happens.

Patient: I try to just exist with that tiny inward lift in my chest, and for a half-second it’s almost neutral — but then the band clamps down harder and the disaster voice floods back: me snapping, getting reported, fired, losing the house. I'm shaky and fuzzy-headed right now; can we keep it painfully slow and do one more tiny thing I can actually stay with?


--- Turn 24 ---

You're trying to exist with the sensation of your chest feeling the air move in – that's a small step. Goal: Introduce an action that requires zero effort, focusing on the physical sensation, and use the "painfully slow" phrase to create space.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go painfully slow. Right now, notice the sensation of your feet being flat on the floor. No need to think about anything else, just be with the feeling of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: They're flat and heavy on the floor — a dull pressure that steadies me a hair. But the band in my chest is still clamped and the disaster voice's already back — me snapping on the caller, getting reported, fired, defaulting, losing the house. I'm running on fumes; can we go even slower and do one more tiny grounding thing?

Let's go even slower. Right now, notice the sensation of the floor beneath your feet. Not the pressure of your feet, not the weight of your body, just the sensation of the floor. Can you be with that sensation for just a tiny second, without moving or thinking about anything else?

Patient: It's solid and a little cool under my soles — that feel steadies me a hair. But the band in my chest is still clamped and the disaster voice is already louder: me snapping at the caller, getting reported, written up, fired, defaulting, losing the house — it all feels like it's already happening.
