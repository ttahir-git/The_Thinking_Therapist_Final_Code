Patient: Lately I'm stuck worrying about how I'll perform when I finally get a job — my brain immediately says I'll definitely bomb interviews, somehow get hired and then crash and burn in a few weeks, lose the job, and end up back broke and living with my parents. I know it sounds dramatic, but I get totally hooked on that chain of events and then procrastinate so I don't have to deal with it. I try to be upbeat, but every time I try to apply or prep, the fortune-teller in my head takes over and I freeze.

Therapist: That fortune-teller voice sounds really loud when you're trying to apply or prep for a job. When you say "I'll definitely bomb the interview," what's one specific thing you're imagining about the outcome that makes that voice so convincing – is it a specific job title, salary, or even just the fear of looking silly in front of others?

Patient: Usually I picture a mid-level marketing coordinator role — I freeze in the interview, say something awkward, they reluctantly hire me because they're desperate, I mishandle a campaign, the client leaves, I'm fired within a month, can't find another job, and end up crashing back at my parents' place. It feels totally convincing because I've had tiny slip-ups before and my brain blows them up into proof that one mistake equals total collapse. I know that sounds extreme, but honestly I can't make myself believe any other outcome — the fortune-teller voice treats everything else like wishful thinking.

Therapist: You're really attached to not having to deal with the discomfort of that worst-case scenario. What value would losing that "security" of a job really threaten for you – is it financial stability, independence, or something else?

Patient: It's mostly independence and my sense of worth — and money, obviously. If I lose a job it feels like proof I'm a failure: I picture moving back in with my parents, everyone judging me, my savings gone, my confidence crushed so I never try again and just spiral into debt and shame. That story feels way more real than any other outcome.

Therapist: When that "I'm a failure" story shows up, what would it take for you to notice it as just a thought, without judgment – like you're having a story, but you don't have to believe it? For a tiny moment, can you imagine yourself having a conversation with that voice, saying "I see you're trying to protect me from feeling like a failure, but what would it mean to take care of my worth right now, even if I'm not sure what's next?"

Patient: I’ve tried saying that to the voice, but it just yells the disaster script right back and drowns out anything softer I tell it. Saying I’ll take care of my worth feels like lying—I don’t even know what that would look like—so I get overwhelmed fast. Can we slow down? I keep getting stuck imagining the campaign tanking and being completely ruined.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back from the scenario. What's one small thing you could do in the interview, just for a moment, that wouldn't have to change the outcome – would it be taking a deep breath, smiling at the interviewer, or asking a question about the company?

Patient: I guess I could try taking one deep breath before answering and then ask a simple question about the team's priorities. But the fortune-teller immediately yells that the pause will make me look blank and they'll think I'm useless, and that one moment will snowball into the whole disaster I picture. Can we slow down? I'm already spiraling imagining that pause becoming proof I can't handle anything.

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking "the pause will make me look blank," you saw that pause as a tiny act of courage – a tiny step that says, "I'm willing to take a moment to think before speaking"? Would that be enough to make the pause feel different, even if it's still just a moment?

Patient: I want to believe that — I really do — but the fortune-teller just yells that the pause will read as blankness, they'll write me off as incompetent, and that tiny pause becomes the first domino in the whole disaster. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed picturing it all; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground – just the sensation of your feet touching the floor. That's a small, concrete thing that's not tied to the fortune-teller's story. Can you focus on that sensation for just a moment, without trying to change it or tie it to anything else?

Patient: Okay—I can feel my feet on the floor, like a steady weight through my heels and a slight coolness under my toes. But the fortune-teller is already yelling that the ground is slippery, that I'll trip getting into the interview and that one stumble will mean I can't handle anything, and my chest is tightening. I'm trying to stay with the feeling but I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your chest – it's tightening, right? What's the physical sensation of that tightness, like a knot or a heaviness? Is it in your chest, your shoulders, or somewhere else? Can you describe it without trying to change it or tie it to the fortune-teller's story?

Patient: It's like a heavy knot under my breastbone, a tight band that creeps up toward my throat and across my shoulders, and my breaths get shallow and quick with a flutter in my stomach. I'm trying to just name it, but the fortune-teller immediately screams that this is proof I'm failing and that thought makes the tightness worse. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: What would happen if you simply named the knot in your chest without trying to change it? Not "I'm failing" or "I need to breathe better," just "there's a knot under my breastbone"? Can you do that for just a tiny moment, without judgment?

Patient: Okay... there’s a knot under my breastbone, heavy and constricting, and my breaths get shallow. Saying that for a second makes it feel a tiny bit less scary, but then the fortune-teller yells that the knot is proof I'm already failing and the whole crash-and-burn story kicks back in. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't want to spiral, but those predictions take over fast.

Therapist: Let's hold onto that tiny moment of naming the knot for just one more breath. Before the story takes over, notice how your body feels when you breathe out – is it a bit more relaxed, or is it still tight? Can you just notice that sensation without trying to change it or tie it to the fortune-teller's story?

Patient: When I breathe out there’s a tiny loosening — like the knot eases a notch and my shoulders drop a little. But before I can hold that, the fortune-teller screams that it's fake, that the relief won't last and I'm still going to mess up, and my chest clamps back down. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with one breath a bit longer? I don't want to spiral, but that disaster voice grabs me so fast.

Therapist: Let's stay with that tiny loosening – notice how your shoulders feel when the knot eases a notch. Can you describe that sensation in one word? No judgments, just a word. What word comes to mind?

Patient: Constricted. It drags up this hot shame and frustration — the fortune-teller's already yelling that the little easing is fake and I'm still doomed, and I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: What happens when you say "constricted" to yourself – what physical sensation does it bring up, besides the shame and frustration? For just one tiny moment, can you notice what happens in your body when you say that word, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I say "constricted" my throat tightens, my jaw clenches, my pulse bangs in my neck, and my stomach curls into a hard knot — there's a hot flush behind my face too. That little naming sparks a spike of shame and frustration, and the fortune-teller immediately yells that this proves I'm doomed, which just makes everything clamp down harder. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with one breath a bit longer?

Therapist: Notice what just happened when you said "constricted" – your body reacted with tension, shame, and frustration. Can you simply observe those sensations, without trying to change them or push them away, for just one more breath? Just notice: "I feel tightness in my throat, my jaw clenches, my pulse is pounding..."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing this supposed to help? When I try, my throat tightens, my jaw clenches, my pulse bangs in my neck and my stomach curls into a hard knot. The fortune-teller yells that's proof I'm doomed and it just makes everything clamp down; I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: You're doing something when you say "constricted" – you're naming the sensation. What else are you doing when you name that sensation? Are you looking away from your body, or are you noticing something else in the room?

Patient: I think I mostly look away — my eyes drift to the window or my phone, like I'm trying to escape the feeling, and my attention flits to things in the room. Naming it does make me notice the tension, but it also brings this hot spike of shame and frustration and then the fortune-teller screams that's proof I'm already failing. I'm not sure I follow how noticing helps — can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed.

Therapist: When you said "I'm not sure I follow," what thought came up in your mind? What story did you start to tell yourself about not understanding how noticing helps?

Patient: The thought was basically, "I'm dumb, I don't get this, so nothing's going to help me" — and the fortune-teller immediately screams that if I can't even follow this, I'll totally blank in interviews, be written off as useless, get fired, and end up back with my parents. Saying that sparks this hot shame and frustration in my chest and makes my throat clamp, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: What's the smallest thing you could do right now to challenge the thought "I'm dumb" – not by changing the thought itself, but by noticing what's driving it? For example, what tiny thing could you observe about your body that's connected to this thought?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is just noticing one small physical cue — like my throat clenching or my fingers curling — and quietly naming it to myself, like "throat tight." I guess that could give a split second between the thought and the reaction so the fortune-teller doesn't instantly hijack everything. But I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps — it drags up this hot shame and frustration and the voice already yells that noticing won't change anything, so can we slow down?

Therapist: When you say "I'm dumb," what's the first thing you think about that thought – what's the story you're telling yourself about what it means to be "dumb"? For example, is it "I'm not smart enough," "I'll never be able to do this," or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? The story is basically "I'm not smart enough," which quickly turns into "I'll never get it, I'll freeze in interviews, they'll see I'm useless, I'll get fired, and end up back with my parents" — the fortune-teller treats anything else as wishful thinking. Saying that lights up hot shame in my chest and my throat clamps, and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if you took just one tiny step away from that story – not by changing the thought itself, but by noticing what's true right now in this moment? For example, what's one tiny thing you can see, hear, or feel that isn't part of the story "I'm dumb"?

Patient: I can see the light on the windowsill, hear a car go by outside, and feel the weight of my feet on the floor. Naming those things for a beat makes the panic ease a smidge, but then this hot shame spikes and the fortune-teller screams that none of it matters — I'll still freeze in the interview and everything will crash. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps; can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed.

Therapist: When you say "I'm still going to freeze," what's the first thought that comes up – what's the story you're telling yourself about what that feeling means? For example, is it "I'm a failure," "I'm not good enough," or something else?

Patient: The first thought is basically, "I'm a failure — not good enough." Then the fortune-teller yells the whole chain: I freeze in the interview, they see me as useless, I tank at the job, get fired, end up back with my parents and totally humiliated. Saying that even in my head drags up a hot shame and this exhausted, heavy feeling like I can't keep going — can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if you took just one tiny step away from that story – not by changing the thought itself, but by noticing what's true right now in this moment? For example, what's one tiny thing you can see, hear, or feel that contradicts the idea that you're a failure?

Patient: I can see the little plant on my windowsill and hear a car pass outside — that small stuff feels real, like it doesn't fit the "I'm a failure" story. But the fortune-teller immediately screams that's meaningless, that I'll still freeze, get fired, and end up back with my parents, which brings this hot shame and leaves me feeling heavy and wiped out — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you see the plant, what's the first thought that comes up? Is it "I must be failing as a person because I can't even take care of a plant," or something else? What if we challenge that thought by asking, "Is it possible that taking care of a plant is not a reflection of my worth as a person?"

Patient: Yeah — my first thought is exactly that: "I must be failing if I can't even keep a plant alive," and the fortune-teller immediately treats that as proof I'll fail at bigger things. When you ask if the plant says anything about my worth, my brain just yells that's denial and that tiny stuff doesn't matter — the collapse is still coming, and saying otherwise feels like lying. Saying that pulls up this hot shame and leaves me kind of wiped and fuzzy... can we slow down?

Therapist: When you say "that's denial," what's the thought that comes up next? Is it "I'm not good enough," "I'll never be able to do anything right," or something else? What if we gently ask, "What would happen if, for just one tiny moment, you let go of the idea that the plant's survival is a reflection of your worth?"

Patient: I tell myself, "I'm lying to myself" or "I'll be exposed as not good enough" — basically the voice says I'm fooling myself and that always feels true. If I try to let go for a second, the fortune-teller screams it's a trap — that tiny gap will make them see I'm useless and the whole crash-and-burn starts, so I can't make myself believe it's safe. Saying that drags up this hot shame and tightness, like that old failure pressing down, and I'm already feeling wiped and fuzzy — can we slow down?

Therapist: What would happen if, instead of calling the thought "lying," you said it's just a thought? What if you looked at it as "this is just a story my mind is telling me" – without judgment? What if you noticed the physical sensation of the tightness and the hot shame, and simply observed it, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try, but when I tell myself "that's just a thought" it feels hollow — my throat tightens, there's that hot shame burning behind my face, and the fortune-teller immediately yells that calling it "just a thought" is denial and proof I'm hiding the truth before the crash. I don't know if I'm doing it right; it just makes me more convinced the collapse is around the corner. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed.

Therapist: What's the tiny spark of hope that's driving you to try to call that thought "just a thought"? Is it "maybe if I can just label it, I can avoid the pain"? What if we gently ask, "What would happen if, for just one tiny moment, you let go of the need to control the thought with a label?"

Patient: Maybe the tiny spark is that calling it "just a thought" could buy me a tiny sliver of distance — like, maybe labeling it gives me a second so the panic doesn't hit full force. But when I try to let go of control the fortune-teller screams it's a trap, I'm exposed, everything collapses, and that hot shame and tightness slam back in, so I'm not sure I follow how letting go helps. Can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed and confused about this.

Therapist: When you say "labeling it gives me a second," what's the thought that comes up next? Is it "I can just delay the pain for a little longer"? What if we gently ask, "What would happen if, instead of using labeling as a way to delay the pain, you simply noticed the sensation of the tightness and the hot shame – without trying to change it?"

Patient: I try that — just notice the tightness and the hot shame — and for a second it softens, like a tiny crack in the panic. But then the fortune-teller screams it's fake, the shame spikes hotter, and I feel like I'm right back in that old, humiliating place and can't breathe. I don't really get how simply noticing helps; can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and fuzzy.

Therapist: When you notice the panic return, what's the first physical sensation that shows up? Is it the tightness in your chest, the racing of your heart, or the burning in your throat? What if we simply labeled that sensation without judgment, without trying to change it? For example, you could say "my chest is tight" or "I feel like I'm having trouble breathing."

Patient: My chest tightens first — like a band squeezing under my breastbone — then my throat starts to burn and my heart kicks up. If I try to name it ("my chest is tight") it gives a tiny pause, but the fortune-teller immediately screams that's proof I'm doomed and the shame spikes, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?
