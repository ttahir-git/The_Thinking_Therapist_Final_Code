Patient: Lately I've been getting really shut down by social anxiety—going to even small hangouts makes me jittery and I end up cancelling or staying home, so I mostly keep to myself. It connects with my OCD and the unstable work situation—I'm an artist and the uncertainty just amplifies everything. I've tried therapy-ish things before and I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried that, it doesn't work. How is talking about it supposed to change any of this?

Therapist: When you say the uncertainty makes you "shut down" and cancel plans, what's one thing you feel you're losing control of when you're trying to do something creative – like an art piece or even just making a cup of coffee?

Patient: Mostly it feels like I'm losing control of the outcome and my own head—these intrusive doubts start shouting that whatever I do will be wrong or contaminated. So when I try to make a piece or even a coffee I get tangled in rituals, second-guessing, or perfectionism and then just freeze. I've been told to "focus on the process" before—how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: Those "intrusive doubts" shouting "you'll be wrong" sound like a persistent critic – what's one small thing you've created recently that didn't get torn apart by those doubts, but instead felt like "it's mine"?

Patient: A couple weeks ago I did a small watercolor of a potted succulent—nothing fancy, just a quick half-hour piece. For once I didn't obsess over every leaf; I let the washes do their thing and it actually felt like mine, imperfect but done. But even that calm didn't last long before the doubts barged back in—how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: That feeling of letting go and creating something "mine" despite imperfection – what would it mean to you to create something new today that didn't need perfection, just "shows up"?

Patient: I guess it would mean I get a little bit of control back — that I can tolerate not knowing the exact outcome and still finish something, which would feel like a small victory against the rituals. But I'm skeptical: I've had those small wins before and the doubts just come back, so how is that supposed to help me stop cancelling plans or feeling panicked around people?

Therapist: That small victory of creating without perfection – what would it mean to you to hold onto that feeling when you're with others, like when you're in a conversation or meeting someone new?

Patient: It would mean I could be a bit more present and not get stuck rehearsing or correcting everything — maybe actually say something without running it through a thousand checks. But I'm skeptical: that calm I get when painting disappears the moment I'm around people, so I'm not sure how holding onto it would stop the panic or the cancelling. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: If your panic and cancelling were to completely eliminate the possibility of being present and connecting with others, what would be one thing you value about those connections – like laughter, shared interest, or simply being seen?

Patient: Mostly I miss being seen — not judged or fixed, just noticed and understood for who I am. But I also worry that being seen means being exposed, and then they’ll find the weird, anxious parts and recoil. How is thinking about "being seen" supposed to help when my chest tightens and I want to run?

Therapist: When your chest tightens and you feel the urge to run, notice the physical sensation in your body – where it's holding space. Can you make space for that feeling of being seen, even if it feels like it's tied to being exposed?

Patient: It feels like a tight band across my chest and my breath gets shallow—my hands go cold and my stomach knots when I notice it. I can try to name it and breathe into it, and sometimes that softens it for a moment, but then the urge to run usually wins. How is making space for it supposed to stop me from cancelling plans or freezing when someone looks at me?

Therapist: When you notice the tight band across your chest, what would happen if you simply said to it, "I'm here, I'm feeling this tightness," without trying to breathe it away or change it?

Patient: Maybe it would help a bit — like the tightness becomes something I notice instead of a command to run, so it can loosen for a moment. But usually that moment is short; my brain immediately starts criticizing me for not doing it perfectly or for still feeling scared. I don't know, it feels like a tiny trick, not a solution—how is that supposed to stop me from bailing when the panic spikes?

Therapist: When you notice the tight band across your chest and your critical voice starts up, what would happen if you simply said to it, "That's the tightness – it's here now," without trying to change it or justify it – just acknowledged it, like "I see the thought 'you're not doing it right'"?

Patient: Maybe it would help a little — like the tightness stops feeling like an alarm and more like a thing I can notice. But almost immediately the critic says I'm doing it wrong or not doing it hard enough, and that voice usually wins and I bail. I've tried that labeling stuff before, so honestly — how is noticing it supposed to stop the panic from taking over when I'm actually with people?

Therapist: When you're with someone and the panic spikes, what would it mean to you to stay with them – not just notice the tightness, but actually show up and engage with them – in this moment, right now?

Patient: Maybe it would mean actually being seen and not having to fix myself all the time — but right now I'm drained, my chest's tight, and my head's foggy so staying feels like too much. I could try to focus on one tiny thing to stay present, but honestly, how is staying with that feeling supposed to stop me from panicking and bailing?

Therapist: Even though staying feels like too much right now, what would it mean to you to stay with the feeling of your chest tightening and your head fogging – just to hold onto that feeling for 5 seconds, so you don't have to push through it and lose connection with the person in front of you?

Patient: I can... try to hold it for five seconds. Maybe focus on the tight band and count, keep my breathing shallow but steady. But it still feels huge and pointless—how is that supposed to help me not run when the panic spikes?

Therapist: As you hold the tight band for 5 seconds, what would it mean to you to just be willing to stay with it – not to try to change it, not to push through it, but simply to acknowledge that this feeling is here, and it's enough to hold onto that moment with the person in front of you?

Patient: I can... try to stay with it for five seconds — count the seconds, notice the band, let it be there. It feels like such a small, exhausting demand, and I can't help thinking: how is holding this for five seconds supposed to stop me from bolting when it really spikes?

Therapist: What would it mean to you to just hold onto that 5 seconds, not to think about stopping the panic, but to hold onto the pause itself – not for the purpose of stopping the panic, but simply because it's what's happening in this moment, right now?

Patient: Maybe it would mean I can tolerate being uncomfortable for a moment without immediately running — a tiny proof I can handle something. I can try to hold five seconds, but even thinking about it wears me out, and I don't see how pausing that short will stop me from bolting when it really spikes. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it mean to you to hold onto the 5 seconds not because it's a tool to stop the panic, but because it's a way to value the connection with the person in front of you – to see them, be with them, and hold onto that value, even when the panic spikes?

Patient: Maybe it would mean a chance at being noticed instead of erased — a tiny bridge to actually connecting. I can try to hold those five seconds, even if it feels exhausting and pointless, but I'm doubtful it’ll do much when the panic really spikes. I don't know, it just feels fragile — how is that supposed to make the full-on urge to bolt stop?

Therapist: When you're about to bolt and the panic spikes, what would it mean to you to actually notice the panic – not to try to change it, but to notice that it's here, right now, and it's not just "I'm going to run away" – but "I'm feeling this intense urge to leave, and that's actually what I'm doing – I'm leaving this moment, this connection, and this person"?

Patient: Maybe noticing it would mean I actually see that I'm leaving on purpose, which could give me a sliver of choice or at least less shame afterward. But when it spikes I just feel boxed in and drained, and naming it usually doesn't stop the impulse—I still go. How is simply noticing supposed to make me stop running?

Therapist: Notice that you've been trying to stop the impulse by naming it – but you're still running. What if, instead of trying to stop the impulse, you just noticed what you do when the impulse comes – what's the smallest physical thing you do, the smallest action you take, when you decide to run away from this moment?

Patient: Usually it’s tiny — my shoulders tense, my breath gets shallow, I shift my weight back and either put my hands in my pockets or reach for my phone and start scanning for an exit. Sometimes I speed up my speech or force a laugh, but mostly it’s that little step-back move. How is noticing that supposed to help me not just walk out?

Therapist: When you notice your shoulders tense, your breath gets shallow, and you shift your weight back, what would it mean to you to say to yourself, "This is what I'm doing when I decide to leave" – not as a warning to change, but as a fact about what's happening right now?

Patient: Maybe it would mean I can actually see the pattern—like I'm not just flaky, I'm doing a tiny step-back that leads to walking out. It might make me feel less ashamed afterward, but I don't see how saying that aloud would stop my throat from closing and me bolting—how is that supposed to help right then?

Therapist: Right now, as you're about to bolt, what's the smallest thing you could do to make space for a different choice – not to stop the impulse, but to notice that you're already doing something when you decide to run away, and that's the only choice you have right now?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is to put a hand flat on the table or my thigh, feel the contact, and take one slow breath — or nudge my weight slightly forward instead of stepping back. It’s small and kind of dumb-feeling, but I guess it could give a moment of choice. Still — how is that supposed to stop me when the panic really hits?

Therapist: What would it mean to you to take that one slow breath, or to put your hand flat on the table, not because you're trying to calm down, but because you're actually noticing that your body is already doing something when you decide to run away – that's the pause, and that's what you have right now?

Patient: I can... try to put my hand on the table and take one slow breath—maybe it would remind me there's a choice, even if tiny. It feels kind of ridiculous and exhausting, like a band-aid on a bigger thing, so I'm not convinced it'll stop the panic when it really spikes. How is that tiny pause supposed to make the urge to bolt less real?

Therapist: When you put your hand on the table and take that slow breath, what would it mean to you if you didn't try to use that moment to "fix" the panic – if you just noticed that it's happening, and that's the only thing you're doing right now?

Patient: Maybe it would mean I'm allowed to be messy for a second — that I don't have to jump in and fix everything right away. I can try to just notice the panic without doing anything to change it, but it still feels fragile and pointless, like it won't stop me from bolting when it gets worse. How is just noticing supposed to make the urge any less real?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if you just noticed the panic, without trying to "fix" it, without trying to stop it, without trying to change it – just noticed it, in this moment, with your hand on the table, taking one slow breath?

Patient: Maybe it would mean I don't have to fix or disappear the panic to be okay — that it's just something happening to me, not the whole thing. That little pause could be proof I can hang on for a moment, but it still feels flimsy, and I keep wondering how that actually makes the urge to run any less real when it hits.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if you simply said to yourself, "This is what's happening right now" – not as a warning to stop it, not as a reason to try to fix it, but simply as a fact – no judgment, no trying to change it, just noticing it is what's happening?

Patient: Maybe it would let me step back a bit — see the panic as an event happening, not as me being broken. Saying "this is what's happening" might dull the shame, but it still feels like a fragile trick when the urge to run spikes. I can try it, but honestly — how is that supposed to stop me from bolting?

Therapist: When you say "this is what's happening" to yourself, what if you didn't use that sentence to try to stop the urge to run – what if you simply noticed that the sentence "I have to get out of here" is what's happening right now, without using it as a reason to try to stop it?

Patient: Maybe if I just noticed the "I have to get out" thought as a thing happening, it could make it feel less like a command and more like background noise — maybe a tiny gap appears. But I'm wiped and skeptical; I've labeled thoughts before and it still drags me out, so honestly — how is noticing it supposed to actually stop me from leaving?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to use the gap to "change" the thought, you simply noticed that the thought is happening right now – not as a command, not as a warning, not as a reason to leave, but simply as a thing that's happening – right now, with your hand on the table, taking one slow breath?

Patient: Okay... I can try that — hand on the table, one slow breath, and just notice the "I have to get out" thought as a thing happening. It loosens the urgency for a second, but it still feels fragile and like a trick; how is noticing that supposed to actually keep me from leaving when it really spikes?

Therapist: When you notice the thought as a thing happening, what if you didn't try to "make space" for it or "notice it" as a reason to stay – what if you simply noticed that the thought is happening, and the thought itself is what's driving the urge to leave?

Patient: If the thought is what drives the urge, maybe seeing it as just a thought could take away some of its power — like spotting the puppeteer instead of obeying the string. I can try that small move, put my hand down and name it, but honestly I'm wiped and when it really spikes the noticing feels useless. How is that supposed to actually stop me from walking out in the moment?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the thought as the puppeteer, you didn't try to "pull back" the string or "stop" the thought – what if you simply noticed that the thought is happening, and the thought itself is what's driving the urge to walk out?

Patient: Maybe that could help a little — seeing the thought as the puppeteer and not pulling the string might strip some of its force. But honestly my head's fogged and it still feels like a fragile trick; when it really spikes I almost always bolt, so how is that supposed to actually stop me in the moment?
