Patient: Uh, so... lately I've been avoiding get-togethers with friends because social situations make me really anxious. I lost someone close not long ago, and I guess that made it worse — small talk just feels impossible. I don't know, it's hard to talk about, but it’s been on my mind a lot.

Therapist: That anxiety when thinking about small talk must be really tough to navigate. When you say it's hard to talk about what happened, what's one thing that's made it even harder for you to reach out to friends since losing that person?

Patient: I guess one thing is I'm afraid they'll ask about what happened and I won't be able to say it without falling apart. I don't want to be the person who brings the mood down or seems fragile. I don't know — it just feels safer to stay away.

Therapist: That fear of vulnerability when friends ask about what happened is really understandable, but it sounds like avoiding them altogether feels like a safety measure that's also keeping you from connecting with people who care about you. What would it be like to have a small, low-stakes conversation with a friend, even if it felt a little awkward, and just say something like "I'm still really struggling with [loss] right now, but I'm trying to focus on [something else]"?

Patient: I guess that could feel less isolating than nothing, but I don't know — saying it out loud feels like opening a wound and they might ask things I can't handle. Maybe I could try something vague like, "I'm having a rough time, but I'd love to hear about you," or steer the visit toward doing something low-key together instead.

Therapist: That idea of shifting the focus to what you'd like to hear from your friend sounds really brave – it's about creating space for connection, not about forcing vulnerability. When you say you value hearing about their lives, what's at the heart of that for you?

Patient: I guess it reminds me I'm not the only one dealing with stuff — like there's still normal life happening. I don't know, it feels grounding to hear about small, ordinary things instead of replaying everything in my head.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful shift from replaying your own struggles to finding comfort in others' everyday stories – it's about noticing what brings you connection and peace in the present moment. What would happen if, instead of trying to avoid social situations, you showed up with a willingness to listen to your friend's story and just be there, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I guess if I just listened, it might take some pressure off me — like I wouldn't have to perform or explain myself. I don't know, though, the silence could make me panic or they'll turn the conversation back to me and I won't know what to say. Maybe doing something quiet together, like a walk or a coffee, would make it easier to be present without the spotlight.

Therapist: That idea of doing something quiet together sounds really appealing – it's about choosing to be present with someone without needing to "fix" anything or be the center of attention. When you say you value being with friends in a low-key way, what's at the heart of that for you?

Patient: I guess it's that normal, everyday stuff makes me feel less unmoored — like I'm not stuck in that one terrible loop all the time. I don't know, hearing about someone else's routine or silly little problems grounds me and feels... safer than talking about the big stuff. It also takes the pressure off me to be "okay" or perform, which is tiring.

Therapist: That makes sense – you're not trying to be "okay" or perform; you're just seeking connection in a way that feels authentic to you. When you say being grounded by small moments with friends feels safer than confronting the big stuff, what's the underlying value that's worth fighting for – is it connection, peace, self-worth, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's mostly connection and a bit of normalcy — some proof that life isn't only that one loss. I want peace and to feel like I still belong, not defined by grief. I don't know, it's hard to talk about more than that right now.

Therapist: That's a beautiful way to hold onto hope – it's not about talking about the loss right now, but about finding small moments to connect with life and each other. What's one small thing you could do this week to show up for a friend or connection in a way that feels authentic to you, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: I guess I could text one friend and suggest something short and low-key — like a 30‑minute walk or coffee. Saying something like, "I could use a little company for a short walk" feels doable and doesn't force me to explain myself. I don't know, I might still feel like cancelling, but if I commit to a very specific, short time it could be easier.

Therapist: That's a great place to start – suggesting a short, low-key outing that feels manageable and doesn't require grand gestures. By committing to a specific time (30 minutes) and being clear about what you're asking for (company, not conversation), you're creating space for connection without putting pressure on yourself. What would happen if you showed up exactly as you said – 30 minutes, no explanation needed – and just enjoyed the company of that friend?

Patient: I guess if I actually showed up for just 30 minutes, it might take some of the pressure off and make me feel less alone for a little while. I don't know, I'd still worry they'd ask about the loss and I'd fall apart, so I'd probably plan a clear exit line like, "I only have half an hour," or bring something to do together so it's less about talking. What if I do start to panic anyway — how am I supposed to get through it without bailing?

Therapist: That's a great question about how to handle the panic – instead of "how am I supposed to get through it," what if you focus on what you can do with the panic, right in the moment? For example, what if you simply acknowledge the feeling ("I'm feeling anxious") and then say, "That's okay, I'm here with my friend, and we're doing a 30-minute walk"? By focusing on the present and what you can control (your presence with your friend), you might find that the panic isn't as overwhelming.

Patient: I guess I could try saying something like, "I'm feeling anxious," but I don't know — saying it out loud feels vulnerable and like they'll stare at me. Maybe I could practice the line a few times, plan a clear exit, and bring something to do or use a breathing trick so it doesn't turn into a meltdown.

Therapist: That's a great plan to practice the line, have a clear exit, and bring a distraction to manage the anxiety. By focusing on the small step of saying "I'm feeling anxious," you're not avoiding the feeling, but acknowledging it as a normal part of being present with others. Remember, it's not about "fixing" the anxiety, but showing up with curiosity and kindness towards yourself – what's one thing you can say to yourself right after you say "I'm feeling anxious" that might help you move forward?

Patient: I guess I could tell myself, "This will pass — I can handle thirty minutes," and then focus on my breathing or a quick grounding trick like noticing my feet on the ground. I don't know, saying that out loud feels weird, but maybe rehearsing it a few times would make it less scary.

Therapist: That's a powerful self-statement – "This will pass" acknowledges that the anxiety is temporary, and "I can handle thirty minutes" asserts your ability to cope. By linking it to a grounding trick like noticing your feet, you're creating a tangible anchor to bring you back to the present moment. Rehearsing it a few times might indeed make it feel less scary, and when you say it out loud, it can become a gentle reminder to yourself that you've got this.

Patient: I guess I can try rehearsing it a few times — maybe quietly before I go or while I'm out for a short walk. I don't know, it feels awkward and fake to practice emotions, and I'm worried it'll still hit me and I'll want to leave. Could you show me one or two simple grounding tricks I can actually use in the moment? I don't want to get overwhelmed.

Therapist: Here's one simple trick: notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just look down and notice the weight of your body distributed on the soles of your feet. No thinking, no effort – just observation. Another one: notice the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just listen to the rhythm of your breath without trying to change it. These tricks are not about managing emotions, but about bringing your attention to the present moment – what happens when you try one of these while saying "This will pass — I can handle thirty minutes" to yourself?

Patient: I tried it just now. I guess noticing my feet did help a bit — maybe made things 10–20% less tight — but my mind kept jumping around and I couldn't hold the sentence in my head for more than a few seconds. Saying it out loud feels too exposed, so I tried it silently and it still felt weird and almost fake. I don't know, I'm starting to feel kind of panic-y and distracted; can you give me a really low-key trick I can use that won't make me look odd to my friend?

Therapist: Here's one: look at the corner of your friend's eye. Just glance up and notice the corner of their eye – it's a tiny detail, but it's something you can focus on without thinking. Don't try to change it or analyze it, just notice it. This is a super-low-key trick that won't make you feel exposed or distracted from your conversation – what happens when you glance up at the corner of your friend's eye while saying "This will pass — I can handle thirty minutes" to yourself?

Patient: I tried it a couple times and... I guess it helped a little — like a tiny nibble of relief — but my head's still jittery and I can't keep the sentence in my mind. I don't know, staring anywhere feels awkward and I'm worried I'll look strange if I keep doing tricks. Can you give me one more really discreet thing I can do — like pressing my thumb to my palm or something — that won't make me feel exposed?

Therapist: Here's one: press the heel of your hand onto your leg, just lightly. That's it – just the heel of your hand, with your fingers relaxed. It's a tiny physical anchor that won't make you feel exposed, and it's easy to do without thinking about it. Just do it as you're saying the sentence to yourself: "This will pass — I can handle thirty minutes" – and as you press your hand down, see if that tiny action helps calm your jittery head.

Patient: I tried it — I guess it helped a little, like a tiny loosening, but my head's still jittery and I can't keep the sentence in my mind. I don't know, pressing my hand felt less weird than staring at someone's eye, but I'm still worried I'll look strange. Can you give me another really discreet thing I can do with my hands in my lap or under the table? I'm starting to feel kind of panicky and unfocused.

Therapist: Here's one: subtly rub your thumb and index finger together – just a gentle, gentle rubbing motion, without looking up or focusing on anything. It's a tiny, calming motion that's easy to do under the table. Just do it as you're saying the sentence to yourself: "This will pass — I can handle thirty minutes" – and see if that tiny movement helps calm your jittery head and focus your attention.

Patient: I tried it — I guess it helped a tiny bit, like a small untightening, but my head's still jittery and the sentence won't stick. I don't know, it still feels a bit stupid and I'm worried I'll just bail when it gets hard. As someone who likes routines, planning feels helpful, but this feels unpredictable — could we talk about a concrete plan or backup I can use if I start to panic so I don't cancel?

Therapist: Let's talk about what you'll do if you start to feel panicked again. Here's a simple backup plan: whenever you feel your head getting jittery, take 2-3 deep breaths and say to yourself, "Okay, I've got this. I'm here with my friend for thirty minutes." That's it – just those three words. Then, gently bring your attention back to your feet on the ground (remember that tiny trick?) or the sensation of your hand rubbing together. If that doesn't work, you can always take a quick sip of water or shift your weight slightly. The goal is to create a tiny anchor to help you stay present and connected to your commitment, even when you feel anxious.

Patient: I... okay. I guess that sounds small enough to try, but I'm already kind of wiped and worried it won't hold up. Could you give me one very short, polite exit line I can use if I need to leave — something like, "I just need to step out for a bit" that doesn't invite questions — and a one‑line phone prompt I can set to remind me to do the breaths? I don't know, having it written feels safer.

Therapist: Here's a one-line exit line: "I'm so sorry, I think I need to take a quick break" – it's polite, brief, and doesn't invite questions. As for the phone prompt, try setting an alarm on your phone to remind you to take 2-3 deep breaths whenever you feel anxious (e.g., "Breathe in, 30 seconds"). Having it written down might indeed feel safer, and it can serve as a tangible reminder to stay present and connected to your commitment.

Patient: Okay... I guess that could work. Could we tweak the exit line to something less apologetic — like "Excuse me, I need a minute" or "I need to step out for a moment" — which do you think is less likely to invite questions? And for the phone prompt, maybe something super short like "Breathe — 3 deep breaths" or just "Breathe"? I don't know, I'm already kind of wiped but having the words written down feels a bit safer.

Therapist: For the exit line, I think "Excuse me, I need a minute" is a great choice – it's direct, polite, and leaves no room for assumption. "I need to step out for a moment" is also a good option, but "Excuse me" adds a bit more courtesy. Both of these lines are unlikely to invite questions and can help you quickly exit the situation.

As for the phone prompt, I love the brevity of "Breathe — 3 deep breaths" – it's clear, concise, and actionable. "Breathe" alone is also a great choice, as it's simple and unambiguous. Having the words written down might indeed feel safer, and it can help you stay focused on your intention to take a few deep breaths.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll use "Excuse me, I need a minute" and set the alarm to "Breathe — 3 deep breaths." I don't know, I'm already pretty wiped and worried it won't help — could you give me one simple inhale/exhale count to follow so I don't have to think about it? I don't want to practice anything complicated right now.

Therapist: Try this: inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and exhale for a count of 4. That's it – no thinking, no effort, just a simple, steady rhythm. When the alarm goes off, try to follow this pattern with 3 deep breaths, and see if it helps calm your nervous system.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try the 4‑4‑4 and set the alarm for three breaths. I'm already pretty wiped and my head's jittery — I don't know, if that doesn't help can we quickly go over one really simple backup so I don't just bail?

Therapist: If the 4-4-4 doesn't work, try this: take one deep breath in, and when you're done, say to yourself, "I've got this." That's it – just one breath, and one simple affirmation. It's a tiny anchor that can help you stay present and focused, even when everything else feels overwhelming.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try the one-breath and say "I've got this." If that doesn't work, can you give me one really tiny fallback—like a single line to tell myself or one quick physical thing to do so I don't just run? I don't know, I'm already kind of wiped and worried it won't hold up.

Therapist: If all else fails, try this: take a tiny step forward with one foot. Just move one foot forward, and then stop. That's it – no thinking, no effort, just a tiny physical anchor to help you stay present. It's so small, you can do it even if you're feeling completely overwhelmed.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try the tiny step. My chest's racing and my head's all over — I don't know, can you give me one very short, non‑cheesy word or phrase to say to myself when I do it? Something like "stay" or "here"?

Therapist: Try this: "Now". Just say "Now" to yourself as you take the tiny step forward. It's a simple, present-tense word that can help you anchor yourself in the moment, even when everything else feels chaotic.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try saying "Now" when I take that tiny step. I'm pretty wiped and my chest's still racing, so I don't know if it'll stick — if it doesn't, what's one very small thing I should do next so I don't just leave?

Therapist: If saying "Now" doesn't work, try this: look down at your feet. Just gaze at the ground for a second, and then look back up. It's a tiny, non-actionable step that can help you pause and take a brief breath before deciding what to do next.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try looking at my feet if "Now" doesn't do it. I don't know, my chest's still racing and I'm wiped—could you quickly restate, in order, the simplest backups I should try so I don't have to think about it?

Therapist: Here are the simplest backups in order:

1. Take a few deep breaths (4-4-4)
2. Say "I've got this" after one deep breath
3. Take a tiny step forward with one foot and say "Now"
4. Look down at your feet if the above doesn't work

Try each one in order, and see what works for you.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try those in order, but I'm already wiped and I don't know if I'll remember them when I'm panicking. Could you write one super-short text I can copy-paste to invite a friend for a 30‑minute walk that doesn't pressure them or force me to explain? I don't know, reaching out feels exposing, but having exact words might help.

Therapist: Here's a super-short text you can copy-paste:

"Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now and I need a break. Would you be free for a 30-minute walk sometime soon?"

This text is brief, non-pressuring, and doesn't require you to explain anything. It simply invites a friend to join you for a short walk, which can be a safe and calming escape from your anxiety.

Patient: I guess that text is okay, but saying I'm "feeling really overwhelmed" feels too exposing. Could you give me a vaguer one I can copy—like, "Hey, want to go for a quick 30‑minute walk this week? Could use some company"—I don't know, that feels less heavy.
