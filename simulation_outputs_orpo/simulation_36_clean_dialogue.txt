Patient: Hi, I'm a senior data scientist and lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and a lack of motivation after a difficult breakup. It's made social situations and my relationships harder, and I don't know how to move forward. I guess I just feel stuck and it's hard to even talk about it.

Therapist: When you say "I feel stuck," what's one thing you used to do before the breakup that you wish you could do again, even if just for a minute, to feel connected to yourself?

Patient: I used to go to a quiet café on Saturdays and mess around with a small personal coding project—just making little visualizations or tools for fun. I don't know, I guess that made me feel like myself for a bit. I haven't had the energy to do that since the breakup.

Therapist: That project felt like a small spark of joy. When you say you haven't had the energy, what's one tiny, low-risk way you might start making room for that spark again, even if it's just for 5 minutes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could set a 5‑minute timer on a Saturday and just open the notebook, run one cell or tweak a tiny chart—no pressure to finish anything. Maybe do it with a coffee like I used to, just to see if that small spark comes back.

Therapist: That sounds like a gentle, curious approach. Before you start, notice what happens when you think "I just want to see if the spark comes back." What's the thought that usually comes with that phrase, and what would happen if you let that thought pass without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — the thought that usually pops up is "this won't work, you'll just feel worse or waste your time." If I let that pass, I guess the tightness might ease and I could actually sit with the notebook for those five minutes without immediately judging myself.

Therapist: That willingness to sit with the notebook without judging yourself feels like it's connected to wanting to make room for that spark again. What would you value most about making that tiny spark come back, and what small action from that value would feel like a tiny step forward?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what I'd value most is feeling like myself again, like I can do small things that are just for me and not tied to the breakup. A tiny step would be that 5‑minute thing: make the coffee, open the notebook, run one cell, and not force anything — maybe do that once this Saturday.

Therapist: As you imagine opening the notebook, notice what it looks like, feels like, and smells like. What's the sensation of holding the notebook, flipping through the pages, and running that single cell?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the laptop screen looks familiar and a little warm, the cursor blinking like it's waiting. There's the smell of coffee, my fingers feel cool on the keys, and my chest tightens a bit when I hover over "run"—then a small, weird relief if it finishes without errors. It's awkward to say out loud, I guess, but that's what I notice.

Therapist: When you notice that "running" makes your chest tighten, what if that tension was a tiny signal that you're willing to work with the discomfort, not push it away? What would happen if, instead of avoiding the "run" button, you simply let the cursor keep blinking while you breathe into that tightness for just a second before choosing what to do?

Patient: I don't know... If I actually breathed into it, maybe the tightness would ease a little instead of spiking. I guess that might make it easier to press run, but it feels really awkward to just sit with it. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to do that without feeling silly.

Therapist: Let's pause right here, just for 10 seconds, without any action. Notice the sensation of your fingers on the keys, the warmth of the laptop, and the feeling of the air around you. When your mind starts to wander or you feel the urge to "do something," gently acknowledge it and bring your attention back to that pause. No need to change anything, just observe the pause itself.

Patient: I don't know... I tried to do the ten seconds. My fingers felt a little less tight on the keys, the coffee smell was there, and my breath was shallow at first but then slowed a bit. My mind kept darting—wanting to check messages or tell myself it's useless—which made me want to move. I guess it felt a tiny bit calmer but also really awkward; can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Let's focus on the pause itself, just for a beat. When you notice your mind wanting to "do something" (check messages, tell yourself it's useless), what would happen if you simply let that thought pass without judgment or action? You've already noticed your breath slowing; what's the sensation of holding that pause, just for one more breath?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I let the thought pass it doesn't grab me as hard—my breath felt a bit slower and my chest a little less tight, like the urge to do something softened. It still feels fragile and awkward, though, like I could snap back into checking my phone at any second. Can we keep doing this slowly? I'm not sure how long I can hold it without getting restless.

Therapist: Let's anchor this pause to a tiny, concrete sensation. When you feel your chest relaxing slightly (the softening), notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor, without trying to change anything. Can you hold that sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to hold it for one breath. My feet feel cool on the floor and a little heavier, and that actually helps the chest loosen a tiny bit—but I'm already feeling restless and wanting to check my messages. Can we keep doing this slowly?

Therapist: Let's slow down the movement urge. When you feel the restlessness (wanting to check messages), what would happen if you simply acknowledged it, without acting on it? You've already noticed your chest loosening slightly; what's the sensation of holding that looseness for just one more second, without trying to "fix" it or move?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel that small looseness—a softer chest, a slightly longer breath, my feet a bit more grounded. It's fragile and my brain's already yelling at me to check my phone, which makes me feel restless and kind of embarrassed. Can we keep going slowly? I'm not sure how long I can hold it without fidgeting.

Therapist: Notice how the mental voice (yelling at you to check your phone) is separate from your physical sensations (soft chest, grounded feet). When you feel that voice rising, what if you simply labeled it as "thinking" instead of acting on it? Would that tiny shift make it easier to hold the pause?

Patient: I don't know... I guess maybe labeling it as "thinking" would help—like it puts a little distance between me and that urge, so I might not grab my phone. It still feels loud and kind of embarrassing, though; can we stay with this pause a bit longer? I'm not sure how long I can, but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's stay with the pause for just one more breath, and notice what happens when you stay with the feeling of the voice being "thinking". What's the sensation of your chest when you're holding that label, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest feels a bit lighter, like there's a small space where the tightness used to be, but it's still tense underneath. Noticing it feels weird and makes me want to look away or check my phone. Can we keep this a little longer? I'm not sure how much I can hold, but I want to try.

Therapist: Notice what's happening when you feel the tension underneath the lightness. What's one thing you value deeply that might be connected to holding onto that space, even if it feels awkward?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I value being competent and steady, being someone who can handle things. Maybe holding that small space feels like protecting that part of me so the breakup doesn't erase it. It's awkward to say and makes me feel exposed—can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: When you think of holding onto that space, what would you do if you were curious about what would happen if you let it go, just for a tiny moment? Would you look at your phone, or notice your breath, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my first impulse would be to reach for my phone, just to distract myself. If I tried to be curious I'd notice my breath instead, but it's a lot to hold and my words feel heavy—can we keep this slow?

Therapist: Notice how the weight of your words feels when you're trying to say "I value being competent and steady". What's one tiny word you could use instead of "value" that might feel a little lighter, like "means"?

Patient: I don't know... maybe "matters." It feels a bit lighter. Can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: When you think of something that matters to you (like being competent and steady), what's one tiny action you could take right now to move closer to that value, even if it's just for 10 seconds?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could set a 10‑second timer right now and just rest my fingers on the keys and notice my breath, without pressing run. It feels like a tiny bit of proof that I'm steady, but my words feel heavy and I might fidget—can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you think about your fingers fidgeting while you're trying to stay steady. What if that fidgeting was actually a sign that you're willing to try something new, even if it feels a little awkward?

Patient: I don't know... I guess maybe the fidgeting is proof I'm trying, even if it feels messy and embarrassing. My hands keep twitching and my chest is still tight, but maybe that twitching is a small kind of trying. Can we keep this slow?

Therapist: Notice the phrase "it feels messy and embarrassing". What if you said it to yourself like you're talking to a friend, instead of judging it? Would that change the way you feel about the fidgeting?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I said "it's messy and okay" like I'm talking to a friend, the fidgeting might feel less shameful and more human. My hands still twitch and talking about it takes effort—can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the fidgeting, you simply noticed what happens when you let go of the effort to control it? Would that tiny shift change the way you feel about your hands or the twitching?

Patient: I don't know... when I stop trying to control it the twitching kind of fades into the background and my hands feel a bit less tense—just a little. Saying that feels awkward and takes a lot; can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice that saying "it feels a bit less tense" is connected to the effort to describe it. What if you didn't say "a bit less tense", but simply stated the fact that your hands feel less tense? Would that shift the way you think about the connection between your hands and the value of being steady?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if I just say "my hands feel less tense" it sounds more neutral, like it's just happening instead of me judging it. It might make being steady feel more reachable, but saying that takes effort—can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice that saying "my hands feel less tense" seems to matter to you, because it's connected to the value of being steady. What if, instead of saying it's "reachable", you simply noticed that it matters to you when your hands feel less tense? Would that tiny shift change the way you think about steadiness?

Patient: I don't know... I guess just noticing that it matters—without saying it's reachable—does make steadiness feel less like a distant goal and more like a small thing I can actually notice in myself. My words feel heavy and it's hard to push for more, so can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "it matters" to yourself about your hands feeling less tense. What is it about that mattering that feels valuable to you? Is it the feeling of control, the sense of calm, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... maybe it's the sense of calm more than control—like a small proof I haven't completely fallen apart. Saying that feels heavy and a bit exposing, so can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you think "I haven't completely fallen apart" to yourself. What does that thought actually sound like? Would you say it out loud to a friend?

Patient: I don't know... it sounds small and a little embarrassed, like a quiet "I'm still here" more than a proud declaration. I don't think I'd say it out loud to a friend — it feels exposed and fragile. Can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "I'm still here" to yourself, quietly, without judgment. What does it feel like to hold that truth in your body, without needing to share it with anyone else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying "I'm still here" feels like a small, soft warmth in my chest—there's still a tightness, but it feels a little less sharp. It doesn't fix anything, it just steadies me a bit, and talking about it takes effort—can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you say "I'm still here" to yourself, and you're not trying to fix anything. What does the warmth feel like in relation to your values, like being steady and not falling apart?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a tiny, warm anchor in my chest—like proof that I'm steady enough not to completely fall apart. Saying that out loud takes a lot and feels fragile, so can we keep going slowly?
