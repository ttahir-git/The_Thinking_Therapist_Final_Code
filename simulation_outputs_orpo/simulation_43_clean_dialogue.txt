Patient: I've been stuck worrying about my performance at school — I second-guess every lesson and it makes me procrastinate on planning and grading until I'm overwhelmed. It's been wearing on me; I don't sleep well and feel guilty a lot. I'm skeptical this will change anything — I've tried strategies before and they didn't stick, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: What's one specific thing you'd avoid doing right now because of worry about your school performance – like planning a lesson or grading papers – that you wish you could just take a tiny step towards doing despite the fear?

Patient: Grading the huge stack of midterm essays — I keep avoiding it because I worry I'll be too slow, miss things, or it’ll show I'm not doing enough. I wish I could just open one student's paper and read the first paragraph or set a 10‑minute timer to write a single comment, though honestly I've used timers before — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Would it be just slightly more bearable for you to commit to writing one comment on that first paragraph, even if it's just "Great start," for just 2 minutes, without checking your timer or worrying about speed, just to see what that feels like?

Patient: Alright, I can try that — I'll write a single comment like "Great start" for two minutes, though I'm skeptical it'll matter. I'm already feeling the urge to check how long it's taking or if the comment sounds sincere, and I don't know how I'm supposed to stop that. Okay, should I do it now and then tell you how it felt?

Therapist: Instead of waiting, let's pause right here for a moment and notice what the "should I check how long it's taking" thought feels like in your body. Can you give that thought a tiny label, like "Ah, there's my'should' voice again," without doing anything else?

Patient: "Ah, there's my 'should' voice again." My chest feels tight and my shoulders got tense — there's this little knot in my stomach and an urge to peek at the timer. How is noticing that supposed to stop me from checking it?

Therapist: Notice how that knot in your stomach might show up when you're trying to do something that matters to you – like helping your students. What value does writing that one comment matter to you, even if it feels small?

Patient: It matters because it shows up for the kids — even a small comment reminds me I'm not just failing to keep up, I'm actually doing the job I care about. It feels like a tiny bit of proof I can still meet my standards instead of everything piling up. But I've told myself that before — how is reminding myself of value supposed to stop the knot and the urge to stall? Can you give me something actually practical for when that tightness hits?

Therapist: When that knot in your stomach shows up next time, and you feel the urge to check the timer, notice it as "this tightness in my chest, not the thought 'I should check the timer'." You can even say to yourself, "Ah, the knot's back – what's its job right now?"

Patient: Okay — when I ask "what's its job" I notice it's trying to protect me from looking foolish or not keeping up, like it's stopping me before I can fail in front of others. The tightness is still there and the urge to check the timer is loud — how is naming it supposed to make that urge quieter? I can try saying it out loud, but I don't trust that'll stop me from peeking.

Therapist: Notice what would happen if, instead of checking the timer, you did one tiny, small action that still feels connected to helping the kids – like just taking a deep breath, or stretching your arm up. What would happen if you did that small action, just for a second, without checking the timer?

Patient: When I actually try it, the deep breath loosens the knot a little and my shoulders drop — the urge to peek quiets for a few seconds. But it feels like a tiny bandage: the worry creeps back and then I get panicky about falling behind. How is that supposed to stop me from slipping back into checking or putting the whole pile off again?

Therapist: Notice what just happened when you took that deep breath – your shoulders dropped and the urge to check the timer quieted. What value did that moment show you about yourself, even if it felt temporary? Was it that you can still notice your breath, even when worry tries to creep back in?

Patient: I guess it showed I can slow down for a second and still be present — that I haven't completely lost touch with myself even when panic spikes. But it feels fragile; knowing I can notice my breath doesn't fix the pile of papers or the worry I'll fall further behind. How is that supposed to help when the knot comes back ten minutes later and I’ve looked at the timer anyway?

Therapist: When that knot comes back, instead of trying to "fix" the pile of papers or beating yourself up over checking the timer, what would it take for you to just commit to doing one more small action – like writing that one comment on the paper, or just taking one more deep breath?

Patient: Probably making the step embarrassingly small and concrete — like "open one essay, write one sentence: 'Good start,' then close it and stand up" — plus a physical break to interrupt the knot. I've made those tiny promises before and still backslid, so how is that supposed to help when the worry hits again and the pile's still there? I could try that now, though I'm not convinced it'll stick.

Therapist: What is it about making that tiny promise – writing "Good start" on the essay – that feels meaningful to you, even if it's just for a moment? Is it that it shows you're willing to show up, even when the pile is still there, and that you value the small act of doing something tangible, rather than getting caught up in worry?

Patient: It feels meaningful because it's a tiny, concrete bit of proof that I can still show up for the students — a way to reconnect to why I do this when grief and money worries make everything feel heavier. But I keep thinking it's just a Band‑Aid — how is that supposed to help when the pile and the worry are still there and the pressure keeps coming back? Still, I could try opening one essay and writing that one line right now, even if I don't trust it'll stick.

Therapist: When you open that essay and write "Good start," instead of focusing on the pile or the pressure, what would it take for you to just notice the sensation of the pen moving across the page, or the sound of your own breath, without judgment?

Patient: I guess I'd have to deliberately slow down — set the pen on the paper, notice its weight, feel the scratch, and breathe while I write that one line. That might let the knot ease for a moment, but I'm already thinking it'll feel staged or I'll just speed up afterward — how is ten seconds of noticing supposed to stop me from spiraling back to the timer? I'm willing to try it now, but I'm not convinced it'll stick, so what if it doesn't help?

Therapist: What if, in those 10 seconds, you simply acknowledge the thought "I'm trying this because it feels meaningful" without judgment – without tying it to success or failure?

Patient: Alright — I'll say it now: "I'm trying this because it feels meaningful." Saying it made the knot loosen a little and the urge to check the timer quiet down for a moment. But it still feels like a paper bandage — temporary relief, then the worry comes back when I remember the pile and the bills. How is that supposed to stop the next wave, or what do I do when the relief wears off and the panic starts again?

Therapist: When the knot starts to tighten again, notice what value is still present – the feeling that writing "Good start" matters to you, even if the worry is still there. What would you value most in this moment, if you weren't trying to avoid the panic?

Patient: I think what I'd value most in that moment is showing up for the students in a real, honest way — doing the small, concrete things that prove I care, even when I'm tired and scared. I also want to be kinder to myself, to admit I’m doing what I can instead of beating myself up for not doing more. But I'm skeptical: how is naming that value actually going to stop me from checking the timer or freezing when the bills and the pile start shouting at me? Can we turn that value into one very specific, doable next step I could try right now?

Therapist: When the knot starts to tighten again, before you check the timer, commit to just one tiny action that shows you're willing to "show up" for the students – write the word "for" on the top of that one essay, right now, without worrying about the rest.

Patient: Okay — I wrote "for" at the top. It felt small and clumsy; my hands were heavy and the knot's still there — how is that supposed to stop me from checking the timer when the panic returns, and what's a practical next step that might actually help?

Therapist: When the panic returns and you feel the urge to check the timer, instead of doing that, notice what's physically happening in your body when you bring your hand to the timer – feel the weight of your hand, the tension in your fingers, the sensation of your breath. Can you pause for just 2 seconds before taking any action with the timer, and instead do something small with that hand – like flex your fingers or touch your thumb to your palm?

Patient: Okay — I just tried pausing for two seconds and flexing my fingers. My hand felt heavy, the knot eased a hair and my shoulders dropped a bit, but the urge to check was still there under it. How is that actually going to stop me when the panic ramps up for real, and what's a practical next step if this only buys me a few seconds?

Therapist: When the panic ramps up, instead of checking the timer, bring your attention back to the word "for" you wrote at the top of the essay – notice how that small word is connected to your value of showing up for the students. What if you took one tiny step towards that value, right now, before checking the timer – like making a small mark next to the word "for" with your finger, or looking up at the clock for just a second to acknowledge it's there?

Patient: I made a tiny smudge next to "for" with my fingertip and looked up at the clock for a second. It felt clumsy and slowed me enough that the knot loosened a bit, but it didn't disappear. How is that supposed to stop me if the panic comes back harder — what's one practical thing I can do next if this only buys me ten seconds?

Therapist: When the panic comes back, instead of checking the timer or worrying about the mark, look at the student's face you're grading – notice their eyes, their smile, or their posture. What small, concrete thing can you do with that gaze that connects to your value of showing up for them, right now, without getting caught up in worry?

Patient: I'd let my eyes settle on one student's face, pick out something specific — their focus or a little smile — and write one tiny, concrete note like "I noticed your idea here" or "Nice image" next to a line. It feels small and my words are dragging, but it might tilt me from seeing a pile to seeing a person for a second — though honestly, how is that supposed to help the next time the panic comes back?

Therapist: When the panic comes back, instead of trying to "help" yourself, notice what happens in your body when you look at that student's face – do you feel tension, numbness, or something else? What is the sensation of that gaze, without judgment?

Patient: When I look at a student's face my chest tightens and my jaw tenses — there's this hollow in my stomach and my hands go a bit numb, like I'm shrinking away. A flush of shame creeps in too, like whatever I'm about to do will prove I can't cut it. I can name that, but how is noticing it supposed to keep the panic from pulling me back into checking the timer or freezing up?

Therapist: Notice that the flush of shame is tied to the fear of not being able to "do it right." What value is being threatened by that fear, even if it's just for a moment? Is it your ability to show up for the students, or something else?

Patient: It's my sense of competence and dignity — the part that says I'm still the kind of teacher who can show up and do right by the students — that's being threatened. The shame makes me want to shrink and hide, so I freeze instead of doing the tiny, concrete thing. I can name it, but how is noticing that actually going to stop me from checking the timer or shutting down when it hits?

Therapist: When the shame kicks in and you feel the urge to freeze, instead of trying to "not think" it or "push it away," notice the sensation of your feet on the ground – feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your toes on the floor. What happens to the shame when you bring attention to that physical sensation, without judgment?

Patient: I tried it — feeling the weight through my heels and the pressure of my toes. The shame eases a bit, like it moves out of my chest and I can breathe down here for a second, and the urge to shut down softens. But it still comes back and the worry sneaks up again — how is feeling my feet supposed to stop it from returning five minutes later?

Therapist: Notice what happens when you breathe into that calmness – what happens to your body, your thoughts, and your emotions? Instead of trying to "hold" the calm or "make" it last, simply observe the natural cycle of the shame returning, without judgment. What is the pattern of the shame's return, and what might you do with it next time it comes?

Patient: When I breathe into the calm, my chest loosens and my thinking quiets for a bit — the shame usually comes in waves: it spikes fast (tight chest, jaw, urge to check the timer), hangs around for a minute or two, then drifts down if I keep breathing and stay grounded. Next time I could try a short script: feel my feet, take three slow breaths, open one essay, write one line, then stand up — something literally one minute long to interrupt the wave. I'm skeptical it'll stop the big waves entirely, but maybe it shortens them; how is that supposed to keep the shame from coming back harder later? I don't have much energy to test it, but I could try once more now.

Therapist: Notice what value is being threatened by the shame's return – is it still your competence, dignity, or something else? What would happen to that value if you were able to interrupt the wave of shame for just one minute, without judgment or effort?

Patient: It's still mostly my sense of competence and dignity — and the fear that I won't be useful to the students anymore. If I could interrupt the shame for one minute, it would give a tiny bit of evidence that I can act despite the fear, calm the spike enough to do one small thing, and maybe shorten the next wave. I'm worn thin and skeptical — how is a minute supposed to fix the bigger mess of the pile and the bills? I can try that one‑minute script now, if you think that's what will matter.

Therapist: Take a deep breath, and as you feel the weight of your body on the ground, say to yourself: "I will do one small thing for one minute, just because it feels like the right thing to do – not because I'm sure it'll fix everything, but because it feels like it might make a tiny difference."

Patient: "I will do one small thing for one minute, just because it feels like the right thing to do — not because I'm sure it'll fix everything, but because it feels like it might make a tiny difference." Saying that eased the knot a hair and I can feel my weight through my heels, but my hands are still heavy and I'm worn out; I'll try the one‑minute script now — three breaths, open one essay, write "Good start," then stand up — though I'm not sure it'll change the rest of the pile.

Therapist: As you breathe in for the first time, notice what happens when you open that essay – what physical sensation arises when you place your hand on the paper, and what thought comes up in your mind?

Patient: When I lay my hand on the paper it feels cool and a bit rough, my fingers go a little numb and my shoulders tighten — my breath gets shallow and my jaw clenches. The thought that pops up is, "This will take too long; they'll see I'm not keeping up," and a sharp flush of shame comes with it. I can still write the line, but honestly — how is noticing all that supposed to stop the panic from dragging me back to the timer?

Therapist: Notice the thought "This will take too long" – what value is being threatened by that thought, besides the panic itself? What would happen to your sense of competence and dignity if you were able to act on the thought "Good start" without judgment, even if it's just for one minute?

Patient: Besides the panic, it threatens my sense of competence and dignity — like if I can't even do this tiny thing, maybe I'm not the teacher I thought I was. If I could write "Good start" without judging it, even for a minute, it might give a little proof I can still act and care, not just collapse under the pile. But honestly — how is that one minute supposed to help with the bills and the mountain of work? My hands feel heavy, but I can try it now.

Therapist: Take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I will write 'Good start' without judging it, just because it feels like the right thing to do – not because I'm sure it'll fix everything, but because it feels like it might make a tiny difference in this moment."

Patient: "I will write 'Good start' without judging it, just because it feels like the right thing to do — not because I'm sure it'll fix everything, but because it feels like it might make a tiny difference in this moment." Saying that loosened the knot a bit; my hand felt heavy but I actually wrote "Good start" on the page. It felt small and clumsy — how is that supposed to help the rest of the pile and the bills? I can try another minute, though my words are dragging.
