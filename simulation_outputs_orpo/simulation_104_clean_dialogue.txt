Patient: I'm a senior software developer who recently moved, and I've been avoiding gatherings because social situations send my anxiety through the roof. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that always predicts disaster — I'll say something dumb, they'll laugh, word will spread, I'll lose respect at work, end up completely isolated — and I cling to that story like it's the only real future. People tell me that's unrealistic, but I just can't see any other outcome.

Therapist: When you say your mind predicts disaster, what's one specific thing that happens in those social situations that makes you feel like you'll lose face or respect? For example, is it when someone laughs at your joke, or when you have to introduce yourself?

Patient: Usually it's when I have to say something in a group—like introduce myself or answer an offhand question. I picture my voice cracking or me saying something stupid, people laugh, someone repeats it at work, my reputation gets ruined, I lose projects or the job, and I'm back isolated and humiliated. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop feeling like that's the only thing that'll happen.

Therapist: Can you imagine what would happen to you right now, just for a tiny moment, if you took a deep breath and said "hello" to that one person in the group without thinking about the outcome? What would that feel like, physically and mentally?

Patient: If I actually took that breath and said "hello," my chest would clamp up, my voice would probably crack, my face would heat and my hands would shake so I can barely get the words out. Then my mind runs the whole catastrophe — someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, my competence gets questioned, I lose projects or worse, and I'm back isolated and humiliated. I know people say that's extreme, but I just can't picture any other ending; it feels totally inevitable.

Therapist: Notice what just happened when you described that "catastrophe" story: your words ("I lose projects or worse") became like a mantra, didn't they? Can you see that as a thought, rather than a prediction of what's going to happen?

Patient: I can kind of hear it as a mantra, but it doesn't feel like "just a thought" — it feels like a forecast that's already written. Calling it a thought feels like pretending; the humiliation story is so vivid and convincing that I can't treat any other outcome as real.

Therapist: What would be just one tiny thing – one tiny thing – that you would do or say if you weren't afraid of being ridiculed or humiliated? What's one small value that matters to you that could be connected to that moment?

Patient: Maybe I'd just say, "Hi, I'm Mark," or ask someone lightly about their weekend — something tiny that actually tries for connection, because I care about not being a shut-in and I want honest relationships. But then my brain immediately plays the movie: my voice cracks, someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, my competence is questioned, I lose projects and end up alone and embarrassed. I know that sounds extreme and people tell me to see other outcomes, but I can't make myself believe any of those — the disaster feels inevitable.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to avoid the disaster story, you simply acknowledged it for one tiny second before you said "Hi, I'm Mark"? Not just mentally – actually say it out loud: "My voice might crack, my face might heat up..." Can you do that tiny acknowledgment without judgment, just to see if it changes the game?

Patient: "My voice might crack, my face might heat up, my hands might shake, and someone will laugh." I just said it out loud, but nothing changed — my chest's still tight and I can already hear the laugh echoing, imagine it getting repeated at work, my reputation shredded, and me losing projects. I know that sounds irrational, but I can't make the other outcomes feel real.

Therapist: Notice how you're already imagining that laugh echoing back to you – it's like a record playing on repeat. Can you catch that thought just as it's about to repeat itself, and instead of going "Oh no, it's happening," say to yourself: "That's just a thought"?

Patient: I tried — I actually said "that's just a thought" out loud, but it felt hollow and the catastrophe movie immediately drowns it out. Within seconds I'm back at the laugh, people repeating it, my reputation ruined, projects gone — it doesn't feel like a thought, it feels like a prophecy. I'm getting frustrated and tired of these little tricks because they don't change the panic; can we slow down?

Therapist: What would it mean for you to take just one tiny step away from the panic – just one tiny step – right now, without trying to change the thoughts? For example, what would you do with your body if you weren't trying to avoid the laugh?

Patient: If I weren't trying to avoid the laugh, I'd let my hands rest on my knees, take a slow breath, keep my shoulders down and maybe lean in slightly — just a small, calm movement so I don't look like I'm running away. But the second I picture that, my brain shoots the film: my hands tremble, my voice cracks, someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, my reputation collapses and I end up alone. I know that sounds stuck and maybe boring to hear, but I can't help feeling frustrated and exhausted by how inevitable that outcome seems.

Therapist: When you picture your hands resting on your knees, taking a slow breath, and leaning in slightly – without trying to change the thoughts – what do you notice about your body? What's one thing you can see or feel that matters to you about that small movement?

Patient: I notice my hands actually feel a little steadier on my knees and my breath eases a notch — it would feel like I'm trying to show up instead of disappearing, and that small act of presence matters to me. But the instant I notice it, the movie starts: my hands tremble, my voice cracks, someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, my reputation collapses and I'm back alone. I'm getting frustrated and tired of this loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: When the movie starts again, and you feel the trembling, cracking, laughing – what's the first thing you notice that's different this time? Is it the same thought that popped up before, or is something else happening in your body or mind?

Patient: It's basically the same thought — the laugh and the whole disaster movie rush in first. My breath might steady for a split second, but the throat-tightening and the image of people whispering and my reputation collapsing immediately drown it out. I'm honestly getting annoyed and tired of trying these little tricks — other endings just don't feel real to me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and exhausted from trying to control the thoughts. Can you take a moment to acknowledge that feeling – not just the thought, but the physical sensation of it in your body? What does it cost you to keep trying to push against this loop, and what would it take for you to let go of the need to control the outcome?

Patient: Physically it's a tight knot in my chest, my throat clenches and my stomach sinks — there's this exhausted heaviness like I've been bracing for a punch. It costs me friendships, chances at work, feeling like I have to hide who I am, and just constant mental drain from rehearsing the worst outcomes. Letting go would mean some kind of concrete proof that the catastrophe won't happen — something I don't have, so it feels impossible; I'm honestly frustrated and tired of these little exercises because they don't make the disaster feel any less real. Can we slow down?

Therapist: What's one thing that matters to you most in a moment like that – not what you'll say or do, but what it will mean for your values, your relationships, or your sense of self? What would you want to hold onto, even if the worst happens?

Patient: What matters most is staying true to myself — showing up honestly and trying to keep a few real connections instead of hiding. But even that feels doomed: if I’m genuine and my awkwardness shows, someone will laugh, it’ll get repeated at work, people will question my competence, I’ll lose projects and end up isolated and humiliated. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can’t shake how inevitable it feels — I’m getting frustrated and tired; can we slow down?

Therapist: What is one small, tangible thing you can hold onto in that moment – not a thought or a prediction, but a physical sensation or a sensation in your body – that feels connected to staying true to yourself? For example, can you imagine your feet touching the ground, your breath moving in and out, or your hands feeling a certain texture?

Patient: I can feel my feet flat on the floor and the chair pressing into my thighs — that steady, heavy contact kind of grounds me and reminds me I'm actually here. But the moment I notice that, the movie starts again — my voice cracks, someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, and I lose projects — and I can't make the other outcomes feel real. I'm getting frustrated and tired of this loop; can we slow down?

Therapist: When the movie starts again, and your voice cracks, can you notice the thought that says "my voice cracks" without judgment? Can you simply observe it as a thought, without trying to change it or push against it? Just say to yourself: "That's a thought" – without adding a value judgment or a push-back.

Patient: Okay — I said "that's a thought" out loud. It felt empty; the disaster movie flooded back instantly — my voice cracking, people laughing, my reputation ruined, projects gone — and my chest tightened. It still doesn't feel any less true, and I'm getting frustrated and tired; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your body right now – the tightness in your chest, the heaviness in your legs. What does it feel like to be in this place of frustration and exhaustion? Can you allow it to be there, without trying to push against it or change it?

Patient: It feels like a lead weight in my chest and this hollow, queasy pit in my stomach, my breaths coming shallow and fast while my legs feel heavy and tinny. If I try to let it sit, it will calm a notch for a second, but then the movie spikes back up — my voice cracks, people laugh, it gets repeated at work, and everything collapses. I can try to allow the feeling, but it already feels pointless because the disaster feels inevitable. I'm really frustrated and tired of this loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: What is one thing that you value that might be lost if you keep holding onto this thought – not the thought itself, but what it's costing you in terms of your relationships, your work, or your sense of self?

Patient: Mostly my real connections — honest friendships and being seen for who I am. If I keep clinging to that catastrophe story, I keep avoiding, those friendships quietly fade, I miss projects or promotions because I don't show up, and I end up isolated and resentful — it's like a chain that always finishes the same way. I know it sounds dramatic, but it feels inevitable, and I'm really frustrated and tired of this loop; can we slow down?

Therapist: What would one tiny step look like for you – just one small action – that would allow you to try showing up in the moment, even if it feels like the disaster story is waiting just beneath the surface?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest step is to stand by the snacks, take one slow breath, and just say, "Hi, I'm Mark," to one person — then sit down. Of course my head already plays the movie — voice cracks, someone laughs, it spreads at work, I lose projects — and I'm getting worn down; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice what's happening in your body when the movie starts playing – the tension in your shoulders, the tightness in your chest, the "oh no" thought. Can you simply acknowledge that it's happening, without trying to change it or fight it? Just say to yourself: "Ah, here it comes. My body is reacting."

Patient: "Ah, here it comes. My body is reacting." I say that and my chest clamps, shoulders pull in, breath gets thin. Saying it doesn't drown the movie — I can already hear the laugh, see it spread at work, my reputation gone — and it just feels heavy and pointless; can we slow down?

Therapist: What is it about the image of your reputation being "gone" that feels so crushing to you? Is it the thought of losing your sense of self, your identity, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's my sense of competence and usefulness — my reputation feels like the proof I'm still worth something, and if that's gone then I don't know who I am. The movie makes it tangible: a laugh, whispers at work, losing projects, maybe the job, and suddenly everything I built feels like it evaporated. I'm getting worn out by this replay; can we slow down?

Therapist: What would it be like to imagine that your reputation isn't defined by one moment, but by the value you bring to others and the work you do? What if, instead of losing everything, you gained something new – a new skill, a new connection, or a new sense of purpose?

Patient: I can sort of imagine that — like maybe one awkward moment wouldn't erase decades of work and maybe I could even pick up a new skill or a real connection — but it doesn't feel real to me. My head jumps straight to the rest of the movie: even if I gained something, someone would still mock me, it'd spread at work, projects get pulled, and I'm right back worse off; I'm worn out by this—can we slow down?

Therapist: What is it about the idea that you'll always be "worse off" that feels so exhausting to you? Is it the weight of that expectation, the fear of being trapped in this cycle, or something else?

Patient: It's mostly the constant pressure — like there's this rule stamped on my forehead that one slip equals total collapse, and that endless rehearsal of "what if" just chews up whatever energy I have. Even when I try to picture something else, my mind runs the same movie: voice cracks, someone laughs, it spreads, projects get pulled, and I'm left worse off, so I feel trapped and hollow. I can't make any other ending feel real and it's draining me; can we slow down?

Therapist: What's one small thing you could do right now, just for a minute, that wouldn't be "lost" to this story? Would you be willing to put a tiny "stop" to this movie, even if it's just for 30 seconds, to explore what's possible when you're not trapped in it?

Patient: I can do 30 seconds — feet flat, hands on my knees, slow breaths, just notice sensations and count each inhale. But it already feels pointless; the moment it's over the movie will pick up again — my voice cracks, someone laughs, it spreads at work, projects disappear — and I'm back worse off. I'll do it if you want, but I don't expect it to change much; can we slow down?

Therapist: What is it about being able to notice your breath, feel your body, or count your inhales that feels precious to you? Is it the sense of control, the tiny spark of hope, or something else?

Patient: It's more like a tiny, fragile proof that I'm still here — a small spark that maybe I can touch the real moment instead of the movie. But it never lasts: the calm flickers, the laugh and whispers flood back, projects get pulled, and I'm right back worse off. I'm getting worn out and frustrated… can we slow down?

Therapist: What is it about being present that feels most valuable to you – is it connection, creativity, or something else? If you couldn't hold onto this spark, what would be the smallest cost to your core value?

Patient: Being present feels like the only real chance for connection — a tiny proof I still belong and that I'm not just hiding. If I lose that spark the smallest cost is those everyday ties fading: people stop checking in, casual chats disappear, I get overlooked for projects, and it snowballs into the same collapse — reputation chipped away, projects pulled, isolation. I know that sounds bleak but I can't seem to picture any other outcome; can we slow down?

Therapist: What is one tiny, almost imperceptible detail about your breath, your body, or the pause that you've been assuming is "gone" forever? For example, is it the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the sound of your own breath, or something else?

Patient: It's the tiny tickle of air at the top of my nostrils and the steady press of my heels into the floor — like a little anchor that feels real. The second I notice it, though, the movie surges: my voice cracks, someone laughs, it spreads at work, projects get pulled and I'm back worse off. I'm worn out and it's hard to hold even that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you commit to noticing that tiny tickle of air at the top of your nostrils, or the steady press of your heels into the floor, without letting the movie take over? Just for one more second, without judgment, without trying to change it or push against it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. I notice the tickle at the top of my nostrils and my heels pressing into the floor and, for a beat, my breath eases and it feels real. But it's already slipping — the movie's back: my voice cracks, someone laughs, it gets repeated at work, projects pulled — so it's hard to hold; can we slow down?
