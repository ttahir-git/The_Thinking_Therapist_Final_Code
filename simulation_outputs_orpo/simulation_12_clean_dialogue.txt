Patient: Hey—so since I started this new program/job, I've been masking a lot with jokes and sarcasm so I don't have to feel how... I don't know, awkward and off. I guess it's become my go-to for dealing with this adjustment disorder stuff, but it kind of drains me and I don't always notice until later.

Therapist: That takes a lot of energy to keep up with humor when you're feeling drained. When you notice yourself using jokes or sarcasm to cope, what's the first thing you do or think when it wears off – like when you're alone, or after a conversation?

Patient: I usually keep jabbering or throw another joke out there — easier than stopping. Then later, when I'm alone in the truck or at home, I feel wiped out and kind of hollow, like I used up whatever feelings I had. I don't know, I guess I busy myself with TV or projects so I don't have to sit with it.

Therapist: Those moments of emptiness seem really important to you, even if you don't know how to process them yet. What's one small, personal value that's connected to sitting with that feeling, like being present for yourself or your relationships?

Patient: I guess being steady and reliable for my family — actually showing up without hiding behind a joke. I don't know, it's kinda awkward to say, but I want to be present for them and not just skim over the hard stuff.

Therapist: Being steady and reliable for your family feels like a core value. When you're present with them, what happens when you notice your mind trying to protect you with a joke – like it's saying "You can't be vulnerable here"?

Patient: I usually feel my mouth go for a joke, like some reflex — everyone's laughing but I end up feeling... I don't know, kind of distant. I guess my partner gives me that look and I either toss out another quip or change the subject, or say I'm fine. It leaves me feeling guilty and hollow, like I missed a chance to actually connect, and talking about it makes me squirm.

Therapist: When your mouth goes to make a joke, what's the physical sensation in your body that shows up before you say it – like a tension in your shoulders or a tightness in your chest?

Patient: I don't know — it's like a tightness in my chest and my shoulders bunch up, my jaw gets real tight and my hands start fidding with whatever's nearby. My heart speeds up a bit and next thing I know I'm blurting a joke, I guess.

Therapist: Notice that tightness in your chest – what would it look like if you gave that tightness a tiny bit of space, just for a breath, without having to fix it or make a joke about it?

Patient: I don't know... maybe it'd be like letting that lump sit there for a single slow breath, noticing my shoulders ease a hair and my jaw unclench a bit without trying to do anything about it. I guess it feels weird and exposed, and my first thought is to make a joke or move on. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with all this.

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start – just noticing that lump in your chest without trying to fix it. Let's take it one step further: what if, instead of trying to let go of the tightness, you just acknowledge it – name it to yourself – without doing anything with it?

Patient: I don't know... maybe I'd call it "the lump" or "the guard" — sounds dumb, but naming it feels like taking the wind out of it. I guess saying it out loud might stop me from blurting a joke, but it also makes me feel exposed and weird. Can we slow down? I'm kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to feel weird – that's what it means to be willing. You're already taking a tiny step by naming the lump. What's one tiny value that's connected to you being willing to sit with that feeling – like being honest with yourself or showing up for your partner?

Patient: I guess it's about being honest with myself and actually showing up for my partner — not hiding behind the wisecracks. I don't know, saying that out loud makes me squirm and feel exposed, like I want to change the subject.

Therapist: Instead of trying to make that sentence work, what if you just say it without expectation – like a statement of fact: "I want to be honest with myself and show up for my partner, but it feels weird to say that out loud"?

Patient: "I want to be honest with myself and show up for my partner, but it feels weird to say that out loud." I don't know, saying it makes me squirm — I feel like cracking a joke or changing the subject. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: What's the first thing you notice when you feel that squirminess in your body – the first thing that shows up before you want to make a joke or change the subject?

Patient: I don't know — it's this buzzy tightness under my ribs and my jaw locks up, like my face is ready to crack a joke. My hands start fiddling with whatever's nearby and my head hunts for something to say to steer away. I guess it feels safer to move or make light of it than to sit with that feeling — can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: That buzzy tightness sounds really present right now. What if, instead of trying to move away from it or make a joke, you just gave it a tiny bit of kindness – a tiny "hello" – without judgment?

Patient: Okay... "hello lump" — I don't know, saying that out loud feels dumb, but when I try it my chest eases a bit and my shoulders loosen a hair, my jaw unclenches. I guess it still feels awkward and I get this urge to crack a joke or look busy. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That awkwardness sounds really present right now. What if, instead of trying to move away from it or make a joke, you just allowed it to be there – like a small, tiny thing that's okay to feel?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if I just let it be, I could say to myself, "okay, you're here," and not have to fix it right away. Saying that already makes me feel exposed — my mouth itches for a joke and my hands want to busy themselves. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That tiny statement "you're here" feels like a tiny act of courage. What if, instead of trying to protect yourself from that vulnerability, you just said it again – just one more time – and saw what happens?

Patient: "You're here." I don't know, saying it again makes my chest loosen a touch and my shoulders drop, like a weight shifts. I still get this stupid urge to crack a joke or start fiddling with something — feels easier — so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That urge to crack a joke or fiddle feels like a familiar escape. What if, instead of chasing that escape, you just sat with the weight that shifted – that feeling of your shoulders dropping?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. My shoulders feel heavy, like someone's pressing down, and my jaw's still tight — my mouth wants to crack a joke, but I'm just taking a slow breath. I don't know, it's weird and I feel kind of wiped out, so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That feeling of being wiped out sounds like it's connected to your value of showing up for your partner. What would it take for you to be willing to stay with that exhaustion – even for just a moment – if it meant you could show up for them in a way that feels truly present?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if it was tiny — like one minute where I don't have to perform and my partner just gives a quiet look so I don't have to explain. I guess some practice, a heads-up or a cue, and someone saying it's okay to just be there would help. It feels heavy to even think about, so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That quiet look from your partner sounds like a perfect cue. What would it look like if they just nodded slightly or looked at you with a soft expression – just enough to say "it's okay to be there"?

Patient: I guess it'd be real small — a tiny nod, soft eyes, maybe a half-smile, no questions or trying to fix anything, just a quiet "it's okay." Saying that out loud already makes me... I don't know, squirm. My mouth itches to make a joke or busy myself. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That squirming sensation is actually a sign that you're willing to stay with the discomfort – even if it feels hard. What if, instead of pushing it away, you just acknowledged it – like, "Ah, my body is squirming because I'm feeling vulnerable"?

Patient: I guess—yeah, my body's squirming 'cause I'm feeling vulnerable. I don't know, my chest's tight and my head's already flitting to a dozen other things and I keep wanting to make a joke to dodge it. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That urge to make a joke is actually a way to avoid feeling the tightness in your chest. What if, instead of using the joke to escape, you used it to acknowledge the tightness – like, "Okay, my chest is tight because I'm feeling anxious about being vulnerable"?

Patient: I guess I might try something like, "Okay, my chest's tight — I'm getting anxious about being vulnerable," and then, of course, follow it up with a stupid joke like, "Must be the dust in the air," to cover it up. I don't know, saying that out loud makes me feel exposed and my head's already flitting to a dozen other things. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That exhaustion sounds like it's worth noticing. What happens to your body and thoughts when you pause for just one moment before saying the joke – like, "Okay, my chest's tight..."?

Patient: If I actually pause... my chest loosens a little, shoulders drop a hair, my jaw unclips — but it's tiny. My brain, though, starts flitting to other stuff — "say something funny, did I forget something at the site," that kind of jangly buzz — and the urge to cover it with a joke spikes. I don't know, I guess it feels exposed and kind of exhausting, so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That jangly buzz sounds like it's made of tiny, annoying thoughts – "say something funny, did I forget something at the site." What if, instead of trying to quiet that buzz, you just acknowledged it – like, "Ah, my brain is buzzing because I'm worried about what to say"?

Patient: Yeah... "My brain's buzzing 'cause I'm worried about what to say" — I guess saying that actually takes the edge off a bit, but my head's already jumping to a hundred other things — did I lock the truck, what about that delivery — it gets annoying. I don't know, it still makes me want to crack a joke to cover it up. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: You've already paused and said "My brain's buzzing" – what if you just paused again, just for one breath, without trying to fix the thoughts?

Patient: Okay... I take one slow breath. My chest eases a bit, but my head's already darting to "did I lock the truck" and a joke's lining up — I don't know, I guess one breath helps a hair, but it's tiring, so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: Notice what happens to your body when you pause – specifically, what's the physical sensation in your body, like where you feel the breath, or what's your jaw doing?

Patient: I don't know... when I pause the breath's kinda shallow, up high in my chest and throat instead of my belly, and my jaw stays locked like it's waiting to crack a joke. My hands keep fiddling and my head's already darting to other stuff, so it eases a bit but it's pretty draining — can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: That exhaustion sounds like it's worth noticing. What if, instead of trying to control the thoughts or the breath, you just allowed the exhaustion to be there – like, "I'm tired of trying to make this work"?

Patient: I don't know... I feel worn out from always having to perform — my chest's tight and my head's already darting to "did I lock the truck" or that delivery — so sitting with it feels like a lot. I guess letting it be, even for a breath, feels scary but maybe helps a little. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control the thoughts or the breath, you just wondered what would happen if you let the exhaustion be there – without trying to fix it or move away from it?

Patient: I don't know... if I actually let it sit maybe the edge would ease — shoulders drop a bit, jaw loosens, but my head's already darting to "did I lock the truck" and I feel itchy to move. I guess if I kept at it for a minute it might feel less urgent, but it also scares me and makes me want to crack a joke. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to push the thought away, you just noticed the itch to move – like, "My body is itchy to get up and do something"?

Patient: Yeah... my body's all itchy to get up and do something — my hands start fiddling and my head's already shouting, "did I lock the truck?" I don't know, I want to crack a joke or go fix something to dodge it. Can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to push the joke away, you just noticed it for what it is – a way to avoid the discomfort of the itch?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the joke lining up already — something like, "Well, at least I keep the crew laughing," and that’s me dodging the itchy tightness in my chest. My head's already pinging to "did I lock the truck" and my hands want to get busy, so can we slow down? I'm getting kinda overwhelmed.
