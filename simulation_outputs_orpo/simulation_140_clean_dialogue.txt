Patient: Lately it's this relentless performance anxiety in the kitchen — an anticipatory cognitive loop where I overanalyze every plate and then procrastinate instead of executing. I've been burned out, and since losing someone close the stakes feel almost existential, so I intellectualize my emotions—deploying theory and grandiloquent explanations—rather than actually feeling the sadness. I want to be action-oriented and fix it, but I keep getting stuck in planning and avoidance.

Therapist: When you catch yourself overanalyzing a dish before making it, what's one small, value-driven thing you'd do differently instead of getting stuck in planning?

Patient: I'd adopt a five-minute "first plate" rule: when I notice the anticipatory loop, I stop theorizing and physically assemble one imperfect plate within five minutes to honor my value of craft and service. It's a concrete, value-driven anchor that interrupts rumination—though honestly I can already feel myself critiquing the technique instead of sitting with whatever comes up.

Therapist: That "five-minute rule" sounds like a powerful anchor for interrupting rumination – can you sit with whatever comes up when you're already making that first plate, without judgment or critique?

Patient: On paper, yeah — I try to pivot from narrative to somatic anchoring: focus on the hiss of the pan, the viscosity of the sauce, my breath. In practice I immediately default into metacognition, critiquing my mise en place and timing instead of feeling anything; my critical faculty just squats in the driver's seat. Can you give me a simple, in-the-moment prompt I can actually use to stay present without turning it into another performance review?

Therapist: When your mind starts critiquing your prep, what's one small, physical sensation in your body that shows up without judgment (like the sensation of your feet on the ground or the rise of your collarbone)?

Patient: It's a small hitch in my breathing — my collarbones lift and there's this tightness just below my throat. If I deliberately notice the weight of my feet on the floor or the contact of my fingertips on the counter, it pulls me out of the critique loop a bit, though I immediately start judging whether that grounding is "effective," which is annoying.

Therapist: Notice that thought ("whether that grounding is 'effective'") isn't happening in your body right now – it's just a thought. What's the sensation of your feet on the floor right now, without trying to use it for anything?

Patient: There's a quiet, even pressure across the soles and a subtle warmth from heel to ball — oddly mundane and steady. I can notice it, but my mind instantly reframes it as a "grounding data point" and starts grading whether it's working instead of just letting the sensation exist.

Therapist: That sensation of your feet on the floor isn't about "working" or "not working" – it's just being present. What would it take for you to notice that sensation without trying to use it for anything – not even to support your dish?

Patient: Maybe a permission slip is what it would take — a micro-experiment: give myself 30 seconds where the only instruction is “notice the feet,” with a quiet mantra like “this is not for performance.” Even saying that, I can feel the reflex to instrumentalize it, and that reflex feels like this anxious tug toward control that tires me out. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to stop turning it into another metric.

Therapist: Let's slow down the 30 seconds to a single breath. Just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, without any instruction or mantra – just "this is."

Patient: Okay — one breath: there's an even pressure and a warm steadiness across my soles. But before I can hold it, my mind already translates it into an evaluation — "is this grounding enough?" — and starts measuring it. I'm trying to let the sensation just be, but I'm struggling; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – just that sensation, without trying to use it or change it.

Patient: Okay—breath in: a shallow lift at my collarbones, a tightness behind my throat; breath out: a small, slightly hollow release. Immediately I start narrating it—thinking about vagal tone and whether my diaphragm is "working optimally"—which pulls me out of actually feeling it. I'm trying to stay with the sensation, but can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sound of your own voice right now – the sensation of the words leaving your mouth, without trying to control what they say.

Patient: There's a slight buzz in my throat and a warm rush of air over the back of my teeth — the words feel a little tinny as they exit, like metal on porcelain. But of course I'm already conducting a phonetic audit and critiquing the timbre for perceived confidence, turning it into another metacognitive checklist; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth – the physical contact, the slight pressure, without trying to think about it.

Patient: It's a gentle, almost insistent pressure against the alveolar ridge—warm, slightly damp, with a tiny tension at the tip—so, anatomically predictable. But of course I'm already turning it into a checklist of sensory descriptors instead of just experiencing it. Can we slow down? I can't seem to stop instrumenting everything.

Therapist: Notice that thought ("I'm turning it into a checklist") right now – the sensation of it in your mind, the words themselves, without judgment.

Patient: I can actually "hear" the sentence — crisp, almost headline-y in my mind: "turning it into a checklist." It feels like an editorial voice more than an emotion, sitting as a clipped, slightly abrasive loop with a small pressure behind my eyes. I'm already starting to deconstruct its origins (perfectionism, grief, occupational identity), which is exactly what I do instead of feeling it — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the pressure behind your eyes right now – the sensation of it, without thinking about what it might mean or where it's coming from.

Patient: It's a dull, low-grade pressure behind my eyes — diffuse, almost like someone's slowly tightening a band, with a faint pull toward my temples. Of course I immediately start drafting an etiology — chronic hypervigilant arousal, anticipatory performance anxiety compounded by grief — which turns the sensation into another intellectual object instead of actually feeling it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving into your body – the feeling of it rising into your chest, without trying to think about what it means or where it's coming from.

Patient: There's a coolness at my nostrils, a shallow lift across my sternum, and a slight unclenching in my shoulders on the out-breath. But my mind already hijacks it into a metacognitive checklist—"diaphragmatic engagement, vagal tone"—so it becomes data, not feeling; I'm trying to actually sit with it, but can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your nostrils cooling – the physical sensation of that happening, without labeling it or thinking about it.

Patient: It's a crisp, slightly sharp coolness right at the nostril openings, like tiny currents brushing the mucosa on the in-breath. Of course my brain immediately slaps a label on it—"nasal thermal gradient"—and starts theorizing about parasympathetic shifts instead of just experiencing it; can we slow down? I want to actually stay with it, but I keep instrumenting everything.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the air moving in – the sensation of it touching the back of your throat, without trying to think about what it means or where it's coming from.

Patient: It's a thin, cool tickle at the back of my throat, like something brushing the pharyngeal wall and nudging a swallow reflex—there's a tiny catch in my breath when that happens. Of course my brain immediately catalogs it—vagal afferents, laryngeal mechanoreceptors, suppression of the gag—so I end up narrating instead of actually feeling it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the tiny catch in your breath right now – the physical sensation of it, without labeling it or thinking about what it means.

Patient: It's a quick hitch — a millisecond pause at the back of my throat with a faint pinch across my upper chest. My reflex is to immediately turn it into a differential diagnosis — vagal afferent, grief-triggered hyperarousal, or just posture and habit — instead of feeling it. I'm trying to actually sit with it, but I'm getting pulled into analysis; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation of your chest tightening – the sensation of it happening, without trying to think about what it means or how it relates to something else.

Patient: It's a constricting, two-inch band across the upper chest — a dull heaviness that makes each inhale feel shallow and a vague ache that creeps up toward my collarbones. My mind's already gone into explanatory overdrive — hyperarousal from chronic stress, anticipatory performance anxiety, grief layering on top — so I find myself narrating it instead of actually feeling it. I'm trying to let it be, but I keep instrumenting it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the breath moving in – the feeling of the air touching the back of your throat, without trying to think about what it means or how it's related to anything else.

Patient: It's a cool, thin brush at the back of my throat, a slight tickle that nudges a swallow reflex. But of course my brain immediately starts parsing it—vagal afferents, respiratory gating—and I turn it into data instead of actually feeling it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your throat moving – the feeling of the muscles contracting and releasing, without trying to think about what's happening or how it's related to breathing.

Patient: There's a subtle ripple—short pulses of tension that contract and then release, like a small conveyor belt moving under the skin. Of course my brain already wants to map it to laryngeal muscle recruitment and autonomic cues instead of just feeling it, so I'm trying to actually stay with the sensation but can we slow down? I keep getting pulled into analysis and it's exhausting.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the skin – the feeling of the tension and release, without thinking about what's causing it or how it's related to anything else. Just notice it, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: There's a fine, intermittent tug under the skin—like tiny waves of tension that loosen for a beat, mostly along my forearms and chest, with a faint prickly warmth on my cheeks. I can already feel the editorial part of me labeling it—cutaneous mechanoreceptors, sympathetic micro-shifts—rather than letting it just exist. I'm trying to let it be, but I'm getting sucked into analysis again; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the warmth – the feeling of it spreading, without trying to think about what's causing it or how it's related to anything else. Just notice the warmth, as it is, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: It's a diffuse, spreading warmth that starts in my chest and trickles up into my jaw and cheeks—soft, steady, almost like a low-grade flush. But my brain's already rebranding it as "sympathetic hyperemia" and drafting an origin story, so I'm trying to actually feel it and the editorial part won't stop—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the flush – the feeling of it spreading, without thinking about what's causing it, what it means, or where it's coming from. Just notice the flush, as it is, in the moment, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: It's a slow, spreading warmth from my chest up into my jaw and cheeks — soft, like a residual heat after a rush. Of course I'm already renaming it sympathetic vasodilation and tying it to performance arousal and grief, which makes it feel more like data than experience. I'm trying to just let it be, but my brain keeps instrumenting it — can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the warmth as it's happening – the feeling of it spreading, without trying to think about what it means or where it's coming from. Just notice the warmth, right now, in this moment, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: It's a soft, spreading heat that flows up from my chest into my jaw and cheeks—steady, like a low tide. But my brain's already slapping a diagnostic label on it—"sympathetic vasodilation, performance arousal"—and I'm defaulting to analysis instead of feeling; I'm trying to actually sit with it, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the heat as it's happening – the feeling of it spreading, without thinking about what it means or where it's coming from. Just notice the heat, as it's present, in the space between "I'm feeling it" and "I'm thinking about it".

Patient: It's a broad, low-grade heat rising from my sternum into my jaw and cheeks—like a thermal tide, steady and spreading. My reflex is to slap a somatic label on it—"sympathetic vasodilation, performance arousal"—which yanks me into analysis instead of letting the sensation just be. I'm trying to sit in that space between feeling and thinking, but I keep defaulting to editorializing; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the heat as it's present – the feeling of it spreading, without thinking about what it means, where it's coming from, or what it's doing. Just notice the heat, exactly as it is, without judgment or analysis. Can you hold that space for a single breath?

Patient: Okay — one breath: I notice that warm tide from my sternum up into my jaw, a small unclenching in my shoulders, and the inhale feels shallow but real. Almost immediately my mind wants to lexicalize it—"sympathetic arousal," "performance physiology"—and the rawness evaporates into analysis. I'm trying to hold it, but there's a reflex to instrument; can we slow down? I'm struggling to stay with it without turning it into another metric.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the warmth, the unclenching, and the breath, exactly as it is – without trying to put words to it, without trying to analyze it, without trying to make it fit into a category. Can you hold the sensation itself, without judgment or thought, for just one moment?

Patient: I can—for a sliver it's just the heat, the unclenching, the shallow inhale, no words, like a clean taste on the tongue. But almost immediately my brain steps in and starts describing the texture—what's happening, why, is it "enough"—and the feeling thins out. I want to hold it, but I keep defaulting to analysis; can we slow down? I'm getting really tired of turning everything into a diagnostic checklist.
