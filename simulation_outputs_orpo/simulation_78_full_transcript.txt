--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Well, lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because social situations make me really anxious — I just get flooded and can't breathe. I'm an artist and with the house so quiet since the kids left, my confidence has plummeted and I don't really have much social support. I don't know, it's hard to talk about.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express feeling "flooded" and "stuck" in social situations, which are classic ACT metaphors for overwhelm. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the tangible context of this avoidance to identify what's driving your current strategy.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of being overwhelmed by social situations sounds really suffocating. When you say you avoid gatherings because they make you "flooded," what's one thing that usually happens right before you start feeling that way – like a trigger or a physical sensation that signals you're about to get stuck?

Patient: I guess it usually starts with my chest tightening and my hands getting kind of cold, like I can't catch my breath. Then my head fills with those mean little thoughts — "they'll think I'm boring" — and I just want to disappear. I don't know, it's embarrassing to say.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a clear physical symptom (chest tightness) and a specific thought pattern ("they'll think I'm boring") that follows it. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Introduce defusion to challenge the thought by connecting it to your physical experience.

Therapist Answer:
When your chest tightens and your hands get cold, what's the one thing you notice about that physical sensation – like a word or a phrase that describes it, without judgment ("it feels like a knot")?

Patient: I don't know... maybe like a heavy knot, like a clamp squeezing my chest. My hands go cold and tingly and I feel kind of pinned to the spot. I guess that's the best way to put it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a vivid metaphor for your physical experience ("heavy knot, clamp squeezing chest"). Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Connect the knot to your values to create a contrast to the thought that followed.

Therapist Answer:
That knot in your chest is a very tangible experience – it's a physical sensation you can feel right now. When you think that others will think you're boring, what's one thing that's really important to you about being around people – like what they value about you, or what you're passionate about?

Patient: I guess I want them to notice my work — the colors, the little details I fuss over — and not just see me as quiet or invisible. It matters to me that people think I'm someone who cares about things, who has something to offer. I don't know, I feel silly even saying that.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the knot to a value ("noticing my work, being someone who cares about things") and contrasted it with the thought ("being quiet, invisible") that follows. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Gently challenge the thought by connecting it to the knot.

Therapist Answer:
When you think "they'll just see me as quiet, invisible," what's the one thing that's already happening in your body right now – the knot in your chest, the tingle in your hands – that shows you're already showing up with something, even if it's just that you're feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I guess my breathing gets really shallow and my shoulders hunch up, and I start fiddling with my ring like I'm trying to hold myself together. I don't know, it feels like I'm bracing so I don't say the wrong thing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a physical action (fiddling with your ring) that's a subtle attempt to cope with the knot, and you've acknowledged feeling overwhelmed. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Introduce willingness to create space for a small action, rather than trying to "hold it together."

Therapist Answer:
You're already showing up with that physical action, even when you feel overwhelmed – you're fidgeting with your ring because you're trying to cope. What would it be like to take one tiny breath, just one, before you say something or do something, and see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might help a little. When I'm in it my breath gets so shallow I almost forget how to breathe, so pausing feels weird and clumsy. I've tried breathing exercises before and they calm me for a minute, but then the thoughts come back — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that pausing feels awkward because your breath is already shallow, and you're worried it won't work again. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect pausing to a small value, like staying present with your breath.

Therapist Answer:
Even if pausing feels clumsy right now, what's one tiny thing you notice about your breath when you do pause – like a slight pause in your chest movement, or a tiny rise in your belly?

Patient: I guess I notice a tiny lift in my belly, like a little soft rise, and my chest eases a notch. It's so faint it almost vanishes as soon as those thoughts start racing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small, fleeting change in your body ("tiny lift in your belly") when you pause, and you're still worried it won't work. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect that tiny change to your value of staying present, even if it's just for a moment.

Therapist Answer:
That tiny lift in your belly happens right now, even when thoughts start racing – it's a tiny bit of space you've created by pausing. What would it be like to hold onto that tiny lift for just 1 second, without trying to change it or push it away, and see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to hold it for a second my belly lifts and my chest eases a little, and my shoulders drop — but then the thought about being boring rushes back and it disappears. I guess it helps for a beat, but it's hard to keep it. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that holding onto the tiny lift creates a temporary shift (eased chest, dropped shoulders) before the thought rushes back. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this moment of shift to your value of showing up with your work, even if it's just for a moment.

Therapist Answer:
When your belly lifts and your chest eases, you're showing up with your work – that's something to hold onto. What would it be like to notice just that shift – the lifted belly, the eased chest – without trying to change it or push it away, and see what happens to the thought about being boring when you do?

Patient: I guess if I notice that little lift the "they'll think I'm boring" voice quiets for a beat, like it doesn't have to shout as loud. But it never lasts — then I worry I'm doing it wrong and the thought rushes back. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that noticing the lifted belly creates a temporary silence in the "they'll think I'm boring" voice, but it doesn't last. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this moment of silence to your value of showing up with your work, without trying to control it.

Therapist Answer:
When the thought about being boring quiets for a beat, what happens to your work – the colors, the details – in that moment? Does it feel like you're still doing it, even if the thought isn't shouting?

Patient: I guess when that thought quiets I can actually get into the colors — the little marks, the way a green sits next to a blue — and I feel lighter, like I'm inside the work for a moment. But it never lasts long before the worry sneaks back and I pull away. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that when the thought quiets, you can actually engage with your work – noticing the colors, the marks – and it brings a sense of lightness. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this sense of lightness to your value of being present with your work, without trying to control the thought.

Therapist Answer:
That feeling of lightness, when you're inside the work, what's one thing you can notice about that feeling right now – like a physical sensation, a thought, or a sensation in your body – that shows you're already present with it, even if the thought isn't present?

Patient: I notice a quiet warmth in my belly and my shoulders loosen a little, like something soft opens up. My fingertips tingle and want to make a mark on the canvas, and for a moment that critic voice goes quieter. I don't know, it's small and I worry it'll vanish — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small but significant shift in your body and mind – the quiet warmth, loosening shoulders, tingling fingertips – and it's accompanied by a quieter critic voice. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this moment of small shift to your value of creating, without trying to control the thought.

Therapist Answer:
That quiet warmth in your belly, when you make a mark on the canvas, what happens to the rest of your body – your chest, your breath, your whole presence – in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... when I'm really into a mark my chest loosens, my breath deepens a touch, and my shoulders drop — my hands just want to keep working. But it scares me because it disappears so fast and the critic rushes back — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that when you're fully engaged in creating, your body relaxes (loosening chest, deepening breath), and your hands move on their own (dropping shoulders). Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this sense of relaxation to your value of creating, without trying to control the critic's return.

Therapist Answer:
When your chest loosens, your breath deepens, and your hands just want to keep working, what's one thing you can commit to noticing in that moment – just for a breath, a heartbeat – before the critic rushes back, and see what happens?

Patient: I guess I could try to notice the quiet warmth in my belly and the tingle in my fingertips — the weight of the brush and the little scratch of paint on canvas — for just one breath. But when I do, a shameful, frustrated feeling pops up and tries to shove it away, so I get clumsy and pull back. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that trying to notice the quiet warmth and the physical sensations of creating brings up a shameful, frustrated feeling that tries to push it away. Core emotion is still anxiety. Goal: Connect this feeling to your value of creating, not despite the critic's voice, but because of it.

Therapist Answer:
When that shameful feeling pops up, what's one thing you can gently acknowledge about it – like noticing it's just a thought, or that it's connected to the critic's voice – and then what happens when you take that breath and try to notice the quiet warmth and the weight of the brush again, without trying to push the feeling away?

Patient: I guess I could try telling myself it's just a thought, that the critic's voice isn't the whole me. But when I do, a hot shame rushes up — my face burns, my hands get clumsy and I snatch the brush away; if I take that breath and notice the warmth and the weight it steadies me for one beat, then the shame claws back. I don't know, it's embarrassing and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified that trying to acknowledge the shameful feeling as "just a thought" triggers a hot shame response that claws back in. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Connect this cycle to your value of creating, not by trying to change it, but by noticing what's already happening when you're in that moment.

Therapist Answer:
What happens to your body when the shame claws back in, just for a beat, before it rushes back in again – is your chest tight, your breath shallow, your shoulders tensed?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I guess when the shame claws back my chest clamps, my breath goes shallow, and my shoulders pull up tight. My face gets hot and my hands fumble — it feels embarrassing and furious at the same time, like I want to curl up and hide. I don't know, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations that come up when shame claws back in – clamping chest, shallow breath, tensed shoulders, hot face, fumbling hands. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Connect these sensations to your value of creating, not as something to achieve, but as something that's already happening in your body.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your chest clamping tight – what happens to your breath when that happens, right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I don't know, I guess my breath just gets really shallow, like I'm holding it, then little quick gasps. My face heats up and this shame and frustration wells up and I clench my hands — it feels embarrassing and I freeze. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations that come up when shame claws back in – shallow breath, hot face, clenched hands. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice the pause in your breath when you freeze – what happens when you're holding it, just for a moment, before the shame rushes back in?

Therapist Answer:
When you're holding your breath, pause for a second... what's the sensation in your body, right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels like it's clamped down, my breath is almost stuck — little panicked gasps — and my shoulders hitch up. My hands go cold and I fumble with my ring, my face feels hot and ashamed, and I just want to hide. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the sensations of being stuck – chest clamped, breath almost stuck, panicked gasps, shoulders hitching up, hands cold, face hot, shame. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Connect this stuckness to your value of creating, not by trying to "fix" it, but by noticing what's already present when you're in this moment.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the feeling of your chest being clamped down – what's the sensation of that "clamping" right now, just beneath the surface of your awareness?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band low in my chest, a dull pressure that won't ease — like something's sitting on me. My breath gets tiny and quick, and my hands go fidgety and numb. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the sensation of the tight band – a dull pressure that won't ease. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice the physical sensation of your breath getting tiny and quick – what happens when you try to breathe into that tiny space, without trying to change it?

Therapist Answer:
When your breath gets tiny and quick, try to notice what happens to your body, just for a moment, without trying to push the breath out or change it. What's the sensation in your chest, or in your body, when you're holding that tiny breath?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band low in my chest, a dull pressure, and my breath gets tiny and quick so my shoulders hitch up. My hands go numb and I fumble my ring, then this hot shame and frustration wells up — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations again – the tight band, tiny breath, shoulders hitching up, numb hands. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice that the hot shame and frustration are trying to push you away from the tiny breath – what's the story you're telling yourself about those feelings right now?

Therapist Answer:
What's the thought that's trying to push the tiny breath away, right now?

Patient: I guess the thought is that I'm a failure — that they'll see how clumsy and useless I am, that I somehow messed up and don't deserve to be here. I don't know, it makes my face burn and I want to hide; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the thought that's trying to push the tiny breath away – "I'm a failure" – and it's tied to shame and self-criticism. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice what's already true about being in this moment, without judgment – what's actually happening with your body and breath?

Therapist Answer:
What's the sensation of your feet on the ground right now, without trying to change it or judge it?

Patient: I don't know... my feet feel kind of heavy and flat on the floor, like they're planted but numb at the edges, as if I'm stuck. It makes me feel stupid and hot with shame, like I should be moving but can't — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensation of your feet being heavy and numb – it's a clear indicator that you're stuck in this thought pattern. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice what's happening with your breath when you try to stay present with this sensation – what's the smallest thing you can notice about your breath?

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, right now. What's the shape of your breath, or the sensation of it touching your nostrils?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a thin, cool thread brushing my nostrils, barely there. My chest hardly lifts — the air feels trapped low — and as soon as I notice it that hot shame wells up and it tightens like something pressing down. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the sensation of your breath as a thin, cool thread – it's a subtle yet clear indicator of what's happening. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice the physical sensation of the hot shame pressing down – what's its texture, its weight, its location in your body?

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of the hot shame pressing down on your chest – is it a tight band, a weight, a heaviness? What's the sensation of that weight moving down into your body?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a tight band across my chest at first, then a heavy, lead-like weight that sinks down into my ribs and gut, making everything go quiet and my hands go clumsy. The shame wells up and makes my face hot and my breath shrink — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the sensation of the hot shame as a tight band, a heavy weight, and a physical contraction in your body – it's a clear indication of the shame's presence. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice what's happening with your body when the shame makes your face hot and your breath shrink – what's the smallest thing you can notice?

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your face getting hot – is it a warmth, a flush, a tingling? What's happening to your mouth, your lips, your tongue?

Patient: I don't know... it's this hot, prickly flush across my cheeks, like a sudden burn. My mouth goes dry, my lips feel tight and my tongue feels thick so words catch — I swallow and everything feels stuck and clumsy. It makes me ashamed and annoyed with myself, and I just want to hide; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations of the hot shame as a prickly flush, dry mouth, tight lips, and thick tongue – it's a clear picture of how the shame is affecting your body. Core emotion is still shame. Goal: Notice what's happening with your body when you try to swallow and speak – what's the smallest thing you can notice?

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your throat when you swallow – is it a tightness, a lump, a heaviness? What happens to your voice when you try to speak?

Patient: I don't know... when I swallow it's like a lump that won't move, a tightness right at the front of my throat, like something's stuck there. My voice goes small and shaky, like it wants to come out but the words get caught, and then shame and frustration wash over me and my hands fumble — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of shame washing over you – is it a warmth, a heaviness, a pressure? What's happening to your body right now, physically?

Patient: I don't know... it's like a hot, heavy tide — more like a pressure that settles across my chest and sinks into my gut. My breath gets tiny and quick, my shoulders pull up, my face flushes, my hands fumble with my ring and my throat feels full so my voice goes small, and then this frustrated shame makes me want to hide. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?
