--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an accountant who just started a pretty demanding new role, and lately I've been throwing myself into hobbies to avoid the stress of adjusting. I keep filling my afternoons with gardening, woodworking, and mindless TV so I don't have to think about how overwhelmed I feel. I don't know, I guess I just don't like talking about this stuff.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using these hobbies as a way to temporarily escape from the stress of adjusting to your new role. Can you tell me more about what's lost when you're doing these activities - what is it about not thinking about your stress that you're getting from gardening, woodworking, and TV?

Patient: I don't know, I guess when I'm in the garden or in the shed it feels like I'm in control and not... swallowed up by the job stuff. It calms me down and makes the day feel less heavy. But I suppose I'm losing time I could use to actually sort things out—talk to my partner, catch up on paperwork, or even just sleep properly—and then I end up more behind. I don't know, it's just easier to keep busy than sit with the worry.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a sense of relief and a feeling of being in control when you're engaged in these activities. Can you think of what might happen if you made room for just a small amount of time to sit with the worry and uncertainty, rather than trying to distract yourself with gardening or TV? What would that feel like?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it would feel... heavy, like everything I've been stuffing down would sort of bubble up. My chest would tighten and I'd feel guilty for not getting on with things, and I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it. Maybe, if I sat with it, it could ease a little after a while, but it's scary to try.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to consider sitting with those feelings. Would it be okay if you tried a small experiment, just for a minute or two, to see what happens when you allow yourself to feel the weight of uncertainty, rather than trying to distract yourself? Maybe we could start with just noticing the sensation in your chest right now, without trying to do anything about it, just observe it.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'm nervous about it, but okay, I'll try for a minute. Right now my chest feels tight, like a band, and my breathing's a bit shallow and quick. I don't really like this — can we go slowly?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a slow, deep breath in together, and as you exhale, allow your chest to release a little bit. Take another deep breath in, and this time, when you exhale, I'd like you to notice where the sensation of the band around your chest feels. Is it in your chest, your neck, or somewhere else?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's mostly across my chest and creeping up into my throat a bit. It feels tight and makes me want to fidget or get up and do something to avoid it. Can we... go really slowly? This is a bit much.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to pause for a moment, and when you're ready, we can continue. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, take a deep breath out, and just be with the sensation for a moment. If it's okay, I'll just wait here with you in silence for a bit.

Patient: I don't know, I guess sitting with it made the tightness worse at first—my hands started fidgeting like I wanted to get up and do something, maybe putter in the shed or make tea. After a little while it felt a tiny bit less sharp, but I'm still anxious and guilty about not doing the things I should. Can we keep going really slowly? I'm feeling a bit shaky and I don't want to rush this.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body was responding to the discomfort, but then it did start to release a bit. Now that it's a bit less sharp, I'd like to explore what's still lingering. Can you think of one thing, just one thing, that you could do, right now, that would feel like taking small steps towards tackling the things you feel guilty about, rather than avoiding them?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could set a ten-minute timer and just sort one bit of paperwork or answer one email—something tiny so it doesn't feel like I'm committing to fixing everything. It makes me nervous thinking about it, like it'll open a floodgate, so can we keep going really slowly?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Setting a timer and taking a tiny step feels like a manageable commitment. Would it be okay if we start with that tiny step, and after the timer goes off, we can pause again, and then you can decide what to do next?

Patient: I don't know, I guess... okay, I'll do it. I'll set a ten-minute timer and try to answer one email — I'm nervous it'll open a floodgate, so could you stay with me while I do it and check in when the timer goes off? Can we keep going really slowly afterward?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll be here with you, and we can pause whenever you need to. Let's focus on getting through the next minute, and when the timer goes off, we'll check in together. When you're ready, you can take a deep breath in and start checking your email.

Patient: Okay. Deep breath... timer's on. I'm opening my inbox now. I don't know, I guess my hands are a bit shaky and I keep wanting to get up and putter in the shed instead. There's an email from HR about benefits—that feels small, so I'll try that one first. Can you just remind me to breathe and check in when the timer goes off? I'm nervous it'll open a floodgate.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're being gentle with yourself, acknowledging your nervousness and taking a small step. You're opening the email, and taking a deep breath in... when you're ready, we can check in again. I'm here with you, and I'll remind you to breathe whenever you need it.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... I'm looking at it now — it's about benefits and an enrollment deadline. My hands are still a bit shaky but I'm trying to type a short reply just to acknowledge it. Can you remind me to breathe and stay with me until the timer goes off? I'm nervous it'll open a floodgate.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're taking care of that small step, and your hands are still shaking a bit. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit. I'm here with you, and I'll remind you to breathe when the timer goes off. You're typing your reply...

Patient: I don't know, I guess I sent a short acknowledgement — just a quick "Thanks, I'll review and enroll" so it didn't feel like opening everything. My hands are a bit steadier and my breathing's calmer, but my chest is still tight. There's about a minute left on the timer — can you stay with me and remind me to take another slow breath when it goes off? I'm nervous it'll open a floodgate.

Therapist Answer:
You took a small step and acknowledged the email. Your hands feel steadier, and your breathing is calmer. Take another deep breath in... and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your chest without trying to change it. I'm here with you, and we've got about 30 seconds left on the timer.

Patient: I don't know, I guess it’s a kind of dull, heavy pressure — my breathing’s a bit slower but the band’s still there. Can we just... stay with this for a bit when the timer goes off? I don’t want to rush into anything else right now.

Therapist Answer:
We've made it through the timer. I'm here with you, and we can stay with the sensation of the pressure in your chest. Let's just notice it, without trying to change it or do anything about it, for a moment.

Patient: I don't know, I guess the pressure's still there — dull and kind of heavy, like everything's a bit flat. My attention's dragging and it's hard to do more than breathe. Can we just sit with it a little longer? I don't really know where to go from here.

Therapist Answer:
We can just be with the pressure and the feeling of your attention dragging, without trying to push through or get beyond it. Let's just rest in this moment, noticing what's here, without judgment or trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... okay, I'll try to stay with it a bit longer. My head keeps drifting to the shed and the list of things I should be doing, but the pressure's dull and constant and it makes everything feel like too much. Can we just sit here for a while and not rush into anything?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pressure is feeling overwhelming and making it hard to focus on anything else. We can just sit here, noticing the pressure and the thoughts that are drifting in, without judgment. Let's just be with this feeling of overwhelm, and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know, I guess it just feels heavy and flat — like everything's coated in fog and I don't have the energy to push through it. My mind keeps skittering to the shed and the never-ending list, but I don't want to get up and do any of it. Can we just sit with this for a while longer? I don't really like talking about it, so... could you stay with me?

Therapist Answer:
You're feeling really stuck and disconnected from your energy. I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you. Let's just rest in the silence, without trying to push through or change anything. We can just be with the heaviness and the fog, and see what happens. Your body and mind can take the time to relax and unwind.

Patient: I don't know, I guess my words feel heavy and it's all a bit much to keep up with. The pressure's still there and I don't have the energy to do anything else right now. Can we just sit with this a little longer? I don't really want to talk, but could you stay with me?

You're feeling really drained and overwhelmed. I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you. We can just be with the heaviness and the pressure, without needing to talk or do anything. Your body and mind can just rest and relax, and we can just sit with it.

Patient: I don't know, I guess my words are getting fuzzy and it's getting harder to keep going. I don't really want to talk much—can we just sit quietly for a while and not rush into anything? Maybe later I can try another small thing, but not right now.

Therapist Answer:
We're sitting together in silence, and I'm here with you. No need to do anything or say anything. Just be with the quiet, and let yourself relax and unwind.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... okay. This quiet feels heavy but a little less sharp, my thoughts keep skittering to the list—shed, paperwork—but I can't make myself move. My words are fuzzy and it's a lot to keep up with, so can we just sit like this a bit longer? Please stay with me.

Therapist Answer:
You're still resting in the quiet, and it's feeling a bit more manageable than before. Your thoughts are still present, but they seem to be drifting away from the need to act. We can just sit together, and I'll stay with you, whenever you need me to. No need to rush or do anything.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... this quiet helps a bit — the tightness in my chest is a little less, but my head's all foggy and everything feels like too much effort. Can we just sit like this a while longer? I'm not ready to start on the list or do anything else yet.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... that actually helps a bit — the tightness's softer and my head's a little less foggy, but everything still feels heavy. Can we just stay like this a while longer? I don't want to start on the shed or the paperwork yet.
