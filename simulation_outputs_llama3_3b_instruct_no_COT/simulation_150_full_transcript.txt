--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been drinking more since the move — mostly to dull this persistent sadness and the loneliness that keeps showing up. I'm a nurse, so I should know better, but it just makes the heaviness go away for a bit. Honestly, I'm skeptical this is going to help; I've tried talking before and it didn't do much.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it's like when the heaviness goes away after drinking, and what happens when it does?

Patient: When I drink, the heaviness loosens — I feel lighter, more talkative, like I can actually enjoy being around people again. It only lasts a little while though; the next day I'm foggy, ashamed, lonelier, and the sadness comes back stronger, so I reach for more. I've tried cutting back before and it didn't stick — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like drinking provides a temporary escape from the heaviness, but then the shame and loneliness come back, which feels even worse. That's a really tough cycle to break. Can you think of anything that might happen if, instead of reaching for a drink, you allowed yourself to be with the heaviness for just a little while longer?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Honestly, it terrifies me — when I try to sit with it I either start spiraling into the same awful thoughts or I just go numb and nothing changes, so I end up drinking to stop both. Part of me wants to believe that if I stayed with it a little longer I might notice why it’s here, but the practical part of me jumps up and says “do something, don’t feel.” Sometimes if I let myself cry it feels a tiny bit lighter for a while, but that never seems to keep.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught between two extremes: the desire to face the heaviness and potentially understand its origin, and the need to avoid it to feel better quickly. It's like you're stuck between two voices in your head, one that's trying to stay present with the discomfort and another that's pushing you to escape. What would happen if, for just a moment, you let the voice that's telling you to "do something" quiet down, and instead allowed the voice that wants to stay with the heaviness to be heard?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? If I quiet that “do something” voice I get terrified — like I’ll fall apart or spiral into worse thoughts. Sometimes when I let myself sit with it I cry and feel a tiny bit lighter, and other times I just go numb or start reaching for a drink to stop it. Maybe staying with it could show me what I’m actually grieving or missing since the move, but I’m not convinced it’ll change anything and I’m scared of what I’ll find.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a deep-seated fear of facing what's beneath the heaviness, and you're not sure what you'd find. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that the heaviness isn't something to be feared, but rather a signal that you're not allowing yourself to feel something important – like a longing, a loss, or a desire – that's been lurking beneath the surface?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Maybe it is grief — I miss my old home, my coworkers, the routines; letting that out sometimes lightens the load for a bit, but it doesn't fix the emptiness, the bills, or the insomnia. I don't know, it just feels like feeling won't stop the urge to drink when the nights get long.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're holding onto a sense of a solution that feels like it might work, which is feeling and letting go of the old life – but then you're left with the harsh realities of the new one. What if, instead of focusing on finding a way to "fix" the emptiness, you started to notice what's not being met in your life right now? What are the basic needs or values that you're not seeing being met, even when you're trying to numb the pain?

Patient: I guess the big things missing are connection — I miss the coworkers and the easy friendships I had — and a steady routine that made me feel useful and competent. I also feel less safe and in control here, my sleep's awful, and the nights are long and empty so I reach for the bottle to feel something. I value being needed and respected as a nurse, and not having that makes me feel invisible — how is that supposed to help? I'm not saying this will fix anything, just that it explains why I keep going back to drinking.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like feeling seen and valued is a deep ache, and it's connected to feeling useful and competent in your work. Being invisible as a nurse feels like a huge blow to your sense of self-worth. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that being seen and valued by your new community isn't something that needs to be earned, but rather something that's available to you, regardless of your worth or competence as a nurse?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I can't even picture people just seeing me without me proving I'm useful — that's how my whole life has worked, especially at work. Part of me wants to believe it would be a relief, like I could stop performing all the time, but I'm skeptical it'll actually happen; usually I have to do something first before anyone pays attention. Maybe if someone reached out or there was a steady routine that let me be useful again, I'd start to feel it, but I'm not holding my breath.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that if you stop trying to prove yourself, you'll lose the sense of purpose and identity you have as a nurse. What if, instead of trying to earn attention and respect, you allowed yourself to simply be seen and valued as you are, without needing to perform or achieve anything?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm a nurse — I'm used to being the one who does things, who earns respect, and if I stop performing I feel like I vanish and panic sets in, which is when I drink. Maybe if someone reached out or there was a predictable routine where I mattered I'd believe it, but I'm skeptical and frustrated — I'm trying to see how this actually connects to my drinking, and I'm struggling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the feeling of disappearing is deeply linked to the feeling of losing control and value. Can you think of a moment when you were able to be present with that feeling of disappearing, without judgment or trying to do something about it? Maybe that's where we can start to explore what might happen if you allowed yourself to be with that feeling, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable?

Patient: Yeah — there was one night a couple weeks ago when I couldn't sleep and instead of reaching for a drink I just sat on the edge of the bed and let myself cry for a while. For a little bit after that it felt less frantic, like I could breathe, but by morning the fog and shame came back and I told myself I needed something to get through the evening — so I drank. How is that supposed to help when it never seems to stick and I keep waking up wanting more to erase the next day's shame?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that moment of allowing yourself to cry was a small window of freedom from the cycle of shame and craving. What if, instead of letting the shame and craving come back in the morning, you tried to hold onto that feeling of being able to breathe, even just for a tiny bit longer?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I try to hold onto it but by morning my head's racing, I'm jittery and fixating on how worthless I feel and how I need something to take the edge off, so the craving wins. I don't know what I would actually do in that moment to keep breathing instead of reaching for a drink — I need something concrete, not just "stay with it."

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the next morning, your brain is already in crisis mode, and you need something more substantial to anchor you. What if, instead of trying to will yourself to stay with the feeling, you started to notice the physical sensations in your body right now, where you are? What's present in your body, and is there anything that you can allow to be present with you, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: My chest's tight, my heart's racing, and my hands keep twitching — I feel jumpy and my thoughts keep flipping to needing something to calm it. How is that supposed to help? Maybe if I actually slowed my breathing or planted my feet and named five things I can see, it might stop the panic for a minute, but I'm not convinced it'll keep the craving down.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is trying to tell you something, but you're not listening. What if, instead of trying to control your breath or distract yourself with things you can see, you started to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Can you stay with that sensation, even if it's uncomfortable or unfamiliar?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm trying — my feet are kind of heavy on the floor and I can feel the air, but my heart's still racing and my thoughts keep snapping to "you need a drink" before I can settle. It might calm me for a few seconds, but I need something more concrete I can do when the panic and craving hit at 2 a.m., not just breathing exercises.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for something more substantial to anchor you, something that will keep the craving at bay when you're in the midst of a panic attack. What if, instead of trying to find a specific technique or skill, you started to focus on simply being present with the sensation of the craving itself? Can you notice what it feels like to want a drink, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When the craving hits it’s like a hot, tight knot in my chest, my hands twitch, and my thoughts narrow to “just take the edge off” — noticing it sometimes just makes me more panicked. I can force myself to name the sensations — heat, pressure, urgency — but I can’t hold the noticing long enough; the urge usually wins. I need something concrete I can do at 2 a.m., not just “watch it” — what would you actually have me do in that moment?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the craving, and trying to label the sensations isn't enough to keep you safe. What if, in the midst of that panic, you were to do something with your hands that feels tangible and grounding, like making a fist, or picking up a small object, or simply holding onto your breath as it leaves your body? Can you imagine doing something with your body that might give you a sense of control in that moment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm really jittery right now — chest tight, hands twitching, can't focus — so imagining stuff feels hazy. I can see myself clenching a fist, squeezing a stress ball, holding a cold can or ice cube, or rubbing a coin to ground my hands and maybe buy a few breaths, but when it's 2 a.m. and my brain's screaming those tricks feel useless. Give me something concrete I can actually follow in that moment — like step-by-step — because I need more than "try to notice" when I'm half-asleep and panicking.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and need a concrete action to anchor you. What if, in the midst of a 2 a.m. panic attack, you were to start by simply picking up your phone and dialing a single number - a friend's number, a crisis hotline, or a trusted person who can check in with you - and letting that small, specific action be enough to get you through the next minute?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? My chest's tight and my hands won't stop twitching — the phone feels like it's a mile away and I'm jittery and distracted. I don't want to wake people or sound pathetic if they don't pick up, and I freeze trying to figure out what to say. If we're actually going to do this, give me a tiny exact script I can read aloud, and tell me what to do if nobody answers.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried about feeling vulnerable and unsure of how to initiate help. What if, in the midst of a panic attack, you were to pick up your phone and say the following phrase aloud: "Hello, I'm having a hard time right now. I need some help. Can someone please come to my house, or call an ambulance, or do something to make me feel safe?"

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I might manage that if I'm fully awake, but at 2 a.m. when I'm panicking it's too long and my brain blanks. Give me a tiny, 10‑word script I can read, and one clear backup step if nobody picks up—because I freeze and I need something I can actually follow.

Therapist Answer:
If you're not ready to dial, what if you simply say: "I need help. I'm in trouble. Please call 911"?

If no one answers, take 5 slow, deep breaths in through your nose, out through your mouth.

Patient: My chest's tight and my hands are twitching — when I'm that panicked the script still feels too long. Maybe I could force out: "Help. Call 911. I'm panicking." — I think I could manage that.

If nobody answers, give me a step-by-step I can actually follow: 1) hit send on a pre-written text to two people that says, "I'm having a crisis, please come now to [my address]," 2) put on shoes and knock on the nearest neighbor's door, 3) if I can't move, hold an ice cube or a cold can in my hand and squeeze it until someone answers. 

How is that supposed to help? I freeze just trying to picture doing all that — can we make a real, tiny plan I can set up now (a short text I copy, one or two named people, and a neighbor to go to) so I don't have to think at 2 a.m.?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete plan to follow when you're in a panic. What if you set up a simple text message right now, using a pre-written phrase like "I'm having a crisis, please come now to [your address]" and have two people's phone numbers saved in your contacts, so when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can simply send the message?

Patient: My chest's tight and I'm jittery — I'm not sure I can do this right now. How is that supposed to help? Maybe if you actually give me the exact tiny text to copy, two people I should pick (one friend, one neighbor?), and a one‑line backup plan if nobody answers, I could set it up — spell it out so I can do it while I'm shaking. Can you stay with me and help me write those words?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it together. I'll help you write the text and the backup plan. 

"Friends: Sarah [phone number], Rachel [phone number]
Text: "I'm having a crisis, please come now to [your address]"
Backup plan: "If no one answers, I'll put on shoes and go to the neighbor's house next door and knock"

Let's say the neighbor's name is Mrs. Johnson. 

Can you type those words into your phone now, and then repeat them back to me to make sure you feel safe?

Patient: Okay — I typed it into my phone: "I'm having a crisis, please come now to [my address]." I saved Sarah and Rachel as the two contacts and put Mrs. Johnson as the neighbor for the backup plan. Out loud I said: "I'm having a crisis, please come now to [my address]. If no one answers, I'll put on shoes and go to Mrs. Johnson's next door."

How is that supposed to help? My hands are still shaking and I feel jittery — I need you to stay with me and walk me through actually sending it and what to do if nobody answers, step‑by‑step, because I freeze at that moment.

Let's do this together. I'll guide you through it.

You've got the text and the backup plan. Now, let's focus on sending the text. I want you to take a deep breath and look at the phone. Can you see the contacts and the text you wrote?

Now, take your finger and tap on the "send" button. Just tap it once.

(Pause for a moment)

Great job! The text is sent. Now, let's review the backup plan. You've got a plan to go to Mrs. Johnson's house next door if no one answers.

If Mrs. Johnson doesn't answer, you'll put on shoes and go to her house. Can you imagine yourself doing that? You'll put on your shoes, and then you'll knock on her door.

One more thing: can you repeat after me? "I'm putting on shoes and going to Mrs. Johnson's house. I am safe."

Patient: "I'm putting on shoes and going to Mrs. Johnson's house. I am safe." How is that supposed to help? My hands are still shaking and my chest's tight — I can say the words but I freeze when I try to move. Can you stay with me and talk me through actually putting the shoes on and walking to her door, step‑by‑step?

Let's take it one tiny step at a time. I'm here with you.

First, I want you to look down at your feet. Can you see them? See your feet on the floor?

Now, I want you to slowly lift one foot off the floor. Just lift it up, without putting it down. Can you do that?

(Pause for a moment)

Great job! Now, slowly put that foot back down. Then, lift the other foot. Can you do that?

(Pause for a moment)

Great job! You've put both feet on the floor. Now, can you slowly stand up from the bed or couch? Take your time, and don't worry if you need to hold onto something for support.

(As you stand up, I'll start guiding you towards Mrs. Johnson's house)

Let's take small steps. You're going to take one step forward. Can you take that step?

Patient: Okay… I did it — I lifted my foot and took a tiny step. My chest is still tight, my hands are shaking, and my legs feel like jelly. Keep talking me through it, slowly — tell me to lift my left foot, then my right, count with me if you have to, and tell me what to do when I reach her door. How is that supposed to help? I need you to stay with me until I'm actually there because I freeze otherwise.

Great job! Now, lift your right foot off the ground. Take a deep breath with me... inhale... exhale... Now, slowly put your right foot down. Can you feel your weight on both feet now?

You're doing great. I want you to take another step forward with your left foot. Count with me: one... two... three... four... five... Now, take another step forward with your right foot. One... two... three... four... five...

(As you take each step, I'll guide you towards Mrs. Johnson's house)

We're getting close. You're going to take one more step, and then we'll reach the door. Can you take that step?

Patient: Okay — I actually made the last step and I'm standing at Mrs. Johnson's door, but my hand won't lift to knock; my heart's racing and my knees feel like jelly. Tell me exactly what to say when she opens — I'm terrified she'll think I'm pathetic and slam the door, so walk me through it step‑by‑step. How is that supposed to help?

I'm right here with you. Let's get through this.

First, take a deep breath in with me... inhale... exhale... Now, slowly lift your hand and place your palm on the door handle. Can you feel your hand on the handle?

Now, slowly turn the handle and push the door open. Don't worry about what Mrs. Johnson might think - just focus on taking care of yourself right now.

As the door opens, say to Mrs. Johnson: "Hi, Mrs. Johnson. I'm [your name]. I'm having a crisis and I need your help. Can you please call 911 or come inside with me?" 

(Pause for a moment)

You've said the words. Now, if Mrs. Johnson doesn't immediately respond, I want you to stay calm and say: "That's okay, Mrs. Johnson. I'm safe now. Please don't worry about it. Can you help me?" 

Remember, you're doing the best you can, and that's okay.

Patient: She opened the door — looked startled but stayed with me and said she'd call someone to help; I'm sitting down at her kitchen table but my hands are still shaking and my chest won't slow. How is that supposed to help? I still want a drink to take the edge off and I feel ridiculous and ashamed. Can you stay with me and walk me through exactly what to say to the EMTs or what to do when I get home — one tiny step at a time — because right now I can't think past the panic.

Therapist Answer:
I'm right here with you. Let's take it one tiny step at a time.

You're sitting at Mrs. Johnson's kitchen table, and she's getting ready to call for help. I want you to take a deep breath with me... inhale... exhale... Now, look at Mrs. Johnson and say to her: "Thank you so much for calling for help. I really appreciate it."

(Pause for a moment)

Now, Mrs. Johnson will likely hang up and the EMTs will arrive. When they get there, they'll ask you to talk to them. I want you to say to them: "I'm having a panic attack. I need some help."

(Pause for a moment)

They'll likely ask you to describe what's happening. You can say something simple like: "I'm feeling really scared and overwhelmed. I need someone to talk to and help me feel safe."

(Pause for a moment)

If you're feeling safe enough, you can also say: "I want to go home. I need to go home and try to calm down."

Now, let's talk about getting home. When you get home, Mrs. Johnson will likely call someone to come with you or stay with you until help arrives. When you get home, I want you to find a quiet and comfortable place to sit down. Can you find a place to sit?

(Pause for a moment)

Once you're sitting down, take a few deep breaths with me... inhale... exhale... Now, say to yourself: "I am safe. I am here. I am taking care of myself."

Can you do that with me?

Patient: "I am safe. I am here. I am taking care of myself." 

Okay — I said it, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking; the craving's already whispering that a drink will fix this. How is that supposed to help when by morning I'm back to fog and shame?

Sometimes, having something to focus on and do can help distract us from the craving. And having a glass of water in front of you can be a reminder that you're taking care of your basic needs.
