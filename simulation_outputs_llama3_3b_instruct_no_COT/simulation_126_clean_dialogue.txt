Patient: I'm an artist in my late twenties and lately I've been avoiding get-togethers because social situations make my chest tighten and I start obsessing over every little thing I said. I mostly keep to myself and it's starting to strain friendships and work opportunities. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—how is talking about it supposed to fix any of that?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about how talking about this will help. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in a social situation and your chest tightens - what's the first thing that shows up for you?

Patient: The first thing is this rush of judgmental thoughts—like, "Did I say something dumb? Are they judging me?"—and my heart spikes, my breathing gets shallow and my chest tightens. Then I start replaying everything I said, scanning faces for signs they noticed, and I get this strong urge to leave before I mess up more. I've tried breathing exercises and talking myself down and it doesn't stick—how is just talking about it supposed to help with that?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is creating a really intense experience in the moment. Can you imagine being in a social situation where you're able to take a step back and simply notice the physical sensations in your body, without judgment, just as they are? Would you be willing to try to observe the tension in your chest, your shallow breathing, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice, but honestly—how is that supposed to help? When I try to focus on the tightness I just start replaying everything and judging myself for even paying attention; sometimes I slow my breathing for a moment and then the panic spikes back harder because I think I'm doing it wrong.

Therapist: It sounds like your attempt to observe the physical sensations gets caught up in the same cycle of judgment and replaying. Can you try to imagine that the thought "I'm doing it wrong" is just a thought, and that it doesn't have to be true - can you make room for the possibility that you're simply being present with your physical experience, without trying to change it or judge yourself for it?

Patient: I can kind of see the point, but honestly that "just a thought" line never sticks for me — it feels like a lead weight and labeling it becomes another thing to mess up. I've tried that kind of mindfulness before and it just turns into more self-criticism. How is noticing it actually supposed to make the chest tightness or the urge to bolt less real in the moment? Can you give a concrete example of how that would work when I'm already halfway to the door?

Therapist: It can be challenging to break the pattern of self-criticism. Can you try to imagine that when you notice the chest tightness, you simply acknowledge it, like "This is the physical sensation in my chest", and then ask yourself what would it be like to take one small step forward, say hello to the person waiting for you at the door, without letting the judgmental thoughts take over?

Patient: I can picture saying "this is the chest tightness," but that just becomes another thing to judge—like, "am I doing this right?" When I'm already halfway to the door my brain's yelling "leave" and I don't have time for gentle self-talk. What would actually make me stop bolting in those ten seconds—give me a concrete, doable step I can try right in the moment.

Therapist: It sounds like you need a more immediate solution. Can you try to pause for just one beat before reaching the door, and when you do, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, without trying to control your breathing or calm down - just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Okay, fine—I'll try pausing for a beat and taking that breath, but I'm not optimistic. When I do breathing stuff my brain just yells that I'm doing it wrong and the panic spikes harder. How is this different from the breathing exercises I've already tried that made things worse? If I actually do it and nothing changes, what's a tiny, concrete action I can do in those next ten seconds that doesn't become another thing to judge?

Therapist: It's possible that the pause and breathing isn't enough to interrupt the panic response in that moment. What if, instead of trying to control your breathing or calm down, you simply took a small step forward, like taking one step into the room, without trying to do anything else - just a tiny, tiny movement that acknowledges you're here and willing to engage, without adding any expectations or goals?

Patient: That feels like a tiny, almost meaningless trick — how is putting one foot in the room supposed to stop my brain from yelling "leave" two seconds later? I can try taking one step, but honestly in the past those little gestures just turn into another thing I beat myself up over. If I do manage the step, what’s the next tiny, concrete move that won’t become another thing to mess up?

Therapist: It sounds like the act of taking a step isn't enough to create a lasting shift. Can you try something even smaller, something that doesn't rely on willpower or self-control - like simply saying "hello" to the person waiting for you, without thinking about the outcome or judging yourself for it - just a simple acknowledgment of their presence?

Patient: I can force myself to say "hello," but the second it leaves my mouth I start scanning faces and replaying it, and it just becomes another thing to judge. How is that supposed to stop the flood of thoughts? If I do manage to say it, what's the next tiny, concrete move that won't immediately turn into something I beat myself up about?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the same cycle of evaluation and self-criticism. What if, right after saying "hello", you simply listen to the person's response, without trying to think about your own reaction or evaluate it - just focus on hearing their words, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: I wish that worked—I try to "just listen" but the second they start talking my head's already scripting my next thing and replaying my last awkward line. Right now I can barely focus, my chest tightens and I get the urge to leave mid-sentence. How is simply listening supposed to stop that spiral—what's one tiny, concrete thing I can do in that split second that won't just become another thing I beat myself up about?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is already primed for analysis and self-criticism. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of your body being in the present moment - not on the conversation, not on your thoughts, but on the physical sensation of your feet connecting with the floor?

Patient: I can try, but right now my mind's scattered and focusing on my feet just drags in more thoughts — my chest tightens and I get this urge to bolt. How is paying attention to my feet supposed to stop that loop? Give me one tiny, concrete thing I can do in that split second that won't just turn into another thing to mess up.

Therapist: It's like your mind is a superhighway with many lanes, and no matter where you try to focus, another thought jumps in. What if, in that split second, you simply allowed yourself to be present with the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change it or analyze it, just notice it as it is - not as a means to achieve something, but simply as it is?

Patient: I can try, but honestly right now my head's racing—my chest tightened and I feel this real urge to leave—focusing on my feet just becomes another thing to get wrong. How is that actually supposed to stop me from bolting? Give me one tiny, concrete next move I can do in that split second that won't just turn into another thing I beat myself up over if it doesn't work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're in a situation where you need a more immediate and concrete action. What if, in that split second, you simply took one tiny step forward - just one small step, one tiny movement - without thinking about the outcome or trying to control it, just a small, automatic movement?

Patient: I guess I can try that one tiny step, but right now my chest's tight, my heart's racing and I can barely focus—my brain will probably still be screaming "leave" the second I move. How is that one step supposed to stop the panic, and if I do it, what's the very next tiny, concrete thing I can do that won't immediately become another thing I beat myself up over? I'm not convinced this won't just turn into more proof I'm doing it wrong.

Therapist: It's like the next step feels like a huge undertaking. What if, immediately after taking that one step, you allowed yourself to simply be where you are - in that exact spot, with your body moving forward, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to control anything - just the sensation of existing in that moment, as it is?

Patient: I can try to stay put, but right now I'm feeling really jittery and distracted—my chest's tightening and my head's racing. How is "just being" any different from the other stuff that turns into more self-criticism? Tell me one tiny, concrete thing I can actually do in that moment that won't immediately become another thing to fail at.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is really struggling to stay present. What if, in that moment, you simply looked up and made eye contact with the person waiting for you - just a brief, automatic glance, without trying to analyze it or control the interaction?

Patient: I guess I could try a quick glance, but making eye contact usually spikes my anxiety — my chest tightens and I feel exposed, like everyone can read me. I'm pretty jittery and distracted right now; if I actually manage to look up, what's one tiny thing I can do next that won't just turn into another thing I beat myself up over?

Therapist: It sounds like making eye contact is too overwhelming. What if, instead, you simply leaned forward, just a tiny bit, without thinking about it, without trying to control it, just a small physical adjustment?

Patient: I could try leaning forward a tiny bit, but right now I'm really jittery and my hands feel shaky—my chest's tight and I can barely focus. How is that supposed to stop the urge to bolt? I've tried those small movements before and it just turns into another thing I mess up—if I do lean, what's the very next tiny, concrete thing I can do that won't immediately become more proof I'm failing?

Therapist: It's like your whole body is on high alert. What if, right now, you simply allow yourself to stand still, without trying to do anything, without moving or changing your position, just exist in that moment, with your hands where they are, without judgment?

Patient: I can't just "be"—telling me that makes my chest tighten more and my mind starts screaming "leave," and right now I'm jittery and can't focus. Standing still feels like another instruction I'll probably fail at—how is that actually supposed to break the panic in the moment? If you want something concrete, give me one tiny physical thing I can do right now that won't just become another thing to judge.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to find a way to stay present. What if, in the next moment, you brought your attention to your breath - just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it, just observe it as it is?

Patient: How is just noticing my breath supposed to help? When I try that my head immediately starts judging each inhale and then I get more panicked—right now my chest's tight, I'm jittery and I can barely focus. Give me one tiny, concrete thing I can do in the next ten seconds that won't just become another thing to beat myself up over, and can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I can see that the instructions are feeling overwhelming. Let's take a step back. Can you just look at your hands, right now, without thinking about it, without trying to change anything - just notice what they look like, feel like, and are doing?

Patient: Okay—I'm looking. My hands are shaking a bit, fingers tense, nails a mess from over-picking. But even noticing them just turns into "don't shake, don't look weird" and I start criticizing myself—how is this supposed to help when it just becomes another thing to get wrong? I'm jittery and distracted right now, but I can try to stay with it if we slow the pace.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the self-criticism. Let's slow down even further. Can you simply acknowledge the sensation of your hands shaking, without judgment, without trying to change it - just notice it as it is, in this moment?

Patient: Okay—I can do that. My hands are shaking, fingers tense, nails chewed, palms a bit clammy. But even noticing it turns into "stop shaking" in my head and I start criticizing myself, so it just feeds the panic. I'm feeling more jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down? Give me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now that won't just become another thing I beat myself up over.

Therapist: Let's take it really slow. Can you simply say to yourself, "My hands are shaking"? Just say those words, without adding anything else, without judgment, without trying to change it - just acknowledge the fact that your hands are shaking, right now?

Patient: Okay—"My hands are shaking." I said it, but as soon as I do my brain snaps to "stop shaking" and I start judging myself harder; my heart's racing and I'm really distracted. Can we slow down—give me one tiny, concrete thing I can do right now that won't just turn into another thing I beat myself up about?

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. Can you say the words "My hands are shaking" again, and this time, say them very softly, almost to yourself, without thinking about it or trying to control it? Just focus on making the words feel like a gentle whisper in your mind.

Patient: Okay... "My hands are shaking." I said it softly, but my brain immediately flipped to "stop shaking" and the judgment kicked in—my heart's racing and I can't focus. Can we slow down? Give me one tiny, concrete thing I can do right now that won't just become another thing to beat myself up over.

Therapist: Let's go back to the beginning. Can you simply allow yourself to be with the sensation of your hands shaking, without trying to change it, without judging it, just... be with it, in this moment?

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to be with it. My hands are shaking, fingers tense and a bit clammy, but the second I notice it my brain snaps to "stop shaking" and I get harsher on myself. I'm really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down, and give me one tiny, concrete thing to do in this moment that won't just become another thing I beat myself up over?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting back to the familiar pattern. Can you try to look at the sensation of your hands shaking, and then... pause for just a very short moment, before something else happens? Just a pause, a tiny little pause, without thinking about what's happening or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay—I can do that. I look at my shaking hands and I get a tiny pause, like half a second, but in that pause my brain yells "leave" and my heart spikes and I get even more scattered. How is that little pause supposed to stop the spiral when it just gives my head more time to make things worse? I'm trying, but right now it feels pointless—what's the very next tiny thing to do in that half-second that won't just become more to beat myself up about?

Therapist: It sounds like the pause isn't working as you thought. Can you try something even smaller than a pause - can you simply allow your gaze to rest on the shaking hands for a brief moment, without looking away or focusing on anything else, just rest on the hands as they are?

Patient: I try to rest my gaze, but my eyes keep darting and I only hold it for maybe a blink before my head yells “leave” and my heart jumps. It just feels like giving my brain more time to spiral—how is this supposed to help when it just becomes another thing I fail at? If you want something concrete, tell me one tiny physical thing to do right now—like press my thumb and forefinger together or squeeze my palm—something simple I can do that doesn’t feel like a test. Can we slow the pace?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're failing again. Can you try something very gentle, very small - can you simply notice the sensation of your fingers touching, without trying to do anything with them, just simply noticing the contact between your thumb and forefinger?

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the contact between my thumb and forefinger, it's a faint pressure and my skin feels clammy. But even as I notice it my brain's already yelling at me and my chest tightens, so I don't see how this stops the urge to bolt. If you want something concrete, tell me one tiny physical move to do right now — like squeeze and hold for five seconds — that I can do without it becoming another thing I fail at. Can we please slow the pace?

Therapist: It sounds like the noticing is still getting caught up in self-criticism. Can you try a very simple physical action, just for a tiny moment - can you take a tiny breath in, and then exhale slowly, without trying to control the breath or change it, just allow it to happen?

Patient: Okay—I'll try. (breathes in, exhales slowly) My chest's still tight and my brain's already yelling "you're doing it wrong." How is that supposed to help when it just turns into more self-criticism, and if it doesn't work what's one tiny, concrete thing I can do right now that won't just become another thing to beat myself up about?
