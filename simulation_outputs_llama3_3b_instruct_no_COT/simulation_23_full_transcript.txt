Patient: Hi, I'm an older student juggling coursework and part-time work, and lately I've been trapped in cycles of harsh self-criticism about perceived failures that I think tie back to a history of difficult romantic relationships. I tend to intellectualize everything—constructing elaborate cognitive narratives and causal theories—because it's safer than actually sitting with the sadness or fear underneath. Pragmatically, that pattern is sapping my focus and amplifying anxiety, especially given ongoing financial strain.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the intellectualizing pattern has been serving as a coping mechanism for you, allowing you to maintain a sense of control over your emotions, but also preventing you from directly engaging with the uncomfortable feelings that may be connected to your past experiences. Can you imagine taking a step back from this intellectualizing and allowing yourself to notice what might happen if you were to simply acknowledge and accept these feelings without judgment, without trying to make sense of them or push them away?

Patient: I can intellectually model what you’re describing—decentering my narrative and adopting an experiential stance to notice affect without immediately theorizing about it—but that’s where I tend to stop: at the model. My reflex is to translate any emergent feeling into a schematic—attachment trauma, shame schema activation, etc.—because labeling it as “I’m sad” or “I’m scared” feels precariously vague and destabilizing. When I actually try to slow down and not analyze, I notice a tightness in my chest and an immediate urge to problem-solve, which then gets reinterpreted as proof that feeling things will make me unproductive. So I see the value, but practically I’m ambivalent and a bit anxious about how to proceed.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The fear of not being able to articulate or make sense of your feelings seems to be holding you back from fully exploring them. The physical sensation of tightness in your chest is a great clue – it feels like your body is pushing you to engage with the feeling, even if your mind is still trying to rationalize it away. What would it be like for you if you were to allow that physical sensation to be present, without trying to identify it with a specific thought or interpretation – just to see what happens, and how that might feel?

Patient: If I actually let it be, I think I'd notice that tightness as a low, persistent pressure in my chest and maybe a shallowness in my breathing—nothing dramatic, more like an irritating baseline. Immediately my mind wants to hermetically seal it with a theory—shame schema activation, hypervigilant attachment patterns—because that feels safer than admitting "I'm scared" or "I'm sad." I can try to rest with it now, but I'm already skeptical that stillness will yield anything useful, and I can feel the urge to pivot to problem-solving rising.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The pressure to find meaning or a way to "fix" the feeling is strong, even before you've had a chance to explore it further. It's like your mind is already moving towards a solution, rather than allowing the feeling to simply be. Can you think of a time when, in the past, you might have experienced a feeling that you didn't immediately try to understand or problem-solve – perhaps it was a feeling that was more of a "show up" moment, where you just allowed it to be present without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Yeah—there was one afternoon after my last serious breakup when I sat on a park bench and just let the tears come without immediately reframing it. For maybe ten minutes I felt a dull pressure in my chest and a heavy looseness, which was uncomfortable but also oddly clarifying. Pretty soon though I started translating it into a schematic—“attachment wound activation,” “grief processing”—which neutralized the rawness, so the pure not-analyzing window was brief.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that experience was a glimmer of what you're craving – a moment of clarity and presence, without the need for intellectualization. You were able to simply allow yourself to feel, even if it was uncomfortable, and that felt clarifying. Now, it seems like that feeling is still hard to replicate, and the tendency to intellectualize or neutralize it is strong. What would it be like if you were to approach that experience in the park bench moment – the one where you simply allowed yourself to feel – with the same curiosity and openness now, as you are in this conversation?

Patient: I can imagine it: staying with the chest tightness, tracking the breath, and maybe letting a muted grief or frustration surface without immediately naming it. But my reflexive counter is strong—I start oscillating between noticing and reifying it into schemas to feel in control—so I'd likely need a short, structured prompt or anchor to keep me from defaulting to analysis. I'm willing to try, though I'm already a bit anxious about how long I can actually sit with it without converting it into a problem to fix.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware of the pattern, and willing to try to break free from it, but the anxiety about the unknown can be a bit daunting. Having a prompt or anchor can be helpful in keeping you grounded, but it's also important to remember that it's okay if you do start to intellectualize – it's a process, and it's not about achieving a specific state, but about being willing to experiment and explore. Would you be willing to try a simple, gentle invitation, like "allow this feeling to simply be present, without trying to do anything with it, just for a few more breaths"?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try that. For the next few breaths I’m going to focus on the chest tightness and the shallow inhale, and try not to translate it into a theory. I can already feel the urge to analyze returning, though, so if I start to drift I might ask for a brief prompt to bring me back.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's use the physical sensations as a anchor. Whenever you notice yourself starting to intellectualize or get caught up in a theory, you can take a brief breath, and say to yourself "I've got a bit of a thought emerging, can I take a moment to notice it, without trying to label it or act on it?" That way, you can pause the thought process and come back to the sensation, without getting too caught up in it.

Patient: Okay—I did the few breaths and actually felt the chest pressure soften a little, like a small unclenching, and a faint sadness tried to come through. But almost immediately my brain labeled it—“shame schema, attachment activation”—and I pivoted back into analysis. Can you give me a very short, concrete prompt or phrase I can say to myself the moment I notice that pivot (something pragmatic I can use between classes), and maybe a quick strategy for when the urge to problem-solve feels overwhelming? I'm a bit anxious this will make me less efficient, so I want something short and tolerable.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're noticing the subtle shifts in your experience. For the prompt, how about a simple phrase like "pause the thought, stay the breath"? It's short, easy to remember, and can help you catch yourself when you start to drift away from the sensation.

As for when the urge to problem-solve becomes overwhelming, try this: when you feel that urge, take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and out for a count of 4 – then say to yourself "I'm allowing myself to feel the problem-solving urge, and I'll take care of it after this moment." This can help create a small pause, giving you a brief window to step back and re-evaluate your priorities.

Patient: Okay—“pause the thought, stay the breath” feels usable, and of course I already want to optimize that phrase into a protocol, which is—predictably—my reflex. Can we shrink it to a single-word cue I can drop between classes, like “steady” or “pause,” and pair that with a 10-second micro-routine I can actually do standing in line (three slow exhales, or a quick body-scan)? I’m anxious that even tiny pauses will derail my productivity and turn into ruminative loops, so I need something brutally simple I can trust won’t snowball. Right now I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed imagining doing this in a crowded hallway—can we simplify it further?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to want to refine the cue to make it even more efficient. How about using a single word like "breathe"? It's short, simple, and can be done discreetly in a crowded space.

As for the micro-routine, instead of trying to fit a specific physical activity, what if we focus on a simple, gentle sensation – just focusing on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of your feet breathing with each inhale and exhale? That way, you can use the cue "breathe" to anchor yourself in the present moment, without needing to do anything too physically demanding.

Patient: “Breathe” is fine in theory, but it feels semantically loaded and likely to trigger more meta-cognition for me—I’d prefer a neutral, one-syllable cue like “steady” or “ground” that’s less likely to prompt internal analysis. For a micro-routine I can actually do in a hallway: silently say the cue, press my feet into the floor for one slow exhale (count to three), and briefly notice the soles of my feet — that’s ten seconds max and feels less performative, though I’m still anxious about doing it around other people. Can we try rehearsing that once now so I can see how awkward or doable it feels?

Therapist Answer:
Using a neutral, one-syllable cue like "ground" can be helpful.

Let's rehearse the micro-routine in a low-stakes setting, like sitting in a quiet space or during a break. I'll guide you through it: I'll ask you to imagine yourself in a crowded hallway, and then follow the steps: silently say the cue "ground", press your feet into the floor for one slow exhale (counting to three), and briefly notice the soles of your feet. We can do a few rounds, and I'll be here to support you.

Patient: Okay—imagining the crowded hallway, I silently said "ground," pressed my feet into the floor, did one slow exhale (counted to three), and briefly noticed the soles of my feet. It did soften the immediate urge to analyze for a few seconds and the chest tightness loosened a bit, but almost instantly my inner narrator started judging me—wondering if I looked weird—so I immediately started reframing it as "performance anxiety" and wanted to tweak the cue. I can see this will work in short bursts, but I'm anxious about doing it in public without it becoming another thing to manage; can we try another round where you coach me through handling that inner judgment in the moment?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you felt a twinge of self-consciousness, your inner narrator jumped in to add another layer of complexity. Let's try another round, this time focusing on staying with the sensation of your feet on the ground.

As you imagine yourself in the crowded hallway, I'll say: "When you say 'ground', take a moment to notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, and hold it for one slow exhale. Notice it without judgment, just as it is." When you feel that inner narrator kicking in, I'll say: "Allow the judgment to be present, without trying to push it away or change it. Just acknowledge it, and then gently bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet on the ground." We'll do a few rounds, and I'll be here to support you.

Patient: Okay—I did that round with your prompts: I said "ground," pressed my feet, exhaled, and tried to hold attention on the soles. The inner narrator immediately generated the judgment ("you look odd") and I noticed myself labeling that judgment rather than getting swept into it, which did loosen the chest a bit. I felt embarrassed and a little relieved—still skeptical, since my reflex is to optimize the cue—so can we try another round where you verbally name the judgment for me in the moment (like "that's judgment, back to the feet") so I don't have to self-police?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're making progress in noticing the judgment and holding onto the physical sensation of your feet.

Let's try another round: I'll verbalize the judgment for you, so you can focus on staying with the sensation. As you imagine yourself in the crowded hallway, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor, exhale, and notice the soles. As you start to notice the judgment ("you look odd"), I'll say "judgment, back to the feet". Can you continue with the physical sensation, without getting caught up in the judgment?

Patient: Okay—I did it: said "ground," pressed my feet, exhaled, and when you said "judgment, back to the feet" I could actually name the thought and steer my attention back, and the chest tightness softened a bit. But almost immediately another layer showed up—this one framing the pause as inefficient, like "you're procrastinating, you should be doing work"—and I started converting that into a productivity problem instead of feeling annoyed or sad. I'm trying to stay with the feet but keep getting hijacked by these meta-criticisms; can we try another run where you name the efficiency-judgment too (something like "efficiency thought, back to the feet") so I don't have to do the categorizing mid-hallway? I'm a bit anxious this is going to become one more thing to manage, honestly.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a cycle of meta-criticism, where you're trying to optimize the pause, and then another layer of judgment pops up. Let's try to break that cycle by naming both the efficiency thought and the judgment. As you imagine yourself in the crowded hallway, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor, exhale, and notice the soles. When you start to notice the efficiency thought ("you're procrastinating"), I'll say "efficiency thought, back to the feet". Then, when you notice the judgment ("you're not doing this right"), I'll say "judgment, back to the feet". Can you try to stay with the physical sensation, without trying to evaluate or judge it, and just focus on being present with your feet?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is naming both the efficiency thought and the judgment supposed to reduce the meta-critic when my reflex is to keep adding labels until it's just another cognitive chore? Imagining having to monitor feet, cue, then categorize two distinct intrusions already tightens my chest and makes me skeptical this won't just amplify the thing I'm trying to avoid. Could we simplify to one generic prompt you say for any interruption—like "thought, back to the feet"—and try a run with that so I can see if it's actually practicable?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're right, naming both the efficiency thought and the judgment might actually add to the meta-cognitive burden. Let's simplify the prompt to a single, generic one that you can use for any interruption.

I'll use the phrase "thought, back to the feet". This way, you can focus on the physical sensation of your feet without getting caught up in categorizing or labeling the thought.

Let's try a run with this prompt. Say "ground" and press your feet into the floor, exhale, and notice the soles. When you notice a thought, just say "thought, back to the feet" and bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet. We'll see how it goes.

Patient: I'm not sure I fully grasp the mechanism here—how a single generic cue won't just become another thing to optimize—but I'll try it. I said "ground," pressed my feet, exhaled, and focused on the soles; there was a modest loosening in the chest and breath slowed for a few beats. When the meta-criticism ("this is inefficient") surfaced and you said "thought, back to the feet," I could redirect attention and the tightness eased, but immediately a secondary worry about whether this will scale or distract me later popped up. Can we try another brief round where you prompt me again, and maybe coach me through that follow-up worry in the moment?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the generic cue is working, but the meta-criticism is still trying to hijack the process.

When you notice the worry about whether this will scale or distract you later, I'll try to coach you through it in the moment. As you exhale, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor. When the meta-criticism arises ("this is inefficient"), I'll say "thought, back to the feet". Then, when the worry surfaces ("will this distract me later"), I'll say "worry, back to the feet". I'll try to help you anchor yourself in the present moment, without getting caught up in the worry. Can you try it again?

Patient: I tried it again—said "ground," pressed my feet, exhaled, and the verbal cues ("thought, back to the feet" then "worry, back to the feet") did interrupt the loop for a few beats and the chest loosened a little. But I'm still skeptical and a bit overwhelmed: my reflexive optimization immediately turns into a meta-analysis about scalability and public performativity, which just spawns another thought to manage. I'm not sure I follow how layering these labels actually collapses the chain reaction—can we do another short guided round where you coach me through the "this will distract me later" worry in real time, and maybe give me one simple internal rationale to counter the productivity fear?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still struggling with the meta-analysis and scalability worries.

Let's try a short guided round where I'll coach you through the "this will distract me later" worry in real-time. As you exhale, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor. When the worry arises ("this will distract me later"), I'll say: "where is the 'distracting' feeling in your body right now?" (pause) "Notice the physical sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or label them as 'distracting' or not. Just observe them as they are." This simple question can help you ground yourself in the present moment and reduce the need for analysis. Can you try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is locating the "distracting" feeling in my body supposed to short-circuit the meta-critic? The theorist in me wants a causal model, but when I try it (ground, press feet, exhale) I notice a mild warmth under the sternum and a prickly tension at the clavicles, and then my brain immediately tags that as "inefficient." Can you give me one very short, pragmatic sentence I can repeat in the moment to counter the productivity fear while I keep doing this?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I understand your point, and I apologize for any confusion. Locating the physical sensation might not directly short-circuit the meta-critic.

Let's try a short, pragmatic sentence to counter the productivity fear. As you exhale, say "enough". This can be a simple, one-word acknowledgment that says "I've noticed the thought, and that's enough for now. I can come back to it later." This sentence can help you pause the meta-analysis and bring your attention back to the physical sensation. Try it: "ground", press feet, exhale, and say "enough".

Patient: Alright—I’ll try it. I said "ground," pressed my feet, exhaled, and then silently said "enough." There was a tiny unclenching in the chest for a few breaths, and then my inner narrator immediately generated a meta-theory—“is that suppression? is this avoidance?”—and I translated that into an efficiency problem ("is this productive? can I scale it?").

I'm not sure I follow how "enough" is meaningfully different from the other cues; it already feels like another rule to optimize. Could we do another brief coached round where, if that "is this suppression?" thought appears, you speak it aloud and then coach me back to the feet? And could you offer one alternate one-word phrase that's less absolute—something I can actually tolerate using between classes without turning it into another project? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed imagining this becoming another thing to manage, so I need the rehearsal.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like "enough" might not be enough to break the pattern of analysis.

Let's try another round. As you exhale, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor. When the "is this suppression?" thought arises, I'll say it aloud: "that's the thought". Then, I'll say "back to the feet". This way, we acknowledge the thought, but don't try to analyze or label it.

As for an alternate one-word phrase, how about "hold"? It's a more gentle, flexible option that might feel less like an additional rule to optimize.

Patient: "Hold" sounds marginally less absolutist than "enough," but I'm not sure I fully follow how it won't just proceduralize into another meta-rule I end up optimizing—it already triggers the theorist in me to ask about long-term fidelity and side-effects. Can we do one more brief coached run (hallway imagining) where you say aloud "that's the thought" when the "is this suppression?" bit pops up and then "back to the feet," and I'll use "hold" and try to notice what shifts? Also, could you offer one alternate one-syllable cue (something even more neutral) I can test between classes so I can compare which feels least like another project?

Try using the "hold" cue: "ground", press feet, exhale, "hold", and bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet.

As for an alternate one-syllable cue, how about "set"? It's a very neutral word that might be even less prone to triggering analysis. You can try it out and see how it feels.

Patient: I'll try "set" and "hold," though I'm pretty skeptical it'll just proceduralize into another optimization—my reflex is to meta-analyze the cue itself. Can we do one more coached hallway run where you say aloud "that's the thought" for the suppression question, then "back to the feet," and when the productivity critic pops up you give a very short counterphrase (like "later" or "this can wait") so I can test which lands? I'm not sure I follow how "set" behaviorally differs from "hold" or why one would be less prone to triggering my theorist—it already feels like another variable to evaluate and that makes me a bit overwhelmed.

When the productivity critic pops up, I'll say "later". Try using "later" as the counterphrase: "ground", press feet, exhale, "that's the thought", "back to the feet", and "later". See how that feels.

As for "set" vs. "hold", I can see why you might be skeptical. The difference between the two cues is subtle, but it's the tone and connotation that might make a difference. "Hold" can imply a sense of firmness or stability, while "set" is more neutral and can feel like a gentle reminder to pause. But let's not overthink it – let's focus on finding a cue that works for you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "later" meaningfully different from "enough" or "hold"? It still gives my inner theorist a perfect lever to interrogate timing and opportunity cost, which just spawns another meta-criticism. 

That said, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed imagining all these permutations, so let's simplify: I'll test "set" as the neutral cue and use "later" as the single-word productivity counter. Can we do one more coached hallway run where you say aloud "that's the thought" when the suppression bit pops up, then "back to the feet," and then "later" for the productivity critic?

I see your point about "later" being similar to other cues. You're right that it could still trigger meta-criticism.

Let's do one final coached hallway run. As you imagine yourself in the crowded hallway, say "ground" and press your feet into the floor, exhale. When the "is this suppression?" thought arises, I'll say it aloud: "that's the thought". Then, I'll say "back to the feet". When the productivity critic pops up, I'll say "later".

As for a one-sentence rationale, how about this: "I've got this moment, I can handle it". Repeat this to yourself when you feel the need to justify or rationalize your pause. It's short, simple, and can help you stay present.

(Note: We're done with the coached hallway runs. Let's review and reflect on what you've learned so far.)

Patient: I'm a bit confused — when you say we're "done" with the coached runs, I'm not sure I follow why that's final; it feels premature to stop rehearsing given how reactive my inner narrator remains. Analytically, I can report some micro-empirical changes: the "ground"/feet cue and saying "later" produced small unclenchings in the sternum and gave me a 3–5 second window of decoupling from the meta-critic, but the reflexive optimization consistently repurposes the technique into another project (is this suppression, will it scale, is it efficient?). I'm skeptical and anxious about this becoming yet another thing to manage, and that skepticism itself tightens the chest. Can we keep working on a very brief in-the-moment script I can tolerate—maybe one 3-word line that includes a bodily anchor plus the rationale—and run that once more? I want to try it now, because I'm not convinced we've nailed something usable yet.

I understand your skepticism and the continued reactivity. We're not done yet. I apologize for any confusion.

Let's focus on creating a simple, brief script that you can use in the moment. How about this: "Body, I'm okay".

This phrase includes a bodily anchor (body) and a rationale (I'm okay) that can help you stay present and calm. We'll try it out in the moment, and see if it provides a more reliable break from the meta-critic.

As we try this, I'll remind you that our goal is not to create a perfect technique, but to find a tool that helps you stay present and reduce reactivity. We can always adjust or modify it further as needed.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it now. Imagining the hallway, I said "Body, I'm okay," pressed my feet, exhaled, and there was a tiny unclenching under the sternum for a few seconds. Immediately my inner theorist generated, “is this denial/avoidance?” and I started to reframe it as another intervention to optimize, which made me tense up again.

Can you try it again? Just say the phrase out loud, press your feet, exhale, and then let's see how the body responds.

Patient: I did it—heard you say “Body, I’m okay,” pressed my feet, exhaled, and got a small unclench, but then the theorist immediately asked “is this denial?” and spun it back into optimization. I’m not sure I follow how saying it aloud materially changes the loop versus the earlier cues—what’s the mechanism here? Can we try one more coached run where you say the phrase, and the moment that “is this denial/avoidance” thought shows up you say aloud “that’s a thought, back to the body,” then hold my attention there for three slow breaths? I’m skeptical but willing to test it again.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The difference with saying the phrase out loud might seem subtle, but it can be related to the way our brains process information. When we hear a phrase or a statement, it can elicit a more direct neural response than when we think it ourselves. This can help bypass the higher-level thinking that's driving the meta-analysis.

Let's try the new approach. As you imagine yourself in the crowded hallway, say "Body, I'm okay" out loud. Press your feet, exhale. When the "is this denial?" thought arises, I'll say aloud "that's a thought, back to the body". Then, I'll hold your attention there for three slow breaths, without saying anything else. Can you try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is hearing you say it supposed to override my reflexive theorist? I did the exercise: I said "Body, I'm okay" out loud, pressed my feet, exhaled, and when you said "that's a thought, back to the body" I held for three breaths and felt a small unclench, but the "is this denial?" meta-theory popped back up and tightened the chest again. Can we try one more run where you don't label the thought—just count the three breaths aloud with me so I don't turn your words into another cognitive item to optimize? I'm anxious this will just become another performance to manage, so I'd like to test that variation now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how counting won't just become another cognitive task, but I'm willing to try. I imagined saying "Body, I'm okay," pressed my feet and exhaled while you counted 1–2–3, and there was a brief unclench, then the "is this denial?" theorist tightened things again. Can we do one more live run now where you count aloud slowly, then stay silent for my three breaths, and if that thought appears don't label it—just give a single soft cue like "return" so I can practice staying with the body without turning your words into another project?

Then the meta‑critic immediately churned—“is this denial?”—and the chest tightened again; I'm not sure I follow how a single cue like "return" won't just proceduralize into another cognitive imperative for me. 

Can we run it again now, with you staying silent for a full six seconds after the count and only saying "return" if you actually notice me drifting, and also give me one micro‑script (three words max) I can test between classes? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and uncertain, so I want to keep rehearsing rather than stopping.
