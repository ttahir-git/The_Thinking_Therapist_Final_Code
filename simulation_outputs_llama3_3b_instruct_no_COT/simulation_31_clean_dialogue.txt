Patient: I'm a social worker in my early fifties and lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and this lack of motivation that makes even small things feel impossible. I guess it started after I felt more isolated — I don't know, the loneliness just keeps creeping in and it's been affecting my relationship. I feel stuck and not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from your life right now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "the loneliness just keeps creeping in" and what that feels like for you, in your body and emotions?

Patient: I don't know... it's hard to put into words. Physically there's this heaviness in my chest and a constant fatigue, like I have no energy even for small things, and emotionally I feel numb a lot of the time and then suddenly tearful or irritable. I guess that makes me withdraw from my partner — I want to connect but I end up avoiding because I feel ashamed or like I’ll just make things worse.

Therapist: Those feelings of heaviness and numbness can be really tough to navigate. It sounds like you're feeling disconnected from your body and emotions, which is making it hard to reach out to your partner. Can you think of a small, tiny thing you'd like to do with your partner that you've been wanting to do, but haven't had the energy for? What would happen if you were to take that tiny step, even though it feels really difficult right now?

Patient: I don't know... maybe something tiny like making coffee together in the morning or sitting on the porch for ten minutes without talking. I guess if I did it I'd feel awkward and like he'd notice how off I am, and I'd probably pull away or start crying and ruin it. But I also wonder—awkward as that sounds—if it might remind us of something normal, though I'm scared it'll just make me feel worse.

Therapist: The thought of making coffee or sitting together in silence can feel like a vulnerability, and the fear of being judged or falling apart is understandable. It sounds like you're worried about being rejected or judged, and that's causing you to pull away. Can you take a moment to acknowledge the value of being present with your partner, even if it's just in a small, quiet way? What would be important to you about having a small moment of connection with him?

Patient: I guess having a tiny moment would mean... I don't know, feeling like we're still a team, like I'm not completely invisible to him. It might feel safe or normal, like a small reminder that we're still connected, but I'm embarrassed saying that and I'm scared he'll see how off I am. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about this—can we slow down a little?

Therapist: It can be really hard to acknowledge our vulnerabilities, especially when we're already feeling overwhelmed. Let's slow down for a moment. Can you notice what happens in your body when you pause and take a breath? Where do you feel the heaviness or tension in your body right now?

Patient: I don't know... when I breathe a little the tightness eases for a moment, but mostly there's this heavy pressure behind my chest and a lump in my throat. My shoulders feel hunched up, my stomach's in knots, and my hands go a bit cold and numb. I guess I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is still feeling quite tense. Let's take a slightly bigger breath together, and when you're ready, I'll guide you back in. As we breathe in, can you allow yourself to notice the physical sensations in your body without trying to change them or push them away? And when we breathe out, can you imagine any tension or discomfort slowly releasing, just a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know... I took a slow breath and for a moment the pressure eased and my shoulders dropped a bit, but the lump in my throat is still there and my hands feel cold. I guess it helped a little, but I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: That small moment of release was nice. Let's take another deep breath together. As we breathe in, can you bring your attention to the lump in your throat? Notice it without trying to push it away or change it. See if you can allow it to be there, just as it is. When you breathe out, imagine that you're releasing a tiny bit of tension related to that lump, but don't try to get rid of it completely. Just let it be, and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know... when I focus on the lump it feels like a tight, burning ball I can't swallow, and my chest gets heavier. I'm suddenly jittery and want to shut down or leave, like it's too much to stay with. I guess that little release helped a bit, but I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: The sensation of the lump can be really uncomfortable. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to feel like you need to shut down or leave. Can you take another slow breath, and this time, when you breathe out, imagine that you're allowing yourself to feel this overwhelming sensation, without trying to push it away or escape from it? You're just allowing it to be, as it is, in this moment.

Patient: I tried taking another slow breath like you said. When I breathe out the lump loosens a tiny bit, but it's still there and it makes me want to shut down. I don't know, I'm feeling shaky and like I might start crying, and it's getting a bit much—can we slow down a little? I want to keep going but it's hard right now.

Therapist: It sounds like the lump is still present, and it's getting harder to tolerate. Can we take another pause, just for a moment? I'm not going to try to push you to keep going if you're feeling shaky or overwhelmed. You're safe, and we can slow down as much as you need. Would you like to sit in silence for a moment, just breathing, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I'm feeling shaky and kind of panicky, and if I start crying I might want to stop or change the subject—so can we keep it gentle? I don't know how long I can sit, but I'll try to breathe and stay here for a bit.

Therapist: Let's keep the space gentle and calm. You're in control here. Take your time, and breathe when you're ready. I'll be here, and we can stay in silence together. No need to worry about what's coming next or what might happen; we're just here to be with this feeling, together.

Patient: I'm trying to stay with it, but I don't know—my breath's still shallow and the lump's there and I'm getting teary. I want to keep going but it's getting hard, so can we stay really gentle and just sit with the breathing for a few more minutes? I might shut down if it gets too direct, so maybe keep it quiet for now.

Therapist: Let's keep the space quiet and calm. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. We're just here to sit with the breath, and the lump, and whatever else arises, together. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out, and just be with what's present in this moment. No pressure, no expectations. Just being.

Patient: I'm trying to keep breathing—my chest is still heavy and I'm getting teary, but the quiet helps. I don't know how long I can stay with it, and I'm feeling overwhelmed, so can we keep it slow and gentle? I want to keep going, but I might get shaky or shut down if it gets too direct.

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to slow down. Let's keep the pace as gentle as a leaf floating on water. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out, and just be with the heaviness in your chest, and the tears that might come. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough.

Patient: I don't know... I'm breathing and the tears are coming, my chest still feels heavy and my hands are cold. I want to tell him how this is affecting us but I'm scared he'll see me as weak and I'll just pull away. I'm getting shaky—can we keep it really gentle and not talk about fixes yet?

Therapist: It's okay to feel shaky, and it's okay to cry. Allow the tears to be what they are – a release, a release of tension, a release of feeling overwhelmed. Your hands may be cold, but that's just a physical sensation. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out, and just be with the sensation of your chest heaviness, without judgment. We're not looking for a solution right now, we're just sitting with the feeling of being overwhelmed and scared.

Patient: I don't know... the tears just keep coming and I feel really ashamed about it. I want to tell him how this is affecting us, but I'm terrified he'll think I'm weak and pull away, and I guess that fear makes me keep quiet. Can we stay really gentle and not talk about solutions yet? I'm feeling shaky and might shut down if it gets too intense.

Therapist: The tears are coming, and the shame is present. Can you allow that shame to be what it is – a feeling, a thought, a sensation? Don't try to push it away or change it. Just observe it, gently, as you would a cloud passing by. You don't have to do anything with it, you just need to be with it. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out, and let the tears flow.

Patient: I don't know... the tears just won't stop and I feel really, really ashamed. I want to tell him how this is hurting us but I'm terrified he'll see me as weak and pull away, and that fear makes me clam up. Can we please stay really gentle and not try to fix anything right now? I might get shaky or shut down if it gets too direct, so just... stay with me a bit.

Therapist: The tears are still coming, and the shame is still present. It's okay to feel like you're at a standstill. Take a slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out, and let the tears be what they are – a release, a release of feeling overwhelmed, of feeling ashamed. You're not trying to stop the tears, you're just being with them. We're not trying to fix anything, we're just sitting together in this moment.

Patient: I don't know... the tears just keep coming and I feel ridiculous and ashamed about it. I'm terrified he'll see me like this and think I'm weak or that I'm a burden, and that thought just makes the lump worse. I want to keep going but it's getting too much—can we stay really quiet and gentle for a bit longer? I don't know what to say next.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and fear are really intensifying. The lump is still there, and the tears keep coming. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it? Let's just be with the breath, and let the rest follow. We'll stay right here, quietly, until you're ready to move forward.

Patient: I'm still here, breathing—it's helping a little, my shoulders dropped a bit and the tears are slowing, but the lump's still tight and I feel shaky and embarrassed. I don't know what to say next and I'm scared he'll see me as weak, so I guess… can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer, just focusing on the breath? I might clam up if it gets too direct.

Therapist: The breath is still present, and it's helping a bit. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin? No need to think about anything else, just the present moment. We're just being with the quiet, together.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — kind of solid, I guess — and the air on my face, which is oddly calming. My shoulders eased a bit but the lump in my throat is still tight and I'm pretty embarrassed about crying. I don't know... can we stay quiet and gentle for a while longer? I'm worried if we get too direct I'll shut down.

Therapist: The sensation of your feet on the floor is a good anchor. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you notice the sensation of your mouth, too – is it open, or is it relaxed? No need to say anything, just be with the sensation of your mouth and your body, just as they are. We're just being here, together, in silence.

Patient: I don't know... my jaw's a bit tight and my lips are pressed together, like I'm holding something in. My mouth feels kind of closed off and dry, though the breathing helps a little. Can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer? I'm scared if it gets too direct I'll just shut down.

Therapist: The sensation of your jaw and lips is present. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you notice the sensation of your tongue, resting in your mouth? No need to try to move it or change it, just be with its presence. We're just being here, together, in silence, and allowing things to be as they are.

Patient: I don't know... my tongue feels kind of heavy against the roof of my mouth, like I'm holding it there, and my jaw's loosened a little. It helps a bit, but the lump's still tight and I'm pretty shaky. Can we stay quiet and gentle for a while longer? I'm worried if it gets too direct I'll shut down.

Therapist: The sensation of your tongue feeling heavy against the roof of your mouth is present. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit more, since your jaw has loosened? It's small, but it's something. We're just being here, together, and allowing things to unfold slowly.

Patient: I guess I do notice it — my shoulders feel a little lower and my jaw's a bit looser, but the lump's still there and I'm still shaky. I don't know, I'm embarrassed about how much I'm crying. Can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer? I'm not sure what to say next and I don't want to rush it.

Therapist: The relaxation in your shoulders and jaw is small, but present. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just be with the lump, as it is, without trying to change it or push it away? We're not trying to fix anything or change how you're feeling. We're just being here, together, in silence.

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to be with it, like you said. The lump's still heavy and tight, but maybe it's a tiny bit less frantic when I don't fight it. I'm still shaky and embarrassed—can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer?

Therapist: The lump is still there, but it's not as frantic as it was before. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you notice the sensation of your heart beating, just beneath your chest? It's still beating, and it's still yours. We're just being here, together, with the sensation of your heart, and the lump, and everything else, just as it is.

Patient: I can feel it—kind of a fast, heavy thud under my ribs, like it's trying to get out. The lump's still there and I'm shaky and really embarrassed, so I don't know... can we stay quiet and gentle for a while longer? I want to keep being here but I'm not sure what to say next.

Therapist: The sensation of the thud beneath your ribs is present. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just allow the thud to be what it is, without trying to change it or push it away? We're not trying to fix anything, we're just being here, together, in silence. Just the sound of your breathing, and the thud, and...

Patient: I can feel that thud—it's loud and makes me feel a little panicky, and the lump tightens when I notice it. I don't know, I guess I'm scared of saying anything that might make him pull away, so I keep wanting to change the subject. I'm getting shaky and embarrassed—can we keep it quiet and gentle for a while longer? I want to keep going but it's hard to stay with this if it gets too direct.

Therapist: The thud is loud, and it's making you feel panicky. The lump is tightening when you notice it, and that's creating more anxiety. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just be with the panic, as it is, without trying to change it or push it away? We're not trying to fix anything, we're just being here, together, in silence. Just the sound of your breathing, and the panic, and...

Patient: I don't know... the panic's still loud and it makes me want to get up and leave. My breath's shallow, my chest's tight, and I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy—I'm worried if we push it I'll just clam up. Can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer? I don't know what to say after that.

Therapist: The panic is still present, and it's making you feel like you need to get up and leave. Your breath is shallow, and your chest is tight. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just lean back a bit, and let your head rest on the surface in front of you? No need to try to do anything, just rest, and be here.

Patient: I did— I leaned back and rested my head and it helped a tiny bit, like the room steadied for a moment. But my heart's still racing, I feel a bit dizzy, and I don't know, I'm still shaky and feel like I might just get up and leave. Can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer? I might shut down if it gets too direct.

Therapist: The room feeling steadied for a moment was a small victory. Your heart is still racing, and you're feeling dizzy, but you're leaning back and resting your head, which is helping a bit. Take another slow breath in, and when you're ready, breathe out. Can you just notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit more, since you're leaning back and resting your head?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I do notice a tiny bit more slack in my shoulders and my breath feels a little slower. My heart's still pounding and the lump's there and I'm shaky, so can we stay really quiet and gentle for a while longer?
