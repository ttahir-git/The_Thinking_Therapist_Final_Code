Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with the prolonged financial strain on my business — it's created this pervasive, almost clinical sadness and a real paucity of motivation I can't seem to will away. It's starting to bleed into my marriage; there's more friction and I'm withdrawing even though I'm usually action-oriented. I find myself theorizing about why I feel this way—attributing it to chronic stress and learned helplessness—because actually sitting with the feeling feels risky.

Therapist: It sounds like sitting with this feeling of sadness and uncertainty is feeling uncomfortable for you, like you're avoiding something. What's the sensation like when you do allow yourself to sit with it for just a moment, even if it's just for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: If I actually let myself sit with it for a moment, it shows up as a dull, persistent pressure in my chest and a sort of cognitive fog—like someone turned down the color and volume on everything. My default move is to intellectualize it—call it anhedonia or a chronic stress response—because naming it feels safer than feeling it. Physically there's a hollow heaviness behind my sternum and a restless agitation that wants me to get up and fix things rather than stay with the feeling.

Therapist: That sounds like a really nuanced and complex experience. It's like your mind is trying to navigate this heavy feeling with intellectual tools, but your body is saying, "No, let's just feel it, even if it's uncomfortable." Can you think of a time when you felt this dull, persistent pressure or cognitive fog, and you didn't immediately try to intellectualize it or distract yourself? What happened when you allowed yourself to simply be with that feeling for that brief moment?

Patient: Yeah—there was one night last month after a fraught conversation with my wife where I actually sat on the back steps for maybe a minute instead of jumping up to "fix" things. The chest pressure intensified, a couple of tears slipped out, and time felt oddly dilated—there was this brief, clarifying ache that made me realize how exhausted I am, but it was more of a lived somatic signal than an idea. Almost immediately my mind recoiled and started inventorying solutions and worst-case scenarios—cashflow projections, contingency plans—which cut the feeling off, leaving a faint relief mixed with guilt that I couldn't stay with it longer. I don't know, it's like I get a thirty-second window of actual feeling and then I retreat into analysis because feeling feels too precarious.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between this moment of brief, visceral experience and the need to intellectualize and analyze it, even if it's just to make sense of it. The relief that followed, though, might have been tinged with guilt, suggesting that staying with the feeling was a bit scary, even if it was just for a short time. Would it be possible to explore what's driving the guilt, rather than the feeling itself?

Patient: If we unpack the guilt, a big part of it is tied to my identity as the provider—those fiscal shortfalls read to me like a moral deficit, as if I'm failing a contractual obligation to keep my family secure. There's also shame around vulnerability: admitting fear or sadness feels like losing control or respect, and I'm terrified of becoming a burden, so my ego reflexively converts feeling into contingency plans and existential rationalizations. I know I'm doing the classic intellectualization here, and that meta-awareness makes me anxious and sort of ashamed—I'm trying to talk about the guilt instead of actually sitting in it, because feeling it feels precarious.

Therapist: That's a powerful insight. It sounds like the sense of identity as a provider and the fear of vulnerability are tied up in a knot. Your mind is trying to protect you from feeling like a burden, which is a very human and understandable fear. Would it be possible to explore what would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept this feeling of being a burden, without necessarily identifying with it as a definition of who you are? What if you simply allowed the feeling to exist, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: In theory, acknowledging it out loud would decouple the feeling from the identity — like downgrading it from absolute verdict to just one passing signal. I imagine the chest pressure would intensify for a beat, maybe a tear or two, then some of the moralized urgency would ease instead of immediately converting into cashflow triage. Practically, I can picture a micro-experiment—say the words “I feel like a burden” out loud, breathe into the sternum for thirty seconds, and notice what shifts—but I also have to admit I'm laying this out as an intellectual protocol to avoid actually doing it, because doing it feels precarious and brings up this secondary guilt about not fixing things.

Therapist: You're recognizing the pattern of intellectualizing as a way to avoid the uncertainty of feeling the emotion directly. It's interesting that you mention the practicality of the micro-experiment, which suggests you're drawn to the idea of taking action, even if it's just a tiny step. Would you be willing to try this micro-experiment without framing it as a "protocol" or a "protocol to avoid feeling"? Instead, would you try to approach it as a genuine, small act of experimentation, just to see what happens?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it, though I can already hear my brain turning it into an experiment rather than just feeling it. “I feel like a burden.” Breathing into my sternum now, I get a hot tightness, a flush of shame, and a little sting behind my eyes; thoughts about failing and fixing the finances start crowding in after maybe ten seconds. I want to stay with it longer but I'm noticing the urge to switch to solutions—can you help me slow down so I can actually sit with the rest of it?

Therapist: Let's take a pause together. I'll help you slow down the thoughts and feelings. When you say "I feel like a burden," you can take a deep breath in, and then... just be with that sensation for a moment, without judgment. No thoughts, no analysis, no trying to fix it. Just the sensation of the hot tightness, the flush, the sting behind your eyes. Can you stay with that for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay—I'm breathing in now. There's a hot pressure under my sternum and my vision's a little softer at the edges, like everything's been desaturated; at the same time my head's already drafting contingency budgets. I want to stay with the warmth and the sting behind my eyes but it's getting hard—can you keep me anchored for another breath or two so I don't start problem-solving?

Therapist: I'm here to anchor you with you. Just focus on the sensation of the hot pressure under your sternum, and the sensation of the sting behind your eyes. Notice how your body is responding, and let go of the need to analyze or solve anything. Take another slow, deep breath in, and when you exhale, just be with the feeling again. Can you stay with it for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay—I'm breathing in now. The pressure under my sternum tightens, there's that warm sting behind my eyes, and for this one breath I can feel the helplessness like a real weight instead of just a concept. My brain's already pivoting to cashflow scenarios and contingency lists, and I want to stay with this but it's getting hard—can you keep anchoring me for another breath or two so I don't slip into problem-solving?

Therapist: I've got you. Just notice the sensation of the weight of helplessness as a physical feeling in your body. It's okay if your mind starts to wander to cashflow scenarios and contingency lists – that's not the goal right now. Can you simply acknowledge those thoughts, and then bring your attention back to the weight of helplessness in your body? Take another slow breath in, and when you exhale, just be with that feeling again.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the physical weight supposed to help when my brain immediately goes to financial triage and contingency planning? When I try, I do feel the sternum pressure and the warmth and sting behind my eyes, but pretty quickly my mind starts listing budgets and worst‑case scenarios, so it feels like a mismatch between an experiential register and my habitual analytical mode. Can you give me a very concrete, simple instruction to keep me anchored — like a counting rhythm or a short phrase to repeat — because I keep defaulting to problem‑solving and I need something tangible to stay with the feeling.

Therapist: I apologize for the confusion. Let's try a different approach. I want you to bring your attention to your breath. Simply focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Count your breath, starting with one: "one... in... out... one... in... out..." as you breathe. Can you try this simple counting rhythm to anchor your attention to the physical sensation of your breath?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. One — in — out. Two — in — out. Three — in — out. Four — in — out.

The sternum pressure eases a bit on the first couple breaths, but by the third my brain is already sketching cashflow contingencies. I can hold the rhythm for maybe three breaths before slipping back into problem‑solving; could you count aloud with me or give me a short phrase to repeat so I have something concrete to latch onto?

Therapist: I'll count aloud with you. One... in... out... One... in... out... Two... in... out... Two... in... out... Three... in... out... Three... in... out... Four... in... out... Four... in... out...

As we count, I want you to notice the sensation of the breath in your body, not just the counting. Let's try to stay with the sensation for just one more breath. Ready? One...

Patient: One — in — out. Two — in — out. Three — in — out. The sternum pressure loosens a bit and my vision's still soft at the edges, but my brain is already sketching cashflow fixes again and I have to nudge it away. Can you keep counting with me for a few more breaths? I want to stay with this, but it's getting hard and I need the scaffolding.

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out. Two... in... out. Three... in... out. Four... in... out. Five... in... out. 

Notice how the counting is becoming a steady, repetitive motion, almost a mantra. I want you to use that mantra to help you stay with the sensation of the sternum pressure and the warmth behind your eyes. When you feel your mind starting to drift into problem-solving, bring your attention back to the counting and the physical sensations in your body. Ready? One...

Patient: One — in — out. Two — in — out. Three — in — out. The sternum pressure loosens a little and my vision is still soft, but my mind's already sketching contingency plans again. Can you keep counting with me for a few more breaths and maybe add a short tether phrase on the exhale—like “I'm here”—so I have something concrete to hold onto?

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... I'm here. Two... in... out... I'm here. Three... in... out... I'm here. Four... in... out... I'm here. Five... in... out... I'm here.

The phrase "I'm here" becomes a sort of anchor, a reminder that you're present with your body and the sensation. Try to stay with the counting and the physical sensations, and let the phrase "I'm here" become a gentle reminder that you're okay, even if your mind is trying to wander. Ready? One...

Patient: One — in — out — I'm here. Two — in — out — I'm here. Three — in — out — I'm here. Four — in — out — I'm here. Five — in — out — I'm here.

The sternum pressure loosens a touch and the sting behind my eyes is quieter, but my mind keeps darting to cashflow and shame about not fixing things. I want to stay with this, but it's getting thin—can you keep counting with me and maybe lengthen the exhale phrase to "it's okay to feel" so I have something a bit more permissive to latch onto?

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel. 

Notice how the phrase "it's okay to feel" becomes a bit more expansive, allowing for a greater range of emotions and sensations. Let's see if we can ride this out together. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Patient: That actually helped a little—the sternum loosened and the sting quieted—though my brain keeps drafting contingency plans and shame narratives before I can stay present. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now; can we slow down and keep the counting going, or add another concrete anchor (like placing my hand on my chest) so I don't slip back into problem‑solving? Also, could you help me figure out a few simple words I could say to my wife when this fog hits, so I don't default to withdrawing?

Therapist: Let's slow down the counting and add another anchor. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

And let's add a physical anchor, too. Can you place one hand on your chest, where the sternum pressure is located? Hold it lightly, just to anchor yourself to the physical sensation. 

Now, let's explore some phrases you can use to communicate with your wife when you feel overwhelmed. What are a few words or sentences that feel safe and authentic for you to say when you're in this place?

Patient: Okay — here are a few that feel like they could be said without me collapsing into analysis:

- "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. I need a minute to breathe."  
- "There's something heavy on my mind about the business; I can't talk it through fully right now, can we pause and come back to it?"  
- "I don't want to unload everything on you, but could you just sit with me for a few minutes?"  
- "I'm fogged by worry and not myself at the moment—can we have a quiet check‑in later?"  
- "I need a small bit of patience from you right now; it would help more than solutions."

They feel a little awkward to say — my reflex is to convert them into action items ("let me make a plan"), which drains the vulnerability out of them. Can we practice one of these out loud together? Keep counting with me and keep your voice steady — my hand's still on my chest and it's tight, and I need the scaffolding.

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Let's practice one of those phrases together. You can say: "I need a small bit of patience from you right now; it would help more than solutions." I'll keep counting and stay steady. Go ahead and say it, and let's see how it feels.

Patient: Okay—I'll try it now while you keep counting. "I need a small bit of patience from you right now; it would help more than solutions." 

Saying that felt oddly vulnerable—my chest tightened and my voice went flat for a second, and my mind immediately wanted to tack on possible fixes so it wouldn't sound like weakness. Can we role‑play it a few times with you as my wife, keep the counting, and maybe try a shorter version too, because I worry the long sentence will make me retreat into problem‑solving?

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Let's practice a shorter version. You can say: "I need some patience right now." I'll respond as your wife, and we'll keep counting. Go ahead and say it.

Patient: "I need some patience right now." 

Saying that felt exposed — my chest tightened, my voice flattened for a beat, and my brain immediately started appending contingencies so it wouldn't sound like weakness. Can we role‑play it now with you as my wife, keep the counting anchor, and run it a few times? Also, can you practice a couple of likely wife responses too (like offering solutions) so I can rehearse a short comeback that keeps me from withdrawing — something one line and non‑technical, because long explanations make me retreat.

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Let's practice. You say: "I need some patience right now." I'll respond as your wife. (pause) Okay, I'm here. You can say a short comeback.

(Note: I'll try to respond with a solution or a neutralizing phrase to help you practice responding without retreating.)

Go ahead and respond.

Patient: Okay... thank you. Please don't try to fix it—just sit with me for five minutes. 

My chest's tight and I'm jittery—keep counting with me and say a likely "let me help" or "what can I do?" so I can practice a one‑line comeback.

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Okay, I'll try to respond in a way that lets you practice a comeback. You say: "I need some patience right now." I'll respond: "What do you need from me in this moment?"

Patient: Okay—here's a short one I can actually say without spiraling: "I need you to just sit with me for five minutes; please don't try to fix it." 

A couple even shorter options:
- "Can you just be here with me for a few minutes?"
- "Hold my hand and don't offer solutions, please."

My chest is tight and I'm jittery right now—can you keep counting and give me a likely "Let me help" or "What can I do?" response so I can practice using one of these comebacks?

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Okay, let's try a likely "Let me help" response. You say: "I need some patience right now." I'll respond: "I'm here, and we can figure it out together."

Patient: Okay — I'll try a short comeback to that: "I appreciate that, but I don't need solutions right now; could you just sit with me for five minutes?" 

Saying that made my chest tighten and my hands feel a little shaky — my mind's still trying to draft fixes. Can you keep counting and respond as my wife with either "I'm here" or the solution-offer line ("We can figure it out together") so I can practice the boundary and a quick, non‑technical rebuttal?

Therapist: I'll keep counting. One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

Okay, let's try it again. You say: "I need some patience right now." I'll respond: "I'm here."

Patient: Okay... I'm here—thank you. Hearing that actually helps a little, but my chest's tight and my mind's already racing into cashflow fixes; I'm jittery and distracted. Can you just sit with me for five minutes and keep the counting going—one, in, out—so I don't dissolve into problem‑solving?

Therapist: One... in... out... it's okay to feel. Two... in... out... it's okay to feel. Three... in... out... it's okay to feel. Four... in... out... it's okay to feel. Five... in... out... it's okay to feel.

(I'll keep the counting steady and silent, just a steady "one... in... out...")

Patient: Okay — I'm still with you and I'm trying to keep the rhythm, but my heart's sped up and I'm jittery; the sternum pressure is a hair looser but the mental cashflow parade keeps barging in. Could you keep the steady counting and, every so often, say a short tether like "back to breath" or "stay with the body"? Also tell me to keep my hand on my chest if I start drifting — I think that extra concrete cue will help me actually feel this instead of immediately turning it into a plan.

Therapist: One... in... out... back to breath. Two... in... out... stay with the body. Three... in... out... back to breath. Four... in... out... stay with the body. Five... in... out...

(I'll continue to keep the counting steady, and occasionally say one of those short tether phrases to help you stay grounded. And don't forget to keep your hand on your chest if you start to drift away.)

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and more anxious / distracted right now; my heart's racing and my hand on my chest is trembling. The counting and "back to breath" help a little, but my default reflex to intellectualize—drafting contingencies and budgets—keeps barging in and it's maddening because I actually want to feel this. Can we slow down? Keep the steady counting, say "back to breath" on every other exhale, and tell me to keep my hand on my chest if I start to drift. Also, can we quickly rehearse one very short line I can actually say to my wife when I'm like this—something nontechnical, like "Can you just sit with me?"—and run that a couple times?

Therapist: One... in... out... back to breath. Two... in... out... stay with the body. Three... in... out... back to breath. Four... in... out... stay with the body. Five... in... out... back to breath.

(I'll slow down the counting and keep it steady, saying "back to breath" on every other exhale. I'll also remind you to keep your hand on your chest if you start to drift away.)

Let's practice the short line you want to say to your wife. You can say: "Can you just sit with me?"

Go ahead and say it. I'll respond as your wife.

Patient: "Can you just sit with me?"

Saying that felt exposed—my chest tightened, my hand's trembling, and my thoughts are already flitting to cashflow contingencies. Could you respond first as my wife with a simple "I'm here," and then with a solution-offer like "We can figure it out together," so I can practice a short comeback (something like "I just need you right now")? And please keep the counting and the occasional "back to breath" cue, and remind me to keep my hand on my chest if I start to drift.

Therapist: One... in... out... back to breath. Two... in... out... stay with the body. Three... in... out... back to breath. Four... in... out... back to breath.

(I'll respond as your wife.)

You: "Can you just sit with me?"

Me: "I'm here."

(Now it's your turn again. Try to stay with the feeling and respond with a short comeback. I'll keep the counting steady and remind you to keep your hand on your chest if you start to drift.)

Patient: Hearing "I'm here" actually helps a bit — my chest loosens a touch but I'm still jittery and the cashflow parade keeps barging in. Okay, my short comeback: "I just need you right now." 

Can we role‑play the likely follow‑up — say "We can figure it out together" — so I can practice a one‑line rebuttal? Keep counting and "back to breath" cues, and remind me to keep my hand on my chest if I start drifting.

Therapist: One... in... out... back to breath. Two... in... out... stay with the body. Three... in... out... back to breath. Four... in... out... back to breath.

(I'll respond as your wife.)

You: "I just need you right now."

Me: "We can figure it out together."

(I'll respond with the solution-offer, and you can practice a short rebuttal.)

Remember to keep your hand on your chest and stay with the feeling.

Patient: Okay — I hear "We can figure it out together," and I appreciate that, but not right now; a short line that actually lands for me is: "Not right now — please just sit with me." 

My chest is tight, my hand's trembling, and my mind's already drafting budgets, so keep the counting and the "back to breath" cue and remind me to keep my hand on my chest if I drift. Can we run that exchange a few more times — first with "I'm here" and then with "We can figure it out together" — so I can practice the rebuttal?
