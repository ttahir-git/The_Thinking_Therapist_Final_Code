Patient: Lately I've been feeling stuck and directionless — since the move I feel like I'm only the chef and I don't know what matters beyond the kitchen. I'm creative and sensitive, but outside the stove I don't know who I am. I've been through therapy before, so how is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: It sounds like the kitchen, for you, has become a very identity-anchoring space. Can you explore with me what's so essential to you about being the chef, and what it is about being outside the kitchen that makes you feel unmoored?

Patient: Being the chef gives me... a reason to get up. I'm needed, I make things people notice, and the kitchen's noise and rhythm keep me steady. Outside of it there's no structure, no real praise — just a strange emptiness where I used to be useful, and I don't know what to do with myself. But how is talking about that supposed to help? I've tried thinking things through before and it didn't change a damn thing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a strong connection to the sense of purpose and identity that comes with being a chef. And you're right, thinking things through hasn't provided the solutions you're looking for. What if, instead of trying to find a solution, we explored what it would be like to be with that sense of purpose and identity in your daily life, even outside the kitchen?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I mean, I can imagine sitting with the feeling, but I don't know what that actually does for the rest of my day — it just feels like rehearsing the problem. When I'm not in the kitchen I used to fiddle with sketches and old pans, but it never gave me the same steady purpose, it just felt like fumbling around. Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it already feels like we're circling the same stuff.

Therapist: The act of sitting with the feeling doesn't necessarily provide a solution, but rather allows you to experience it more fully. It's almost like noticing the texture of the emptiness, rather than just feeling it. Would you be willing to try noticing that emptiness more closely, without trying to problem-solve or imagine a solution, and just be with it for a moment?

Patient: Alright... I'll try, though I don't expect much. Sitting with it now, I notice a tightness in my chest, like a hollow where the orders and noise used to be, and my hands feel a bit useless — my mind keeps drifting back to the kitchen. I still don't see how just naming it helps; what am I supposed to do with that feeling?

Therapist: That's a good start, noticing the physical sensations. Would you be willing to notice the sensation of your hands being useless, and just be with that, without trying to do anything with them, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My hands feel heavy, like they're full of old dough that won't rise — stiff, a bit cold, like they don't know what to do without a pan in front of them. They keep wanting to reach for a cutting board, and that itching makes my chest tighten. How is that supposed to help, though? I don't know what to do with that feeling once I notice it.

Therapist: Your hands are already doing the noticing, and the sensation is unfolding. What if, instead of trying to figure out what to do with it, we simply allow the urge to reach for the cutting board to come and go, without judgment or resistance?

Patient: Alright — I let the urge come and go. My hands twitched, then calmed a bit, but it felt kind of pointless, like watching flour settle on a counter. How is letting it pass supposed to give me anything to build a life around? I'm getting frustrated; it already feels like we keep rehearsing feelings and not actually fixing a damn thing.

Therapist: Your frustration is valid, and it's normal. Sometimes, what we're looking for is not a grand solution but rather a small, everyday experience that can show up in our lives. Can you think of a tiny, everyday moment where you might be able to be with this feeling of frustration, without trying to fix it, and see what happens?

Patient: Maybe it's the little things — like when I make my morning coffee or scrub a pan and there's that empty space where the rhythm used to be. I could try noticing the frustration right then, the urge to rush back to the kitchen, and just let it sit without doing anything about it. But how is that supposed to help? I'm skeptical — I've tried sitting with it before and it just feels like going in circles, and honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see the possibility of tiny, everyday moments where you can practice being with the feeling of frustration. What if, instead of trying to figure out where it's going to lead, we focus on simply being with the feeling of not wanting to go back to the kitchen, in this moment, while you're making your morning coffee?

Patient: Alright, I'll try it while I make my coffee — though I doubt it'll change anything. As I pour the water there's a hollow in my chest, my hands keep twitching like they want a pan, and a little shame creeps in, like I'm failing myself. How is that supposed to help? I don't know what to do with the feeling once it's just sitting there.

Therapist: It's showing up in the present moment, with the actions you're doing. Can you allow the shame to sit with the feeling of not wanting to cook, without trying to push it away or judge it, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. The shame sits heavy behind my ribs, like a warm coal that tells me I'm lazy or useless without the kitchen, and it makes my hands ache to prove myself by cooking something. How is that supposed to help? I've let it sit before and it just hollowed me out; I don't know what to do with it next and it's getting frustrating.

Therapist: The shame is holding a strong emotional weight. What would it be like, for just a moment, if you didn't try to use your hands to prove yourself to that shame?

Patient: If I didn't try to prove myself, my hands would feel useless but also a little lighter, like I wasn't chained to the stove for my worth. That space is weird — relief and a cliff at the same time — and the shame's still there whispering that I'm lazy. How is that supposed to help? I've tried letting the proving go and it just hollowed me out; I'm getting frustrated — can we actually work out something practical from that breathing space instead of just circling it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're approaching the space from a place of resistance. What if, instead of trying to get rid of the shame, we focus on the physical sensations in your body when your hands feel useless – like the heaviness and the aching – and see if you can find a small part of you that doesn't feel ashamed, or uncomfortable, in that feeling?

Patient: Okay — when I zero in on the ache in my hands I can feel a tiny spot near my thumb that's not burning with shame, it's just... neutral, even a little curious. It flickers into a memory — the quiet pride of a perfectly seared scallop, or adjusting a spice just so — that small part doesn't judge me. But how is that supposed to help? Even if that little curiosity's there, it doesn't show me how to fill the rest of the hollow, and I'm getting impatient with all this sitting around feelings.

Therapist: The tiny spot of curiosity is a tiny island of calm in the storm. What if, instead of trying to navigate the rest of the hollow, we just anchor ourselves in that small moment of curiosity, where you found some neutral, almost gentle acceptance? Can you stay with that feeling of quiet pride in the memory, without trying to build on it or fill the rest of the space?

Patient: I'll try, but I'm feeling rattled and distracted — my chest's tight and my thoughts keep skittering away. When I land on that quiet pride it's a little ember, kind of soothing, but it flickers fast and the worry snaps back that I'm wasting time. How is staying with that supposed to help in any practical way? I'm anxious it won't stick and I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: The ember is flickering, and that's okay. It's not meant to be a long-lasting flame, but a tiny spark to help you notice what's already present in the moment. What if, instead of trying to make it last, we simply observe the thought that comes up when you think "I'm wasting time" – can you see it as a thought, without judgment?

Patient: I can try. When I notice "I'm wasting time" it hits like a shout — my chest tightens and my thoughts start skittering away, like I can't keep my focus. How is just seeing it as a thought supposed to help? I've labeled thoughts before and they just turn into other nags; it doesn't actually calm me down.

Therapist: Labeling the thought "I'm wasting time" might actually intensify it. What if, instead, you gently bring your attention back to the small, neutral feeling near your thumb – the quiet pride – without trying to label it or fix it? Can you just notice the sensation of your attention wobbling back and forth between that feeling and the "I'm wasting time" thought?

Patient: I can watch it — my attention flips from that quiet spot near my thumb to the shout "you're wasting time" and back, like a bad radio dial. Landing on the thumb settles my chest a little, but the panic keeps yanking me away and then I'm jittery again. How is noticing this wobble supposed to help when I can't stop it from getting pulled away — can we actually do something practical with it?

Therapist: The wobble is like a metronome, helping you tune into your own rhythm. What if, instead of trying to stop the wobble or fix the thoughts, you started to notice the sensations that arise when the attention wobbles back to the "I'm wasting time" thought – like the feeling of panic, or the tension in your shoulders?

Patient: When the thought snaps back, my chest knots up, my shoulders hunch, my breathing gets shallow and my hands clench like I'm about to grab a pan. My head fills with a dozen little nags—orders, clocks, things I should be doing—and I can't keep my attention on that quiet spot for long. How is noticing all that supposed to help when it just makes me more jittery? Can we actually try a practical thing right now to slow the wobble—something I can do when it hits in the middle of the day?

Therapist: The physical sensations are unfolding, and they're intense. What if, in the midst of all that activity, you simply allow yourself to be with the sensation of your feet touching the ground – the weight of your body, the sensation of your feet connecting with the earth? Can you stay with that feeling for just a breath, without trying to do anything with it, and see what happens to the rest of your body and mind?

Patient: Alright — I try to feel my feet. There's a bit of weight under my heels, a tiny steadiness, and my chest loosens a hair when I focus on that. But the panic still snaps back — my hands clench and my head floods with nags; how is that supposed to help in the middle of a service? Give me something practical I can do fast when it hits, because I can't stand fumbling around with feelings then.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a quick response, something to help you stay grounded in the midst of chaos. What if, in a moment when the panic hits, you simply take a tiny, slow breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth, noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Okay — I try it: a slow nose in, mouth out — my chest loosens a hair and my hands unclench for a second, but the panic snaps back and my head fills with orders. How is that supposed to help in the middle of service when I don't have a spare breath to waste? Give me a quick, practical thing I can do between tickets that won't make me look like I'm losing it.

Therapist: It's happening quickly, and it's in the midst of chaos. What if, between tickets, you take a tiny pause, and simply put one hand down on the counter, just for a second, to anchor yourself, before picking up the next item?

Patient: Alright — I can picture it: one hand on the counter for a second. When I imagine it my palm feels a little steadier and my chest loosens, but the panic still jerks me back and I'm afraid I'll look like I'm stalling in front of the line. How is that supposed to help when service never gives you a clean second? What else can I do that's just as quick and more discreet, something I can tuck into the rhythm so I don't look like I'm losing it?

Therapist: It's a high-pressure situation, and you need a quick fix. What if, between tickets, you take a tiny pause, and simply touch the quiet spot near your thumb with your other hand? It's a subtle gesture, and it might help you get your bearings quickly.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? It sounds subtle enough, but when I'm in the weeds my hands still twitch and my head fills with orders — my chest's tight and I can't hold attention. Try me: give me one quick, discreet thing I can actually do between tickets that won't look like I'm stalling or make me more obvious than I already am. And please, something besides “just breathe” — that doesn’t cut it in the middle of service.

Therapist: It's not just about subtlety, but also about finding a concrete action that can help. What if, between tickets, you simply make eye contact with a regular customer, just for a second, to acknowledge them and bring your attention to the present moment?

Patient: How is making eye contact supposed to help? That could invite questions or look like I'm pausing — I don't have time for that. I'm jittery and my hands keep twitching, I need something I can do with my hands already on the line that won't draw notice. Give me one quick, covert thing I can actually do between tickets — and please, not breathing exercises; those don't work for me when I'm in the weeds.

Therapist: You're looking for something concrete to do with your hands that won't draw attention. What if, between tickets, you give the counter a gentle, firm tap with your finger?

Patient: Fine — that tap is subtle enough I could probably sneak it in. My chest's tight and my hands twitch, though, so how is tapping a counter supposed to steady any of that when my head's already full of orders? I'm worried it'll look like I'm counting or stalling — tell me exactly how to do it so it feels natural and doesn't slow service, because I'm skeptical this won't stick.

Therapist: Let's break it down. As you tap the counter, try to focus on the sensation of your finger making contact with the surface, and then, immediately, shift your attention to the next item on the line. Don't think about what's ahead or the orders in your head, just focus on the physical sensation of your finger on the counter, and then move on to the next thing. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. I tap once with my index finger, feel the contact, and it steadies me for a beat; my chest loosens a hair and my hands unclench a bit. But then the orders snap back and the twitching returns — it only buys me half a second. How is that supposed to help if it disappears so fast? Tell me exactly — how hard, where on the counter, one tap or two — so it feels natural and won't slow anything, because I'm skeptical this will stick.

Therapist: Let's refine the action. Instead of tapping your index finger, try tapping the edge of the counter with the heel of your palm. Keep your wrist still and use just the tip of your palm. Make two small taps, almost imperceptible, with the heel of your palm. Focus on the sensation of your palm making contact with the counter, and then shift your attention to the next item on the line. Try to keep your movements quick and light, almost like a whisper. Can you try it?

Patient: Alright — I tried the two light heel-of-palm taps in my head like you said: it steadied me for a split second in the weeds, my chest eased and my hands unclenched, but the panic snaps back and my head fills with orders. I'm jittery and distracted and it's hard to hold even that half-second — how exactly do I make the taps feel natural (how hard, exactly where on the edge), and give me one more quick, covert thing I can do that might last a bit longer without looking like I'm stalling, because I'm skeptical this'll stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated. Let's focus on making the taps feel more natural. The heel of your palm should be light, almost feather-light, with just a slight pressure on the counter. Try tapping the edge of the counter with the heel of your palm, about an inch from the edge, with a light, quick motion, almost like a soft whisper. Focus on the sensation of your palm making contact with the counter, and then shift your attention to the next item on the line. As for another quick, covert action, what if you try tapping the top of the espresso machine with your index finger?

Patient: How is tapping the espresso machine supposed to help? That sounds louder and more obvious — it'd probably draw attention, and my hands ache some days so I don't want to bang on metal. My chest's tight and my thoughts are skittering, and I've tried tricks like this before that only buy a split second before the panic snaps back; tell me exactly how hard and where to tap, or give me another covert thing that might actually last a bit longer, because I'm skeptical this will stick.

Therapist: I understand your concerns about the espresso machine. Let's try again. For the heel-of-palm tap, try making contact with the edge of the counter at a 45-degree angle, about 1/4 inch from the edge, with a light, soft touch. Aim for a gentle "thud" rather than a loud bang. Focus on the sensation of your palm making contact with the counter, and then shift your attention to the next item on the line. If you're not comfortable with the heel-of-palm tap, what if you try gently running your index finger along the edge of the counter, almost like you're smoothing out a small scratch? This action is quick, subtle, and can be done without putting pressure on your hands.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the smoothing, but I'm really jittery and distracted right now; my chest's tight and my thoughts keep skittering. How exactly do I run my finger so it looks natural — along the very top edge or the side, slow or quick, light pressure or a little firmer? And how is that supposed to help when stuff's flying at me? Give me one more covert thing I can do that might actually buy more than half a second and that I can do while chopping so it doesn't look like I'm fidgeting.

Therapist: I want you to focus on the sensation of your finger running along the edge of the counter, rather than thinking about how it looks. Try running your finger along the top edge of the counter, with the tip of your finger, using a light, gentle touch. Focus on the sensation of your finger gliding along the edge, feeling the slight resistance, and then shifting your attention to the next item on the line. As for the speed, try to keep it slow and smooth, like you're unfolding a small piece of paper. Don't try to force it or rush it. If that's still not working, what if you try taking a small, deep breath into your diaphragm, just beneath your ribcage, and then exhaling slowly? This can help calm your nervous system without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Breathing's fine in theory, but in the weeds I can't slow down — I've tried that and it doesn't work. My chest's tight, my thoughts are skittering, and those taps or the smoothing only buy me a blink. Give me one more covert thing I can do while chopping that might buy more than half a second and actually feel natural, because I'm skeptical this'll stick.
