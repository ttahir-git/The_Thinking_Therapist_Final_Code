Patient: I'm an older nurse and lately I feel stuck—like my whole identity is just my job and I don't know what matters beyond that. My OCD flared up after a recent health scare and it's left me feeling directionless. I don't really expect this to help—how is any of this supposed to change by talking?


--- Turn 1 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That health scare must have been really tough for you. It's understandable that your OCD flared up as a result. It sounds like your mind is trying to hold onto familiar patterns of thinking, but you're feeling uncertain about what's truly important to you. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about what matters beyond your job as a nurse – what's the first feeling or image that arises for you?

Patient: The first image is an empty kitchen table — no paperwork, no patients, just me and this big quiet space. It feels hollow and a little scary, like I don't know what would fill it if I'm not being useful as a nurse. I've told folks stuff like this before—how is picturing an empty table supposed to help me actually find direction?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The image of that empty kitchen table seems to capture a sense of loss of purpose. It's interesting that you mention feeling scared, too. That fear of uncertainty can be overwhelming. Can you stay with the feeling of that fear for a moment, and see if there's a part of you that's curious about what would happen if you were to sit at that table without the burden of being a nurse?

Patient: Okay... I can sit with that fear a bit—the hollow in my chest when I picture the table. There's a small, stubborn part that's curious, like maybe I'd bake or read or tinker in the garden, but I've tried little things before and they never stuck, so I don't trust that curiosity. How is sitting with this supposed to help me actually find what matters, beyond just noticing I'm scared?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and explore that small, curious voice. Now, I'd like to ask: what if, instead of trying to trust that curiosity, you were to just lean into the feeling of not knowing what to do with your time, and simply commit to taking a tiny, small step towards one of those things you're curious about, like baking or reading? Would that be possible for you to do, even if it feels a little scary?

Patient: Maybe—I'm willing to try something tiny, but I've tried 'little steps' before and they always fizzle out. How is one tiny thing supposed to break years of habit and this OCD worry that if I'm not useful I'm nothing? If I had to pick, maybe reading one chapter or making one simple biscuit, but I don't trust it'll stick and that makes me skeptical.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those 'little steps' can feel insignificant when the underlying worry is still there. It's like the habit of OCD is always pulling you back to the old pattern. Can you say to yourself, "I'm willing to try this tiny step, and if I make it, what would be the smallest, most manageable next step after that?"

Patient: Okay — "I'm willing to try this tiny step." If I finish one chapter, the smallest next step could be 15 minutes of reading three times this week; if I make one biscuit, the next step might be baking once this weekend. But I'm skeptical — OCD will nag that it won't matter and I'll quit; how is mapping out tiny steps supposed to stop me from sliding back into being only a nurse?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to create a plan to outsmart your OCD, but that might not be the best approach. Can you try to look at those tiny steps as more of an invitation to notice what happens when you're not in the grip of OCD's worries?

Patient: I can try, but honestly—how is that supposed to help? Noticing feels passive to me; when I try to just 'notice' I end up watching the worry circle louder and then doing something useful to quiet it. Maybe if I did notice, I'd feel a tiny bit lighter for a minute—or I'd just feel guilty for not being productive. If we're going to do this, I need something more concrete—like a short, timed task and someone to check in—otherwise it'll just fizzle and I'll be back to feeling useless.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The feeling of watching the worry circle louder can be really overwhelming. Having a concrete plan with a check-in can be helpful. Would you be willing to try a 5-minute task with a specific goal, like writing down three things you appreciate about your nursing work, and then checking in with me in 5 minutes to see how it goes?

Patient: Alright—I’ll do the 5-minute thing now. I set a timer, though I’m skeptical it’ll matter.

I wrote three things I appreciate about nursing: comforting people when they’re scared, catching small changes that make a big difference, and training newer staff so they don’t make the mistakes I saw. Doing it felt odd—there’s a tiny warmth, but also guilt, like I’m just patting myself on the back for the only thing I can be. 

Okay... so how is this supposed to move me toward finding other things that matter? And can you actually hold me to doing this again a couple times this week so it doesn’t just fizzle?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing and appreciating your strengths in nursing is a great start. It's like a small spark of connection to what matters beyond just your job. I'd like to hold you to doing this 5-minute task three times this week, and also introduce a simple mindfulness exercise to help you notice when that guilt and warmth come up. Let's do a short mindfulness exercise right now, just for 1 minute, to explore what's happening with that warmth and guilt. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of that warmth in your body, and gently ask yourself what's saying, "Ah, I'm just patting myself on the back"?

Patient: Okay—I did. The warmth sits low in my chest, but there's this sharp inner voice right on top of it saying, "Don't get soft—people need you," and that anything like self-praise is selfish. I asked it why and it came back with this old fear that if I'm not constantly useful I'm nothing—how is just naming that supposed to make it stop, though?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The inner voice is really familiar, isn't it? That voice can be tough to quiet, but naming it can help. Can you try to acknowledge the voice without judgment, and then say to yourself, "I'm going to take a break from that voice for just this moment, and focus on the warmth in my chest"? Let's make a commitment to do this 5-minute exercise three times this week, and I'll check in with you after each one to see how it goes.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the naming thing and say, “I’m going to take a break from that voice,” but the moment I do it drags up this hot shame and I get mad at myself, like I have to prove I’m useful. How is asking me to “take a break” actually supposed to loosen that knot? Fine—I’ll do the 5-minute exercise three times this week, but you’ve got to check in after each one and be blunt if I’m dodging it, or it’ll just fizzle.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and anger are intense. Let's be clear: there's no avoiding or dodging. I'll check in with you after each exercise, and if you're not willing to engage with the voice and the emotions that come up, we'll stop. For now, let's focus on the first exercise. Can you commit to doing the 5-minute exercise tomorrow, and I'll check in with you after it to see how it goes?

Patient: Okay—I’ll do it tomorrow. Saying that makes my chest tighten and this hot shame starts flaring up like it always does, so I can’t promise I won’t get mad at myself or blow it off. You said you’d be blunt—so tell me exactly when you’ll check in and how you want me to report back, and if I don’t answer, call me out on it straight away. How soon after I finish should you check in, and what will you do if I dodge it?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame is already starting to surface. I want you to commit to reporting back to me as soon as you're done with the 5-minute exercise tomorrow. Specifically, I'd like you to send me a text at 10 minutes past the 5-minute mark, just to let me know you've completed it. If I don't hear from you, I'll call you at 10:15 to check in and see what's going on. If you're not willing to report back, or if you're dodging, we'll take a closer look at what's going on and figure out what's needed to move forward.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try and do it tomorrow. So just to be clear: you want me to text you ten minutes after I finish the 5-minute exercise, not ten minutes after a set time, right? What should the text actually say—just “Done” or a sentence about how it felt? I’m telling you now the shame spikes and makes me want to hide or pretend I did it, so you need to actually be blunt if you don’t get it—call me at 10:15 and ask “what happened” straight up. How will you challenge me if I pick up and lie and say I did it when I didn’t?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
To clarify, I'd like you to text me "I did it" as soon as you've completed the 5-minute exercise. If I don't hear from you at 10 minutes past the 5-minute mark, I'll call you at 10:15 and ask, "What happened?" directly. If you respond with something other than "I did it," I'll call you out on it, and we'll have a real conversation about what's going on. For example, "That doesn't sound like the 'I did it' you promised me. Can you tell me what's going on?" I'm not looking for excuses or a reason to avoid the truth.

Patient: Okay — I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after I finish the 5-minute exercise. Saying that already makes my chest hot and I can feel the shame wanting me to hide or fib. If you call and I pick up and lie, don’t beat around the bush — say “I don’t believe you” and ask me why I’d lie to myself; be blunt or I’ll just slip back into pretending everything’s fine.

I'll be direct and straightforward if you try to hide or deceive yourself. If you pick up and lie, I'll say "I don't believe you" and ask, "Why would you lie to yourself about not completing the exercise? What's really going on here?" I want to understand what's preventing you from being honest with yourself, and we'll work through it together.

Patient: Alright — I’ll do it. I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after the 5-minute exercise, but I can already feel that hot shame firing up and the urge to fib. If you call and I lie, call me out with “I don’t believe you” and ask why I’d lie to myself, but don’t back off if I get defensive or hang up — call again or push me on it. And be straight with me: how is this bluntness supposed to actually change my behaviour instead of just making me feel worse in the moment?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and defensiveness can be intense. I want you to know that my goal isn't to make you feel worse in the moment, but to create a space for you to confront the underlying issues. Bluntness can be uncomfortable, but it can also be a catalyst for growth. I'm not looking to change your behavior, but rather to help you understand the patterns that keep you stuck. By calling you out on your dishonesty, I'm not trying to shame you, but rather to help you see that your actions (or lack thereof) are a reflection of your values and what's truly important to you. It's not about being "right" or "wrong," but about exploring the underlying dynamics that keep you from making progress. Are you willing to take a chance and be honest with yourself, even if it's uncomfortable?

Patient: Okay—I’ll take the chance and try to be honest, but I’m already on edge—my chest’s tight, shame’s flaring, and I feel jittery and distracted. I don’t really trust bluntness to help; most times it makes me dig in, but I’ll do this if you really hold me to it and don’t let me squirm out. I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after the 5‑minute exercise tomorrow, and if I don’t answer, call me and call me out—no soft-pedaling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're already feeling the stirrings of defensiveness and shame. That's exactly what we're going to explore. Remember, my goal is to hold space for you to be honest with yourself, not to make you defensive. If you text "I did it" tomorrow, I'll follow through on my promise to call you out if you don't. If you pick up and lie, I'll say "I don't believe you" and we'll work through why you felt the need to deceive yourself.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to be honest, but I’m already on edge; my chest’s tight and I feel jittery so I can’t promise I won’t chicken out or fib. Call me at 10:15 if you don’t get “I did it” ten minutes after I finish, and don’t sugarcoat it if I lie—say “I don’t believe you” and push me on why I’d do that. But seriously — how is this blunt calling-out supposed to help me stop feeling worthless and actually stick with something, instead of just making me defensive?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can feel the tension in your words. I want to acknowledge that the shame and self-doubt are real, and it's not going to be easy to confront them. Bluntly calling out the lie isn't about being confrontational, but about creating a space for you to face the truth about yourself. It's not about making you feel worse, but about helping you understand the patterns that keep you stuck. By acknowledging your dishonesty, you may start to see that the shame and self-doubt are linked to the same fear of being worthless that's driving your behavior. This can be a small step towards exploring what truly matters to you, and what values you want to live by. Are you willing to take that small step, even if it's uncomfortable?

Patient: Alright — yeah, I’ll try to take that small step, even though my chest’s tight and the shame’s already heating up and making me jittery. But I need you to be blunt and specific: call at 10:15 if you don’t get “I did it,” say “I don’t believe you” if I lie, and call me back if I hang up — no soft-pedaling. Still—how exactly will you use that bluntness when I get defensive so it helps instead of just making me slam the phone or dig in? I’m willing, but I want a clear plan for when I freak out so it doesn’t just end in me feeling worse.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll be clear and direct when you get defensive. If you lie, I'll say "I don't believe you" and ask, "What do you think will happen if you keep pretending that's true?" Then, I'll follow up with, "Can you see how that's not serving you?" If you get defensive, I'll press for more, asking questions like "What's really going on here?" or "What's the thought that's driving this behavior?" My goal is to help you identify the underlying fears and doubts that are driving your behavior, not to criticize or attack you. I'll also acknowledge and validate your feelings, but I won't let you use them as a reason to avoid the truth. If you start to get upset, I'll ask, "What would happen if you took a deep breath and said 'I don't know' instead of lying?"

Patient: Okay—I’ll try, but my chest’s already tight and that hot shame is buzzing so I’m jittery and distracted. How is asking “what would happen if you keep pretending” actually supposed to help when every time someone pushes like that I freeze or hang up—I’ve tried it and it just makes me lie or shut down. If I do freak out and slam the phone, promise you’ll call back more than once and switch to something grounding—don’t just “I don’t believe you” and leave it; say “Are you safe?” or guide me to take three slow breaths with you so I don’t spiral.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can sense the anxiety building. You're right, my previous approach might not be the best fit for you. When you start to get upset, I'll take a different tack. I'll ask "Are you safe?" to check in with your physical and emotional well-being, and if you need, I'll guide you through a simple grounding exercise, like taking three slow breaths together. This will help calm the nervous system and create space for us to regroup. If you're ready, we can start with the 5-minute exercise tomorrow and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to do it tomorrow, but my chest’s already tight and the shame’s buzzing so I’m jittery and distracted. I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after I finish the 5‑minute thing; if you don’t get it, call at 10:15 and be blunt—say “I don’t believe you” if I lie, and if I hang up call back and guide me through three slow breaths and check “Are you safe?” I’m skeptical this won’t just make me dig in more, but I’ll do it if you really stick to that plan—also tell me now: if I freeze and can’t even start, what will you do next?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll follow through on my commitments. If you freeze and can't start, I'll give you a brief pause, and then say, "Take a deep breath with me. Let's start again from the beginning. What's one thing that's holding you back from taking that first step?" I'll keep it simple and non-judgmental, and we'll work from there. No pushing or prodding, just a gentle nudge to help you get started.

Patient: Okay — my chest’s already tight and the shame’s buzzing, so I’m skeptical, but I’ll try. If I freeze, do this: first be blunt — “I don’t believe you’re starting” — then immediately switch to grounding: “Are you safe? Breathe with me — five slow breaths,” and call me back if I hang up; don’t let me off the hook. How is that supposed to help, really, instead of just making me dig in?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Being blunt about not believing you're starting can be jarring, but it's a necessary step to acknowledge the reality of the situation. The immediate shift to grounding is crucial, as it helps calm the nervous system and creates space for a more rational conversation. By being specific about the five slow breaths and checking in with "Are you safe?", I'm helping you focus on your physical sensations and create a sense of connection, rather than getting stuck in shame or defensiveness. This approach doesn't try to "fix" or "solve" the problem, but rather creates a temporary reprieve from the emotional overwhelm, allowing us to regroup and try again.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the plan tomorrow, but my chest’s tight and I’m jittery and can’t focus well right now. Be blunt: I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after, and if I still feel hollow afterward, how exactly will you help me figure out whether these tiny bits actually point to anything that matters beyond nursing, instead of just being distractions? Also — if I don’t pick up when you call, keep calling and do the breathing grounding, but tell me now what you’ll do if I actually do the exercise and come back saying “I still feel useless.”

Therapist Answer:
I'll be blunt and direct. If you text "I did it" and still feel hollow, I'll ask, "What's the story behind that feeling? What's the thought that's saying 'you're still useless'?" I'll help you explore that thought and see if it's related to a specific situation or a deeper pattern. If that's the case, we'll work together to identify what's driving it and find ways to address it.

If you do the exercise and come back saying "I still feel useless", I'll acknowledge your pain and frustration, and then ask, "What would happen if you were to take one tiny step towards something that felt slightly more meaningful to you, just for a minute?" I'll help you explore the possibilities and see if that tiny step can give you a sense of momentum or connection to something that matters beyond nursing.

Patient: Okay—my chest’s tight and the shame’s buzzing so I’m jittery; honestly I’m feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down? Even if I do the exercise and still feel useless, how will you help me know whether these tiny things actually point to something that matters beyond nursing instead of just distractions? Give me one concrete tiny step that isn’t about being useful to others, and tell me exactly what you’ll do when I come back saying “I still feel useless.”

I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed. Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. One tiny step that isn't about being useful to others is simply noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground. That's it. Just pay attention to the sensation of your feet on the floor, without judgment or distraction. I'll do the same, and we'll do this together for just 30 seconds. When we're done, we can reassess and see how you feel.

Patient: Okay—I'm already on edge and this whole thing makes me skeptical, but fine, we'll try it. Doing it now: my feet feel heavy on the floor, a bit cold at the toes and a tiny buzz under the soles; my chest's still tight and that hot shame's sitting there like a weight. I can feel a tiny bit of calm, but how is this supposed to turn into anything that matters beyond nursing—what's the next concrete step if this just gives me a minute of relief?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the sensation of your feet on the floor is a tiny spark of calm. Let's take it a step further. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it. Just observe the sensation of the breath as it is. Let's do this for 30 seconds, and when we're done, I'll ask, "What's the most ordinary, mundane thing you can think of doing in the next 24 hours that feels slightly more enjoyable than the feeling of shame and worthlessness?" This is a tiny step that's not about being useful, but about experiencing pleasure in a small, everyday activity.

Patient: Okay — I did the 30 seconds. Breaths were shallow, my chest’s tight, heart’s jittery and that hot shame’s sitting there like a weight. I felt a flicker of calm, then the shame pushed right back — how is this supposed to lead anywhere useful?

If I have to pick one tiny, non-useful thing for the next 24 hours: make a strong mug of tea and sit on the porch for 10 minutes, no phone, just watch the sky. That’s it. 

If I do that and come back saying “I still feel useless,” tell me exactly what you’ll do next — step by step. Don’t be vague. And if I freeze and don’t do it, will you really call me out bluntly, then do the five breaths grounding and call back if I hang up?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the shame is still a strong presence. Let's acknowledge that. Now, let's focus on the tiny step you've chosen: making a strong mug of tea and sitting on the porch for 10 minutes, phone-free, just watching the sky. If you come back saying "I still feel useless", here's what I'll do:

First, I'll say, "I can see that the shame is still with you. Can you take one more deep breath with me, and let's try to find a small spark of curiosity about what you're feeling?"

If you're still feeling stuck, I'll ask, "What's one thing you could say to yourself, just for a moment, that would be kind and compassionate, but not necessarily true?"

If you're still struggling, I'll guide you through 5 slow, deep breaths together, and then I'll ask, "Can you think of one thing, no matter how small, that you enjoyed doing as a child or in a previous time in your life when you felt more connected to yourself or others?" We'll explore that memory together, and see if it can give us a sense of what might be missing in your life now.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the tea tomorrow, but I’m already jittery saying it; my chest’s tight and that hot shame’s humming. Be concrete: when exactly do you want me to text “I did it” (ten minutes after the 10 minutes sitting, right?), and if I come back and say “I still feel useless,” tell me word-for-word what you’ll say first, second, third. If I don’t answer, give me the exact script you’ll use on the call—start with “I don’t believe you,” then “Are you safe?” then lead me through five slow breaths and call back if I hang up. And seriously—how will following that script actually help me stop feeling worthless instead of just making the shame louder?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling really anxious. Let's get clear on the plan.

I want you to text "I did it" 10 minutes after the 10 minutes of sitting on the porch, watching the sky, no phone. If you come back and say "I still feel useless", here's what I'll say:

First: "I can see that the shame is still with you. Can you take one more deep breath with me, and let's try to find a small spark of curiosity about what you're feeling?"

Second: "What's one thing you could say to yourself, just for a moment, that would be kind and compassionate, but not necessarily true? Try to find something small, like 'I'm feeling really stuck right now' or 'I'm not sure what to do next'."

Third: "I want to help you see that the feeling of worthlessness is not about you as a person, but about a thought that's trying to control you. Let's explore what that thought might be, and see if we can find a way to challenge it."

If you don't answer, I'll follow the script:

"I don't believe you. Are you safe? Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and breathe out through your mouth. Take another breath in, and breathe out. Take another breath in, and breathe out. One more time, breathe in, hold, breathe out. How do you feel now?"

If you hang up, I'll call back and we'll continue with the exercise. I'll be gentle, but firm, and we'll work through it together.

As for how this will help, I want to emphasize that it's not about avoiding the shame or making it go away, but about creating space to explore the underlying patterns and thoughts that keep you stuck. By acknowledging the shame, challenging the thought that's driving it, and finding small moments of kindness and curiosity, we can start to build a sense of connection to yourself and your values. It's not about feeling "worthless" or "not worthy," but about finding a sense of compassion and understanding for where you are right now.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try the tea tomorrow, but I’m already jittery—chest tight and that hot shame humming. I’ll text “I did it” ten minutes after the ten minutes on the porch. If I come back and say “I still feel useless,” promise you’ll say exactly the three lines you gave (the breath line, the “one thing you could say” line, then the “feeling of worthlessness is a thought” line), and if I don’t answer say exactly “I don’t believe you. Are you safe? Take a deep breath in through your nose…” and call back if I hang up. And be straight: if after all that I still feel useless, what one concrete, non-useful tiny action will you ask me to do next—say it word for word so I know what I’m being asked to try.

I can see that you're feeling really anxious. I'll stick to the plan.

If you come back and say "I still feel useless", I'll say:

"Can you take one more deep breath with me, and let's try to find a small spark of curiosity about what you're feeling?"

"If you could say one thing to yourself right now, just for a moment, that would be kind and compassionate, but not necessarily true?"

"The feeling of worthlessness is a thought that's trying to control you. Let's explore what that thought might be, and see if we can find a way to challenge it."

Take another breath in, and breathe out. Take another breath in, and breathe out. One more time, breathe in, hold, breathe out. How do you feel now?"

If you still feel useless after that, I'll ask you to do this: "I want you to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, using a bread you don't like, on a knife you don't like, and with a spread you don't like. Just focus on the sensation of putting the peanut butter on the bread, and the sound of the knife moving, and the smell of the spread. Don't think about the taste, or the texture, or anything else. Just focus on the physical sensations."

Patient: Make me a sandwich with stuff I hate? How is that supposed to help — it just feels humiliating and my shame's already spiking from that stupid text I got; my chest is tight and I'm jittery. Fine — I'll try it tomorrow, and I'll text "I did it" ten minutes after I'm done, but you have to say the three lines you promised word for word if I come back saying "I still feel useless." If I don't answer, call at 10:15 and do the exact breathing script and call back if I hang up. Now tell me, straight — if the sandwich doesn't help, what's the one concrete non-useful thing you'll make me do next, word for word?
