Patient: Lately I've been using procrastination to numb this grief I've been carrying — ever since I had to start this demanding program it's gotten worse. I keep filling my time with small tasks so I don't have to feel the real stuff, because feeling it is just... too much. I don't know, I guess I feel stuck.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the small tasks have become a way for you to avoid dealing with the pain of the program and your grief. Feeling stuck is a really common experience in situations like this. What's the thought that comes up for you when you try to imagine actually facing the pain and confronting the grief?

Patient: I guess the thought is that if I actually face it, I'll fall apart and won't be able to keep up with the program — like I can't afford to break down right now. I don't know, it just feels safer to keep doing little tasks instead of... dealing with it.

Therapist Answer:
So the fear of losing control and falling apart seems to be a powerful motivator for you to keep using procrastination as a way to avoid feeling the grief. Can you think of a small, low-stakes moment where you might be able to practice being with that fear, without it feeling like it's going to overwhelm you?

Patient: I guess I could try it during my morning coffee — like set a five-minute timer and just notice what comes up before I jump into doing stuff. I don't know, it feels a bit dumb but like low-stakes enough to try. If that feels too much, maybe while I'm doing the dishes I could do the same.

Therapist Answer:
Noticing what comes up while doing everyday activities like making coffee or doing the dishes can be a gentle way to start small. Would it be helpful to commit to doing this tiny experiment for just one of those activities, say, the dishes? What's the value that would be important to you in doing that small act of noticing your thoughts while doing the dishes?

Patient: Okay, yeah — I can commit to trying it with the dishes for a week. I guess the value is rebuilding some trust in myself, like proving I can sit with a little of the feeling and still get stuff done so I don't keep avoiding everything. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to say, but that's probably it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing your thoughts while doing the dishes can be a way to rebuild trust in yourself. Would you be willing to do something else, just a tiny step further, while doing the dishes? Like, what if, while you're noticing your thoughts, you also acknowledge the physical sensations in your body, like the feeling of the water, the sound of the suds, or the weight of the dish in your hand?

Patient: I guess I can try that — maybe set a two-minute timer while I'm doing the dishes and focus on the water temperature, the sound, and the weight of the plate. I don't know, it feels weird and kind of exposing, like it might make me more emotional, but it also feels like a practical way to test if I can handle a little. If it gets overwhelming I'll stop and go back to the usual routine.

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the physical sensations can be a way to create some space between you and your thoughts. When you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, you can always stop and come back to the task. What's the sensation in your body right now, as we're sitting here talking about this? Is there anything that shows up for you?

Patient: I don't know — my chest feels tight and there's this heavy knot in my stomach. My shoulders are tense and my hands feel a bit clammy, like I'm bracing. I guess noticing it makes me kind of awkward and I don't want to get too deep right now; can we just name it and pause there?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is trying to prepare for a potential overwhelm, but it's not quite there yet. Naming the sensations can be helpful, and it's okay if you don't feel like exploring them further now. Let's pause here and acknowledge that you've been willing to take small steps towards being with your feelings, which is something to be proud of. Can you take a deep breath in and out, and then tell me what you're going to do next, based on what we've explored today?

Patient: Okay, I took a deep breath. I guess I'll try the two-minute dishes thing every evening for a week—set a timer, notice the water, sound, and weight of the plate, and stop if it gets too much. I don't know, I'm nervous it won't stick or I'll just do other little tasks instead—what should I do if I can't make myself start or I bail halfway through?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel uncertain about commitment. If you find yourself getting stuck or losing interest, rather than beating yourself up about it, what if you simply acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the current moment, like noticing your breath or the sensation of your feet on the ground? No judgment, just a return to the present.

Patient: I don't know, that sounds... reasonable, I guess, but I'm worried the whole "notice your breath" thing will just feel vague and I'll drift off into doing something else. Could you give me a really concrete script or a tiny checklist to use when I feel like bailing—like exactly what to say to myself or do so it doesn't feel weird? Also, should I set an alarm or tie this to another habit so it's not just another vague goal?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a concrete script can help. Here's a simple one: "I'm going to focus on the water for the next 2 minutes, that's all I'm committing to. I'll notice the way it feels to hold this plate, the sound of the water, and the sensation of my hands. If my mind wanders, I'll gently bring it back to the water. That's all." You can write this down and put it somewhere visible, like on a sticky note next to your sink. As for tying it to another habit, could you think of a task you already do every day that you can attach this to, like right after brushing your teeth or taking a break from work?

Patient: I guess I can tie it to right after I finish dinner — that's when I usually do the dishes anyway. I'll set a 2-minute timer on my phone labeled "water — 2 min" and stick the little script on a Post-it by the sink. I don't know, I'm worried I'll still ignore it, but if I bail I'll try to just notice that I bailed without judging and start again in ten minutes.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a specific time and place can help you show up more consistently. And it's great that you're willing to acknowledge and start again if you do bail – that's a good way to develop a sense of curiosity and kindness towards yourself. What do you think would be a good way to acknowledge the small act of doing the dishes, even if you only do it for 2 minutes, and still feel like you've made progress?

Patient: I don't know — maybe something simple and concrete, like checking a box on a habit tracker or dropping a coin in a jar each time I do it. I guess I could also say out loud, "I sat with this for two minutes," or text one person "did the dishes for 2 mins" so it feels real. I'm skeptical about rewards sounding childish, but maybe a tiny treat (a cup of tea) after counts; if I bail I could give myself partial credit and try again later — does that seem reasonable?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a concrete way to acknowledge progress can be helpful. Your suggestions sound like good options – the habit tracker, dropping a coin, or simply saying it out loud – these all help to create a sense of tangible accomplishment. Giving yourself partial credit and a tiny treat can also be a gentle and kind way to encourage yourself to keep going. What do you think about acknowledging the difficulty of sitting with the feeling, even if it's just for 2 minutes, rather than focusing on the reward?

Patient: I guess acknowledging the difficulty feels more honest and less like I'm bribing myself into feeling things. I don't know — maybe something simple like, "That was hard; I stayed with it for two minutes," would make it real without feeling childish. I don't really like talking about this stuff — can you help me come up with a couple of short lines I can actually say to myself?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Acknowledging the difficulty can help you develop a more realistic and compassionate relationship with yourself. Here are a couple of short lines you can use to acknowledge the experience: "This was hard," "I'm showing up," or "I made it through this 2 minutes." These lines can help you acknowledge the effort without making it sound like a reward or a punishment.

Patient: I guess those lines feel okay — "This was hard" and "I'm showing up" sound about right. I don't know, saying them out loud might feel kind of cheesy or awkward; can you help me figure out a low-key way to practice them so it doesn't feel so weird when I'm actually at the sink?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Saying them out loud might not be the most comfortable way to start. Here's an alternative: could you try simply thinking the lines to yourself while doing the dishes? Just silently say "This was hard" or "I'm showing up" as you're washing, rinsing, and drying. This way, you're still acknowledging your experience, but without having to vocalize it.

Patient: I guess I'll try thinking the lines silently while I'm at the sink. I don't know, I'm worried I'll forget or it'll feel awkward — could we make a tiny checklist I can actually stick by the sink? Something like: 1) set 2-min timer, 2) focus on water for two breaths, 3) silently think "This was hard" once, 4) check the box — I guess is that too rigid?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a checklist can help you remember the steps and reduce feelings of forgetting. And it's not too rigid – it's a gentle reminder to help you stay on track. Writing it out explicitly like this can also make it feel less awkward to say the phrase "This was hard" to yourself.

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll put the checklist by the sink. I'm feeling kind of jittery right now though — like this could just turn into another thing I fail at, and then I'll spiral into doing a bunch of other tiny tasks instead. I don't know, what if we add a super-small fallback? Like, "If you can't start, just put one dish in the sink and set a 30-second timer" — something so tiny it feels impossible to bail on. Would that be okay?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel anxious about committing to a new practice. The fallback plan you proposed is a great idea – it's so small and manageable that it feels impossible to bail on. This way, you can still take a tiny step towards doing the exercise, and if you get stuck, you can take another tiny step. Having this fallback can help you build momentum and confidence.

Patient: I guess that fallback sounds doable, but I'm feeling really jittery and distracted right now — like I might just avoid it anyway and start doing other tiny tasks. I don't know, I guess could we add one more micro-step? Like if I can't even put one dish in the sink, maybe just set the phone timer on the counter and touch it for three seconds — what would you suggest I do in the moment if I still walk away?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of avoidance. The micro-step you're thinking of is actually a great way to break the cycle. If you still can't put one dish in the sink, simply acknowledging your intention to do so is a small act of commitment. When you touch the timer, you can say to yourself, "I started the process" or "I showed up." This acknowledges the tiny action you took, and gives you permission to continue, even if you didn't finish.

Patient: I guess that sounds doable, but I'm really jittery right now — my hands feel shaky and my mind's already jumping to a bunch of other tiny tasks. If I touch the timer and still walk away, I don't know what to do next; can you give me a one-line script to say to myself in that exact moment that actually helps? I'm worried it'll just become another thing to procrastinate on. Also, would it be dumb to have a one-person accountability text I send when I start, like "started dishes — 2 mins"?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When you touch the timer and feel like walking away, you can say to yourself, "I'm okay with not doing it right now." This acknowledges that it's okay to take a break and doesn't add another task to your mental to-do list. It's a gentle way to accept your current moment and allow yourself to come back to it when you're ready.

And having a one-person accountability text is not dumb at all! It can be a helpful reminder that you're committed to this process. The message you choose to send can be something simple like "started dishes — 2 mins" – or even just "starting". The goal is to have a way to acknowledge your action and keep yourself accountable, without feeling too committed or responsible.

Patient: I don't know... that "I'm okay with not doing it right now" line helps a little, but I'm still jittery — my hands are shaking and my brain's already listing other tiny tasks. I need a one-liner that actually reels me back when I touch the timer and want to walk away, something active, not permission to bail; can you give me one or two concrete options I can choose from? 

Also, about the accountability text — I don't want to bother someone or get ignored. Is it dumb to just text myself "started — 2 min"? If the person doesn't reply, won't I just spiral more? I guess I could use a backup plan, but I don't know what that should be.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When you feel like walking away, you can try saying to yourself, "I'll just sit here for 10 more seconds." This phrase gives you a small amount of time to pause and reassess, without immediately abandoning the task.

Alternatively, you can say "I'll just focus on the water for one more second." This phrase helps you build momentum by getting you to focus on the task for just one more brief moment.

Regarding the accountability text, it's not about bothering someone or expecting a response. The goal is to send a simple message that you've taken action, and that's it. You can text yourself "started — 2 min" or any other variation that feels comfortable. If the person doesn't reply, you can just consider it a confirmation that you started, and move on.

Patient: I don't know, I guess those could help. Maybe tweak them to be more active — like "Stay here for 10 seconds and take one full breath" or "Focus on the water for one full breath" so it actually pulls me back instead of giving me permission to bail. I feel kind of stupid even worrying about the exact wording, so yeah, I'll just text myself "started — 2 min" instead of relying on someone else. Which of those two scripts do you think is more likely to actually keep me there?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your tweaks to the scripts are great – "Stay here for 10 seconds and take one full breath" and "Focus on the water for one full breath" are more active and concrete, and they encourage you to engage with the task. "Started — 2 min" is also a good option, as it's simple and straightforward.

Based on your current state, I think "Focus on the water for one full breath" might be a slightly better choice. It's a more direct and specific instruction that encourages you to focus on the task without giving you an excuse to bail.

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll try "Focus on the water for one full breath." But I'm really jittery right now—my hands are shaking and I can already feel that shame and frustration creeping in, like I’m about to mess this up before I start. I don't know, I need one very short, active line to pull me back when that shame spikes (not permission to bail) — something like a two- or three-word cue I can actually say or think. Also, is texting myself "started — 2 min" actually useful, or will that just remind me of past screw-ups and make it worse?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When shame and frustration spike, you need a quick and powerful cue to pull you back. Two or three words can be enough to anchor you in the present moment. Try "Breathe it out" – it's short, simple, and encourages you to release the tension. When shame and frustration arise, say "Breathe it out" to yourself, and bring your attention back to the water.

As for texting yourself "started — 2 min", I think it's not the best choice right now. The message can indeed trigger past self-criticism and reinforce negative self-talk. If you want to track your progress, it's better to stick with something neutral, like "water".

Patient: I don't know, I guess "Breathe it out" could help, but it already feels a little thin. My hands are shaking and I can feel shame spiking—like I'm imagining myself failing before I even start. Maybe something shorter like "One breath" or "Stay here" would actually pull me back more; which do you think would work better? Also, I'm really anxious that even texting "water" will just remind me of past screw-ups and make me spiral—what's a safer micro-check-in if that happens?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When shame is intense, a shorter and more direct cue can be more effective. Between "One breath" and "Stay here", I think "Stay here" might be a slightly stronger anchor. It's more concrete and reminds you to stay present in the current moment, rather than just focusing on the breath.

As for texting "water", you're right that it might trigger past self-criticism. Instead, you could try texting yourself "done" or "present". These simple messages acknowledge that you're taking the first step and are present with yourself, without adding more pressure or self-criticism.

Patient: I guess "Stay here" feels a bit stronger, so I'll try that as my cue — say it once and keep my hand on the timer or the plate for a beat. I'm really jittery and ashamed right now though, like I can feel it ready to yank me into a string of tiny tasks, so I need one more concrete micro-action after the cue — like "Say 'Stay here' + place one dish in the sink" — is that okay? 

Also, I don't know about texting myself "done" yet; that might still sting if I don't get a reply, so could a physical check (drop a coin in a jar or tick a box on a sticky) be a safer backup? What should I do in the exact moment the shame spikes and I start walking away — one very short line or action to actually stop the spiral?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Adding a physical action after the cue can help you stay grounded in the present moment. "Say 'Stay here' + place one dish in the sink" is a great combination – it's concrete, actionable, and gives you a sense of accomplishment. This can help you build momentum and confidence.

As for texting "done", I understand your concern. A physical check-in can be a safer backup. Dropping a coin in a jar or ticking a box on a sticky note can provide a sense of validation and tangible progress.

When shame spikes and you start walking away, one very short line or action can be enough to stop the spiral. Try saying "Stop" or simply taking a deep breath in. This simple, firm statement can help you pause and come back to the present moment.

Patient: I don't know — "Stop" feels kind of harsh and like it'll just make the shame louder. My hands are shaking and I can already feel that old frustration pulling me toward other stuff, so I guess I'd rather try "Stay here" + place one dish, or even squeeze my thumb and forefinger once. Which do you think would actually interrupt the spiral if I freeze up — the verbal cue plus a tiny physical move, or just a breath?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
"Stop" can be a bit too abrupt. "Stay here" + place one dish or squeezing your thumb and forefinger is a great combination. The physical action can provide a sense of grounding and momentum, which can interrupt the spiral of shame and frustration.

Between the two options, I think "Stay here" + place one dish might be slightly more effective. The physical action of placing the dish in the sink can give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum, which can help you stay on track. Squeezing your thumb and forefinger is still a good option, but it might not have the same sense of tangible progress as placing a dish.

Remember, the goal is to interrupt the spiral and get you back to the present moment. Try both options and see what works best for you.

Patient: I guess I'll try "Stay here" + place one dish first — it feels more doable and concrete. My hands are still shaking and I can already feel the shame nudging me toward a bunch of tiny tasks, so I'm not sure it'll actually stick. I don't know — if that doesn't stop me, maybe I'll squeeze my thumb and forefinger once and say "Stay here" again, but that sounds weak. Can we make one more tiny fallback that actually feels impossible to ignore when I'm frozen?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a fallback plan that feels impossible to ignore can be a good way to build momentum. Let's try something a bit more forceful. Instead of squeezing your thumb and forefinger, what if you simply put one finger down on the plate or the sink? That's a very tangible and physical action that's hard to ignore. You could say "Stay here" to yourself as you put your finger down. This might give you a bit more of a shock to get you moving.

Patient: I don't know — putting a finger down might actually snap me back, but it also feels... humiliating, like I'm rehearsing because I always mess up the tiny things. My hands are shaking and I'm already picturing myself fleeing to a dozen other tasks. I guess I'll try the finger, but if I freeze even then, can I just set the timer and touch my phone once? I'm really anxious about this.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see why putting a finger down might feel humiliating, especially if it's associated with feelings of failure. Setting the timer and touching your phone is a good alternative. The action of touching the phone is still physical and tangible, but it's not as personally intrusive as putting a finger down on the plate. It's also a very small, neutral action that won't reinforce feelings of shame or inadequacy. Give it a try and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay... I guess I’ll try the phone-touch fallback first — touch the phone, set the 2‑minute timer, and silently say “Stay here” once. I’m really jittery though; my hands are shaking and this shame feeling's already telling me I’ll mess it up before I even start. If I still walk away after touching the phone, what’s one very immediate thing I can do in that exact moment to stop the spiral? I don’t know, I feel kind of overwhelmed right now.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When you touch the phone, set the timer, and say "Stay here", try to focus on your feet on the ground. Simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight on your heels, the pressure of your feet on the ground. This can help you ground yourself in the present moment and interrupt the spiral of shame and anxiety.

Patient: I don't know, I can try the feet thing, but my hands are shaking and I already feel that shame and frustration creeping in like I’m about to run. Can we pick one ultra-simple, 1‑second move I can do in the exact moment I start walking away — something like "plant feet and press palms on the counter once" — would that actually snap the spiral? I guess I'm nervous it'll just make me feel stupid or like another failed attempt.
