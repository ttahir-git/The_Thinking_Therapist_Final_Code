Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — like my whole identity is wrapped up in the business and I don't know who I am beyond that. With the kids gone and the PTSD stuff, there's this emptiness and I'm not sure what actually matters to me anymore. I don't know, I guess I'm just... unsure where to even begin.

Therapist: That sounds like a really challenging and vulnerable place to be. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge this sense of uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what "I don't know" means to you in this moment?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it means my head just goes blank and I can't tell what's important to me anymore. When you ask me to name things I get this tightness in my chest and I start wanting to look away, so saying "I don't know" feels safer.

Therapist: The physical sensations and the avoidance behaviors that come with it. It sounds like "I don't know" has become a way to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed. Can you imagine what would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to lean into that uncertainty, and instead of looking away, you just stayed with the feeling of not knowing? What would you experience?

Patient: I guess if I tried to sit with it, I'd notice this tightness in my chest and my breathing gets shallow, and then my mind kind of skips — like a loop of old stuff I don't want to feel. I start getting flashes of things I thought I'd locked away, and then shame and this stupid urge to be "useful" again so I don't have to feel it. I don't know, I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to avoid the discomfort of feeling these old emotions and thoughts, which is understandable. Taking a step back and acknowledging that feeling overwhelmed is actually a sign that you're making progress. Would you be willing to pause for just a deep breath with me, and when you're ready, we can try to approach this together at a slower pace?

Patient: Okay, I can try a breath with you — inhale, exhale. I don't know, it helped a bit but my chest is still tight. Can we slow down and not dive into the flashbacks yet? I guess maybe start with something small, like what used to make me happy before the business took over.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the small step you took by agreeing to breathe with me. That takes a lot of courage. Now, let's explore what you said: what used to make you happy before the business took over. What comes to mind, even if it's just a tiny fragment, something that might feel nostalgic or pleasant?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it was the little creative things—early mornings with coffee and my sketchbook, noodling on the guitar, or getting my hands dirty in the garden. I used to lose time in that stuff and it felt quietly satisfying, not about being useful or productive.

Therapist: It sounds like those activities felt nourishing for you, like they were bringing you joy and a sense of calm. Those small, quiet pleasures can be a great starting point for rediscovering what's meaningful to you. What would happen if, even just for a tiny bit, you were to bring one of those activities into your life again, not to make a big plan or to be "productive," but just to allow yourself to do it because it feels satisfying?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it might feel kind of nice, like a small breath of normal, but I also get this nagging thought that it's a waste of time and I should be working. Maybe I could try sketching for like 15 minutes tomorrow morning, but I'm already feeling weird about it — like it'll just remind me of everything I'm avoiding. Can we not push too deep right now?

Therapist: It sounds like the nagging thought is coming up again, and it's making it harder for you to take that small step. You're right, we don't need to push too deep right now. Let's just focus on acknowledging the thought and the emotions around it. Would you be willing to just observe this thought as it is, without judgment, for just a moment?

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try to observe it for a bit. When I do, I notice this "I should be working" voice and my chest gets tight, and then my brain starts piling on judgments — like it's stupid or selfish to take time — and I start wanting to do something to fix it. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable, so can we keep this small and slow?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the story your mind is creating around this thought, and how it's making you feel. You're already taking a big step by acknowledging and observing it. Let's keep the pace slow and gentle. What's the first thing you might do if you were to commit to just 15 minutes of sketching tomorrow morning, without any expectations or trying to fix the thought?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'd leave my sketchbook on the kitchen table and set a 15-minute timer on my phone so it's easy to start. Maybe make the coffee first, sit down, and just scribble—no expectations. I'm already feeling weird about it though, so can we keep this really small and not make a plan beyond that?

Therapist: You're breaking down the action into tiny, manageable steps. Just having the sketchbook and the timer on the table, making the coffee, and sitting down – that's a small, low-stakes starting point. No pressure, no expectations. What's the first sensation you notice when you imagine yourself doing that tomorrow morning?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I notice a tiny warmth or looseness in my chest and the smell of coffee, and my fingers feel a little restless—like they want to move. At the same time there's that tight, watchful feeling like I'm being judged, and I'm already wanting to look away, so can we keep this gentle?

Therapist: Those sensations are really interesting. It sounds like there's a mix of physical relaxation and a watchful, critical voice. Let's just observe the physical sensations for a moment, and see if we can gently acknowledge the critical voice without judgment. Can you say it with me: "This critical voice is here, watching over me, and it's saying..."?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's saying stuff like, "You're wasting time, get back to work, who do you think you are to take time for yourself." Saying it out loud already makes my chest tight — can we slow down a bit? I'm trying, but it's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like the critical voice is triggered just by acknowledging it. Let's take a deep breath together, and then let's just pause for a moment. Would you be willing to just sit with the physical sensations in your chest, and the voice in your head, without trying to change or fix anything for a few more breaths?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try to sit with it for a few breaths. My chest is tight and my breathing gets shallow, and when I notice that my head just starts replaying stuff and this hot shame comes up and I want to look away. Can we keep this really slow? I'm already feeling like I might shut down if we push too far.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to feeling overwhelmed. Let's slow down even further. Let's focus just on the sensation of your breath, and let go of trying to change or fix anything. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it in any way?

Patient: I don't know, I guess when I try I notice a tiny rise in my chest and the air feels a bit cooler going in, warmer out. My mind immediately pulls to the to-do list and that judge voice and then my chest tightens. Can we keep this really slow? I'm worried I'll shut down if we go deeper.

Therapist: It sounds like you're finding a tiny glimmer of awareness, and it's getting pulled away from you. That's okay. Let's not try to grasp or hold onto it, but just let it be. What if, instead of trying to control your breath, we just acknowledge the tiny observation you made about the sensation of the air going in and out?

Patient: I don't know, I guess noticing the cool-in warm-out makes my chest loosen a little, but then that judge voice pipes up and I want to look away. I'm already feeling weird about staying with this, so can we not go deeper right now? Maybe we could stick to something practical—like how to actually make that 15-minute sketch happen without it turning into a big thing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit uneasy about exploring further. Let's shift gears a bit and focus on the practical aspect of committing to that 15-minute sketch. What's one small step you could take right now, just to make it more concrete, like setting a reminder on your phone or making a note to yourself?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could set a phone reminder for 7:30 tomorrow and leave my sketchbook on the kitchen table tonight. Maybe even stick a little note on the kettle that just says "15 mins" so it feels low-pressure. I'm already feeling weird about it though—can we keep this small and not make it into a big goal?

Therapist: You're taking concrete steps to make it happen, and that's great. Let's not put too much pressure on making it a big goal. Let's just focus on having the sketchbook and the reminder in place, and see how that feels. Would you be willing to leave it at that, and just let it be for now, without adding any expectations or thoughts about whether you'll actually do it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can leave it at that — I'll set the 7:30 reminder and put the sketchbook on the table tonight. But I'm already feeling weird, like I probably won't do it and then I'll feel guilty, and that makes me want to bail. Can we talk about what to do if I skip it so it feels less scary?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about what might happen if you don't follow through, and that's creating more anxiety. Let's explore that instead of trying to avoid it. What's the worst that could happen if you don't do the 15 minutes of sketching tomorrow? What's the smallest, most manageable consequence you can imagine?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the worst is that I'll feel guilty and stupid, like even the tiny stuff proves I'm failing, and then I'll just avoid trying again and throw myself into work to not feel it. The smallest consequence is probably just being annoyed with myself for a few hours and then forgetting about it — not the end of the world. I'm already feeling weird talking about failing, so can we keep this gentle?

Therapist: You're being really honest with yourself about what's driving your anxiety. Let's focus on the smallest consequence you mentioned, being annoyed with yourself for a few hours. Can you think of a gentle, kind phrase to say to yourself if that happens, something that acknowledges your feelings without adding more self-criticism?

Patient: I don't know, I guess maybe something like, "It's okay — you tried, that's enough for now," or "You're allowed to be imperfect." Saying that already feels awkward and a bit fake, though. Can we talk about what would actually make it feel safer to try so I don't bail — like small accountability or a fallback plan?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to make the experience feel more comfortable. Let's explore what would make it feel safer to try. What if, instead of relying on a big reward or punishment, you had a small, tangible reminder that you could refer to if you needed it? Something like a sticky note on your fridge, or a specific phrase on your phone lock screen?

Patient: I don't know, I guess a sticky note on the kettle that says “15 mins — you’re allowed” or putting “this is enough” on my lock screen might make it feel safer. Maybe a fallback could be: if I skip, I do 5 minutes instead or text one person a quick “I tried” so it doesn’t feel like a big failure. I'm already feeling awkward about needing help, so can we keep any accountability really low-key?

Therapist: You're finding ways to make the experience feel more comfortable and less about needing external accountability. Let's keep it even more low-key. What if, instead of relying on a specific text or reminder, you just told one person you trust that you're trying to do something small for yourself, just to let them know you're thinking about taking care of yourself?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could tell my friend Mara — she's pretty low-key and won't turn it into a big deal. Maybe a one-line text like, "Trying 15 mins of sketching tomorrow, that's it," and if I skip I can just send "didn't make it" so it feels smaller. I'm already feeling awkward about needing someone, so can we keep that the only step and not add more pressure?

Therapist: It sounds like you've found a way to share with someone you trust without adding more pressure. Let's just acknowledge that and let it be for now. No need to explore further. You've made a start, and that's something to build on. We can check in with Mara's one-line text later if you'd like.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can text Mara that one-line. I'm already feeling weird about asking for help — can you help me word the message so it sounds really low-key? I don't want it to feel dramatic or like I'm making a big deal.

Therapist: Let's make it as casual as possible. What if you just send her a simple text, like "hey, just thought I'd try doing something for myself tomorrow, maybe 15 minutes of sketching. If I don't get it done, no big deal"?

Patient: I don't know, I guess something really short would feel safest. Could you make a couple of tiny options and I’ll pick one? Like:

- "hey Mara, gonna try 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. no big deal if I don't."
- "quick thing — trying 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. if I skip, all good."

Which one sounds less dramatic? I'm already feeling weird about sending it, so can we keep it at that and not make it fancier?

Therapist: I've come up with two options that are very low-key. Take a look and see which one feels safest for you:

- "hey Mara, gonna try 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. no big deal if I don't."
- "quick thing — trying 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. if I skip, all good."

Which one feels more like you?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the first one feels less dramatic — "hey Mara, gonna try 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. no big deal if I don't." I'm already feeling weird about actually sending it though. What if I still don't hit send in the morning — what should I do then?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about not sending it, and that's okay. Let's focus on what to do if you don't send it. What if, right now, you just put the phone down and walk away? No action, no decision, just a pause. Would that be okay with you?

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could help — but I can already hear myself getting annoyed if I don't send it and then feel stupid. Maybe a middle ground is drafting the message now and saving it as a draft, then putting the phone down so there's no pressure to hit send in the morning. I'm feeling kind of weird about all this, so can we keep it really small and not decide more right now?

Therapist: Drafting the message and saving it as a draft can help take the pressure off. That's a good step. Let's just focus on taking that one small action. What if you simply write the message now, but don't hit send? Just write it and then put the phone down, without thinking about sending it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can write it now and save it as a draft.  
Message: "hey Mara, gonna try 15 mins of sketching tomorrow. no big deal if I don't."  
I'm already feeling weird about it—can we just leave it there and talk about how that feels for a minute?

Therapist: You've taken that small step. Now, let's focus on how it feels to have written the message and saved it as a draft. Can you tell me more about what's in your body right now?

Patient: I don't know, I guess my chest is still kind of tight and my breathing's shallow, but there's a tiny looseness like a small exhale after I saved the message. My hands feel restless and fidgety, and there's this low, nervous churn in my stomach like I'm waiting for something to go wrong. Saying that already makes me awkward and I want to look away, so can we keep this small and not dig too deep right now?

Therapist: You're noticing the physical sensations that are still present, and they're still making you feel uncomfortable. Let's just acknowledge them without judgment. Can you just be with the feeling of your hands being restless and the nervous churn in your stomach for a moment? No need to try to change or make sense of it just yet.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try. My hands are restless, fingers tapping without meaning, my stomach feels like a knot, and my breath is shallow — there's this urge to get up and do something. I'm already feeling exposed and want to look away, so can we keep this really small and just sit with it for a bit without analyzing?
