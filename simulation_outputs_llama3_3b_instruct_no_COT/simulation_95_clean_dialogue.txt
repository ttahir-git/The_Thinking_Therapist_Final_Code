Patient: Hi — I've been ruminating a lot about my performance at this new, more demanding nursing role, and that anticipatory anxiety tends to morph into avoidance and procrastination. I notice I intellectualize the whole thing — constructing elaborate hypothetical failures and performance metrics — instead of actually feeling the underlying fear, which seems to perpetuate the cycle.

Therapist: So, you're recognizing that your mind is getting caught up in all these hypothetical scenarios and performance metrics, which is keeping you from connecting with the underlying fear. Can you say more about what it would be like if you were able to let go of that mental 'what-if' thinking, and just feel the fear without getting caught up in it?

Patient: If I could relinquish that perpetual "what-if" calculus, theoretically there'd be much less cognitive load and more bandwidth to actually execute tasks instead of rehearsing catastrophes. Practically, I imagine fewer delays, a clearer workflow, and a greater tolerance for ambiguity — but I'm saying that as a schematic, not like I'm actually in touch with the underlying fear. I suspect the real experience would be messy and visceral — maybe a constriction or breathlessness — and ideally something I could observe rather than let dictate avoidance, though I don't really know how to get from here to there.

Therapist: It sounds like you're acknowledging that your current mental approach is unworkable, and you'd like to break free from it. You're also touching on the idea that there's a more direct experience that's elusive, which is the underlying fear. What's interesting is that you mention observing the experience, rather than trying to control it. What if, for just a moment, you were to allow the constriction or breathlessness to simply be, without judgment, and see what that might reveal?

Patient: If I try to let the constriction be, my reflex is to inventory it — where it is, how intense, what it might mean — instead of actually inhabiting it. When I do hold it for a breath there's a tightness in my chest and a hollow in my stomach, and almost immediately a narrative pops up: "This is evidence you'll fail," which pulls me back into analysis. I could attempt to stay with it more, but I'm anxious that sitting with it will just amplify it into full-blown panic, so I default to thinking my way out.

Therapist: You're recognizing that even when you try to stay with the constriction, your mind quickly takes over with more thinking, and a narrative that reinforces your fears. It's like there's a habitual response that kicks in, "Ah, this is more evidence I need to protect myself." Can you think of a small, tiny, almost imperceptible step you could take, just a tiny bit, to allow yourself to hold this physical sensation, the tightness in your chest and the hollow feeling, without immediately trying to analyze or push it away?

Patient: Maybe a micro-experiment: when I notice the tightness, I could do one deliberate 4‑second inhale and 6‑second exhale, place a hand on my chest or belly, and silently label the sensation "tightness" once—then go back to the task. It feels doable in theory because it's tiny and bounded, but honestly I'm already visualizing my mind hijacking it into a full narrative and I'm worried it will amplify rather than settle.

Therapist: You're considering a tiny, tangible step to experiment with holding the sensation, and that's a good starting point. What would it be like, in this moment, if you were to allow the tightness to simply be, without the mental labeling, and see if that would be enough to allow you to just stay with it for a brief moment, without immediately getting caught up in the narrative?

Patient: Hypothetically, allowing the tightness to simply be—without my reflexive semantic tagging—might deprive the catastrophe-generating narrative of its fuel and let the sensation exist as a lower‑intensity background signal. In my imagination it would feel like a persistent but manageable constriction in the chest and a hollow in the belly, with breathing slightly slower, rather than the urgent alarm it usually becomes. I'm still anxious that staying with it could be like tugging on a thread that unravels into panic—so I'm oscillating between curiosity and real fear. I could try holding it for one slow breath right now if you're willing to guide me, though I'm already verbalizing about it instead of just doing it.

Therapist: You're exploring the idea that by not labeling the sensation, you might be able to reduce its intensity and let it coexist as a more manageable presence. Now, I'd like to ask: would it be possible for you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, simply say to yourself "tightness" without adding any other thoughts or interpretation? Just "tightness"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it now: deep breath in, and as I exhale I said to myself, "tightness." When I did that there was a small, almost imperceptible loosening in my chest, like the story paused for a second, but my mind immediately started theorizing that the effect is transient. I'm curious because it felt a bit helpful, and at the same time I'm skeptical and already thinking about whether repeating it will just become another ritual.

Therapist: You noticed a slight loosening in your chest, which is a small step forward. The fact that your mind immediately started theorizing about the transience of the effect is also notable. What would it be like if, for just this one breath, you were to set aside your skepticism, and simply allowed the sensation of the "tightness" to persist for another breath, without adding any thoughts about it being transient or not?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to set the skepticism aside and just let it be for another breath. I breathed in and out, and there was a small, real softening in the chest—less of an alarm and more like a low hum—so it didn't blow up into panic. At the same time my head immediately started narrating reasons why that softening is meaningless, so I'm left oscillating between a tiny felt relief and this reflexive analysis that wants to turn it into data. I can try to stay with it longer, but honestly I'm nervous that staying will just give the mind more material to chew on.

Therapist: You're able to notice a softer, more calming sensation in your chest, but your mind is still trying to analyze it, labeling it as "meaningless." You're caught in a cycle of oscillation between the tiny sense of relief and the reflexive analysis. What would it be like if, for just one more breath, you were to gently, very gently, allow the narrative to exist without judgment, without trying to label or analyze it? Just observe it, as you're doing now, without adding anything else?

Patient: If I do that—let the narrative sit there without trying to fix or interpret it—I picture the thoughts like flyers pinned to a corkboard: present, readable, but not demanding action. When I actually try it for a breath there’s a faint loosening in my chest and the story dulls a little, but my reflex is to catalog the thought—its tone, its likelihood, how it might predict failure—so I don't fully inhabit the sensation. I can try one more breath now if you'd like to guide me, though I'm already worried it'll just become another procedural thing I perform instead of actually feeling.

Therapist: You're getting closer to noticing the narrative as a distinct entity that can be observed without judgment. The picture of thoughts as flyers on a corkboard is a helpful way to describe it. Now, I'd like to explore the concern that you're worried about: what if, by letting go of the need to catalog the thought, you're not actually feeling the underlying sensation, but rather just doing a new mental task? What would be the difference, for just one more breath, if you were to focus on the physical sensation in your chest, without trying to label it or analyze it?

Patient: I think the practical difference is a shift from meta-cognitive narration to raw interoception — noticing rhythm, pressure, temperature, location — so there's less semantic fuel for the catastrophe machine. If I focus on the chest sensation for one breath instead of labeling it, it feels more like a localized pressure behind the sternum and a hollow low in the belly, and the narrative's tempo slows down. I'll try one breath now: inhale, exhale — that time the tightness softened a notch and didn't immediately cascade into a full story, though my brain is already scheming about why that softness is probably temporary.

Therapist: You're noticing a shift from thinking about the thought to paying attention to the physical sensation, and that's allowing the narrative to slow down. It sounds like you're getting more familiar with the sensation of the tightness, and that's helping to reduce its power. What would it be like if, for just this one breath, you were to take a tiny step further, and instead of just noticing the sensation, you were to try to inhabit it, to sit with it, without labeling it or trying to analyze it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—what exactly do you mean by "inhabit it" in practical terms? As a nurse I'm wired for protocols, so that phrasing sounds like another procedure my anxious mind will turn into a ritual of analysis rather than actual feeling. I want to try, but I'm worried I'll just perform another step unless you give me a very concrete, simple prompt to anchor me.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try. By "inhabit it," I mean simply being with the sensation, allowing it to exist in the present moment, without trying to change it, label it, or analyze it. Think of it as a very gentle, small experiment: would you be willing to try one more breath, and on that breath, simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to do anything with it, without labeling it, without thinking about it? Just be with it. You can start with just a simple physical anchor, like placing a hand on your chest or belly, to help you focus.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. I put my hand on my chest, took a slow inhale and exhale, and there was a brief warmth and a slight loosening, like the pressure softened a notch. Almost immediately my head began rehearsing that it was temporary and listing reasons why it wouldn’t last, so I caught myself cataloging the experience instead of inhabiting it. I’m worried this will just become another procedural ritual unless you give me a very concrete cue to tether me when the narration hijacks me — could you suggest something specific to do in that moment?

Therapist: You were able to notice a brief softening of the pressure, but your mind quickly pulled back into analysis. I'm glad you're willing to explore this further. When you catch yourself cataloging the experience, what if, in that moment, you were to simply say to yourself, "Calm," without thinking about it, without trying to justify or analyze it? Just a simple, one-syllable word: "Calm." This is a very concrete cue to help you shift your focus back to the sensation, without adding more thinking. Would you be willing to try it?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try saying "Calm." I put my hand on my chest, took a slow inhale, and on the exhale I silently said "Calm" once; there was a small loosening, like the alarm volume dropped. Almost instantly my mind started qualifying it—temporary, placebo, ritual—so I can see this needs a very concrete, repeatable anchor to outcompete my analytic reflex; could you give me one simple physical cue to do the moment the narration hijacks me?

Therapist: You were able to soften the sensation with the word "Calm," but your mind quickly pulled back into analysis. I think we're making progress here. For the physical anchor, I'd like you to try this: when you feel the narration hijacking you, take a slight pause, and touch your thumb to your index finger, just for a brief moment, as if you're tracing a finger on an invisible surface. This small, physical act can help you break the cycle of analysis and bring your focus back to the sensation. Would you be willing to try this when you feel the narrative taking over?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the thumb-to-index touch. I have to say there's a hot flush of shame and irritation when I imagine doing something so small — it feels almost humiliating, which tightens my chest and makes the narrator louder — but I'm willing to do it when I notice the hijack. Do you want me to hold the touch for a specific count (like two or three seconds) so it's a concrete cue?

Therapist: You're noticing the emotional response to the idea of doing something seemingly simple, and how it's actually tightening your chest and amplifying the narrative. That's a crucial insight. Holding the touch for a specific count can be helpful, but I'd like to try something even more concrete. Let's try a physical anchor that's very small and almost imperceptible: instead of holding your thumb and index finger together, just lightly tap the tip of your thumb against your palm. This tiny, almost imperceptible touch can be a very gentle reminder to bring your attention back to the sensation. Would you be willing to try this when you feel the narrative taking over?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the thumb-to-palm tap. I have to admit there's a hot flush of shame and irritation — as a nurse it feels almost infantilizing, which paradoxically tightens my chest and hands the narrator more ammo — but I'm willing to experiment. Would you suggest I pair the tap with the silent "Calm" cue or just do the tap alone for a one-second pause when the narration hijacks me?

Therapist: You're noticing that the shame and irritation are actually tightening your physical body, which is feeding the narrative. I think we're getting close to a breakthrough. Let's try pairing the tap with the "Calm" cue. When you feel the narrative taking over, take a brief pause, and gently tap your thumb against your palm, and then, immediately after the tap, silently say "Calm." This way, the physical anchor is followed by a calming cue, which can help counteract the narrative's influence. Would you be willing to try this combination?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the tap + "Calm." I did a light thumb-to-palm tap and silently said "Calm" just now, and I felt a tiny easing in the chest, but the narrator immediately started belittling it as flimsy and transient, which makes me irritated and a bit ashamed for needing something so small. I'm willing to experiment with doing it during my shift, but I worry it'll just become another ritual — how often do you think I should practice it so it becomes helpful rather than another thing to overanalyze?

Therapist: You're noticing that the temporary easing was met with the narrator's criticism, which is triggering feelings of irritation and shame. I think this is a great opportunity to practice this technique during your shift, but I wouldn't recommend doing it as a separate exercise. Instead, I'd like you to try incorporating the tap + "Calm" into your regular workflow, so it becomes a habitual part of your practice. Let's start with small, manageable steps: when you catch yourself getting caught up in the narrative, take a brief pause, tap your thumb against your palm, and say "Calm" in a very soft voice. See how this feels in different moments of the day, and don't worry too much about whether you're doing it "right" or "wrong." Just focus on the process, and we can discuss any challenges that arise.

Patient: Okay — I'm willing to try integrating the tap + "Calm" into my workflow, but I have a bunch of reservations. As a nurse it feels almost infantilizing to do something so small in front of colleagues, and that shame tightens my chest and fuels more narration, so I'm worried it will backfire or become yet another ritual I obsess about. Practically, could we think about discreet variants (like tapping under a glove or a micro-breath with hand on sternum) and a simple dosing guideline so I don't turn it into a checklist? Also, if that intrusive memory or a strong wave of shame hits mid-shift, is the tap + "Calm" enough, or should I also name the thought briefly — and if so, how do I avoid converting that into an analytic loop? I want concrete, bounded steps because my default is to overconceptualize everything and that usually defeats the purpose.

Therapist: You're right to be concerned about the potential for this to feel infantilizing or become another source of anxiety. Let's explore some variations that might make it feel more private and less conspicuous. For example, you could try tapping your fingers together on your thigh or under a layer of clothing, or even just a quick tap of your index finger on your knee. These small, subtle variations might help you feel more comfortable with the physical anchor.

Regarding the dosing guideline, I'd suggest starting with a single "Calm" cue per time the narrative hijacks you, and then gradually increase the frequency as you become more comfortable with the practice. This way, you're not turning it into a checklist, but rather focusing on the process of the moment.

Regarding the second question, you're right to consider how to handle strong emotions or intrusive memories mid-shift. In those moments, the tap + "Calm" might not be enough to calm the narrative. If that's the case, you could try adding a brief, one-syllable label to the thought, like "Ah" or "Hmm," without analyzing or judging it. This can help you acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. The key is to keep the response brief and non-committal, without trying to change the thought or analyze it further.

Patient: Okay — I'm jumpy and a bit scattered right now, so thanks for the concrete options; it helps even if I'm simultaneously worried about making it another ritual. Tapping under a glove or on my thigh plus a single "Calm" feels more palatable, but I need an ultra-specific script so my analytic brain doesn't invent ten variants: what exactly do I do if one tap + "Calm" doesn't shift things — do I repeat the sequence a set number of times, or switch to a brief 4‑in/6‑out breath, or allow myself a two‑minute step-out? And with a strong intrusive memory or shame wave, do you recommend an in‑place micro‑protocol I can use discreetly, or is it better to briefly excuse myself — I keep oscillating between wanting rules and fearing that rules will become another thing to overthink.

Therapist: Let's break down the sequence into a very specific, concrete protocol. If one tap + "Calm" doesn't shift the narrative, I'd recommend repeating the sequence for exactly 3-4 times, followed by a 4-inh/6-exh breath. This can help you build momentum and give your brain a chance to adjust.

As for dealing with strong intrusive memories or shame waves, I'd suggest having a discreet protocol that you can use in a private area, like a small bathroom or a secluded spot outside. A possible protocol could be: (1) excuse yourself to the designated spot for 30 seconds to 1 minute, (2) take a few deep, slow breaths, (3) place a hand on your heart or belly, and (4) say "Calm" to yourself in a very soft voice. This allows you to step away from the situation, calm down, and regain your composure without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Okay — this is clearer and I can hold a little of it, but my capacity to marshal more rules right now feels thin and the shame still warms my face when I think of doing something so small in front of others. Quick clarifying questions so my brain doesn't invent fifty variants: when you say repeat the tap+“Calm” 3–4 times, do you mean immediate consecutive repeats (back-to-back) or spaced breaths between each? If it's ineffective after that sequence plus a 4/6 breath, is the agreed threshold to excuse myself for up to 30–60 seconds and do the private protocol, and should I limit attempts per hour so it doesn't become a checklist? I can try an if-this-then-that rule (3 taps back-to-back → one 4/6 breath → if still hijacked, step out 30–60s), but I already feel my mind auditioning caveats, which is exhausting.

Therapist: Let's clarify the sequence. I meant spaced breaths between each repetition, not consecutive repeats. So, if you tap + "Calm" 3-4 times, wait for a few breaths (4-6) before checking in with your body and seeing if the narrative has shifted.

Regarding the excuse yourself protocol, it's not about limiting attempts per hour, but rather using it as a last resort when you feel overwhelmed or stuck. If you're already feeling fatigued from trying to manage your anxiety, it's essential to prioritize your well-being. If you find that you're needing to excuse yourself frequently, it might be a sign that you need to revisit our previous discussions about building up your tolerance and developing more coping strategies.

Let's focus on the sequence and protocol for now. If you find that the tap + "Calm" sequence is still not working, take a few deep breaths, and then excuse yourself to the private protocol area for 30-60 seconds to recharge.

Patient: Okay — this helps, but I'm still a bit foggy on one practical detail: what exactly should count as "still hijacked"—is that a time cutoff (like 30–60 seconds) or a subjective sense (when the panic feels like it's escalating)? 

Also, there are times I literally can't step off the floor — what's the minimal, absolutely discreet micro‑protocol for those moments (under a glove tap + one 4/6 breath, or something even smaller?) so I don't have to invent ten variants mid-shift. 

I can feel my analytic brain already turning this into a checklist and that sensation is draining me — should I be tracking attempts at all, or just treating it as private practice and not logging anything?

Therapist: Let's clarify the "still hijacked" criterion. For now, let's use a subjective sense: if you feel like the panic or anxiety is escalating or becoming more intense, or if you're still caught up in the narrative and can't seem to shift your focus back to the present moment, that's a good indication that it's still hijacked.

Regarding the minimal protocol for situations where you can't step off the floor, I'd suggest a very simple, almost imperceptible action: just the tap + one 4/6 breath. This is a tiny, almost invisible cue that can help you break the cycle without drawing attention to yourself. You can do this discreetly, even under a glove or in a crowded space.

As for tracking attempts, I'd advise against it. This is private practice, and keeping a log can indeed create another layer of analysis and self-judgment. Let's focus on treating this as a personal, discreet exercise, and not a task to be checked off a list. Just remember that the goal is to develop a more mindful, flexible approach to managing your anxiety, not to create another source of stress or anxiety.

Patient: Okay — I can probably hold a very short script: tap-under-glove → silently say "Calm" → one 4‑in/6‑out breath. If that doesn't shift things, wait three normal breaths and repeat the sequence once more, and if it's still escalating, excuse myself for 30–60 seconds. My brain is already auditioning a hundred caveats and wants to make this a checklist — how rigid should I be about that single repeat so it doesn't become another ritual? My capacity to parse more rules is pretty thin right now, so a simple, firm guideline would help.

Therapist: Let's make the repeat protocol simple and flexible. Here's a revised guideline: if the initial sequence doesn't shift things, simply repeat the sequence one more time, without adding or subtracting anything. Don't worry about "getting it right" or "doing it correctly." Just focus on repeating the sequence exactly as you did before.

If that doesn't work, excuse yourself for 30-60 seconds and use the private protocol. Remember, this is not a rigid checklist, but a flexible tool to help you manage your anxiety in the moment.

To help your brain resist adding caveats and turning this into a ritual, I'd suggest this: whenever you think "I have to repeat it exactly this way" or "I have to do it just like that," pause for a deep breath and remind yourself that this is a private, personal practice. You can say to yourself, "I'm just trying to stay present and calm, not to check off a list." This can help you let go of the need for perfection and simply focus on the process.

Patient: I can try that internal script—saying, "I'm just trying to stay present and calm"—but my meta-cognitive reflex already wants to generate a dozen phrasings and evaluate which one is optimal, which of course defeats the point. My energy is pretty low and the idea of doing anything that could be noticed by coworkers makes my chest tighten and my mind catastrophize. Could we settle on one ultra-minimal, internal phrase (something like "I'm here") that feels less performative, and one discreet place I can practice it once a day so I don't turn it into another checklist?

Therapist: I understand that your meta-cognitive reflex is already working against you. Let's simplify the internal phrase to something extremely minimal and private. How about just "here"? It's a simple, non-verbal reminder that you're present in the moment, without adding any cognitive weight.

As for the discreet practice spot, I'd suggest practicing this in a private space, like a quiet corner of the bathroom or a small room where you can sit without being disturbed. Choose a spot where you feel safe and relaxed, and commit to practicing once a day, even if it's just for 30 seconds. This will help you build consistency and make the practice more automatic.

Remember, the goal is to develop a sense of presence and calm, not to add another task to your mental to-do list. Keep it simple, and let's focus on building a small, manageable habit.

Patient: "Here" is acceptably minimal — I can hold that in my head without immediately turning it into a protocol. My energy's pretty attenuated right now though, so even that feels like a lot; the idea of doing anything noticeable still heats my face and tightens my chest. Concretely, I can try: tap-under-glove → silently say "here" → one 4-in/6-out breath, and if I'm too drained, just the single 4/6 breath; is it okay if I skip the formal one-minute practice some days without it becoming evidence I'm failing at this?

Therapist: Given your low energy levels, let's simplify the practice even further. Yes, it's perfectly okay to skip the formal practice some days. In fact, it's better than feeling like you're failing or have to "do it right" every time. Just acknowledge to yourself that you're having a tough day, and that's okay. You can always come back to the practice when you feel more energized.

As for the practice itself, I think the revised sequence you mentioned – tap-under-glove → silently say "here" → 4-in/6-out breath – is a great compromise. If you're feeling too drained to do the full sequence, the single 4-in/6-out breath can be a gentle reminder to take a pause and breathe without feeling like you're neglecting the practice.

Patient: Okay — that actually feels…manageable, even if my chest tightens just thinking about doing it. Part of me immediately wants empirical validation: will the tap + "here" + one 4/6 breath actually interrupt the procrastination loop, or am I just proceduralizing another artefact my meta‑cognitive reflex will weaponize? I don't have the bandwidth to trial ten variants — can you suggest one tiny, non‑tracking sign I can watch for that would indicate it's working, without turning it into another checklist?

Therapist: It's natural to want empirical validation, but let's focus on a non-tracking indicator that can help you gauge the effectiveness of the practice without getting caught up in analysis. Here's a simple, tiny sign to watch for: a slight softening of the physical sensation in your chest. This could be a gentle relaxation of the muscles, a decrease in the tightness, or simply a sense of the sensation becoming less overwhelming.

When you notice this softening, take a brief moment to acknowledge it to yourself, even if it's just a mental "yes, that's a sign of progress." This can help you build confidence in the practice without creating another level of complexity or analysis. Remember, the goal is to develop a sense of presence and calm, not to track your progress or evaluate the effectiveness of the practice.

Patient: Okay — that somatic softening as the non‑tracking indicator actually feels doable in principle; as a nurse I get the appeal of a low‑bandwidth vital sign. My reflex, though, is to quantify it — is any perceptible decrease for a single breath enough to count as a win, or should it persist for, say, three breaths before I mentally acknowledge it with a quiet "yes"? I'm pretty depleted, so "any detectable decrease" would be easier for me to hold, but I'm already worried that even that tiny mental note will become another thing my brain weaponizes into analysis.

Therapist: I understand your reflex to quantify the softening, but let's simplify it further to avoid analysis. Instead of focusing on a specific amount of time or number of breaths, let's use a single, brief acknowledgment. When you notice the softening, say to yourself, "Done." This is a very simple, one-syllable word that acknowledges the fact that you've taken a pause and allowed yourself to breathe. It's not about evaluating the extent of the softening, but simply acknowledging the action of taking a pause.

Remember, the goal is to develop a sense of presence and calm, not to create another layer of analysis. By using the word "Done," you're acknowledging that you've taken a small step towards managing your anxiety, without getting caught up in details.

Patient: Okay — "Done" as a one‑syllable acknowledgment feels simple enough to hold in my head without immediately turning into an algorithm. My meta‑cognitive reflex will still try to operationalize it (counting, timing, grading the softening), and I'm already low on bandwidth so even that small struggle feels onerous. A couple of concrete clarifications would help: should I say "Done" silently in my head or whisper it under my breath? And if I do the tap→"here"→breath sequence and genuinely feel no softening, should I still give myself a private "Done" to avoid turning it into another evaluative loop?

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. Say "Done" under your breath. This way, you're acknowledging the action without drawing attention to yourself or making a conscious effort to vocalize it. Whispering it can feel like a gentle, private acknowledgement.

Regarding the second question, if you genuinely feel no softening after the tap→"here"→breath sequence, you can still give yourself a private "Done" without judgment. This acknowledges that you've taken the pause, without evaluating its effectiveness. Think of it as a small act of kindness towards yourself, rather than a critical evaluation.

Remember, the goal is to develop a sense of presence and calm, not to create another level of analysis or self-evaluation. By acknowledging the action, you're showing yourself that you're taking care of yourself, even if the outcome isn't what you expected.

Patient: Okay — whispering "Done" seems doable in theory, but picturing a coworker overhearing makes my chest tighten and my brain start rehearsing contingencies. I'm already cataloging failure modes: if I whisper and nothing softens, do I keep repeating it until something happens, or do I accept the pause and move on? Honestly, I'm worn out by making rules about rules — could you suggest one ultra-discreet non‑audible fallback (like a tiny fingertip press) and a very simple if‑then for the "no softening" case so I don't immediately turn it into another ritual?
