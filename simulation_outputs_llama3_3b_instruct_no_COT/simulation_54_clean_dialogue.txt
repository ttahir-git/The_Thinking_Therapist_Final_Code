Patient: I've been pretty preoccupied with starting this new program — it's been making me feel on edge and I get way more frustrated and angry than I expect in meetings or classes. I'm an artist, older than most of the others, and the social anxiety around that just makes everything feel worse. I don't know, it's kind of hard to talk about.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share this with me. It sounds like this new program is stirring up some strong emotions for you, and that's not uncommon. What's one thing you notice about how you typically cope with those feelings of frustration and anxiety in your art?

Patient: I guess I tend to bury myself in my painting — I work longer and longer to avoid thinking about the program. Sometimes I get so frustrated I slam things or tear up a sketch, and then I feel awful and guilty. I don't know, it just feels messy.

Therapist: Those moments of acting out or destroying your work can be really intense. It sounds like you're using your art as a way to distract yourself from the feelings that come up. What would happen if, instead of focusing on getting rid of the emotions, you were to acknowledge them, even just for a moment, while you're working on your painting?

Patient: I guess if I tried to notice them they'd swell up at first — I'd slow down and actually feel the anger instead of just smashing things. That scares me because I worry it'll spill into the painting and ruin it, but sometimes when I let it in a little the work ends up feeling... truer. I don't know, it's just hard to sit with.

Therapist: It's like the sensation of being in touch with those emotions is unfamiliar and uncomfortable. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with this feeling of anger, not to try to change it or fix it, but just to see what it's like to allow it to exist in your body, for just a brief moment, while you're working on your painting?

Patient: I guess I can try, but I'm really nervous it'll swell up and I'll end up smearing or tearing the work—and then I'll feel worse. I don't know how to do it without freaking out; could we maybe start with something tiny, like 30 seconds or just a small corner of a canvas?

Therapist: That sounds like a great approach. Starting small can be really helpful in building up tolerance for uncertainty. What's one thing you could say to yourself, just before you begin, to help you feel more at ease with the possibility of not knowing how you'll react to this small experiment?

Patient: I guess I could tell myself, "It's only thirty seconds — you can stop anytime if it gets too much." I don't know, saying that out loud feels a bit silly, but maybe it'd help.

Therapist: Noticing that you're having a hard time with the idea of saying it out loud, but it might help you feel more grounded. Would it be okay if we just start with the physical act of painting, without worrying about the outcome, and see what happens in that small corner of the canvas?

Patient: Okay... I guess we can try that, just a tiny corner—maybe the bottom right. I'm scared I'll lose it and start tearing things up, though. Could you... I don't know, talk me through it or tell me what to focus on? I'm already feeling nervous.

Therapist: I'll be here to support you, but I won't guide you through it. Instead, I'll simply be present with you. As you start to paint, I'll just be here, observing and not offering any specific guidance. When you're ready, you can take a deep breath and begin with that small corner of the canvas.

Patient: Okay... I'm starting. My hand's shaking and my chest feels tight — I guess I'm scared I'll just mess it up or tear it. I'm taking that breath now and trying to focus on that little bottom-right corner, but my mind keeps hopping to, I don't know, what other people will think. Could you... just stay with me and maybe nod or say something quiet if I'm doing okay?

Therapist: *I nod gently* I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll just stay with you in this moment.

Patient: Okay... it's actually a little less scary knowing you're not going anywhere. My chest's tight and my jaw's clenched — I keep picturing them noticing me and thinking I'm ridiculous, and I don't know, I guess that makes the anger spike. Can you... I don't know, just say "breathe" if I start getting louder?

Therapist: *barely whispering* Breathe...

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing — it actually helps a bit when you say it. My hands are still shaking and there's this hot knot of anger under my ribs that feels like it might explode and ruin the painting, and I don't know how to stop it. I guess I keep thinking they'll see me as pathetic if I lose control, and that thought just makes me tighter. Can we... keep doing the small corner for a bit longer?

Therapist: *I nod again, still very quietly*

Patient: Okay... I'm still on that bottom-right corner, breathing, but the knot's not easing — I'm getting frustrated because the strokes look wrong and I want to tear it up. I don't want anyone to think I'm a mess; that thought just makes me tighter. I guess could you say "steady" every now and then? I'm scared it'll spiral and I'll ruin it.

Therapist: *whispering* Steady...

Patient: Steady... okay. It's a bit less frantic — my breathing's calmer — but there's this flat heaviness underneath everything. I don't know, I feel kind of worn out and like I can't keep pretending I'm okay. I guess... can we just stay like this for a while?

Therapist: *I nod again, quietly observing*

Patient: I don't know... I can keep my hand on the brush, but it's getting harder — everything feels heavy and fuzzy. I guess... can we just sit with this for a while, not try to fix anything? I don't know what else to say right now.

Therapist: *I nod gently, remaining still and silent*

Patient: I don't know... I can keep sitting here, but everything feels heavy and kind of numb. I don't really want to talk—I just want you to stay with me a bit longer. I guess... is that okay?

Therapist: *I continue to sit quietly, remaining still and present, allowing the silence to be a space between us*

Patient: I don't know... I can stay like this a bit longer, if that's okay. I'm not ready to talk about the program — it feels too big right now, and I guess I just need the quiet.

Therapist: *I nod again, still silent and present, allowing you the space you need*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is staying quiet supposed to help? I don't know, it just leaves me kind of... hanging, like I'm meant to do something and I don't know what.

Therapist: *still very quietly* Sometimes, it's not about fixing or doing something, but about being with the uncertainty, the unknown. It's okay not to have answers right now.

Patient: I don't know... sitting here just makes me feel like I'm supposed to be doing something, and I can't stand the not-doing. I guess I'm not good at waiting. Could you... give me one tiny thing to do when the anger climbs, something I can do with my hands? I don't know, like a simple breath cue or a small movement.

Therapist: *softly* Try bringing your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, one foot at a time.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try that. I'm pressing my feet into the floor — left, then right — and it's weirdly grounding but also kind of distant, like my chest is still a tight knot and my feet are just... there. It helps a little, I think, but I still feel tense; could you, I don't know, say "steady" if I start getting loud or remind me to check my feet if I seem to be spiraling?

Therapist: *whispering* Whenever you feel like taking a breath, or your feet start to wander, I'll be here, saying "steady".

Patient: Okay... I guess "steady" helps a bit — like a tiny anchor. My hands are still shaking and I keep wanting to tear it up; I don't know how to stop that urge. Can we just keep sitting with this, you saying "steady" now and then?

Therapist: *continues to whisper "steady" periodically, allowing you to maintain the gentle grounding and stay present with your physical sensations*

Patient: Okay... steady does help, a little. My hands are still shaking and there's this itch to tear it up — I don't want to talk about the program yet, it feels too big. Could you just keep saying "steady" now and then, and maybe say "breathe" if you think I'm holding my breath? I don't know, that might keep me from freaking out.

Therapist: *continues to whisper "steady" occasionally, and occasionally adds "breathe" if you pause or tense up, maintaining a gentle, calming presence*

Patient: Okay... steady helps, a bit. My hands are still shaking and I keep picturing ripping the corner— I don't want to wreck it. Could you, I don't know, say "pause" if I look like I'm about to lose it and remind me to set the brush down and take three slow breaths? I guess that might stop me from just tearing it.

Therapist: *whispering* If you look like you might lose control, I'll say "pause" and we'll take three slow, deep breaths together.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Pause.

One — I'm putting the brush down. Two — slow breath in. Three — out. My chest feels a little less tight, my hands are still trembling but not as bad. I don't know, it helps for a minute, but I'm worried it'll snap back the moment I pick the brush up. I guess... can you keep saying "pause" if you see me start to tighten again? I don't really know how to handle it alone yet.

Therapist: *whispering* Pause.

Patient: Okay... I set the brush down. My chest's a little less tight but everything feels so heavy and fuzzy — I don't know how long I can keep doing this without someone right here saying "pause" or "steady" when I start to tighten. I guess can you keep doing that and just... stay with me a bit longer? I don't want to talk about the program yet; I just need the quiet and those little anchors.

Therapist: *continues to whisper "pause" as needed, remaining a constant, gentle presence, allowing you to gradually build your sense of safety and stability*

Patient: I can stay — I don't know how long, but I can. I'm feeling really drained and fuzzy, and I guess I need you to keep saying "steady" and "pause" and remind me to breathe when I start to tighten. I don't want to talk about the program yet; I just need this quiet and those little anchors.

Therapist: *remains quiet, only whispering "steady" as needed, allowing you to settle into the space and continue to benefit from the gentle support*

Patient: I can stay. The quiet and those words help, but I'm still worried about being by myself at the program — I don't know how I'll keep it together without you here. I guess... could we make a tiny script I can say to myself when the anger spikes? Even one short line like "steady—breathe" written down might feel less scary.

Therapist: *smiles slightly, nodding* You can write down a simple phrase, like "steady—breathe" or something that feels comforting to you. I'll leave it here for you to refer to whenever you need it.

Patient: I guess I'll try writing "steady—breathe" on a little scrap and tucking it in my sketchbook — it feels silly but maybe it'll help when I'm there alone. I don't know... could you write that down here for me? Maybe add "pause" at the end — "steady—breathe—pause" — that might remind me to actually put the brush down if I start to lose it.

Therapist: *whispers "steady—breathe—pause" on a piece of paper, handing it to you*

Patient: Okay... I got it. I'll tuck "steady—breathe—pause" into my sketchbook — I guess it feels a bit silly, but maybe it'll help when I'm there alone. I don't know if I'll remember it when I panic; can we just sit a bit longer? I can't do much more talking right now.
