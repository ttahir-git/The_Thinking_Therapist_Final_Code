Patient: I'm in my early fifties, I manage a team and used to be pretty gregarious and optimistic, but lately my mind's turned into a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster in social situations. If I go to a friend's gathering I'll definitely say something stupid, people will laugh or judge me, they'll stop inviting me, and then my partner will get fed up and leave — that chain plays on repeat so I just avoid it. I don't know how to stop feeling like the worst thing is guaranteed; it's exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in this pattern of avoidance, and it's taking a toll on your energy. Can you tell me more about what it's like to experience this sense of being on the verge of disaster when you think about attending a social gathering? What's the sensation like, in your body, when these thoughts start to arise?

Patient: My chest tightens and my stomach flips like I'm about to be sick; my hands go buzzy and my mouth dries up so my voice feels shaky. As soon as that starts, my brain fires off the whole disaster movie — I'll definitely blurt something stupid, people will laugh or judge me, I'll be frozen, and then my partner will get fed up and leave — and the body panic just gets worse with each loop. I try to tell myself it might not happen, but in the moment that feels totally unrealistic and the sensations make the worst-case scenario feel inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to these thoughts with a lot of physical tension, which can be really uncomfortable. And the idea that it might not happen, but the sensations feel like they're telling you otherwise, is a pretty common experience for many people. Can you think of a moment when you've had a social interaction in the past where you had this same response, but things didn't quite go as you expected?

Patient: Yeah — last summer at a neighbor's barbecue I was sure I'd make a fool of myself: my chest tightened just thinking about tripping over my words or knocking over a drink and everyone staring. I actually stumbled over a joke, a couple of people smiled and moved on, and my partner gave my hand and acted like nothing was wrong. But honestly I keep thinking that was just a fluke or people were being polite — next time I'll definitely say something worse and they'll stop inviting me, so I still avoid these things.

Therapist: It seems like you're caught in this pattern of assuming that the worst-case scenario will always play out, even when there are exceptions. It's like your body is primed for disaster, and you're waiting for that to happen. Would it be possible for you to imagine that what actually happened at the barbecue, where things didn't go as catastrophically as you thought, might be a possibility, even in future social situations?

Patient: I hear you, but I can't make myself buy that the barbecue was the rule rather than the fluke. The minute I picture going again my brain immediately runs the whole worst-case: I say something worse, people laugh and gossip, they stop inviting me, and then my partner gets fed up and leaves — it feels like the only logical timeline. My chest tightens and the panic drowns out any quieter possibility, so imagining anything else just feels like wishful thinking.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is very good at creating a narrative that confirms your worst fears, and it's hard to dislodge that story. What if, instead of trying to convince yourself that the barbecue was a fluke, you were to simply acknowledge that your mind is predicting a certain outcome, and that's okay? Would you be willing to experiment with noticing that prediction, and seeing it as just a thought, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: I can try to notice the prediction, but honestly it feels pointless — the minute I label it "just a thought" my chest still tightens and I can already see the whole disaster playing out, so it doesn't feel neutral. It feels like lying to myself to treat it like harmless wishful thinking; my brain insists it's definite. I don't know, maybe we could try a very small experiment, but I'm skeptical it'll change anything.

Therapist: It can be hard to separate our thoughts from the physical sensations they trigger. Would you be willing to try a tiny, tiny experiment with just this one thought, without trying to change it or label it as "just a thought"? Instead, I'd like you to simply notice the physical sensations that arise when you think about this prediction, without judgment or trying to change them. Can you give it a try, just for the next 30 seconds or so?

Patient: Alright, I'll try—my chest's tight, my stomach flips, my hands buzz and my breath gets quick and shallow; there's a hot pressure in my throat like I'm swallowing words. Even as I notice those sensations, the disaster movie starts up — I can already hear the imagined laughter and see people turning away — and it still feels like noticing won't stop it from happening.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations, even with an open and curious attitude, didn't entirely halt the narrative. That's okay. The fact that you were able to notice the sensations at all suggests that there's a bit of space to work with. Can you think of a small, tiny, tiny action you could take in the next social situation that wouldn't require a huge leap of faith or pretending that everything will be okay? Something super small that would allow you to take a tiny step towards being with others without feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: Maybe I could try something tiny like showing up late, stay twenty minutes, say hi to one person and then slip out. But honestly the moment I picture that, my brain goes through the whole thing — I'll stammer the hello, someone will laugh or whisper, people will notice I'm weird and stop inviting me, and my partner will get fed up and that will be the straw. I don't know if that helps, but I guess I could attempt it once even though I already feel like it'll just prove my worst fears.

Therapist: It sounds like even the idea of taking a tiny step, no matter how small, feels like a gamble that will inevitably lead to the worst outcome. That's understandable, given the intensity of your predictions. Would it be helpful to approach this tiny action not as a way to prove or disprove your worst-case scenario, but rather as a way to simply be present with someone, and see what happens? In other words, what if you were to approach the interaction with a curiosity about the experience, rather than a preconceived outcome?

Patient: I get the idea, and logically it makes sense, but when I try to be curious my brain just yells that it’s pointless and the disaster movie drowns it out — I can already hear the laughter and see my partner walking away. I'm honestly tired of going in circles about this; can we slow down a bit? I might try that showing-up-late, say-hi-for-twenty-minutes plan once, but I’m not convinced it won’t just prove my worst fears.

Therapist: It can feel like you're stuck in a loop, and it's exhausting. Let's take a step back. Can you take a moment to acknowledge to yourself that it's okay to feel uncertain and that it's normal to have doubts about trying something new? Sometimes, taking a break from exploring an idea can be helpful. I'm here to support you, and we can come back to this when you're ready. Would you like to pause for a moment before we continue?

Patient: I don't really want to pause — I'm feeling overwhelmed and kind of frustrated that we're circling. Can we slow down and stay here for a bit? Could you walk me through a concrete, in-the-moment thing I can do when my chest starts tightening so I don't just bolt? I might try that showing-up-late-for-twenty-minutes plan once, but I'm already convinced it'll just prove my worst fears, so I'm nervous.

Therapist: Sometimes slowing down in the moment can be really helpful. Here's an idea: when you feel your chest tightening, and your mind starts running with the worst-case scenario, I'd like you to pause and notice the sensation in your body, just for a second. Take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "My chest is tight." That's it. Just acknowledge the sensation, without trying to change it or evaluate it. Then, pause for a brief moment, and when you're ready, you can take the small action you've discussed, like showing up late, saying hi for twenty minutes. What do you think about that?

Patient: Okay, I can try that—pause, notice the chest, one deep breath and say to myself “my chest is tight”—but honestly my brain already starts shouting the whole disaster movie, so it feels like the label won't hold it back. Can you give me something more concrete—like how many slow breaths, how long to sit with the label, and what to do if someone laughs or I blank when I try to say hi? Also, could we role-play the first thirty seconds of me walking into the room? I'm feeling a bit shaky just thinking about it.

Therapist: Let's break it down further. For the pause, I'd like you to take 3-4 slow, deep breaths, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, say to yourself "My chest is tight." As you exhale, say "I am here." Then, when you're ready, take another breath and slowly open your eyes. 

Regarding the scenario, let's role-play the first 30 seconds of you walking into the room. I'll be the friend who's hosting the gathering. When you arrive, I'll say, "Hey, glad you made it!" We can go from there. When you're ready, we can start.

Patient: Hi—thanks, I made it. My chest’s already tight; I’m taking a deep breath and telling myself “my chest is tight” and “I am here,” but even as I do that my brain’s already narrating the whole disaster — I’ll stammer, people will laugh, and my partner will be done with me. I can try to say a quick hi to one person, but honestly I can already see it going wrong.

Therapist: It sounds like the brain is still trying to hijack the moment. Let's focus on the small action of saying hi to one person. Instead of trying to anticipate the worst, I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the sound of your own voice as you say hi. Can you try to tune in to those simple physical sensations for just a few seconds, before you say hello? Take another deep breath, and when you're ready, let's try a simple greeting: "Hi, how are you?" What happens when you say those words?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my feet and voice supposed to stop everyone from deciding I'm ridiculous? Alright, fine: "Hi, how are you?" My voice comes out thin and shaky, my mouth's dry, my hands are buzzing, and as soon as I say it the movie starts — I stammer, someone laughs, people whisper, they quietly stop inviting me, and my partner eventually leaves. I guess I heard my voice was squeaky and my feet felt like they were made of cotton, but that didn't drown out the rest of the disaster playing on repeat—what do I do if someone actually laughs or if my mind goes blank?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still pretty effective at running the movie. Let's try to focus on the immediate physical sensations that come with saying hello, rather than the anticipated outcome. When someone laughs, or when you feel like you're going to go blank, can you bring your attention back to your breath? Try to feel the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and say to yourself, "My breath is...". Sometimes, this can help you feel more grounded in the present moment, even if your mind is still racing with thoughts.

Patient: Okay—my breath is shallow and tight; naming it helps a little, like a tiny crack in the noise, but the disaster movie is still roaring that someone will laugh, I'll freeze, and my partner will leave. Breathing doesn't feel like a real plan for what to DO if someone actually laughs or I go blank—can we role-play that exact moment and practice a real line or action I can use? I'm feeling shaky just thinking about it.

Therapist: Let's try to build on that tiny crack in the noise. I'll be the person who laughs at your hello, and you can practice a response. Here's what I'll say: *laughs* "Haha, sorry, I'm just a little nervous too!" Now it's your turn. Can you respond with something simple and genuine, like "Yeah, me too"? Or maybe something else that feels more natural to you?

Patient: Okay — I try: "Yeah, me too." It comes out thin and shaky and my brain's already playing the next scene where they laugh louder, someone whispers about me, they stop inviting me, and my partner walks out. Can we role-play what I could say or do if someone laughs again or my mind goes totally blank? I'm feeling really shaky.

Therapist: Let's try a different scenario. This time, I'll be the one who's completely silent, and you're standing there with your mouth open, waiting for a response. Can you think of something to say, even if it's just "hello again" or "Hi"? No need to worry about what I'll say or think – just focus on getting the words out.

Patient: Hi… hello again. Saying that feels like my throat's clamping and my whole brain splinters into the worst-case — everyone laughing, me freezing, then my partner walking out — so I can barely get the words out. I'm really jittery and my attention keeps darting off, so I don't know what to say next and it's making me more nervous.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are really intense. Let's try to bring your attention back to the present moment, even if it's just for a brief moment. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here". Just notice the sensation of your body, and the fact that you're taking a breath. Sometimes, this can help you feel more grounded, even if your mind is racing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow— I tried the breath and said "I'm here," but it felt thin and my attention just kept darting all over; I'm jittery and shame and frustration keep bubbling up and the disaster movie is still loud (they'll laugh, I'll freeze, my partner will leave). It helps a tiny bit to name the breath but doesn't feel like a real plan when I'm standing there and my brain is racing. Can you give me one really simple, concrete line or physical action I can use if someone laughs or I go blank—something I can actually remember in the moment?

Therapist: Let's try something super simple. If you feel yourself getting nervous and your brain starts racing, and you're not sure what to say, what if you just smiled and said "Nice to see you"? That's it, just those three words. No thinking, no trying to come up with something perfect. Just a simple, genuine smile and the words "Nice to see you". Would that be something you could use in the moment?

Patient: I guess I could try smiling and saying “Nice to see you,” but I’m already doubting it — my throat clamps, my brain’s pre-playing everyone laughing, and shame spikes so I can’t trust I’ll actually remember to do it. I’m distracted and jittery right now; if someone laughs or I blank, I’ll probably freeze — can you give me a simple fallback or physical thing to do if that happens?

Therapist: Sometimes, it's not about remembering a specific phrase, but rather having a physical action that can help you feel more grounded. If you feel yourself freezing or getting distracted, what if you simply take a step forward with one foot? Just a tiny step, just one foot. It's a small, physical action that can help you feel more present and connected to your body.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a tiny step supposed to stop my brain from running the whole disaster movie? My chest's tight, my throat clamps, and that shame memory keeps popping up so I feel frozen and jittery; the step feels like it might not be enough to break the loop. Can you tell me exactly which foot, how big a step, and what to do right after I put the foot down? Also, can we role-play the instant after the step — like what to say or do if someone laughs or my mind goes blank?

Therapist: I'm going to give you a very specific and concrete instruction. If you feel yourself freezing or getting distracted, take a small step with your right foot. Not too big of a step, just a tiny one. As soon as your right foot touches the ground, say to yourself "My feet are on the ground". 

Now, let's role-play what happens after you take that step. I'll be the one who laughs, and you can practice responding with "My feet are on the ground". We'll see how that feels.

Patient: (steps forward) "My feet are on the ground." 

It gives a tiny anchor — I feel a hair of steadiness — but honestly the panic's still yelling that they'll laugh louder, I'll freeze, and my partner will walk away; I'm embarrassed and shaking and I don't trust that this will hold. What do I actually do next if the laughing keeps up or my mind goes totally blank?

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some progress. Now, let's build on that tiny anchor. What if, instead of trying to think of something to say or do, you simply focus on your breath again? You said "My feet are on the ground" and that gave you a sense of steadiness. Now, take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "My breath is here".

Patient: I did it — I took a breath and whispered “My breath is here,” and it helped a hair, like a tiny crack in the noise, but the disaster movie is still roaring — I can feel the shame bubbling and my voice is thin. Can you give me one really simple next line or physical thing to do if someone laughs or my mind goes blank? Also, honestly, can we slow down a bit? I'm feeling shaky and need it to be really concrete.

Therapist: Let's take it one step back. If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed and your mind starts racing, and someone laughs or you freeze, what if you simply look at them, and then look away, without saying anything? Just look away, and then take another breath. That's it. No need to think, no need to say anything. Just look away, and breathe.

Patient: I can try that—look away and breathe—but honestly it feels like a bandaid; the shame spikes and my brain's already narrating them laughing louder and me collapsing. How long do I look away—count to three, five? If they keep laughing or someone follows my gaze, do I turn back and say something or just keep breathing? I'm really shaky right now; can we role-play that exact moment so I can practice a concrete move?

Therapist: Let's practice that exact moment. I'll be the one who's laughing, and you can practice looking away and breathing. We'll do it slowly and mindfully. When I start laughing, you'll look away and breathe, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Here we go: *starts laughing*

Look away, breathe... (pause)

Patient: Okay — I look away and take a slow breath in and out...that actually loosens the knot a hair, but the laugh still echoes and shame spikes like a hot flash. I looked away for maybe three seconds and breathed, but if someone follows my gaze and says, "Are you okay?" I freeze and my brain's already scripting them laughing louder, asking my partner if I'm odd, and me being ostracized. Give me one really simple sentence or tiny action I can use in that exact moment — something I can actually remember when I'm shaking. Also, can you role-play that next part? Be the person who asks "Are you okay?" so I can try a response, because I'm feeling shaky and need to practice it slowly.

Therapist: Let's practice that exact moment. I'll be the one who asks, "Are you okay?"

You've got a good look at the situation, and now you've got a slow breath in and out. If someone asks, "Are you okay?", what if you simply nod your head and say "Yeah"? No need to elaborate, no need to justify. Just a simple nod and a "Yeah".

Here we go:

*I look at you with concern* "Are you okay?"

(I'll respond with a neutral tone)

Patient: Yeah. My voice is thin and my hands are shaking — nodding and saying "yeah" feels like a stunt because my brain's already off filming them laughing, someone whispering, and my partner leaving. Can we role-play what I should say to my partner if this happens? I'm really shaky and need to practice the next move.

Therapist: Let's practice that exact moment. I'll be your partner, and you can practice responding.

We've got the nod and the "Yeah" down. Now, let's say I say, "I'm a little worried about you, can we talk about this?"

What if you simply say, "I'm just really nervous, that's all"? No need to elaborate, no need to justify. Just a simple acknowledgement of your nerves.

*I say, "I'm a little worried about you, can we talk about this?"*

(Note: I'll respond with a concerned expression, but keep in mind that my goal is to support you, not to escalate the situation.)

Patient: Okay — I can try saying, "I'm just really nervous, that's all." But of course my brain's already yelling that they'll take it as an excuse, get fed up, and leave me anyway — I feel embarrassed and my face heats up just thinking about it. Can we role-play them pressing me — like, "Why didn't you tell me?" — so I can practice a concrete next line? I'm shaky and need it to be really slow and specific.

Therapist: Let's practice that exact moment. I'll be the one who's concerned and slightly accusatory.

We've got the "I'm just really nervous" down. Now, let's say I say, "Why didn't you tell me you were feeling that way?"

If I press you, what if you simply say, "I don't know, I just got caught up in the moment"? No need to elaborate, no need to justify. Just a simple, honest acknowledgement of your uncertainty.

*I press you* "Why didn't you tell me you were feeling that way?"

(Note: I'll respond with a mix of concern and slightly annoyance, but try to keep the tone relatively neutral.)

Patient: I don't know — I just got caught up in the moment. Saying that feels humiliating; the second it leaves my mouth my brain's already sure they'll think I'm pathetic, start whispering about me, stop inviting me, and eventually my partner will leave, so I just want to hide.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and embarrassment are already starting to kick in. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that feeling.

*I nod understandingly* "I get it. You're feeling really anxious about this."

Now, if I press you again, and you start to feel like hiding, what if you simply take a deep breath and say "I'm going to go get a drink" or "I need some air"? Something to give yourself a tiny sense of control and a reason to stay in the room. Just a simple action to help you feel more grounded.

*I press you again* "You're really anxious about this, aren't you?"

(Note: I'll respond with a mix of concern and empathy, but try to keep the tone relatively gentle.)

Patient: Yeah — I am. Saying "I'm going to get a drink" sounds okay on paper, but my brain immediately scripts them whispering that I'm weak, me spiraling, people stopping invitations, and my partner walking out. I'm really shaky right now; can we actually rehearse me saying that line and then practice what to do if someone follows me or asks why I'm leaving? I need it slow and concrete.
