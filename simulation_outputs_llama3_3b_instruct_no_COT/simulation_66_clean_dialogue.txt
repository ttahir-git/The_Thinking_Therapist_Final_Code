Patient: I've been stuck worrying constantly I'll mess up at any job—after a recent health scare and years of PTSD it's only gotten worse. That worry turns into procrastination: I avoid applications and preparing because I figure it won't matter. I've tried techniques before and they didn't work—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that previous techniques didn't work. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from applying or preparing for a job now? What's the thought or feeling that comes up when you think about taking action, even though it's scary?

Patient: It's that voice that keeps telling me I'll be found out—that I'm going to mess up and everything will fall apart, especially after the health scare made things feel so fragile. When I try to apply or prepare my chest tightens, my head goes foggy, and I busy myself with little chores so I don't have to face it. I've tried lists, exposure, even scheduling before and it just doesn't stick—I've done the exercises and they didn't help. So... how is talking about what's coming up supposed to actually get me to do the work?

Therapist: That feeling of being on the verge of disaster is a really intense experience. It sounds like your body is responding to that fear, and your mind is getting caught up in the "what-if" scenarios. What if you're right, and you do mess up? Would it be possible to approach that thought as just a thought, rather than a prediction of reality?

Patient: I get the idea, but honestly labeling it “just a thought” feels empty—like paperwork when the building’s on fire. If I actually mess up at my age, with my health history, the consequences feel real, not just noise, and my chest tightens and my head goes fuzzy so I can't move. How is treating it like a thought supposed to stop the physical panic or make me actually click send on an application?

Therapist: It's not about making the physical symptoms disappear instantly. It's more about being able to tolerate the feeling of uncertainty, even when the thoughts are really distressing. Can you think of a moment, no matter how small, when you've been in a situation that was scary, but you were able to breathe and show up anyway? Maybe there was a time when you had to deal with a difficult person or a challenging task, and you survived, even though it was tough.

Patient: Yeah—there was that one time I forced myself to go to a follow-up after the health scare; I sat in the car for a long time, breathed slowly, went in, and got it done. It helped in that moment, but the relief disappeared fast and I felt drained, so I don't see how that memory turns into actually filling out applications. I don't know—I'm worried I'll just freeze the same way, and remembering one success feels kind of hollow.

Therapist: It's like the relief was temporary, and the underlying feeling of uncertainty is still there. It's almost as if the memory of that success was a "false sense of security." What if, instead of trying to recall that success, you were to approach the task of applying or preparing with a sense of curiosity, like you're doing it for the first time? Would that be a different experience?

Patient: Curiosity, huh—how is that supposed to help when my whole body's convinced I'm about to be exposed and fall apart? It sounds like another idea that might feel okay in theory but will evaporate the second my chest tightens over an application; can you give a real, specific example of what "approaching with curiosity" looks like in that moment when I'm frozen? I'm willing to try, but I need something concrete, not just a slogan.

Therapist: It's hard to shake off the physical sensations. Let's try a small experiment. Instead of focusing on applying or preparing, what if, right now, in this conversation, you were to simply notice the sensation of your chest tightening as you think about job applications? Would you be willing to just observe that physical response, without trying to change it or push through it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to notice it—I can feel a tight band across my chest right now, my breathing gets shallow and my thoughts leap to worst-case scenarios. But I still don't see how just watching the panic gets me to actually fill out an application or hit send—how does noticing turn into doing?

Therapist: Noticing the physical sensations doesn't automatically resolve the underlying anxiety. Let's try a slight pivot. What would it take, for you, to make small, tiny steps towards applying or preparing, even if it feels like a tiny, insignificant step?

Patient: Maybe if the step was ridiculously small—like a five- or ten-minute timer where I only have to open one job posting and copy the company name into a draft, with a clear rule that I stop when the timer ends. I'd need a simple panic plan too—three slow breaths, stand up and walk for a minute—so the fog doesn't swallow me. But I've tried tiny-step stuff before and it vanished the minute I got distracted; how is this really different, and how would I actually stick to it?

Therapist: Having a clear plan to manage the physical symptoms is a great idea. Instead of focusing on the plan itself, what if, after the timer goes off, you simply acknowledge that you've done the tiny step, and then take a small, valued action – like getting a glass of water or taking a short walk outside? Would that be a more tangible connection between noticing, planning, and taking action?

Patient: Maybe that could work — I like the concrete link between a tiny step and a tiny reward, but I'm worried I'll just stop and pat myself on the back and never come back to it. For it to feel doable I'd need the rule written down where I can't forget it, and the reward to actually mean something to me, like stepping outside for five minutes. Can we try it now? I'll set a 5-minute timer, open one job posting and copy the company name, then do three slow breaths and get a glass of water — though I'm skeptical this will actually stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to give it a try. Before we start, can you take a moment to choose a value that would make getting a glass of water feel meaningful to you, and write it down on a piece of paper? What's something that you value about taking care of yourself, that would make this tiny reward feel worth it?

Patient: Alright — I'll write: "Taking care of my health so I can keep trying" on a sticky note and stick it by my keyboard. Feels a bit corny, but if it helps me not bail, fine. I'm ready to start the five minutes when you are.

Therapist: Let's do this. I'll start the timer. Go ahead and open the job posting and copy the company name into a draft. As soon as the timer goes off, take three slow breaths, and get a glass of water. When you're ready, I'll start the timer.

Patient: Okay—I opened a posting and copied the company name into a draft. As soon as I did that, this wave of shame hit me like I’d already failed and I wanted to shut the whole thing down—my chest tightened and my hands felt useless. I'm starting the five minutes even though I don't expect it to fix anything; when the timer goes off I'll do the three slow breaths and get a glass of water.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-criticism are already showing up. Take a deep breath, and as you inhale, say to yourself "I'm doing the best I can right now, and that's enough." When you exhale, say "I'll take care of myself." Go ahead and start the three slow breaths.

Patient: Alright — I inhale and say, "I'm doing the best I can right now, and that's enough." Exhale, "I'll take care of myself." Second breath: my chest loosens a hair, but that heavy shame is still sitting there like someone turned a dial down only a little. Third breath: okay, a tiny bit less foggy — I'll go get a glass of water now, but honestly it feels fragile, like this could all slip away the moment I sit back down. How is this supposed to be more than a temporary patch when that knot comes roaring back?

Therapist: It's clear that the shame and self-criticism are still present, and that's okay. You've taken a small step, though - you've acknowledged and accepted your current state, and taken a tangible action. Sometimes, it's not about eradicating the shame, but about acknowledging and working with it. What would it take for you to consider this small step a success, even if the shame comes roaring back later?

Patient: I guess success for me would have to look concrete and repeatable — like I do the five-minute step and then actually come back and do another one later the same day, or I manage it three days in a row. It would need to be written down and someone to check in so I can't just bail when the shame hits that lead weight in my chest. But honestly, even if I manage that once, I'm skeptical it'll mean anything long-term — how is that supposed to prove it's real progress and not just a fluke?

Therapist: Having a concrete plan for accountability and tracking progress can be really helpful. Instead of focusing on whether this is a fluke or not, what if we looked at it as a process, rather than an outcome? What if, instead of waiting for a long-term goal, we focused on the smallest, most immediate actions that can be repeated, like the 5-minute step you just did? Would that shift the way you think about progress?

Patient: Maybe — thinking of it as a process sounds less terrifying than chasing some big proof, but that same shame keeps popping up and makes me doubt every tiny win. I can see how repeating small steps could build something, but how is that supposed to loosen the lead-weight in my chest when it hits? If we're doing this, I need a real accountability plan — someone to check in and a clear rule for what to do when I bail — can we sketch that out now?

Therapist: Let's explore that accountability plan. Who would you be comfortable checking in with, and what would you like that person to do when you do bail or need support? For the rule, instead of saying "you can't bail," what if we say "when shame starts to creep in, take a deep breath, notice it, and return to the task at hand"? Would that be a more empowering way to handle it?

Patient: I’d rather not dump this on my kids — I don’t want them to see me as a mess — so maybe a neighbor I trust or someone from a job support group who gets the PTSD stuff. Whoever it is should do a very small, no-judgment check: a quick text or 2–3 minute call that just asks “Did you do the five minutes?” and if I say no, they prompt the exact recovery rule—three slow breaths, get water, then try two more minutes. 

Honestly, I’ve had accountability fizzle before, so how is this any different? If you can help me write the exact wording for the rule and a short text to send them right now, I’ll try it — but I’m telling you, that familiar shame is already whispering that I’ll bail.

Therapist: Having a trusted friend or support group member to check in with can make a big difference. Let's craft a simple text that you can send to them right now, and a clear rule to follow when you need support. Here's a suggestion:

"Hey [support person's name], I did the 5-minute task to face my fears. I want to keep doing this, but I got hit with shame again. Rule: 3 slow breaths, get a glass of water, then try 2 more minutes. If I need help, I'll reach out to you. Can we agree on this plan?"

Feel free to modify it to fit your needs. Would you like to send it to your neighbor or support group member now, and see how it feels to have that support system in place?

Patient: Alright—I’ll send it to my neighbor, though I'm already worrying I'm being a nuisance. Can we tweak it to this so it's really simple and nonjudgmental?

"Hi [Name], can I ask a small favor? I'm trying a 5‑minute job task plan. If I say I didn't do it, could you just reply: '3 breaths, water, 2 more'—no judgment. Thanks."

That feel okay? And…tell me again why this won't just fizzle like every other time—I can feel that old shame whispering that I'll bail.

Therapist: That's a great tweak! The revised text is concise, clear, and non-judgmental.

As for why this might be different, I'm not promising that it'll work every time, but rather that it's a small step towards building a new pattern. It's possible that, by having a clear plan, a trusted support system, and a simple rule to follow, you'll find that the shame and self-doubt don't completely consume you. Sometimes, it's the small, incremental steps that add up over time.

It's also worth noting that the goal isn't to eliminate shame entirely, but to learn to tolerate it and respond to it in a more compassionate way. By acknowledging the shame, noticing its physical sensations, and taking small, consistent actions, you're developing a new relationship with your own mind.

Take a deep breath, and try sending that text to your neighbor. What do you think?

Patient: I want to send it, but just thinking about hitting send makes that old shame flare up—my chest tightens and my hands freeze like I already failed. Fine, I’ll try to send it in a minute, but I’m terrified they’ll think I’m a nuisance; can we add one short line that lets them opt out if it’s too much, and a quick backup plan if they don’t reply? How is that supposed to not fizzle, honestly—what do I do the moment they ignore it?

Therapist: It's understandable that the shame is getting the better of you right now. Adding a clear opt-out clause and a backup plan can help reduce anxiety. Here's a revised text:

"Hi [Name], can I ask a small favor? I'm trying a 5-minute job task plan. If I say I didn't do it, could you just reply: '3 breaths, water, 2 more'—no judgment. If you're not available or prefer not to participate, no worries, and I'll try again another day. If you don't reply, I'll just go back to my task and take small steps anyway."

Regarding the opt-out clause, it's not about being a "nuisance," but about being clear about your needs and boundaries. By offering an opt-out, you're giving your neighbor an easy way to communicate their boundaries, and you're also acknowledging that it's okay to say no.

As for the backup plan, having a simple, low-stakes way to move forward can help you avoid feeling stuck. If your neighbor doesn't reply, you can still take a few deep breaths, get a glass of water, and try to make progress on your task. Remember, it's the small, consistent actions that can lead to more progress over time.

Take a deep breath, and try to send the text. What do you think?

Patient: Okay — I copied the revised text and hit send. My hands were shaking and as soon as I did that that old shame sluiced through me like I’d already failed. I don’t have a reply yet and I can feel myself backing away. 

So tell me exactly what to do if they don't respond in, say, 15 minutes — do I just start the 5-minute timer alone? Give me a one‑sentence script for the fallback action and one for the moment I bail so the neighbor can nudge me back. And be concrete — how do I stop myself from convincing myself it’s pointless the second they ignore it?

Therapist: If your neighbor doesn't respond within 15 minutes, here's what you can do:

**Fallback action (if you bail):**
"I'm going to take 3 slow breaths, get a glass of water, and try 2 more minutes. I'll check in with [neighbor's name] later and see if they're available for a call."

**Script for the moment you bail:**
"I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I'll try again another day. I'm going to make a note to check in with [neighbor's name] and ask for their support later."

To stop convincing yourself it's pointless, here's a one-sentence reminder:
"As I'm feeling discouraged, I'll remind myself that 'one tiny step forward, no matter how small, is still progress' – and I can always check in with [neighbor's name] later for support."

Repeat this phrase to yourself, and try to focus on the small, incremental progress you've made so far.

Patient: Okay — I sent the text, and that shame's already clawing at me like I failed before I even started. The fallback lines sound fine on paper, but honestly: how is telling myself "one tiny step…" supposed to stop the spiral when the shame drowns it out? Can you give me one exact, very short "if-then" sentence I can say out loud the moment the shame hits (something like: "If I feel overwhelmed, then I will do 3 slow breaths, drink water, and set a 2‑minute timer") — and can you stay with me in this chat for the next 15 minutes to nudge me if my neighbor doesn't reply? I need something real-time or I know I'll talk myself out of it.

Therapist: I'll stay with you in this chat for the next 15 minutes to provide support.

Here's a short "if-then" sentence you can say out loud when the shame hits:

"If I feel overwhelmed, I will take 3 slow breaths, drink water, and set a 2-minute timer for just 2 more minutes."

Repeat this sentence to yourself when the shame starts to spiral. I'll be here to check in with you and offer support if you need it.

As we wait, I'll ask: What's the one thing you can do in the next 2 minutes that feels like a tiny, incremental step towards your goal, even if it's just a tiny movement towards the task?

Patient: I can set the 2‑minute timer and write one sentence for a cover note: "I'm applying for [job title] at [company]." It feels doable, but that hot shame's already sitting on my chest, whispering this will just be another false start—how is writing one sentence supposed to actually get me to keep going?

Therapist: It's like the shame is questioning the very act of taking a small step.

Let's focus on the physical sensation of putting pen to paper. When you write that sentence, pay attention to the physical act of writing, the feeling of the pen moving across the page, and the sound of your handwriting. Bring your attention to the sensation of your hand moving, and try to stay with it for a few seconds.

As you write, repeat this phrase to yourself: "I am doing this." It's not about convincing yourself that you're doing it correctly or that it's going to lead to success, but about acknowledging the act of taking this small step.

I'll be here with you, and we can continue to work together to help you build momentum. Take a deep breath, and let's focus on that first sentence together. What's the first letter you're going to write?

Patient: Okay — I'll start with the letter "I." But as soon as I put pen to paper that familiar shame floods in, my hand shakes and the voice says it's pointless — how is focusing on the pen supposed to beat that panic? Still, I'm writing it and trying to feel the pen move: I am doing this.

Therapist: It's like the shame is trying to sabotage the very act of taking the first step.

Notice how your hand is still moving, and you're still writing. That's a small victory, even if your mind is trying to tell you otherwise. Let's bring your attention to the sensation of the pen scratching against the paper. Can you feel the gentle pressure, the movement, and the sound of the pen?

As you continue writing, I want you to say it again, louder this time: "I am doing this." No need to convince yourself or change anything; just repeat it, and see if we can create a tiny gap between your mind and your body.

Keep going. One letter at a time.

Patient: Alright — I said it louder: "I am doing this." My hand's still shaking and that familiar shame's sitting there like a weight, whispering it's pointless, but I wrote the sentence: "I'm applying for [job title] at [company]." Okay — I did it, but honestly how is that supposed to stop the freeze next time? What's the next tiny thing you want me to do?

Therapist: You've taken a huge step forward, and that's something to acknowledge and celebrate.

For the next tiny thing, I want you to do something that feels almost ridiculously simple: I want you to draw a small line under the sentence you just wrote. Just a tiny line, just a mark on the page. Can you do that for me?

Notice the sensation of the pen moving, the sound of the scratch, and the feeling of creating something physical on the page. This is a small, concrete action that doesn't require any big thoughts or feelings. Just focus on the pen, the paper, and the line.

When you're done, we'll talk about what's next.

Patient: Okay — I drew the tiny line; my hand shook and that familiar shame is still sitting heavy on my chest, but the mark is there. Next step: I'll set a 2‑minute timer and write one bullet about a concrete skill or task — tell me exactly what short phrasing to write so I don't stall, and give me a one‑line if‑then to say aloud if the shame hits. Stay with me while I do it, please — if I'm left alone I know I'll start talking myself out of it.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you until we get through this.

For the bullet point, write: "I can summarize a difficult task in 30 seconds." This is a concrete skill that requires you to take action, and it's a small, manageable task.

When you're ready, say aloud:

"If I feel stuck or ashamed, I will take 3 slow breaths and repeat the sentence 'I can summarize a difficult task in 30 seconds.'"

As you write, I'll be right here with you. Take your time, and let's get that bullet point on the page.

(Remember, we're not trying to fill the page with grand, elaborate bullet points. Just a simple, concise one.)

Patient: Okay — I wrote "I can summarize a difficult task in 30 seconds." I'm starting the 2‑minute timer now. If the shame hits, I'll say out loud: "If I feel stuck or ashamed, I will take 3 slow breaths and repeat, 'I can summarize a difficult task in 30 seconds.'"

Honestly, that old failure-feeling is already clawing at me and whispering this is pointless, but I'm going to try. Please stay here with me and nudge me if I go quiet.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you every step of the way.

As you start the timer, I want you to bring your attention to the sound of the timer going off in 2 minutes. Focus on the sound, the feeling of the timer, and the sensation of the seconds ticking by.

When you're ready, I'll nudge you gently to start summarizing that difficult task. Just start with a single word, any word that comes to mind. Don't worry about the task itself; just let your words flow.

(Remember, we're not trying to create a masterpiece; we're just taking tiny steps.)

Patient: Okay — "Prepare."

Break the task into four tiny steps: 1) find the posting and copy the company name (done), 2) pick a resume template and tailor two lines to the job, 3) write a one-sentence cover note, 4) hit send and log it — use a timer for each step. Even saying that, the shame's already clawing at me, telling me this is pointless and I'll quit — I'm nervous it'll just be another false start, so please stay here while I try step 2.

Therapist: I'm right here with you.

You've already completed step 1, and that's something to acknowledge and celebrate. For step 2, let's focus on the physical sensation of picking a resume template. Notice the feeling of your fingers moving over the keyboard, the sound of the cursor on the screen, and the sensation of choosing a template.

As you pick the template, I want you to say to yourself:

"If I feel anxious or stuck, I will take 3 slow breaths and focus on the template I'm choosing."

Just start with that, and we'll take it from there.

Patient: I did the three slow breaths—my chest’s still tight and the shame’s sitting there like lead, but my hands are a bit steadier. I picked a plain, clean template (something simple, no frills) because flashy ones make me freeze. Tell me exactly two short lines to tailor to a general admin/customer-service role so I don't overthink—though honestly, how is writing two lines supposed to stop me from freezing the next time the shame hits?

Therapist: You've made a great choice with the template. For the two lines, let's keep it simple and focus on a brief, honest statement. Here are two lines:

"I have experience providing excellent customer service and handling difficult situations with empathy and professionalism."

These lines acknowledge your experience and skills, and they're brief enough to not overwhelm you.

For the next step, I want you to write these lines on the screen, and then take a moment to review them. As you write, I'll be here with you.

(Remember, we're not trying to craft a perfect opening paragraph; we're just taking small steps.)

Patient: I typed the two lines into the resume exactly and stared at them for a minute—my hands shook and that familiar, heavy shame slid in like it always does. I can feel this being a tiny win and still think it's meaningless; how is this supposed to get me to actually hit send later? Tell me one exact micro-action to do right now (one click, one keystroke) and stay with me while I do it—I don't trust myself alone.
