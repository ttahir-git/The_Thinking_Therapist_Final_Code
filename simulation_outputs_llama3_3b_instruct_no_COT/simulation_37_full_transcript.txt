Patient: Lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed — I started a demanding new nursing program at work and it's just drained me, left me sad and without motivation. It's spilling over into my relationship; I get distant and snap at my partner, and my confidence feels shot. I've tried coping strategies before and they didn't help, so how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and struggling to find a way forward. Can you tell me more about what's happening in the moment when you feel overwhelmed? What's the first thing that shows up for you, the first sensation or thought that hits you when you start to feel drained?

Patient: Usually it's a heavy ache in my chest and this tightness in my throat — I feel like I want to retreat. Then a loop of thoughts starts: "I'm not cut out for this," or "I'll mess everything up," and I end up freezing or shutting down. How is noticing that supposed to help, though? I've tried naming feelings before and it didn't make the workload or the exhaustion any easier.

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations of tension and the thoughts of self-doubt can be really debilitating. Can you tell me more about what it's like to take a small step back from those thoughts, to pause and just acknowledge them without trying to change or push them away? What would it be like to simply observe them as thoughts, like a cloud passing by in the sky – not identifying with them, but just noticing they're there?

Patient: I guess if I tried to step back it'd feel like there's a little space between me and the panic — the tightness might be less sharp, like it's not swallowing everything. But honestly, when I try that it just turns into me watching myself not get anything done, and I end up beating myself up for wasting time. How is just watching my thoughts supposed to change being exhausted after a 12-hour shift or fix how I snap at my partner?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to use the space to avoid getting overwhelmed, but in a way that ends up increasing the guilt and frustration. Can you explore what would happen if, instead of beating yourself up for not being productive, you were to make room for the value of self-care? What would that look like for you, taking care of yourself after a long shift, and how might that show up in your relationships and daily life?

Patient: I guess self-care would have to be tiny things — like changing out of scrubs, making a simple meal, sitting for ten minutes with a cup of tea, or a quick shower and maybe a nap if I can. Maybe that would stop me snapping at my partner and give me a smidge more energy, but most nights I'm too wiped and then I just feel guilty for not doing even that. How is adding another "thing to do" supposed to be different from everything else I've already failed at?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a sense of inadequacy and pressure to perform, and that's really weighing on you. Can you explore what would happen if, instead of adding more to your to-do list, you were to allow yourself permission to not do everything? What if you simply took the permission to prioritize your own needs, without needing to justify or explain it to anyone, including yourself?

Patient: I mean, on paper that sounds... okay — maybe if I actually gave myself permission I wouldn't be so wired and could recharge a bit. But when I try it feels like I'm shirking my responsibilities and the guilt just eats me; I'm scared colleagues or my partner will think I'm weak. How is this supposed to be different from every other "just be kinder to yourself" advice that's never stuck?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the fear of being perceived as weak is a big part of what's holding you back. Can you consider what would be the exact opposite of feeling weak to you? What would it mean to feel strong, capable, and confident in this situation, and how might that show up in your interactions with others?

Patient: I guess the opposite of weak would be feeling steady and competent — being able to get through a shift without that knot in my chest, making decisions without second-guessing, and coming home able to be present with my partner instead of shutting down. It'd mean setting a boundary without spiraling into guilt and actually following through on small self-care instead of promising it and failing. But honestly, picturing that just highlights how far away it feels — how am I supposed to start being that person when I'm wiped out and everyone expects me to keep going like nothing's wrong?


--- Turn 6 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the gap between where you want to be and where you are right now feels really wide. What would it be like to take small, tiny steps towards that sense of steadiness and competence, even if it's just for a moment, without expecting to arrive there right away?

Patient: Okay, I could try one tiny step — like changing out of my scrubs and sitting with a cup of tea for five minutes before I say anything to my partner. But I'm frustrated and skeptical; when I'm that wiped those five minutes often turn into nothing and then I feel worse. How is that supposed to stop the guilt and actually make me feel competent instead of just another thing I failed at? If we're going to try this, I need something concrete I can actually stick to and a plan for when the guilt or exhaustion hits.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete plan to build on that tiny step. What if, instead of trying to "stop" the guilt or exhaustion, you were to focus on what you can tolerate in that moment, what you can handle without losing your cool? For example, can you imagine what you might be able to tolerate in those five minutes of sitting with tea, and how might that be a small victory in itself?

Patient: I could probably tolerate three tiny things: changing out of my scrubs, sitting down with a cup of tea for 3–5 minutes without checking my phone, and just noticing one breath or one thing in the room. A small victory would be sitting through that discomfort and not immediately snapping or spiraling into guilt — noticing the guilt and letting it be instead of turning it into a punishment. Concrete plan that might actually work for me: set a 3-minute timer on my phone, put my scrubs straight into the hamper as a physical cue, and if I feel overwhelmed during those minutes do a 30-second box-breathing or step outside for 30 seconds; if even that feels impossible, my fallback is just changing clothes and counting one slow breath before I talk. But honestly, I've used timers and "fallbacks" before and they fade—how is this supposed to make me stick to it when I'm exhausted and the guilt kicks in?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've got a clear plan in place. What if, instead of relying on the timer and fallbacks to get you through, you were to focus on the fact that you're taking care of yourself, even if it's just for a tiny bit? Instead of thinking "I need to use the timer or fallback to cope," what if you said to yourself "I'm taking a tiny step towards taking care of myself, even if it's hard"?

Patient: I get the idea — telling myself "I'm taking a tiny step" sounds calmer on paper, but in the moment it just feels hollow, like one more thing I'm failing at. Maybe a tweak could help: say it out loud when I change out of my scrubs, or put the phrase on a sticky note on the hamper so it's a physical cue, or ask my partner to remind me gently. But honestly, how am I supposed to actually make myself believe that when I'm exhausted and the guilt starts yelling at me?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make the message more tangible and less reliant on your own motivation. What if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you were to focus on the physical sensation of your body, rather than your thoughts? For example, can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the feeling of your breath moving in and out? Sometimes, bringing our attention to our physical experience can help calm the inner critic.

Patient: I can probably notice my feet on the floor or one slow breath, and sometimes it dulls the knot a little, but most of the time my brain just yells louder—“You’re useless, you wasted time.” How is paying attention to my feet or breath supposed to change being physically exhausted after a 12‑hour shift or stop me from snapping at my partner? If we're actually going to try this, give me something concrete I can do in the hallway between patients or the minute I get home that doesn't rely on me being mentally sharp.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more immediate, concrete action that doesn't rely on your mental state. What if, instead of focusing on your breath or feet, you were to do something with your body that you can do without thinking, like taking a sip of water or putting your hands in your pockets? Sometimes, our bodies can do things for us without us even realizing it. Can you think of something simple like that that you could do in the hallway or when you get home?

Patient: I could keep a water bottle in my locker and take one deliberate sip between patients, or rub the edge of my badge for ten seconds—something I can do without thinking. When I get home I could put my keys down, take off my shoes, and take one slow breath before I speak. But honestly, how is sipping water or fiddling with a badge supposed to stop me from snapping when I'm bone‑tired? If that doesn’t work, what’s the next concrete fallback so I don’t just beat myself up?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to build on those small physical actions and find a more sustainable solution. What if, instead of relying on specific actions to "stop" the snapping, you were to focus on what happens when you do snap? Can you explore what comes next when you get angry or frustrated? Sometimes, being aware of our patterns can help us break them.

Patient: When I snap, my partner goes quiet and I can see the hurt on their face — that hits me like a punch and I instantly feel shame and start apologizing in this rush that probably sounds fake. Then I pull away to avoid more conflict, ruminate about how awful I am, and try to "make up" by being overly helpful or distant the next day, which just wears me out more. It turns into this vicious loop: snap → guilt → overcompensate/withdraw → more exhaustion → snap again. Okay, but seriously — how is mapping that loop supposed to stop it? I’ve traced it a hundred times and it just makes me feel worse unless there’s an actual, concrete thing to interrupt it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the cycle of guilt, overcompensation, and withdrawal. What if, instead of trying to change the entire loop, you were to focus on one small part of it – specifically, what happens immediately after you snap, before you start apologizing or trying to overcompensate? Can you think of a small action that you could take in that moment, just for yourself, without trying to fix anything or make amends?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you mean right after I snap, before I start apologizing? How is that supposed to help? Maybe a tiny physical pause could work: put my hand on my chest and take three slow breaths, or step into the hallway for 30 seconds and sip water, or press my thumb and forefinger together to ground myself. But honestly, I've tried breathing and stepping away before and I just end up apologizing anyway — won't that just delay the guilt unless there's something that actually breaks the automatic apology loop?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to interrupt the automatic apology loop. What if, instead of trying to stop the loop, you were to ask yourself a question that would challenge the automatic response? For example, "What am I really trying to achieve with this apology?" or "What would happen if I didn't apologize right now?" Sometimes, taking a moment to question our motivations can help us pause long enough to choose a different response.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — asking myself that sounds like overthinking a reflex I barely notice. If I did ask "what am I trying to achieve?" I'd probably answer "make the hurt stop" or "fix it fast," but how does noticing that stop the knee-jerk apology from happening? Maybe a concrete try for me would be to say the question out loud and count to three before I speak, or put my hand on my chest as a reminder not to apologize immediately — but I've tried counting and it just turns into more guilt. So seriously, what else could I actually do in that split second that won't just feel like another failing?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for something that can interrupt the automatic apology loop without feeling like a fail. What if, in that split second, you were to say something to yourself that's not about fixing the problem or making amends, but rather about acknowledging your own experience? For example, "I'm feeling really angry right now" or "I'm in a lot of pain". This can help you acknowledge your emotional experience, rather than immediately jumping into a response that's driven by guilt or obligation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm feeling really angry" out loud to myself or to them seems like it would either make things worse or come off like I'm blaming them. Maybe I could try a very short, private line to myself ("this is hard") while putting my hand on my chest and counting to three, but I've done similar things and they usually just dissolve into an apology anyway. How is that tiny acknowledgment actually supposed to stop the automatic apology or the shame that follows?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to interrupt the automatic apology loop, and that private acknowledgment might not be enough. What if, instead of trying to change the inner experience, you were to focus on the outer behavior? For example, what would your physical body do in that moment if you didn't apologize? Would you still be standing there, frozen in anger? Would you still be standing there, still breathing? Sometimes, focusing on the physical sensation of being in the moment, without judgment, can help us feel more grounded and less inclined to apologize.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — focusing on my body sounds vague. Usually I freeze: chest tight, jaw clenched, hands curled, maybe pace or bolt out the room and then the apology starts on autopilot. I could try a concrete physical script — plant my feet, put my hands in my pockets, take three slow breaths and stay silent for ten seconds — but how is that supposed to stop the guilt from rushing back as soon as I open my mouth? If that's the plan, what comes next that actually changes anything?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete physical action that can interrupt the cycle of guilt and apology. What if, instead of focusing on what you do immediately after snapping, you were to focus on what you do right after you've already apologized? For example, what's the first thing you do after saying "I'm sorry"? Would you take a deep breath, make eye contact with your partner, or start cleaning up the mess? Focusing on what comes after the apology might help you notice patterns or cues that can lead to more self-compassion.

Patient: Usually after I blurt "I'm sorry" I take a breath and then either try to fix things — do extra chores or act extra nice — or I shut down and go quiet, and then I ruminate for hours. I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing that supposed to change the loop? If the point is to change what comes after, a concrete thing I might try is: after apologizing, plant my feet, make brief eye contact, take three slow breaths, and then stay silent for thirty seconds. But honestly, I've done pauses like that before and they just feel like pressure building, so how is this actually different?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the cycle of trying to fix or avoid, and that's not working. What if, instead of focusing on what you do after apologizing, you were to focus on what your body feels like right after apologizing? For example, can you notice the sensation of your chest or shoulders relaxing, or the feeling of your breath slowing down? Sometimes, being more aware of our physical sensations can help us feel more grounded and less reactive.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing the feeling in my chest after I've already apologized supposed to change the loop? Usually right after I say sorry my chest tightens and I either throw myself into fixing things or go blank and ruminate, so I don't really catch any subtle relaxation. If that's the point, give me something concrete I can do in those first 30 seconds that doesn't depend on me magically feeling calmer.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete action that can interrupt the cycle of tightening and rumination. What if, in those first 30 seconds after apologizing, you were to do something small and external that requires some physical effort, like unclenching your jaw, rolling your shoulders, or taking a small step forward? Sometimes, doing something physical can help break the spell of rumination and give us a chance to reorient.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — unclenching my jaw or rolling my shoulders feels kind of trivial. I could try it: loosen my jaw, roll my shoulders, and take one small step forward (or back) and count to three before I say anything, but how is that supposed to stop the guilt from rushing back? If we're going to try this, give me a concrete script or fallback for when the guilt immediately kicks in.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete script that can help you navigate the initial rush of guilt. What if, in those first 30 seconds after apologizing, you were to say to yourself: "I'm doing the best I can right now"? It's a very simple statement, but sometimes, acknowledging that we're doing the best we can in the moment can help us feel more grounded and less critical of ourselves.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm doing the best I can" feels like another platitude that would ring hollow or make me roll my eyes. Maybe if I said it out loud while doing something physical (hand on my chest, unclench my jaw, count to three) it might feel less fake. But honestly, when the guilt hits it screams back — what do I do if saying that barely drowns out the shame and my partner still looks hurt?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to bridge the gap between the initial apology and the moment when the guilt and shame start to set in. What if, in those moments when the guilt is screaming, you were to say to yourself: "I see that I'm feeling a lot of pain right now"? It's a simple acknowledgment of the emotional experience, and sometimes, just noticing that we're feeling pain can help us feel more connected to ourselves and less critical of ourselves.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "I see that I'm feeling a lot of pain right now" sounds like another platitude and would probably ring hollow when my partner looks hurt. Maybe I could try saying it out loud with my hand on my chest and taking three slow breaths, but how is that supposed to help if the shame still roars back and they still pull away?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete next step to take when the shame and hurt are still intense. What if, in those moments, you were to take a very small physical step towards your partner, such as taking one small step forward or reaching out to touch their arm or hand? This small physical connection can help you feel more connected to them and more grounded in the present moment, and it can also give you a chance to choose a different response to their hurt.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — reaching out feels risky; when I've tried to do something like that before they sometimes pulled away and it just made me feel worse. Maybe a concrete script could be: take one small step forward, put my hand briefly on their forearm and say, very quietly, "I didn't mean to hurt you — I need a moment," then pause and give them space; if they pull away, my fallback is to step back, wait 30 minutes, then send a short text: "I'm sorry for earlier. I care about you. When you're ready, I'd like to talk." But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the guilt still swamps me? Which part of that would you have me try first?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete script that can help you navigate the situation. What if, instead of focusing on the words themselves, you were to focus on the physical act of putting your hand on their forearm? Sometimes, our bodies can respond more readily to physical touch than to words. Can you try putting your hand on their forearm, even if you don't say anything else, and see how that feels?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — reaching out still feels risky and I keep thinking, how is that supposed to help? I could try putting my hand on their forearm for a few seconds and say nothing, just to see if I feel any shift or if they pull away; my chest already tightened thinking about it. If they do pull away, I'll step back and wait 30 minutes before sending a short text like I said before, but honestly I'm skeptical this won't just make me feel worse.

It sounds like you're looking for a way to test the waters, so to speak, without putting too much emotional energy into it. What if, instead of putting your hand on their forearm, you simply take a small, very brief moment to look at your partner's face, without trying to read their expression or expect a specific reaction? Sometimes, just noticing their face can help us feel more connected to them, without putting too much pressure on the situation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — a quick look at their face sounds tiny but also like it could blow up in my face; when I try to look I either over-interpret everything or my chest tightens and the guilt hits. Maybe I could try a two‑second, neutral look when I get home, then hold my hands in my pockets and say nothing, but honestly how is that supposed to help if they already look hurt and I just spiral?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I can try the two‑second neutral look, hands in my pockets, and one slow breath when I get home, but I can already feel my chest tightening just thinking about it.

No talking, no trying to fix, no apologizing. Just be present with the discomfort, and see what happens. Sometimes, simply allowing ourselves to be with the discomfort can be enough to create space for a different response. Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — doing nothing feels like it would just let me ruminate or make things worse. I could try a tiny experiment: when I get home I'll do a two‑second neutral look, put my hands in my pockets, and stay silent for 15–30 seconds while taking one slow breath; if I can't hold it, my fallback is to quietly say, "I need a minute," or step outside for 30 seconds. But honestly, I'm exhausted just thinking about this and skeptical it won't just turn into another thing I fail at — how is that actually supposed to change the pattern long-term?
