Patient: I've been worrying nonstop about my work—every piece feels like it could make or break whatever chances I have, so I just put things off. Losing gigs lately hasn't helped; the instability makes me anxious and that just feeds the procrastination. I guess... I don't know, it's been hard to get back into a routine.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the uncertainty and anxiety around your work are really feeling overwhelming, and that's making it hard for you to get started. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're actually working on a project – what's going through your mind, what sensations do you experience, and how does that feel for you?

Patient: When I try to work, my head fills up with thoughts like "this won't be good enough" or "what if nobody hires me again," and I end up staring at the canvas or avoiding it altogether. My chest gets tight, my hands get fidgety, and I find myself doing anything else—cleaning, scrolling—just to not start. It feels awful and kind of shameful, like I'm letting myself and everyone else down. I don't know... I guess I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed talking about it—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings, and I'm here to support you. Can you take a deep breath with me and pause for a moment? Now, let's focus on just this physical sensation of your body when those thoughts come up – can you describe what's happening in your body when you feel that tightness in your chest and your hands get fidgety?

Patient: My chest feels like it's being squeezed, and my breaths get quick and shallow so I almost forget to breathe properly. My hands go clammy and jittery—I end up rubbing my fingers or picking at stuff, my shoulders tense up, and my mind just goes fuzzy so I can't focus. I don't know... I guess I'm getting overwhelmed talking about it, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is really responding to those anxious thoughts, and it's making it hard for you to focus. Let's slow down and just notice this sensation of your chest feeling squeezed, without trying to change it or figure out why. Can you just be with that sensation of tightness, without trying to push it away or tell it to go away?

Patient: I try to, but as soon as I notice the tightness I start holding my breath and the "what if" thoughts come back. I can feel the squeeze for a few seconds and then my hands start rubbing together and I want to get up. I don't know... I guess it's really hard to just sit with it without wanting to do something else—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body has a built-in escape plan when you try to sit with the uncomfortable feeling. Let's take a tiny step back from that plan. Can you notice what's happening just before you start rubbing your hands together and wanting to get up – what's the next thought that comes up, before you react?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the thought that comes up is something like, "this won't be good enough" or "they'll see I'm a fraud and I won't get any work," and that makes me panic. Then I just feel restless and need to move or do something distracting. I'm starting to feel kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts can be really insistent. Can you say those thoughts out loud to yourself, without judgment – just "this won't be good enough" or "they'll see I'm a fraud and I won't get any work"? What happens in your body when you say those words out loud, rather than just thinking them?

Patient: "This won't be good enough"… "they'll see I'm a fraud and I won't get any work." Saying it out loud makes my chest clamp down, breath gets shallow, my hands start rubbing and my stomach drops like I want to run away. I don't know—I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying those thoughts out loud has triggered a strong physical response. Can you take a deep breath in and out, and then I want you to do something with me – let's make room for the physical sensations in your body to be present, without trying to change them or get away from them. Let's notice the sensation of your chest tightening, the feeling of your hands rubbing, and the sensation of your stomach dropping. Can you simply observe these sensations, without trying to push them away or react to them?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I notice the chest clamp and my breath getting shallow, my hands rubbing and my stomach sinking—it's like everything wants me to move. I don't know, I guess sitting with it just makes me panic more than anything, and I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're taking a big step by noticing and tolerating those sensations. It's like your body is trying to escape or distract itself. I want to suggest a tiny experiment: can you try to notice the sensation of your breath, not the thoughts or the thoughts that come with it? Can you just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or react to the thoughts?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I can feel the air moving but it's really shallow and my chest still clamps down, and my hands keep wanting to rub together. I don't know... I guess sitting with it just makes me panic—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is still trying to regulate itself. Can you notice the sensation of your hands rubbing together, without trying to stop it or change it – just observe the physical sensation, like a small, quiet voice in your body saying "oh, your hands are rubbing" or "your chest is clamping down".

Patient: I can feel them—kind of clammy and quick, like they're trying to do something to quiet me down. It makes a small, dizzy sort of buzz in my head. I don't know… I guess noticing it just makes me more on edge—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
The physical sensations seem to be a way for your body to cope with the anxiety. I want to suggest a small act of kindness towards your body – can you try to acknowledge the physical sensations, including the buzzing in your head, without trying to change them or push them away? Say to yourself, for example, "this sensation is here, and I'm noticing it" – no judgment, no trying to fix it, just acknowledgment.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "This sensation is here, and I'm noticing it." Saying it out loud feels a bit silly but I can feel my chest still tight and my hands fiddling. I don't know, I guess it helps a little, but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like acknowledging the sensations helps a tiny bit. I want to slow things down even more – can you try to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, and see if you can stay with it for just one more beat, without trying to change it or react to the thoughts?

Patient: Okay, I'll try—I can feel the breath, it's tiny and shallow, and I can stay with it for a beat. But then my chest tightens and the "what if" thoughts rush back; I don't know, I guess it's making me panicky—can we slow down a bit?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is still in a state of tension. Can you try to notice what happens when the thoughts come back – what is it about them that's triggering the tightening in your chest? Is it the words themselves, the fear of not being good enough, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... it's not just the words, it's like a whole domino — fear they'll judge me, that I'll lose the few gigs I have, that I'm not really an artist anymore. Saying that out loud makes my chest clamp and my mind races; I guess thinking about those losses and that identity stuff is what triggers the panic. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like a whole web of worries and fears is getting tangled up in your thoughts. I want to help you notice what's happening when you start to think about those losses and identity – what's the physical sensation in your body that starts to happen when you're thinking about it?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow, my stomach drops like I want to throw up, and my jaw and shoulders tense up—my hands start fidgeting and my head goes a bit fuzzy. It feels like everything's sinking and I just want to run away or do something to distract myself. I don't know... I guess I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're drowning in those physical sensations and thoughts. Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, just below you, and the sensation of the air on your skin, without getting caught up in the panic?

Patient: Okay... I can feel my feet on the floor, solid-ish, and the air on my face is cool. It actually helps a little, but my chest's still tight and the "what if" thoughts keep yanking me away. I don't know, I guess I'm starting to feel overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
You're noticing some small moments of calm amidst the chaos. I want to try something gentle – can you try to notice the sensation of your breath as it leaves your body, right now, in this moment – just the sensation of the breath moving out of your body, without trying to bring new breath in or change anything?

Patient: I can feel it—this little hollow whoosh as the air leaves, and for a beat my chest eases a bit, but it doesn't last; my hands are already itching to fidget. It helps… for a second, then the "what if" stuff creeps back and I get panicky. I don't know, I guess I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're finding small pockets of calm, but they're fleeting. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your hands being itchy – what's happening in your hands, right now, as you feel the itch?

Patient: They feel tingly and kind of electric, like there's a small itch under my skin and my fingers need to move. I catch myself rubbing them or picking at the edge of something to distract from the thoughts. I don't know... I guess it's just a nervous habit. Can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
You're aware of your hand movements, and that's a good start. Can you try to notice what's happening when you catch yourself rubbing your hands – what's the sensation in your hands and arms when you do that, and what's happening in your body when you're trying to stop the movement?

Patient: When I catch myself, my hands feel warm and tingly, like the rubbing dulls the buzzing in my head for a second. If I try to stop, my shoulders and jaw lock up, my chest tightens more, and the need to move gets louder—like I'm holding back a panic. I don't know, I guess talking about it makes me nervous—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're noticing the dynamic between the physical sensations and the thoughts. Can you try to notice the sensation of your jaw locking up – what's the feeling of it, the tension in your jaw, and the way it relates to the rest of your body?

Patient: My jaw feels clenched, like a tight knot, and that tension shoots up into my temples and down my neck so my shoulders hunch. When it's like that my breathing gets shallow and the rest of me goes rigid — then the hands start itching to move. I don't know... I guess it's all connected, but I'm starting to get a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your whole body is being pulled into tension when your jaw locks up. Can you try to notice what happens when you allow that tension to be there, without trying to release it or change it? Can you simply observe the sensation of the tightness in your jaw, the tension in your neck and shoulders, and the rest of your body, without trying to fix it or push it away?

Patient: I can try. When I let it be, my jaw really feels like a tight knot, my neck and shoulders feel heavy and hunched, and my breath gets shallow—like everything's just holding on. I don't know, I guess it's making me fidget and my mind wants to bolt; can we slow down?

You're noticing the physical sensations more clearly when you allow them to be present. Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of the air on your skin, as if you're simply observing them, without trying to change them or react to them?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor—kind of steady—and the air on my face, cool and a little calming for a moment. It helps for a beat, but then my chest tightens again and the "what if" thoughts yank me away. I don't know... I guess I'm starting to feel overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
You're finding small moments of calm, but they're fleeting. Can you try to notice what's happening right before the tightening in your chest and the thoughts come back – what's the sensation that's happening in your body just before that happens, before the thoughts "take over"?

Patient: I think right before it all hits I get a fluttery feeling low in my stomach and a catch in my throat, like a buzzy, restless energy. My breath shortens a bit, my shoulders tighten, and my hands start itching to move. I don't know... I guess it's getting a bit much—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're noticing a subtle but distinct sensation before the panic sets in. Can you try to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just before the panic starts – is it getting a bit shallower, or is it just a slight pause in the breathing?

Patient: I think it's both — there's a tiny catch, like a pause, and then the breaths get shallower, like my chest freezes for a beat. Right after that the flutter in my stomach and the itch in my hands kick in. I don't know... I guess it's getting a bit much, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
You're really tuning in to the subtle shifts in your body. Can you try to notice what's happening to the sensation of your chest, just before the flutter and itch kick in – is it getting a bit more constricted, or is it just a slight shift in the sensation?

Patient: It feels like a little band around my chest tightening, like it draws in for a second then locks, and my breathing shortens right after. I don't know... I guess talking about it more is making me kinda overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
You're describing a very specific physical sensation in your chest. Can you try to notice what's happening to the sensation of your hands, just as you're feeling that tightening in your chest – is the itch getting stronger, or is it still a gentle buzzing?

Patient: It gets louder—more of an electric, urgent itch that makes my fingers twitch and want to rub at anything nearby. If I try to hold still everything else tenses up and it feels worse, like I'm holding back a wave. I don't know… I guess I'm getting kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the physical sensations are escalating. Can you try to notice what's happening in the space between your breaths, just before you feel like you're holding back a wave – is there a slight pause, a tiny bit of stillness, before the tension and restlessness take over?

Patient: It's like a tiny blank—this little hiccup of silence—where everything just freezes for a beat, like I'm hanging over a cliff. Then the chest clamps and the itch in my hands spikes and I feel this urgent need to move. I don't know... I guess it's getting pretty overwhelming—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're finding a very small window of stillness, a tiny moment of pause before the chaos takes over. Can you try to savor that moment of stillness, just for a fraction of a second, without trying to do anything or react to it?

Patient: I try—there's this tiny flicker of relief, like the chest loosens just a notch and everything feels quieter for a beat. But then the panic rushes back and my hands start itching to move. I don't know... I guess I'm getting pretty overwhelmed—can we slow down?
