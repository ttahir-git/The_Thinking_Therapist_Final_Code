Patient: Hey — I've been feeling really anxious in social settings lately, to the point I keep avoiding gatherings with friends even though my partner tries to be supportive. It's weird because I'm usually outgoing, but my OCD and the stress about money make me want to bail. I guess I don't know how to make it stop.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a mix of things that are causing you distress in social situations, including your OCD, financial stress, and possibly a sense of responsibility to your partner. Can you tell me more about what happens when you imagine attending a social gathering with friends, and what your body and mind are like in that moment?

Patient: When I picture going to a gathering my chest tightens and my heart starts racing, and I keep scanning for exits like I need a way out — my mind floods with thoughts that everyone will notice I'm awkward or that I'll say something dumb, and then the OCD adds these repetitive worries about whether I touched or said the wrong thing. I get sweaty and jittery and usually end up texting my partner an excuse or just not going at all. I don't know, I guess it's embarrassing to admit how much it takes over, and it's kind of hard to stay on this without wanting to change the subject.

Therapist Answer:
Your body and mind seem to be reacting quite strongly to the prospect of social gatherings, and it's like a perfect storm of anxiety and OCD symptoms. It's understandable that it's hard to admit, but it sounds like it's really taking a toll on your life. Can you think of a situation where you've gone to a social gathering in the past and actually felt okay or even enjoyable? What might be different about that experience that made it more manageable for you?

Patient: I guess the last time I actually felt okay was a small dinner at my apartment with two close friends. It felt manageable because it was predictable, I had something to do so I wasn't the center of attention, my partner was there, and I knew I could step out if I needed to. I don't know, I guess that sense of control and familiarity made the difference — I'm getting a bit uneasy talking about it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like that sense of control and familiarity was a lifesaver in that situation. Can you think of a value that might be related to having a sense of control or feeling comfortable in social situations? What would having a stronger sense of that value mean to you, and what would it feel like to cultivate that more often?

Patient: I guess the value is connection — or maybe authenticity — wanting to feel like I belong and can be myself without over-thinking everything. If I had more of that, I'd probably be less hyper-aware and more relaxed, like I could join in without rehearsing every sentence. I'm getting kind of uneasy talking about this, I don't know… can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel uneasy – it's a vulnerable conversation. You've already taken a big step by acknowledging your desire for connection and authenticity. Can I ask, would you be willing to take a tiny step back from trying to "be perfect" or "rehearse every sentence" in social situations, and instead, focus on being present with others, without worrying about making mistakes? It might just be an experiment to see what happens.

Patient: I guess that sounds doable in theory, but I don't know if I can actually do it — my brain immediately goes to “what if I say something stupid” or “what if they notice I’m nervous” and I bail. Maybe I could try a tiny experiment, like staying for 15 minutes with my partner there so I have an out. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed planning this, can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Planning can be overwhelming. Let's slow down. Why don't we focus on just getting through the first 15 minutes together with your partner, without any expectations or plans beyond that? What would it feel like to sit with them, be present, and see how you show up without any specific goals or outcomes?

Patient: I guess it would feel kind of less suffocating — my chest would probably still tighten, but with my partner there it might be manageable and I could actually pay attention to the conversation instead of scanning for exits. I don't know, the idea of actually doing it makes me a bit panicky, and I'm getting overwhelmed talking about it, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is racing with all the "what-ifs" and it's making you feel anxious. Would you be willing to just take a deep breath with me, and when you're ready, we can start with something even smaller, like noticing your breath as you inhale and exhale, and see if that can bring you back to the present moment?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try one deep breath with you. I don't know, it actually loosens my chest a little but my head's still all over the place — I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down and just stay with this for a minute?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's just stay with your breath for another breath, and another, and see what happens. Notice where you're feeling the tension in your body, and when your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the sensation of your breath. No goal, no outcome, just the present moment.

Patient: Okay, I took another breath. My chest loosened a bit, but my shoulders are still tight and my thoughts keep jumping to bills and what I might say wrong. I don't know, it's hard to just stay here without planning an exit — can we slow down and do another breath together?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your thoughts are still jumping around, and your body is still holding onto some tension. Let's just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of your feet connected to the earth. Can you bring your attention to that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it?

Patient: Okay, I can feel my feet on the floor — it's kind of weird but a little calming. I guess my weight is more on my heels and there's a warm pressure under my arches, but my brain's still scrolling through bills and all the "what ifs" and that makes me tense. I don't know, I'm getting uneasy talking about this — can we slow down and stay with the grounding and breath a bit longer?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is still having trouble letting go. Let's just focus on the sensation of the warmth under your arches, and the feeling of your feet being grounded. Can you notice the sensation of your body sitting, without trying to change it or label it as "good" or "bad"? Just be with the feeling, as it is.

Patient: Okay, I can feel my hips and the chair pressing into me — it's kind of calming, but my brain keeps jumping to bills and "what if I mess up" thoughts. I don't know, I guess it's really hard to just be without planning an exit, and I'm getting uneasy — can we slow down and stay with the grounding a bit longer?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is still trying to hold onto control. Let's bring the focus back to the physical sensation of your body sitting in the chair. Can you notice the sensation of the chair supporting you, without trying to use it to control or avoid anything? Just be with the feeling of being supported, as it is.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the chair holding me, and that actually takes the edge off a little. My shoulders are a bit looser but my stomach's still tied in knots with bills and all those “what if I mess up” thoughts. I don't know, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now — can we slow down and stay with this a bit more?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is starting to relax a bit, but your mind is still a bit of a storm. Let's just focus on the sensation of your breath, and see if we can bring it back to the present moment. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just observe the breath, as it is.

Patient: Okay — breathing feels a bit calmer, my chest's looser and my shoulders relaxed a touch, but my head keeps ricocheting to bills and worrying I'll say something dumb. I don't know, I guess I need us to stay with the breath and grounding a little longer because if we rush I get panicky. Can we just do a couple more breaths together?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Let's stay with the breath and the physical sensations for a few more breaths. Notice how your body feels as you inhale and exhale, without trying to change it or analyze it. You're doing okay, just being with the present moment.

Patient: Okay, I did a few more breaths — my shoulders loosened a bit and my chest isn’t as tight, but my stomach’s still knotted and my head keeps flipping to bills and “what if I say something dumb.” I don't know, it actually helps to stay here, but I'm getting kind of overwhelmed talking about doing the experiment or planning anything. Can we just stay with the breath and grounding for a little longer? I guess I need that before we do anything else.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just be with the breath and the physical sensations for a bit longer. I'll stay with you, and we can just focus on being here together. No plans, no goals, no expectations. Just being present, in this moment, with your body and breath.

Patient: Okay… honestly, staying with the breath actually helps — my chest's a bit looser and I can feel my feet. I don't know, I'm still freaking out about the bills and whether I could even last 15 minutes at a party, so can we just sit with the breathing and grounding for a while longer? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed planning stuff — can we slow down and not talk details yet?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the breath and grounding are helping you feel a bit more grounded, but still, your mind is racing. Let's just sit with the silence for a while, without adding any thoughts or goals. You can just be with the space between the breaths, and let the body relax a bit more.

Patient: Okay... it's quiet. My chest's a little less tight but my head's still buzzing with bills and all the what-ifs, and it's kinda hard to keep talking. I don't know— I can stay here a bit longer, I guess, but my words feel heavy.

Patient: Okay... I can sit here with the quiet, I guess. My chest's a bit looser but my head's still loud with bills and the "what ifs," and I don't know—talking feels heavy right now, can we stay like this a bit longer?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're just existing in the present moment, with your thoughts still present, but not as overwhelming. That's enough for now. Let's just be with the stillness, and see what arises. No need to rush, no need to try to control anything.

Patient: Okay... I can sit with the stillness, but there's this wave of shame and frustration that keeps coming up and makes me want to disappear. I don't know, I guess it feels heavy and talking is hard right now, but I can stay here a bit longer.
