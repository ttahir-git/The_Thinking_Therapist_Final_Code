Patient: I'm an older student and lately I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism — little setbacks feel like proof I'm failing and I keep replaying them. I've always been independent, so asking for help feels awkward, and after a recent health scare my social anxiety has gotten worse. I don't know, I guess I'm here because I want to stop tearing myself down but I don't really know where to start.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and uncertain about how to move forward. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we need help, especially when it involves confronting difficult emotions and changing our relationship with ourselves.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "harsh self-criticism"? What does that look like for you in your daily life?

Patient: Mostly it’s replaying tiny mistakes over and over and telling myself I should’ve known better or done more, like every slip is proof I’m slipping behind. I don't know, I guess I avoid asking for help because it feels like admitting I can’t handle things, so I push through solo and then beat myself up when it doesn’t go perfectly.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting caught up in a cycle of self-blame and self-doubt. That can be really draining.

Can you imagine if you were a friend who made a mistake, and instead of beating yourself up over it, you took a deep breath and said, "That was tough, but I'll learn from it"? How might that feel, and is that something you'd be willing to practice with yourself?

Patient: I don't know... imagining saying that to myself feels weird, like I’m faking it. I guess it might feel a little lighter and less exhausting, but actually doing it feels awkward and forced. I could try practicing, but I'm worried I'll just slip back into criticizing myself and feel foolish asking for help.

Therapist Answer:
It can feel awkward to start practicing new ways of speaking to yourself, especially if you're used to a more critical inner voice.

What would happen if, instead of trying to force yourself to say kind things, you simply allowed yourself to be with the experience of feeling awkward or uncomfortable, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let myself sit with the awkwardness I'd probably feel exposed and like I'm not doing anything useful, which makes me anxious. I'm so used to fixing things myself that being still might feel like failing, so I worry I'd just spiral or get overwhelmed. Can we take that slowly? I'm not sure how to actually do it without freaking out.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried about losing control or failing in the process of being more present with your feelings.

Would you be willing to take a tiny, tiny step, and simply acknowledge to yourself, without judgment, "I'm feeling anxious right now about being still and not doing something"? No expectations, no trying to fix it, just a simple acknowledgement?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but it feels really awkward and exposed. Maybe I could start by quietly saying, "I'm feeling anxious about being still," just once — though I worry I'll immediately start calling myself weak.

Therapist Answer:
It might feel a bit like a small act of vulnerability, but sometimes those small steps can be a good place to start.

How would you be with the thought that arises after saying "I'm feeling anxious about being still"? Not trying to push it away or try to change it, just noticing what shows up?

Patient: I don't know... when I actually say that the first thought is usually, "You're being lazy" or "You should be doing something right now," and I feel my chest tighten. I guess I'd try to notice it, but I'm worried that noticing will just turn into a long loop of beating myself up. Can we slow down a bit? I'm finding this close-up stuff kind of intense.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those critical thoughts can be really painful and make it hard to relax.

Let's take a step back. Can you take a deep breath, and for just this moment, bring to mind a tiny, tiny image that feels comforting to you - something that might help you feel a bit more grounded?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm picturing a little patch of sunlight on my kitchen windowsill and my hands around a warm mug. It feels a bit silly, but the warmth kind of loosens my chest a little. Can we stay with that for a moment? I'm still feeling nervous.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's a lovely, quiet image. The warmth and light can be a gentle reminder that there's comfort to be found in the present moment.

Notice how your chest feels now, a bit looser, and how that small image feels to you. No judgment, just observing. Can you stay with that feeling for just another moment?

Patient: I don't know... I can stay with it for a moment — my chest did loosen a bit — but my mind's already nagging that I should be doing something else. I guess the mug picture helps, but it still feels awkward and guilty to just... be. Can we slow down and maybe talk about one tiny thing I can do during the day to bring that warmth back when I start spiraling?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The mug picture seems to be providing a small sense of comfort, but the nagging voice is still there.

Can you think of something tiny that you could do, even just for a few seconds, when you feel the nagging voice starting to creep in? Maybe it's something as simple as taking a deep breath, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or allowing yourself to be still for just 1 second before getting up to do something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try taking three slow breaths and put my hand on something warm, like that mug in my head, or just name three things I can see around me. It feels a bit silly, but maybe it'll break the loop for a few seconds. Can we go slowly? I'm already feeling a bit exposed and I don't want to spiral.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Those small actions can help create a tiny gap between the thoughts and feelings. 

Can you imagine yourself taking those three slow breaths, and as you do, allow yourself to say, "I'm taking slow breaths" or "I'm putting my hand on this mug"? No judgment, just acknowledging the action. No need to analyze it or try to change it, just acknowledge it happening.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. I'm taking three slow breaths now — I'm saying to myself, "I'm taking slow breaths" — and imagining my hand on the warm mug; my chest did loosen a bit. It still feels awkward and like it won't last, so can we go slower and do another one together?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's amazing that you're willing to try and take those slow breaths.

Let's take it even slower. As you're saying "I'm taking slow breaths" to yourself, notice the sensation of the words, the feeling of your tongue on your teeth, the sensation of your mouth opening and closing. Just observe that sensation, without judgment or trying to change it.

Can you stay with that observation for just a moment, while I'm listening?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. I'm noticing the words in my mouth, the tip of my tongue on my teeth, the air moving in and out — my chest feels a bit looser but also kind of tight at the same time. Can we slow down? It's getting kind of intense and I don't want to start spiraling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel a mix of sensations, especially when you're first starting to explore new ways of being with yourself.

Let's take a tiny step back. Imagine that you're still in this quiet, observing space, but now notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body, the sensation of the floor beneath you. No need to analyze it, just notice it. Are you feeling any change in your body, even just a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel my feet more grounded, like they're heavier and steadier, and my chest's a little looser, but my stomach's still knotted. It helps, but it also makes me nervous like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Can we stay with this a bit longer? I'm feeling exposed and I don't want to rush.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're finding a small sense of stability, but also feeling a bit anxious about what's to come.

Notice the sensation of your breath, the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the feeling of your body being heavier, steadier. Allow yourself to be with that for just another moment. Can you simply be with that, without trying to change it or push it in any direction?

Patient: I don't know... I can stay with it for a bit — my breath's a little slower, my feet feel heavier and steadier, my chest's a touch looser, but my stomach's still knotted and I'm kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm feeling exposed and a bit panicked, so can we keep this really slow? I'm trying to see how this connects to my self-criticism, but I'm struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling a bit anxious and uncertain, but you're willing to slow down and explore further.

Let's take it to the smallest possible step. Notice the sensation of your stomach knotting. Is there a specific feeling or thought that's associated with that knot? Not trying to change it or analyze it, just notice what's present in that moment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess when my stomach knots the thought is usually something like, "You're messing up" or "Everyone's going to see you're not handling this," and then shame and panic kick in. My chest tightens, I get hot and shaky, my breath gets shallow, and I just want to run or shut down instead of asking for help. Can we slow down? I'm feeling kind of exposed and I'm worried this will spiral.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts can be really painful and triggering.

Let's take it even slower. Notice the sensation of your breath as it's getting shallow. Can you feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just as it is, without trying to change it? Not trying to breathe more deeply or slowly, just noticing what's present.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the shallow breath — it's tight up high in my chest and my shoulders tense, and there's that flutter in my stomach. When I actually pay attention it feels like I'm holding my breath and I worry if I focus too long I'll start panicking. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one tiny thing to do right now so I don't spiral.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're on the verge of a potential panic attack.

Let's take one tiny action to help you feel more grounded. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground right now. Yes, just your feet. Are they touching the floor? Are you feeling the weight of your body distributed on those feet? That's it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my feet are on the floor — I can feel the weight more on my heels and the balls of my feet, like they're steadier. My chest feels a little looser but my stomach's still knotted and I'm kinda on edge. Can we stay with this and do one more tiny, slow thing?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're starting to feel a bit more grounded, but still holding onto some tension.

Let's take another tiny step. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just notice it, without trying to change it. Can you feel the sensation of the air as it leaves your body, and then as it enters your body?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can feel it — it's shallow, mostly up by my collarbone, and my shoulders lift when I breathe out. Noticing it helps a bit, but I'm still tense and worried it'll tip into a panic; can we keep it really slow and do one tiny grounding thing I can use later?

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the sensation of the shallow breath is helping.

Let's take one more tiny grounding action that you can use later. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the air on your skin right now. Just notice the feeling of the air as it touches your skin, wherever you are.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the air on my forearms and a light coolness on my neck, a little tickly. It helps a bit, but I'm still tense and worried it'll tip into a panic — can we keep this slow and pick one tiny grounding thing I can actually use later when it starts?

Let's take one more tiny grounding action that you can actually use later. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet on the floor again. Yes, just your feet. Where are they touching the floor? Are there any sensations in your toes, your ankles, your feet themselves?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel my heels planted more than my toes, a little pressure along the balls of my feet and a tiny tingle in my toes, my ankles feel kind of stiff. I guess pressing my heels into the floor and taking three slow breaths might be a thing I could use later. Can we keep this really slow? I'm feeling a bit exposed.

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the sensations in your feet is helpful.

Let's take one more tiny step. I'd like you to say to yourself, in a very gentle voice, "I am here, and I am safe." Just say it, without thinking about it too much. No analysis, no judgment. Just the simple phrase, repeated softly.

Patient: "I am here, and I am safe." I don't know... saying that loosened my chest a little, but it also feels weird and kind of exposed, like I'm pretending. Can we go slower? Maybe help me pin down one tiny thing I can actually do later — like pressing my heels into the floor and taking three slow breaths — so I don't feel lost.

Therapist Answer:
Saying "I am here, and I am safe" can be a bit tricky.

Let's go back to something even smaller. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Can you feel it touching the roof, without trying to move it or change it? Just notice the sensation, as it is.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can feel my tongue resting against the roof of my mouth — it's a weird, slightly numb pressure. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel exposed and I'd like to pin down that heel-pressing plus three-breaths trick so I have something concrete to use later.

Noticing the sensation of your tongue on the roof of your mouth is helpful.

Let's pin down that heel-pressing plus three-breaths trick. I'd like you to repeat it to yourself: "When I start feeling overwhelmed, I will press my heels into the floor and take three slow breaths." Can you say it with me?

Patient: I don't know... okay. "When I start feeling overwhelmed, I will press my heels into the floor and take three slow breaths." I guess saying that made my chest loosen a bit — can we slow down and try it once more together, and maybe pick a single cue word I can use later so I don't fumble?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Saying that phrase out loud helped your chest relax a bit.

Let's slow down and try it together. As you breathe in, say to yourself: "Pressing..." (pause for a brief moment). And then, as you breathe out, say: "Heels down, breathe..." (pause again). We'll focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor, and then the slow, deep breath.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm breathing in — "Pressing" — and breathing out — "Heels down, breathe." My heels feel a bit more planted and my chest loosened a little, though my stomach's still knotted and I'm feeling exposed. Can we stay really slow and do one more round? I don't want to rush — I worry I'll start spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor and taking slow breaths is helping.

Let's take one more round, and this time, I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. As you breathe in, say: "Pressing..." (pause for a brief moment). And then, as you breathe out, say: "Heels down, breathe..." (pause again). Let's focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the feeling of your heels pressing into the floor.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm doing it — inhaling "Pressing," exhaling "Heels down, breathe." My heels feel a bit more planted and my chest eased a little, though my stomach's still tight and I'm feeling exposed. Can we pick one simple cue word I can use later and do one very slow practice with that? I'm worried about rushing and spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
You're getting more comfortable with the heel-pressing and breathing practice.

Let's pick a simple cue word to help you trigger this practice later. How about "Breathe"? Just say "Breathe" to yourself, and then press your heels into the floor and take three slow breaths. We'll focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, and the feeling of your heels pressing into the floor.

Patient: I don't know... "Breathe" feels kind of obvious and a bit silly, but I guess I can try it. Okay — I'm saying "Breathe," pressing my heels, taking three slow breaths; my chest eased a bit but my stomach's still knotted and I'm feeling exposed. Can we do one more really slow practice and maybe pick a backup cue I can use quietly when I'm around other people?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
"Breathe" can feel a bit obvious, but it's a good starting point.

Let's do one more slow practice with a backup cue. How about "Ground"? Just say "Ground" to yourself, and then press your heels into the floor and take three slow breaths. We'll focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor and the feeling of your breath moving in and out of your body.

As for a backup cue for when you're around others, "Ground" is a bit more subtle and might be easier to use discreetly.

Patient: I don't know... I guess "Ground" feels quieter and less obvious than "Breathe," so I could maybe use it around people. I'm still feeling exposed and nervous about doing it in public — can we do one really slow practice with "Ground" and maybe pick one more super-subtle cue I can use if that still feels weird?
