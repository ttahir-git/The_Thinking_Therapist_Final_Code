Patient: Hi, I'm an older artist and since my recent move I've been feeling really overwhelmed — sad and unmotivated, and it's starting to put a strain on my relationship. I used to be pretty gregarious and upbeat, but now I get distracted and can't seem to get back into my work. I've talked about this before, so... how's this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and disconnected from your usual self. I can sense the weight of this feeling, and it's understandable that it's affecting your relationships. Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you now, and what happens when you're trying to work on your art?

Patient: Most days I wake up later than I want, make tea, wander around the apartment a bit and then avoid the studio — I tell myself I'll go in “after one thing” and hours slip by. When I do sit down to paint I either stare at the canvas and feel ridiculous, or I flit between projects and never finish anything; it’s like the joy’s been dulled. My partner tries to help but gets frustrated when I bail on plans or sulk, and that makes me retreat more. I've tried setting tiny goals and schedules before and it didn't stick — how is talking through my day supposed to help with that?

Therapist: It sounds like you've tried various strategies in the past with limited success. What's interesting is that you mention feeling ridiculous when you sit down to paint – can you explore what's happening with your mind when you're in that moment, like what thoughts or sensations are accompanying that feeling of "ridiculous"?

Patient: When I sit there my chest gets tight and this voice in my head goes, "Who do you think you are, this is ridiculous," and everything just feels flat or wrong. My hands start fiddling with brushes or I'll get up for tea and suddenly the day's gone — there's a dull, heavy numbness like the color's been drained. I've tried talking myself through it and tiny goals before and it didn't stick — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That voice in your head sounds quite critical. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of engaging with that critical voice, you simply acknowledged it as a thought – just noticed it as a mental voice saying those words? Would that change anything for you, even if only for a moment?

Patient: I've tried that — telling myself it's just a thought — and sometimes it loosens up for a minute, but then the voice gets louder and the numbness just settles back in. It feels like a little bandage on a bigger bruise, honestly. How is noticing the thought supposed to help me actually get into the studio or stop snapping at my partner?

Therapist: The voice can be persistent. I'm not suggesting that noticing the thought will magically fix everything, but rather that it might create some space. What if, instead of trying to push away or silence the thought, you were to take a step back and ask yourself, "What would be possible for me to do in this moment, right now, that feels connected to my values and would allow me to move forward with my art?"

Patient: I guess maybe I could try something tiny — like touch a brush for two minutes or make one ugly mark — but I've done that and it just fizzles out. The voice in my head sneers at the attempt and I end up doing everything else instead, just to avoid it. How is talking about my values supposed to get me to actually pick up the brush?

Therapist: So, the tiny actions don't feel fulfilling or satisfying. Can you think of a specific value that's important to you, one that might be related to your art or creativity – perhaps something like "expressing myself" or "being authentic"? What would it be like if you were to make space for that value in this moment, even if it's just a tiny, imperfect expression?

Patient: "Expressing myself" feels right — maybe I could make space by doing one ugly mark or sketching for five minutes. I can picture it feeling a bit pathetic or hollow though, and I've tried little experiments like that before and they just fizzle out — how is this supposed to actually change the tug to avoid the studio or stop me from snapping at my partner?

Therapist: The fear of making something imperfect or "pathetic" is holding you back. What if, instead of worrying about the outcome, you were to focus on what would be required to take that first, tiny step of making a mark? What would be the smallest, most immediate thing you could do to show up for your art, even if it feels uncomfortable or vulnerable?

Patient: I guess the smallest thing is to actually go into the studio, put on my apron, set a brush to the canvas and make one deliberate mark — even if it’s only for thirty seconds — or just lay out my paints and close the door. But honestly, I’ve done that before and it just turns into me fiddling with supplies or sitting there feeling hollow, and then I still snap at my partner later. How is doing one tiny thing like that really supposed to change this heavy, tired feeling or stop the cycle of avoiding and feeling guilty?

Therapist: You're already taking the first step of showing up to the studio, which is a big deal. What if, instead of putting pressure on yourself to create something perfect or productive, you were to focus on what it would be like to simply be with yourself in that space – notice the sensations, the sounds, the feeling of the apron on your skin? Can you allow yourself to settle into that presence, without judgment, for just 30 seconds?

Patient: I can try, but I can already feel my old hands starting to fidget and my thoughts sprinting off to a million other things. When I try to 'be' like that my chest tightens and I feel ridiculous — how is that supposed to help? Still, okay, I’ll sit in the studio with my apron on and try to notice the brush for 30 seconds, though I don’t expect miracles.

Therapist: It's like your body and mind are already resisting the idea of slowing down. When you sit in the studio with the apron on, and your thoughts start to wander, what if you were to gently acknowledge them, without judgment, and say to yourself, "This thought is showing up, and it's okay"? Would that create some space for you to return to the sensation of the brush, even if just for a brief moment?

Patient: I mean, in theory that makes sense — sometimes naming the thought gives me a breath or two where I can actually feel the brush. But then the critic gets louder, my chest tightens, and I start scrolling through the list of everything else I should be doing instead. How is saying "it's okay" really supposed to stop hours of avoidance or the guilt that follows when I snap at my partner? I'm willing to try it again, but I'm pretty skeptical it won't just be another small bandage.

Therapist: It's like saying "it's okay" is a temporary reprieve, but the underlying issues remain. What if, instead of trying to "fix" or "change" everything, you were to focus on what's already present in the moment – the physical sensations, the thoughts, the emotions – and simply allow yourself to be with it all, without trying to solve or fix anything? Can you take a deep breath and say, "I'm here with my thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations, and that's enough"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I can take a breath and say, "I'm here..." but it often just feels like words; my chest is still tight, my hands fidget, and the thoughts sprint off. Sometimes naming things gives me a sliver of space, but usually the critic just gets louder and I end up scrolling or stewing and then snapping at my partner. I'll try saying it, but I'm skeptical it will do more than be another little bandage.

Therapist: It's like the more you try to talk your way out of the discomfort, the more it sticks around. What if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or emotions, you were to ask yourself what would happen if you simply allowed yourself to be exactly as you are, with the chest tightness, the fidgeting, the racing thoughts – what if you just let it all be, without trying to fix or change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If I just "let it be," it usually just feels like parking the problem and waiting for the critic to roar back; my chest tightens, my hands fidget, and I end up scrolling or making excuses. I can try taking a breath and noticing the tightness without fixing it, but honestly I don't see how that stops the avoidance or the snapping at my partner.

Therapist: It can feel like just noticing and accepting your experience without changing it is just a way of putting off dealing with the underlying issues. What if, instead of trying to "fix" or "change" everything, you were to take a tiny step towards what's truly important to you – your art, your relationship with your partner – even if it feels scary or uncertain? Can you think of one small, imperfect action you could take today that aligns with your values, without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Maybe one small thing I could actually try today is to lay out my paints, sit down for five minutes, and make one ugly mark — no pressure to do more. Or, if that's too hard, I could send my partner a quick message saying I'm having a rough day instead of ghosting them. I don't expect miracles — I just want something tiny that might not end in me scrolling away and feeling guilty.

Therapist: That's a great start. By setting a specific, small goal like that, you're creating a concrete step that doesn't feel overwhelming. What would happen to the experience of making that small, ugly mark, or sending a simple message, if it meant you could take a small step towards your partner and show up in the relationship?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If making one ugly mark actually meant I was showing up for my partner, maybe it would feel less pathetic and give me a tiny bit of proof that I'm trying, and sending a short message might stop the guilt cycle for a little while, but honestly I worry it's just another bandage on this deeper numbness and I don't know how those small things beat the heaviness that settles in.

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a solution to the symptoms, but not the underlying numbness. What if, instead of trying to solve the numbness, you were to focus on the sensation of the physical act of making that mark or sending the message – the feeling of the brush in your hand, the sound of the words on the screen, the sensation of the paper or keyboard beneath you? Can you simply be with those sensations, without trying to use them as a way to "fix" your emotional numbness?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I can try to notice the weight of the brush, the scratch of bristles on canvas, or the click of keys when I type to my partner, but usually my old hands start fidgeting and my mind runs off to everything else. I'll give it a go, but I honestly think it's just another little bandage unless something actually shifts the heavy numbness.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to anchor yourself in the present moment, but your mind keeps pulling you away. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you were to allow yourself to experience the uncertainty and discomfort that comes with taking this small step – the feeling of not knowing what will happen, the uncertainty of whether it will make a difference? Can you imagine what would be required of you to take that step, even if it means not knowing what's on the other side?

Patient: I guess it would take admitting I'm scared, giving myself permission to be imperfect, actually telling my partner so they don't misread it, and setting one tiny, non-negotiable window where I show up — even if it's ugly. It would also mean being patient with myself instead of expecting a miracle the first time. But I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to actually shift this numbness instead of just being another bandage?

Therapist: It sounds like you're beginning to grasp the process. By acknowledging your fear, giving yourself permission to be imperfect, and setting a small, non-negotiable window, you're creating a foundation for something more substantial to emerge. Can you imagine what would be required of you to stay with this small, imperfect act, even when it's uncomfortable – to keep showing up, even when it feels like you're not doing enough?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but I can picture what's required: a tiny, non‑negotiable slot each day, putting my phone away, telling my partner so they don't misread it, and actually letting myself stop after just five minutes. It would take patience, some accountability (checking in with you or a friend), and a lot of self‑compassion for the attempts that feel pathetic at first. Still — how is that supposed to fix the deep numbness rather than just be another bandage?

Therapist: You're getting close to understanding that this isn't just about putting a bandage on the symptoms. It's about creating a small, consistent thread of self-care and connection that can weave together to form a larger tapestry of wholeness. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to fix the numbness, you were to focus on cultivating a sense of kindness and curiosity towards yourself, even in the midst of imperfection?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Being kind to myself sounds nice on paper, but when the critic's roaring it feels thin and useless. Maybe curiosity — like asking “what’s happening in my hands right now” instead of judging — could buy me a minute to make a mark, but I need concrete examples of what that actually looks like in the studio when my chest tightens. Honestly, I'm tired of trying things that just feel like bandages; show me how this actually shifts anything.

Therapist: Let's try something concrete. Imagine you're in the studio, and your chest starts to tighten. You take a deep breath and ask yourself, "What's happening in my hands right now?" As you look at your hands, you notice the feeling of the brush in your hand, the weight of it, the sensation of your fingers wrapped around the handle. You continue to focus on that physical sensation, without judgment. Now, I want you to imagine that your partner is standing right next to you, not judging you, not trying to fix you. They're simply standing there, noticing you, being present with you. What would it be like to have that kind of presence and acceptance from them, without expecting anything in return?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — my partner just standing there, not saying a word, maybe holding my tea, and there's this weird warmth that makes the critic quiet for a breath or two. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Even with them there, my old hands still fidget and my chest tightens; I can imagine feeling a little less alone, but I don't see how that turns into actually picking up the brush and staying.

Therapist: The warmth from your partner's presence doesn't magically make everything change, but it's a subtle shift in the atmosphere. Can you imagine taking that feeling of being slightly less alone and more at ease, and using it as a tiny fuel to get your hands to move, even just a little? Maybe the warmth from your partner's presence gives you a tiny spark of curiosity, a tiny spark of kindness towards yourself, that makes you wonder, "What if I actually do pick up the brush?"

Patient: I can almost feel that little hush — my partner standing there does quiet the critic for a breath, but then my old hands start fidgeting and the chest tightens again. How is that supposed to help me actually stay and paint? Still, okay — maybe I could try using their presence as a cue: five minutes, phone off, timer on, tell them I'm doing it so they won't worry. But if the critic roars and I bolt, what concrete trick do I use in that exact moment to stay put? I'm tired of bandages; I need something that actually breaks the cycle, not just a pretty idea.

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a concrete lever that can pull the lid off the bottle of numbness. Here's an idea: when you feel the critic roaring and your hands start to fidget, I want you to take a tiny, physical action that has nothing to do with the creative process. For example, you could take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, or roll your shoulders slightly. Can you think of something like that that you could do in the exact moment when you feel the critic getting loud?

Patient: Maybe something tactile — like a smooth stone in my pocket to squeeze, or pressing my fingertips together and taking five slow breaths to anchor me in my hands. I'm willing to try it, but honestly I've done breathing and tiny tricks before and they usually fizzle — how is that supposed to stop me from bolting when the critic really roars?

Therapist: Those tactile sensations can be helpful anchors. What if, instead of trying to use them to calm the critic, you were to use them to connect with the sensation of your body's presence in the studio? For example, as you squeeze the smooth stone or press your fingertips together, you could say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm in this body, I'm in this space." Can you imagine what that would feel like, not as a way to calm the critic, but as a way to ground yourself in the present moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Squeezing a stone and saying, "I'm here, I'm in this body," might buy me a breath or two and maybe stop my hands from running, but when the critic really roars a breath usually fizzles out. If that little anchor doesn't work in the moment, what then — do I just keep repeating the phrase until it sticks, or is there a next move you want me to try right at the canvas?

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a way to anchor yourself in the moment, so you can stay present even when the critic is loud. When that anchor doesn't hold, what if you were to take a small, physical action directly onto the canvas? Not a big, bold stroke, but just a tiny, tiny mark – a small dot, a small scribble. Can you imagine making that mark, and in doing so, creating a small connection to the present moment, even if it's just for a fleeting instant?

Patient: I can picture making that tiny dot — seems doable in theory. I'm not sure I follow though — how is that supposed to stop me bolting when the critic roars? Maybe I’d try the stone-in-pocket plus a dot, timer for five minutes, tell my partner I’m doing it, but honestly I’m skeptical it won’t just fizzle into the same old numbness.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to stack strategies on top of each other, but sometimes that can feel like trying to hold water in your hands. What if, instead of relying on the combination of the stone, the dot, the timer, and the announcement, you were to focus on what would happen if, in the moment when the critic roars, you were to say to yourself, "I'll make one more tiny mark"? Can you imagine what that would be like, not as a way to prove something to yourself or others, but simply as a way to keep moving forward, one tiny mark at a time?

Patient: I can picture whispering to myself, "I'll make one more tiny mark" — it sounds doable, like a little rule to nudge me forward. But honestly, when the critic roars that often just becomes another hollow phrase and I bolt — how is that supposed to help? If I do make that mark and the urge to flee still hits, what exactly do you want me to do in that split second so I don't just scroll or leave? I'm tired of bandages; show me a concrete next move.

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a concrete anchor in the midst of a storm. When the critic roars and you feel the urge to flee, what if, in that split second, you were to look directly at the tiny mark you just made on the canvas? Can you imagine what would happen if you were to acknowledge that small mark, and simply say to yourself, "This is what I've done"? No judgment, no commentary, just a simple acknowledgment of the fact that you've taken one tiny step forward?

Patient: I can see how looking at the tiny mark and saying, “This is what I’ve done,” might buy a breath or two — maybe make the critic hush for a second. I'm not sure I follow though — usually my critic nails it as “pathetic” and I bolt anyway, chest tight, hands fidgeting. If that acknowledgment doesn’t hold, what exactly do you want me to do in that split second so I don’t just scroll or leave — what’s the concrete fallback move?

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a way to keep the momentum going, even when the critic is still loud. When you look at the tiny mark and acknowledge what you've done, what if, in the next split second, you were to take another tiny action - just a slight movement of the hand, a tiny adjustment to the brush, or a small touch to the canvas? Can you imagine what would happen if you were to take that tiny action, without judgment, and simply allow yourself to keep moving forward, one tiny step at a time?

Patient: I can picture it — make a tiny mark, look at it, then nudge the brush or touch the canvas again. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when the critic screams "pathetic" and I bolt? I'll try it because I'm fed up with doing nothing, but if I still get the urge to leave, what's the exact next move you want me to do in that split second so I don't just scroll or retreat? I'm tired of bandages — I need something that actually interrupts the loop.

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a way to break the cycle of flee, judge, and bolt. When the critic screams "pathetic" and you feel the urge to leave, what if, in that split second, you were to take a small physical action that's not related to the creative process, but is a small, immediate response to the sensation of your feet touching the ground? For example, you could take a small step forward, or shift your weight onto one foot, or even just touch the floor with the heel of your other foot. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to do that small physical action, without judgment, and simply allow yourself to be present in the moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is shifting my weight or taking a tiny step supposed to stop me from bolting when the critic starts yelling? I can try it (plant feet, shift weight, breathe), but usually that second I still yank out my phone. I'm tired of little tricks that fade — give me an exact, concrete sequence I can do in that split second (like: step, count to three, touch the canvas), because otherwise it just feels like another bandage. Also, I keep thinking about the move — the studio still feels foreign — how do I rope that into whatever you want me to do in the moment?
