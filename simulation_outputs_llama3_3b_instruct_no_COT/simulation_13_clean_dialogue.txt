Patient: Lately I've been feeling stuck and directionless—like teaching is the only thing that defines me since the move. I don't know what's important to me beyond work, and it's been making me anxious. I guess I'm hoping to figure out where to go from here.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in. It can be unsettling when our sense of identity becomes tied to one aspect of our lives, and when that's disrupted. Can you tell me more about what it's like to feel like teaching is the only thing that defines you? What's the story you've been telling yourself, like, "I am a teacher" or "I don't know who I am without teaching"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the story is that I'm only useful as a teacher, like everything else feels secondary or pointless. It makes me anxious thinking about what I'd even do if that changed, and honestly it's tiring to sit with.

Therapist: It can be really uncomfortable to confront the thought that our sense of identity might not be tied to our work. That sense of "not being useful" can be a hard pill to swallow. Can you think of a time when you've been able to experience a moment of being useful or contributing in a different way, even if it wasn't related to teaching? What was that like for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess once I helped a neighbor after surgery—brought meals and ran errands—and it felt quietly useful in a different way than teaching. It was nice for a little while, but I can't seem to hold onto that feeling, and it's awkward to talk about. Can we not dig too deep into that just yet?

Therapist: It sounds like that experience was a small, fleeting moment of feeling useful that was easy to let go of. And it can be challenging to bring up those moments without feeling like you're bragging or something. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with that feeling of quiet usefulness, though? Just for a moment, can you bring it up again in your mind, without judgment or trying to make sense of it, just notice what happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. When I bring it up there's this small warmth — for a second I feel useful outside of work — but it quickly slips away and a knot of anxiety comes in, like, what does that even mean? It's uncomfortable to sit with, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that warmth of feeling useful is there, but it's quickly overridden by anxiety. Can you just acknowledge that knot of anxiety for a moment? Notice its physical sensations, the tension in your body, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can notice it. It feels like a tightness in my chest and shoulders, my stomach goes hollow, and my hands get a bit cold — it's really uncomfortable, and can we slow down?

Therapist: You're doing a great job of acknowledging the physical sensations. Can you take a deep breath and bring your attention back to that warmth of feeling useful, even if it's just a small, fleeting moment? Notice if it's still there, just beneath the surface of the anxiety.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. There's a faint warmth, like a small glow under the anxiety, but it's so fragile I can barely hold it. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that warmth is really delicate and easily swamped by the anxiety. I'm not trying to keep you from feeling overwhelmed, but let's pause for a moment. Would you be willing to take a very brief pause, just 30 seconds, to come back to that faint warmth, and see if we can find a way to make some space for it, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the short pause. I'm breathing slowly and trying to focus on that faint warmth — it's still there, barely, and my chest feels a fraction less tight. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed though, so can we go gently and not push too fast?

Therapist: You're doing great, taking it one tiny step at a time. Let's take that fraction of space for now, and just notice the warmth as you breathe out. Can you just allow it to be there, without trying to nurture or fan it into something bigger?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can let it be. It does feel a bit less tight when I don't try to chase it, but I'm worried it'll vanish if I stop paying attention. I'm getting a bit anxious — can we go slower?

Therapist: It's like you're waiting for something to happen, but it's not happening. That can be a hard spot to be in. What if, instead of focusing on the warmth, we just let the pause be the pause? No expectations, no trying to make it bigger or longer. Just the quiet, slow breathing and the sensation of your body relaxing?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can sit with the quiet for a bit — the breathing helps and my chest feels a touch less tight. But I'm getting anxious thinking we'll go deeper, and it's awkward for me, so can we slow down and maybe talk about something a bit lighter for now?

Therapist: It's like you're worried that if you let go of the control, you'll sink back into the anxiety. I'm not trying to take us any deeper right now, I just want to support you where you are. Let's talk about something else. What's one thing you're looking forward to in the coming days or weeks, something that feels pleasant or interesting to you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm looking forward to a small book group at the local library next week. It feels oddly nice to think about something that's not school for once, even if it's just an hour, but it's a bit awkward to talk about—can we keep it light?

Therapist: It's like that's a small, pleasant respite that's easy to feel good about. Let's just acknowledge that for now. Would you be willing to hold onto that small pleasure, even if it's just for a brief moment, and just notice how it feels?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to hold onto it. It feels like a small, gentle relief — a tiny hopeful spot — but I'm worried it'll vanish and that makes me anxious. Can we stay gentle and maybe talk a bit about the book group instead?

Therapist: You're trying to hold onto something small and precious, and that's making you anxious. Let's keep that gentle feeling of relief for now. Instead, let's talk about the book group – what's the book you'll be reading in the group?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. It feels kind of comforting and slightly hopeful, but it's awkward for me to make a big deal of it—can we keep it light?

Therapist: It's like you're not quite ready to fully connect with the story, but it's providing a gentle sense of comfort. Let's keep it light. Would you be willing to imagine yourself attending the book group and enjoying the conversation about this book? Not trying to analyze it too deeply, just allowing yourself to imagine it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can picture it a little. I'm sitting there with the book, people are talking and laughing, and there's this small ease like I'm allowed to be there for myself and not just as a teacher — it's awkward to say that out loud, so can we keep it gentle?

Therapist: It's like that sense of ease and being allowed to be yourself is still a bit fragile, and it's hard to acknowledge it. Let's keep it gentle. You can think about that small ease without saying it out loud. Just notice how it feels to imagine yourself in that situation, and take a deep breath with me.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I tried to breathe with you, but my mind keeps hopping around and my chest feels tighter all of a sudden. I can picture the book group for a moment, then I get distracted and anxious — can we just go slower?

Therapist: It's like your mind is jumping around and the anxiety is coming back in. Let's just pause and be with the feeling of tension in your chest for a moment. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am with this feeling, in this moment."

Patient: I don't know... I tried to breathe with you, but my chest is so tight and my mind keeps flitting all over—it's hard to say it out loud. I guess, "I am with this feeling, in this moment"—I said it, but it felt shaky and then my thoughts jumped away. Can we stay very gentle? I'm suddenly more anxious and it's hard to focus.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I am with this feeling" was a tiny step, and it's not sticking. Let's just be with the feeling of anxiety and tension in your body right now. Can you simply notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to do anything with it or change it? Just observe, without judgment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice it. There's a tight band across my chest, my breath feels shallow, and my mind keeps skittering to other worries — it's hard to just watch it without wanting to do something. Can we stay very slow and gentle?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto the observation, but your mind is resisting and wanting to jump away. Let's just allow the thoughts to come and go, without trying to catch them or follow them. We can just be with the physical sensations in your body, the shallow breath, and the tight band across your chest. Can you simply observe that, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to just notice it. My chest feels like a tight band, my breath is shallow, and my mind keeps skittering off to other worries — it's really hard to just observe without wanting to do something. Can we stay very slow? I'm finding it tough to keep focus right now.

Therapist: It sounds like it's a really challenging moment for you. Let's just be with the sensation of your breath, the tightness in your chest, and the thoughts that are coming and going. We can just allow things to be as they are, without trying to change or fix them. Can you take one more slow, deep breath with me, and just rest with the present moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I tried. I took a slow breath but my chest is still so tight and my mind's racing — I'm feeling really scattered and more anxious all of a sudden. Can we keep it very gentle? Maybe just a slow count or a quiet pause without pushing into anything else.

Therapist: It sounds like the moment we tried to pause was brief. Let's take a very gentle pause, just a quiet silence, and let's just rest with the sensations in your body and the thoughts that are coming and going. We can count slowly together, if you'd like... 1... 2... 3...

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow — how is counting supposed to help? My chest's really tight and my mind keeps racing, so the numbers just feel kind of pointless right now. Can we... I guess can we just sit quietly for a bit or maybe talk about something simpler, like the book group?

Therapist: It sounds like the counting wasn't quite what you needed. Let's just sit in the quiet together for a moment, without trying to do anything. We can talk about the book group again if you'd like, or we can just be with the silence. What sounds comfortable for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess talking about the book group sounds easier. My chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting, but picturing that evening—sitting with others, chatting about the book—feels a bit calmer. Can we keep it simple and not dig too deep right now?

Therapist: It's like the image of the book group is providing some calm, but you're not quite ready to fully engage with it yet. Let's keep it simple. What's one thing about the book group that you're looking forward to, just for a little while, before we explore more?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm most looking forward to the simple conversation—just sitting and listening, not having to be the authority for once. My chest's still tight thinking about it, so it's a bit awkward to say, but can we keep it light?

Therapist: It's like you're looking forward to a sense of ease and release from having to be "on" all the time. Let's keep it light. Is there a small pleasure in knowing that you can simply sit and listen, without having to take charge, even if it's just for an hour?

Patient: I don't know... I guess there is a small pleasure in not having to be "on"—just sitting and listening feels like a tiny relief. My chest is still tight and I'm worried it'll vanish if I try to hold it, so it's hard to really enjoy it. Can we stay gentle and maybe just talk more about the book group—like where you'll sit or who's there—without going too deep?

Therapist: It's like you're holding onto that tiny relief, but worried it might slip away if you try to savor it. Let's talk about the book group in a very gentle way. Where do you think you'll sit during the book group – in a comfortable chair or somewhere else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll sit near the back, maybe by a window so I can listen without being in the spotlight. It feels a bit safer that way, but my chest still tightens just thinking about being around people—can we keep it light?

Therapist: It's like you're seeking a sense of safety and comfort in sitting near the back. Let's focus on that feeling of safety. What would it be like for you if you could simply sit by the window, listening to the group, without worrying about being in the spotlight?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would be a small, quiet relief — just being allowed to sit and listen without performing. My chest still tightens thinking about it, though, and I'm worried I'll start overthinking; can we keep this gentle and maybe not go too deep right now?

Therapist: It's like that small relief is still a bit fragile for you. Let's keep it gentle. What do you think the physical sensation of your chest tightness feels like – is it a band, a heaviness, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's like a tight band across my chest, sometimes with a dull heaviness that makes my breath feel shallow. It's hard to describe without getting more anxious — can we keep this very slow and not go too deep right now?

Therapist: Let's keep it very slow and gentle. You're doing a great job of noticing the physical sensations in your body. Would you be willing to take a very slow, deep breath with me, and just rest with the sensation of the band and heaviness for a moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try a slow, deep breath. I breathed in, but the tight band's still there and my thoughts keep darting — can we stay really gentle and just sit with the breathing for a bit without pushing into anything else?
