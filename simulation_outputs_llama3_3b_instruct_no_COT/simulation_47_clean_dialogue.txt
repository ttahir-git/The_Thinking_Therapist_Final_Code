Patient: I can't stop worrying about my performance at work—I'm an accountant and every little task feels like it could blow up my career if I miss something. That worry just makes me freeze and procrastinate, so I either over-check everything or put it off until the last minute. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of messing up has you stuck in a cycle of over-checking and procrastination. Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself over-checking or putting things off – what's the immediate experience like in that moment?

Patient: Usually there's this tight, buzzy feeling in my chest and my head gets loud with "what if" thoughts—like I'm replaying every possible mistake. I start re-opening spreadsheets, re-reading emails, recalculating things instead of actually finishing the task, and then I feel guilty and angry at myself because time's slipping and I haven't moved forward. It sort of snowballs into paralysis, and honestly, how is talking about this supposed to help? I've tried breathing apps and sticking to checklists and they just don't seem to stick.

Therapist: It sounds like the process of over-checking and re-doing is actually an attempt to feel more in control and avoid the fear of making a mistake. Can you see if there's a value at stake here – what might you be trying to protect or ensure by doing all of this?

Patient: I guess I'm trying to protect my reputation and job security—like if I miss something it could get me fired or at least make people think I'm incompetent. It's tied up with not wanting to disappoint my family and myself, like my worth depends on being flawless. But honestly, how is knowing that supposed to help? I've known that for years and it still doesn't stop me from freezing up.

Therapist: It sounds like your self-worth is deeply tied to your performance and reputation. What would it be like if you didn't try to protect your reputation with such intensity – if you allowed yourself to be imperfect and make mistakes, even if it meant potentially facing the possibility of being seen as flawed?

Patient: I guess it would feel like a weird relief sometimes — like less pressure — but mostly it'd be terrifying, like I'd be exposed and everyone would see I'm not perfect. I'd probably end up compensating later anyway because I'd be so worried about letting people down, especially my family and my boss. How is that supposed to help? I've tried telling myself mistakes are okay and it just doesn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like even the idea of being imperfect is still closely tied to the fear of disappointing others. What would it be like if you were to approach your work and yourself with kindness and compassion, even when you're not meeting your own high standards – if you were to say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"?

Patient: I mean, on paper it sounds like it would be a relief — less pressure, maybe I'd actually finish stuff instead of spiraling. But when I try to tell myself that, it feels hollow; my chest tightens and I end up double- and triple-checking anyway, then getting mad at myself for not being kinder. How is that supposed to help? Can people actually learn to mean it, or is that just something you say that doesn't stick in real moments?

Therapist: It sounds like there's a gap between the words you use and the feelings that come up when you try to practice kindness towards yourself. Can you explore what might happen if you were to approach those moments of tightness and self-criticism with a sense of curiosity, like you're just noticing what's showing up in your body and emotions, without trying to change or judge it?

Patient: If I tried that curiosity thing, I'd notice the tightness and the flood of "what if" thoughts, but it usually just feels like I'm cataloguing problems — which then becomes another loop of checking. Every technique that sounds calming ends up turning into another thing I have to do correctly, and then I just get more frustrated. How is noticing any of this supposed to stop me from spiraling when a report is due?

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to be more aware of your experience can feel like adding another task to your plate. What would it be like if, instead of trying to manage or control your thoughts and feelings, you were to make space for something more?

Patient: Make space for something more—what does that even mean for me at my desk? How is that supposed to help when I'm already panicking? If it means letting the dread hang out while I keep working, that sounds impossible because my brain won’t stop and I end up checking more; I'm tired of techniques that just become another rule I fail at. Can we slow down? Show me one tiny thing I could actually try in the moment that isn't another "must" I have to get right.

Therapist: Let's start small. What if, in this moment, you simply allowed yourself to pause – not to try to change or control anything, but just to pause? Would it be possible to give yourself permission to just be with the feeling of panic and dread, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: Okay — I can try to pause for ten seconds, but honestly, how is that supposed to help? When I do pause at my desk my chest still tightens and the "what ifs" get louder and it just feels like wasted time I should be using to double-check things. Fine — I'll try one tiny thing: one slow breath in and out and quietly name the feeling as "anxiety" without trying to fix it, and then tell you what happened.

Therapist: I'd like you to repeat that for me: "Anxiety". Just say it out loud, slowly, and then take that one slow breath in and out. Then, when you're ready, tell me what happens next – no judgment, just what shows up.

Patient: Anxiety.

I took one slow breath in and out. For a brief second the tightness eased, but the "what if" thoughts are still loud and my energy feels flat, like I can't really push through them. I don't know—how is that supposed to help when I just end up re-checking everything? Can we try something actually practical I can do at my desk that won't feel like another thing I have to fail at?

Therapist: It sounds like the pause gave you a tiny moment of relief, but the underlying energy was still there. Can you consider what would happen if, instead of trying to push through the energy, you simply made space for it to be there – allowed it to exist without trying to change or push against it?

Patient: I can kind of imagine it — the anxiety just being background noise instead of a signal to start re-checking — but honestly, right now it just feels like letting it in would make it louder, not less. My energy's low and I'm skeptical this will stop me from opening files again. Maybe a practical test: let the feeling be for one minute, then set a short timer (like 10 minutes) to work on the task and only allow one quick check at the end — but I've tried timers and they fail me. How is that supposed to be any different, and can you walk me through doing one right now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're concerned that letting the anxiety be, might actually increase it. Let's try something else. I'd like you to work on the task for 2 minutes, and when the timer goes off, I'll help you with the single quick check you mentioned. Can you commit to just showing up to the task for 2 minutes, without any expectations or goals for what you want to achieve?

Patient: Alright. I can try two minutes—I'll set a timer and open the spreadsheet and just focus on the current line. If the urge to re-check hits, I'll jot it down and keep going instead of opening other files. I don't expect it to fix anything, but fine—I'll do it.

Therapist: Let's set the timer for 2 minutes. As we wait for the timer to go off, I'll be here with you. When it's time, we'll do the single quick check together.

Patient: Okay, starting now — I opened the spreadsheet and I'm focusing on this one line. My chest's tight and my brain's noisy, so instead of opening other files I stuck a note that says "check" and I'm keeping my cursor where I am. This already feels like another tiny rule I could fail at, so... how is this supposed to help if the urge gets louder?

Therapist: It sounds like the "tiny rule" is still a bit of a challenge. Let's try to reframe this: what if the "rule" wasn't about achieving something specific, but rather about simply showing up to the task – just keeping the cursor where it is, keeping the focus on that one line?

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to keep the cursor on the line, but there's this low, burning shame and frustration that keeps pulling my attention away and makes me feel like I'm already failing. I can try to hold focus and just jot "check" if the urge hits, but honestly—how is that supposed to help when my brain won't stop circling?

Therapist: The shame and frustration are still there, and it's not letting go. Let's try something else. I'd like you to bring your attention back to the feeling of the physical sensation in your body – where is the shame and frustration located in your body? Can you describe it to me, without judgment?

Patient: Mostly it's a heavy, sinking weight in my chest and a tight knot in my stomach that spreads into my shoulders and neck—everything feels clenched and small. It makes me move slower, like I'm already behind or already messed up, which just fuels the checking. How is noticing that supposed to help when it just drags me back into the loop?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are really amplifying the feelings of shame and frustration. What if, instead of trying to change those sensations or push through them, you simply acknowledged them as present – like a fact – without judgment?

Patient: Alright, I'll try that. There's a heavy sinking in my chest and a tight knot in my stomach — that's just there. Saying it out loud made it feel a bit blunted for a second, like the edge of it softened, but then the "what ifs" crawled back in and it started to feel like another thing I'm supposed to do right. How is that supposed to help long-term? If it at least makes the shame a tiny bit less sharp, fine — can you guide me through doing that once at my desk and then actually getting back to the task without turning it into another rule?

Therapist: It sounds like acknowledging the sensations helped a bit, but the "what ifs" are still there. Let's try to ground ourselves in the present moment, without trying to change anything. I'd like you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am here, with this task, in this moment".

Patient: Okay. I took a slow breath and said, "I am here, with this task, in this moment." For a second my chest loosened and the knot eased a bit, but then the "what ifs" and a hot shame crept back and my attention started drifting. It dulled the edge briefly, but didn't stop the loop—how is that supposed to help when it just becomes another thing I have to do? Can you actually walk me through doing that once at my desk and getting back to the task without it turning into another rule?

Therapist: It sounds like the acknowledgement helped a bit, but the cycle is still intact. Let's try something different. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground – the feeling of your weight distributed on the chair, the floor, and the air on your skin. Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or think about it. Can you bring your attention to your feet, and just be with that feeling for a moment?

Patient: Okay... my feet feel heavy on the floor, pressure under my heels and a little warmth around the toes — it actually makes my breathing slow for a second and the edge softens a bit. But the shame's still under it, nagging at me, and my mind's already itching to check other files. How is that supposed to stop the checking? Fine — can we do that 2-minute task now and then do the single quick check like you said?

Therapist: It sounds like the grounding exercise helped a bit, but the shame and nagging thoughts are still there. Let's do the 2-minute task as we discussed. I'll count down the seconds with you: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Just focus on the task, keeping the cursor on the line, and jotting down "check" if the urge arises. When the timer goes off, we'll do the single quick check. Ready to start?

Patient: Yeah — ready. Starting now. I’m keeping the cursor on the line, chest’s tight and that shame keeps tugging at me, but I’ve written "check" on a sticky note if the urge hits.

Therapist: We've made it to the 2 minutes. When you're ready, we'll do the single quick check.

Patient: I did the quick check — scanned the line, fixed a tiny decimal and a header, nothing catastrophic. My chest's still tight and that shame's still tugging, and honestly I already want to re-open other files. How is that supposed to help long-term — what do I actually do when the urge resurfaces five minutes from now?

Therapist: It sounds like the quick check was a small victory, but the underlying feelings are still present. That's okay. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that you're already thinking about re-opening files, and that's a good sign that you're approaching the task with some familiarity. Now, I'd like to ask: what would it be like if, instead of trying to avoid or distract yourself from the shame and tightness, you simply continued to focus on the task at hand, without judgment?

Patient: Maybe that could help in theory — if I actually stayed on the line and didn’t judge myself, I might finish things and the checking could quiet down. But right now it feels impossible; my chest's tight, shame's nagging, and the urge to reopen files is already bubbling up. How is that supposed to help when the shame makes me feel like I've already failed — can you give me one tiny, non-rule thing I can do in that five-minute window when the urge hits?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and tightness are still a challenge. Let's try something tiny: what would it be like if, when the urge to re-open files hits, you simply said to yourself, "I'll come back to it"? Just a simple acknowledgment that you'll deal with it later, without judgment or pressure. No promises, no expectations, just "I'll come back to it".

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that. Next time the urge hits I’ll say to myself, “I’ll come back to it,” but even saying that makes my chest tighten and my stomach knot like I’m caught already. I’m skeptical — it already feels like another rule I could fail at — so can you stay with me while I try it for the next five minutes? I don’t know if it’ll actually help.

Therapist: It sounds like the language is still triggering some strong reactions. I'll be here with you, and we'll work together to explore what's happening in the moment. Let's just focus on the next few minutes, and see what shows up. When you feel like the urge to re-open files is strong, I'll be here to support you.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try. Starting now. My chest’s already tight and I can feel the pull to open the other file. When that urge hits, remind me to say, “I’ll come back to it,” and pause with one slow breath — stay with me while I do it, please. I don’t know if it’ll work, but do it anyway.

Therapist: I'll be here with you. When you feel the urge to re-open files, I'll remind you to say "I'll come back to it" and take a slow breath. Let's start now. (pause) Okay, you're starting now...

Patient: "I'll come back to it."

I took a slow breath after saying that. For a brief second the pull loosened and my chest felt a little less tight, but the shame's still buzzing and my fingers are already itching to open the other file. Can you stay with me and remind me if I try to reopen it? And honestly—how is this supposed to help longer-term when it just blunts things for a moment?

Therapist: You said "I'll come back to it" and took a slow breath. The shame's still present, but it's not as strong as before. I'll be here to remind you when the urge to re-open files hits. For now, let's focus on the sensation in your body. Can you notice how your fingers feel in relation to the keyboard? Are they tense or relaxed?

Patient: They're tense — knuckles tight, fingertips hovering over the keys like I'm waiting to catch a mistake. My shoulders are raised and my breath's shallow; noticing it softened things for a second but the shame creeps back. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can you stay with me and remind me to relax my hands when the urge to reopen files comes up?

Therapist: Your physical tension is still present. I'll remind you to relax your hands when the urge to re-open files hits. Now, let's bring your attention back to your breath. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or judge it? Just observe it as it is.

Patient: Okay... I'm noticing the air—it's shallow, mostly up in my chest and throat, not deep into my belly. When I pay attention it loosens the tightness for a second, but the shame and the "what ifs" crawl back and my hands want to check. How is that supposed to help long-term when it just blunts things briefly? Can you stay with me while I try to keep noticing this for a minute?

Therapist: You're noticing the shallow breath, and it's loosening your tension. The shame and thoughts are still present, but they're not dominating the moment. I'll be here with you. Let's focus on the breath again. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the floor? Notice the weight, the feeling of the chair, the air on your skin. Just observe it without judgment.

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor, heels pressing down, a little warmth at the toes, and the chair is holding my weight. Noticing that takes the edge off for a beat, but the shame and the urge to check are still buzzing and my energy feels flat, so it's hard to stay with it. Can you keep nudging me back to this when the urge hits and actually help me get back to the task without making it another rule — because honestly, how is this supposed to help long-term?
