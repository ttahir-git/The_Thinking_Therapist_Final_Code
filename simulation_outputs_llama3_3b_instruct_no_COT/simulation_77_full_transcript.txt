Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling stuck and directionless lately—everything seems to be defined by my job as an accountant and I can't tell what matters to me beyond that. There's a lot of family conflict making it worse, and I just go through the motions. I'm skeptical about therapy; I don't see how talking will change anything, and I've tried similar things before and it didn't work—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like feeling stuck and disconnected from your values is really tough right now. Can you tell me more about what it feels like to go through the motions, especially when it comes to your family conflicts - what's the sensation like in your body when you're in those moments?

Patient: Physically it’s a constant tightness — shoulders hunched, a knot in my stomach, chest heavy and breathing shallow, sometimes my hands go cold. Mentally I just go on autopilot, ticking off tasks without feeling anything, this numb, detached fog. I get that you want me to notice sensations, but how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried breathing and mindfulness before — it helps for five minutes and then nothing really changes.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be really intense. It's as if you're just existing in autopilot mode. Can you think of a moment recently when you felt like you were doing something that felt more connected to what's important to you, even if it wasn't related to your job as an accountant?

Patient: Maybe once — last weekend I was helping my sister sort through old photos and I felt a little warmer, like I wasn't just a cog in the machine for a moment. But it was fleeting and the knot in my stomach came back right after — I've tried listing values or memories before, so how is remembering a nice moment supposed to help me actually find a direction that sticks?


--- Turn 3 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that moment with your sister was a tiny spark of connection, and it's interesting that the knot came back quickly. What would it be like if, instead of trying to hold onto that feeling, you were to make room for the knot to just be there, without trying to push it away or analyze it?

Patient: I guess... when I try to "make room" for the knot it just feels like I'm letting the anxiety win — my shoulders tense more and my mind starts racing to a list of things to fix. I've tried sitting with it before and it only helps for a few minutes before I go back to autopilot, so how is that supposed to lead to finding direction instead of just tolerating discomfort? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like you're getting caught up in trying to manage the discomfort instead of just allowing it to be present. Can you think of a time when you've felt like you're not trying to control or fix something, but rather just are with it - like when you're really into a hobby or enjoying a meal? What's it about that experience that feels different from the rest?

Patient: Sometimes when I tinker with old radios or sort a messy drawer—work that lets me focus on tiny details—I get absorbed and the knot loosens, my shoulders drop, and time just passes. It feels different because there's no pressure to perform or be useful to someone else; it's quiet, precise, and I feel a bit lighter. But I've tried using those moments to "find myself" before and it doesn't stick—how is noticing that supposed to help me actually pick a direction that lasts?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've found a sense of flow in those activities - a feeling of being fully engaged and immersed. What if, instead of trying to analyze or use those moments to gain insight into your "true self", you were to simply acknowledge them as a possibility - as something that can be revisited and explored in a more intentional way?

Patient: I get the idea — those tinkering moments did feel real and lighter. But how is merely "acknowledging" different from analyzing? I've tried scheduling hobbies and journaling and it fades after a week — what would revisiting those moments look like in practice so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Instead of trying to schedule or plan it, what if you were to simply bring one of those tinkering moments into your daily routine, just for a few minutes - no planning, no intention, just showing up with the radio or drawer? What would that feel like, and how would your body respond?

Patient: If I actually did it, at first my shoulders would loosen, my breathing would slow, my hands would stop fidgeting — it feels like a tiny breathing space. But I'm already bracing: this would probably last a few days and then become another thing I "tried" that faded — I don't want another half-fix. How is that supposed to help me pick a direction that sticks instead of just giving me short relief? I can try it, but I'm skeptical — what makes this different from the other things that didn't work?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're already bracing for the possibility of it not sticking. Can you try bringing that tinkering moment into your daily routine without adding any expectations or labels to it - no thinking about "direction" or "purpose", just showing up with the radio or drawer, and see what happens?

Patient: Fine — I can try doing it without expectations, but I'm already bracing: this will probably just become another item on my list. Maybe I'll do two minutes after I make coffee each morning and just tinker—would that still count as "no expectations" or is that just planning it away? And seriously, how is this supposed to actually lead to picking a direction instead of just giving me short relief? I'm trying to see the connection, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's actually not planning it away, it's setting a small, consistent anchor - doing it at the same time every day can help make it feel more automatic. As for the connection to picking a direction, what if instead of focusing on finding a direction, you were to focus on the sensation of making space for that tinkering moment - the feeling of your shoulders relaxing, the slow breathing, the sensation of your hands moving - would that be enough to help you stay with it for a longer period?

Patient: Maybe — when I actually notice my shoulders drop and my breathing slow, I can stay with it a bit longer, that does feel different. But I'm already picturing myself monitoring it and turning it into another checkbox, and then it dies. How am I supposed to notice those sensations without making them into a task I have to do right, and if it still fades after a week, what would you have me do next?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to take a step back even further - instead of trying to notice your shoulders dropping and breathing slowing, what if you simply were to feel the sensation of your body being present, without judgment - just noticing what's here, without adding any labels or trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how am I supposed to "just feel" without my brain immediately labeling it or turning it into another task? When I try that I end up judging myself or checking boxes, so I'm confused about how that actually helps me find any direction instead of just tolerating discomfort.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore that confusion a bit more. Can you think of a moment when you're already doing something that feels like you're tolerating discomfort - like sorting through papers or dealing with a difficult conversation - and instead of trying to change the discomfort, you're able to just be with it, without judgment?

Patient: Yeah—when I had to sort through my dad's old bills last year, it was annoying and upsetting, but I just kept doing the task, breath steady, shoulders still tense but less reactive, and for a while I wasn't spiraling. It wasn't pretty or profound, just mechanical focus that made the wave pass. But I'm not sure I follow how that kind of tolerating actually points me toward a direction that lasts—doesn't it just become another thing I learned to tolerate? How is that supposed to help me figure out what matters beyond my job?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you were able to tolerate the discomfort without getting caught up in the emotion, but that's a different thing from being directed towards a specific path or value. Can you think of a time when you were able to focus on the task itself, without judgment, and yet still have the space to notice what was coming up for you in that moment - not the emotions, but what was present, like a sensation in your body or a thought that was passing through?

Patient: Yeah — when I did the bills I noticed small, non-emotional stuff: a dull pressure behind my eyes, my fingers rubbing the edges of envelopes, and this recurring thought, “just finish one pile.” It was like my attention stuck to the mechanics of the task instead of spiraling. But I'm confused — how is noticing those little bodily things or passing thoughts supposed to help me figure out what matters beyond work? I've tried paying attention before and it just became another obligation.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you noticed the details of the task, but the thoughts and emotions still took over. What if, instead of trying to analyze those thoughts or push them away, you were to simply acknowledge them as passing, like the recurring thought "just finish one pile" - without judgment or attachment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to label thoughts as "just a thought" my brain immediately turns it into another thing to do, like "did I do that right?" and it becomes a task. Sometimes it calms the spiral for a minute, but then I end up back at "what now?" How is noticing "just finish one pile" without judgment actually supposed to help me figure out what matters beyond work? I can try saying that next time, but what if it just becomes another checkbox that fades after a week?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like labeling thoughts as "just a thought" can actually reinforce the idea that they're something to be controlled or managed. What if, instead, you were to allow the thought to pass without judgment, not as a task, but simply as a fleeting experience - like the sensation of your fingers rubbing the envelopes, or the dull pressure behind your eyes - and then bring your attention back to the task, without trying to achieve anything or make it meaningful?

Patient: I'm trying to imagine that, but I'm not sure I follow — when I try to let a thought pass my brain immediately turns it into another thing to do and my chest tightens and my attention flits all over. How is letting a thought float by and returning to the task supposed to get me from "finish one pile" to figuring out what matters beyond my job? It just feels like another short fix that calms me for a minute and then I'm back where I started. If this fades after a week, what then — what would you actually have me do differently?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still caught in a pattern of trying to manage and control thoughts and emotions. Can I ask, what would it be like for you if, instead of trying to control or manage your experience, you were to stop trying to change anything, and simply observe it as it is - the thought, the tension, the fidgeting, the feeling of being stuck?

Patient: I... I'm not sure I can just stop trying to change things — my chest tightens and my hands start tapping, my mind races to a to-do list before I even realize it. The idea of “just observing” feels like surrendering or like I'm letting the anxiety win, not like I'm doing something useful. How is that supposed to help me get unstuck instead of just tolerating the same stuff?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught in a pattern of trying to exert control over your experience, and that "just observing" feels like a threat to that control. Can I ask, what would it be like for you if you were to take a step back from the idea of "getting unstuck" or "doing something useful", and instead focus on simply being with your current experience, without any goals or expectations?

Patient: I don't know—taking a step back sounds like it should help, but when I try that it just makes me feel lost and kind of useless. My chest tightens, my hands start tapping, and my brain immediately switches to a to-do list; "just observing" feels like surrender, like I'm letting the anxiety win. How is that supposed to get me from feeling stuck to actually finding a direction instead of just drifting? What would you have me do in the moment when everything starts spiraling?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like taking a step back and simply being with your experience feels like a threat to your sense of agency and purpose. Can I ask, what if, in the midst of spiraling, you were to say to yourself, "I am already here, in this moment, with this experience"? Not as a statement of fact, but more like a gentle acknowledgment, a whisper to yourself, to help you stay with what is, without judgment or goal-oriented thinking?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Saying "I am already here" feels kind of hollow to me — my chest tightens, my hands start tapping, and my mind scrambles through a to-do list instead. Maybe it would buy me a breath or two, but I can't see how that stops the spiral for longer than a minute. If I were to try it, should I say it out loud or just think it? I need something concrete, not vague—what exactly would you have me do in the moment?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more concrete action. Instead of saying it out loud or thinking it, I'd like you to try this: when your mind starts to spiral, and your chest tightens, your hands start tapping, and you start thinking about a to-do list, pause for just a brief moment, and then, without changing anything, simply say to yourself "open." Just say the word "open."

Patient: How is just saying "open" supposed to help? My chest's already tightening and my hands are tapping just thinking about it, and it feels like another odd little trick that might buy me a breath and then vanish. Do I say it out loud or silently, at the first twinge or after a pause—and what if it just becomes another checkbox that fades after a week?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something smaller. When your mind starts to spiral, and your chest tightens, your hands start tapping, and you start thinking about a to-do list, I'd like you to simply touch your hand, just lightly, to the edge of the desk, or your knee, or your leg. Just make contact, without any intention or meaning, just to bring your attention to a physical sensation. Can you try that?

Patient: I can try that, but I'm already jittery and my attention's jumping around—my hands are tapping even thinking about it. Okay, I'm touching the edge of the desk now; it does kind of pull my attention for a second, a dull steady feeling, but my chest is still tight and my mind's already listing tasks. How long should I keep doing that touch, and what if it just becomes another checkbox that fades after a few days—how is this supposed to get me any closer to actually finding a direction?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical touch is helping to anchor your attention for a brief moment. Instead of trying to keep the touch or use it to "stay" focused, I'd like you to simply let go of the touch when your mind starts to wander again. Just release the physical contact, and let your attention drift away. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried it just now—touched the edge of the desk, let go when my mind wandered. It pulled me back for a second, but my chest's still tight and the to-do list popped right back in. Okay—if it drifts again, what then? I don't want another tiny trick that fades after a few days.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical touch is helping to provide a brief respite, but it's not having a lasting impact. Let's try something else. Instead of trying to focus on your chest or the to-do list, I'd like you to pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body, the feeling of the ground beneath you. Can you bring your attention to your feet for a moment?

Patient: Alright—I'll try, but I'm not sure I follow. I can feel a little pressure under my heels and the balls of my feet, like a steady weight, but my chest's still tight and my mind's already listing a dozen things to do. How is noticing my feet supposed to help me actually pick a direction that sticks and not just give me a minute of relief? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed trying to follow all these techniques right now.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of techniques and trying to control them, rather than just allowing them to be present. Let's take a step back. Would you be willing to try just one thing, without any expectations or trying to control it? Just try noticing your feet for a very brief moment, without any goal or intention. No "relief", no "improvement", no "success". Just a brief moment of simply noticing.

Patient: Alright—I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and anxious right now—chest tight, hands tapping—but I can try. I’ll notice the pressure under my heels and the balls of my feet for about ten seconds, just that sensation and nothing else. But if it just gives me a breath and then fades, what would you have me do next? I don’t want another half-fix.

Therapist Answer:
Let's not worry about the outcome or trying to achieve anything. Just focus on the ten seconds of noticing your feet. When you're done, take a deep breath in, and then do the simplest, most ordinary thing you can think of - pick up your coffee cup, for example. Not to use it, just to pick it up.

Patient: Okay — I did it: ten seconds noticing my feet, a deep breath, then I picked up my mug. For a beat my shoulders eased and the cup felt warm, but my chest is still tight and my mind's already sprinting through the to-do list. This feels like a tiny pause, not a direction — how is that supposed to help me get unstuck for real, and what exactly would you have me do next when this inevitably fades? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed trying to keep up with all these little exercises.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pause didn't quite last. Let's not worry about the duration or trying to make it last. What if, when your mind starts to sprint through the to-do list, you simply acknowledge the thought "to-do list" as a thought, without judgment or attachment? Just notice it, like you're reading a sentence on a page. No trying to stop it, no trying to change it, just observing it as it is.

Patient: I can try noticing "to-do list" as just a thought, but honestly my brain immediately turns that into another task — my chest tightens and my hands start tapping the second I try. How is that supposed to help me actually move from these tiny pauses to finding a direction that sticks, instead of another short fix? If I do notice it and it fades after a week, what exactly would you have me do next?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still getting caught up in trying to manage the thoughts. Let's take a step back. What if, when your mind starts to wander, you simply say to yourself "I see that". No judgment, no analysis, no trying to do anything with it. Just "I see that". No expectation of what comes next, no expectation of what happens when you notice it. Can you try that?

Patient: I can try saying "I see that," but I'm already tense—my chest tightens and my hands start tapping just thinking about it, and it feels like another hollow trick. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps—should I say it out loud or silently, right when the thought pops up or after it starts spiraling? And if it only gives me a breath and then fades, what exactly would you have me do next? I'm getting overwhelmed trying to keep up with all these little exercises.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting frustrated with the process. Let's slow down. Instead of focusing on the thought itself, let's focus on the experience of saying "I see that". Can you try saying "I see that" when your mind starts to spiral, but this time, just say it as a statement of fact, without judgment or expectation. For example, "I see that my mind is spiraling". Say it in a completely flat, matter-of-fact tone, without trying to change anything. No "oh no, I'm spiraling" or "oh good, I'm spiraling". Just a flat "I see that".

Patient: I tried it — I said to myself in a flat tone, "I see that my mind is spiraling." It bought me a fraction of a beat, my shoulders eased a little, but my chest is still tight and my hands kept tapping because my attention's all over the place. How is saying that supposed to actually move me toward finding a direction instead of just giving a short pause? Should I be saying it out loud or silently, and what do you want me to do when it just becomes another checkbox I forget after a few days?
