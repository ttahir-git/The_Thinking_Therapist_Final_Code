Patient: I've been feeling a lot of anger and frustration lately, mostly tied to job instability and the fear of losing work. I'm an accountant and it's embarrassing to admit I don't handle it well anymore. I don't know... I guess I tend to shut down or try not to talk about it because it feels overwhelming.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share about the emotions you're struggling with. It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from your feelings of anger and frustration, like they're hiding beneath the surface. Can you tell me more about what's meant by "shut down" - is that when you physically feel frozen or emotionally numb, or more like you just avoid thinking about it or talking about it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's more like avoidance—I go quiet, dodge calls or conversations, or try to busy myself so I don't have to think about it. Sometimes there's a physical thing too, like my chest gets tight and I can't think straight, but mostly I just try not to bring it up. I don't really like talking about this.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using your body and behavior to help you cope with these feelings, especially the avoidance and busyness. That can be a helpful way to temporarily escape from the discomfort, but it might not be addressing the underlying emotions. Can you think of a time when you were able to acknowledge and feel your anger or frustration without immediately shutting down? What happened in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess there was this one time a few months ago when my manager hinted at cutting hours and I actually told him I was frustrated instead of staying quiet. My chest got tight and my voice shook, but I said it and felt that anger for a bit before I immediately tried to busy myself to forget it. I don't really like talking about it.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to speak up, even if it's just for a moment. It sounds like the immediate aftermath of expressing your frustration was intense, and you immediately tried to diffuse it by distracting yourself. Can you tell me more about what's hard for you about going back to that place of feeling angry and frustrated? What would it mean for you to explore or experience that feeling more fully, without trying to shut it down?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm scared it'll make me look unprofessional or even cost me more work if I let it show. When I let myself feel it I worry I won't be able to control it, like I'll say something I'll regret or it will just spiral and I won't find my way back. Part of me thinks if I could face it without shutting down I might feel less tense, but I don't really know how to do that.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The fear of being perceived as unprofessional or losing control is a powerful one. It sounds like you're worried about being judged or losing your "image" of being an accountant. What would happen in this moment, if you weren't worried about what others think - would you feel more at ease with your emotions, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know... I guess maybe I'd feel a bit lighter, like I could breathe instead of holding everything in. But I also feel exposed—worried I'd say the wrong thing or clients would think less of me. I don't really like talking about this.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like there's a sense of vulnerability that's associated with feeling and expressing your emotions. Can you explore this feeling of being "exposed" further - what does it mean for you to be vulnerable in this way? What would it be like to have a sense of safety, or security, in being able to feel and express your emotions, even if it means being a bit vulnerable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess being exposed means people seeing me as weak or not up to the job, like my whole image of being reliable would be taken away. Feeling safe would be having someone I trust who won't judge me, or knowing my job's secure so I can admit I'm upset without it costing me. I don't really like getting into this—it's uncomfortable—could we talk about small ways I could handle it in the moment so I don't explode?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having a sense of safety and security around expressing emotions is really important. It sounds like you're looking for a sense of protection from being judged or losing your reputation. Before we explore ways to handle it in the moment, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel uncomfortable with this - it's a normal part of growth and change. Let's take a small step back - are you willing to try experimenting with labeling your physical sensations when you feel the urge to shut down, without judgment - just noticing what's happening in your body, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but it makes me uneasy. When it happens my chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my jaw clenches and my mind goes fuzzy — I worry that paying attention will make it worse. How would I do that without spiraling?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is already on high alert when you feel the urge to shut down. Before we try labeling your physical sensations, let's take a moment to acknowledge what happens when you're able to observe them without judgment. What happens to your body and your experience when you allow yourself to simply notice the sensations, without trying to change them or escape from them?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I actually notice the sensations they ease a bit — my breath slows, the chest tightness loosens and my thinking clears some. But it still feels risky, like if I pay attention too long I'll spiral, so I usually stop and busy myself. Can we stick to something small I can do right then to ease the tightness?

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the sensations can be a subtle but powerful way to create space. Since you're looking for something small and immediate, I'd like to suggest taking a deep breath into your diaphragm, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it. Would you be willing to try that with me, right now, and see if that helps ease the tightness in your chest?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. Okay—breathing in slowly, filling my belly, and out. It does ease the tightness a bit, but it also drags up this shame and frustration—like I'm back to a time I failed—and I get angry at myself for needing this. Can we do one more like that but keep it short? I don't want to spiral.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and frustration can be a powerful trigger. Let's take another small step. Before we try another breathing exercise, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel those emotions, and that you're not alone in having difficult emotions. Can I offer you a simple phrase to use when you feel that sense of self-criticism, like "This feeling is present, but it doesn't define me"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess you can try that. Saying something like that feels strange and it drags up shame and I get mad at myself for even needing it. Can we just do it once, short, and then talk about one quick tactic I can use at work when I feel this coming on?


--- Turn 10 ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that the phrase doesn't feel like your own. Let's try it just once, without judgment, and see what happens. "This feeling is present, but it doesn't define me" - just say it out loud with me.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. "This feeling is present, but it doesn't define me." 

That felt weird — shame bubbled up and I got mad at myself for even needing it. My chest tightened and my mind's a bit all over the place, sorry. Can we just go over that one quick tactic I can use at work right when I feel this coming on?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's normal for shame and self-criticism to surface. Let's move on to the quick tactic. When you feel the physical sensations of tension coming on at work, what's one small thing you could do to take care of yourself, before things escalate?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one small thing would be to excuse myself for a minute—step into the hallway or the restroom, take three slow belly breaths (count to four in, four out) and sip some water. It feels a bit stupid and it makes me mad at myself for needing it, but it usually loosens my chest enough so I don't snap. Can we try practicing that once now?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Taking a moment to step away and breathe can be a helpful pause. Let's try it now, right here. I'll start counting with you - one... two... three... (pause for three slow belly breaths, then) four... (pause again) five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Take a sip of... (wait) water. How did that feel for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it helped a little — my chest loosened and my breathing calmed, but shame came up and my mind kept racing so I wasn't fully present. Can we do that one more short time, and then please give me a very simple phrase I can use at work when I need to step away?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's okay that the shame and racing thoughts came back. Let's try it again, and I'll offer a simple phrase to help you stay present. One... two... three... (pause for three slow belly breaths, then) four... (pause again) five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Take a sip of... (wait) water. When you feel the need to step away, you can say to yourself: "I need a pause."

Patient: I don't know... I guess "I need a pause" sounds okay, but I'm not sure I follow how saying it to myself helps when I'm standing in front of someone and my chest's already tight. I'm feeling kind of scattered and ashamed about needing this, and it's making me frustrated with myself. Can we just practice a really short out-loud line I could use with a manager—like "I need a moment"—and roleplay that once?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the phrase and how you might use it in a specific situation. When you say "I need a moment" to a manager, what would you like to happen next? For example, what would you like to do or what would you like to communicate when you've had that pause?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd want them to just accept it without making a fuss — a quiet "okay" so I can slip out. Then I'd step into the hallway or restroom, do a few belly breaths, sip water, and come back saying something brief like "I'm ready to continue" or "Can we pick this up in five minutes" so I don't have to explain. I don't really like getting into this — it feels awkward and I get ashamed even saying it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you'd like to have a clear and brief way to communicate your need for a pause, without drawing attention to it. Let's practice the roleplay, and I'll respond as a manager. You can say "I need a moment" and we can go from there. Go ahead and say it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. "I need a moment." 

My voice is a bit shaky and my chest tightened saying that — I already feel ashamed like I'm bothering someone, but I said it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to say those words. The manager responds, "Okay, take your time, I've got this." They nod and turn their attention to the task at hand. You step into the hallway, take a few deep breaths, sip some water, and return feeling slightly calmer. What would you like to say to yourself right now, after you've had that brief pause?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd tell myself "it's okay, breathe," but even that brings up shame and I get mad at myself for needing it. My mind's jumpy and my chest's tightening again — I'm not sure I follow how saying something to myself actually helps in the moment. Can you... walk me through saying it, like step by step? I'm feeling kind of scattered.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is racing and shame is coming up. Let's break it down step by step. As you're leaving the room, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "it's okay" to yourself, without judgment. Then, pause for a brief moment, feeling the words, and then say "breathe" to yourself, also without judgment. Let's try it together. Inhale... "it's okay" ... exhale... "breathe".

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. Inhale — "it's okay" — exhale — "breathe." It eased the tightness a bit, but shame spiked and now I feel more anxious and kind of confused, like I'm not sure I follow how this actually helps. Can we do one more very short round and then you walk me through what to say to myself afterward?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is spinning and shame is still present. Let's try another small step. As you're taking the deep breath in, say "it's okay" to yourself, and then, without adding anything else, just pause for a brief moment, feeling the words. Then, exhale and say "breathe". Inhale... "it's okay"... (pause)... exhale... "breathe". 

Now, as you're stepping back into the room, you take a deep breath in, and then you say "it's okay" and "breathe" to yourself, without judgment. As you're saying these words, notice what happens in your body. What sensations arise, what thoughts come up?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I say "it's okay" and "breathe" my chest loosens a bit and my breath steadies, but then a flush of shame comes up and my mind starts racing—what if someone heard, what if I'm weak—and I get mad at myself. My jaw tightens, my hands feel a bit shaky, and I feel confused, like I can't follow what's supposed to happen next. Can you just give me one very short line to say to myself after the breath, and walk me through it step by step? I don't really like getting into this, but I want something simple I can actually use.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling a bit stuck. Let's try something very simple. As you're saying "it's okay" and "breathe", pause for a brief moment, and then just say "let go". Let's break it down step by step: take a deep breath in, inhale... "it's okay"... exhale... "breathe"... pause... and then, say "let go".

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. Inhale—"it's okay"—exhale—"breathe"—let go. 

It did ease the tightness a bit, but now I'm all muddled and ashamed—my face heats up and my hands shake, and I can't tell if "let go" means forget about the problem or just calm down. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps when someone keeps pressing me at work; can you walk me through, step by step, what to do if my manager keeps questioning me right after I come back?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is still racing and shame is present. Let's try to break it down further. As you're saying "it's okay", "breathe", and "let go", notice that your body is starting to relax a bit. When your manager starts questioning you, you take a deep breath in, inhale... "it's okay"... exhale... "breathe". As you're saying these words to yourself, you're not trying to change the conversation or answer their questions right away. You're just focusing on your own breath and body. You're creating space, just for a moment. What happens next, is up to you. You can respond to their question, or take a moment to collect your thoughts before responding.

Patient: I don't know... I guess if he keeps pressing I just freeze or get snappy — I'm scared I'll say something I'll regret. It brings up that old failure feeling and I get mad at myself. Can you give me a very short script for when a manager pushes back with "No, what is it?" and can we roleplay that once?

It sounds like you're feeling stuck and worried about losing control. Let's try a simple response. If your manager asks "No, what is it?", you can say "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts" and then pause. Let's roleplay a scenario. I'll play the manager, and you can respond. Go ahead and say "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts".

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts." My voice is shaky and my chest is tight — shame's flaring and my mind's racing, and I keep getting mad at myself. Can we do the pushback now, like him saying "No, what is it?" so I can try the follow-up? I'm feeling kind of anxious and scattered.
