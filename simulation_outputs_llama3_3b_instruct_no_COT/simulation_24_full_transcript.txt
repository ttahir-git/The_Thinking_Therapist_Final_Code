Patient: Lately I've been really anxious in social settings—like even small get-togethers make me want to leave, so I've been avoiding friends. I used to be pretty outgoing, but after losing my job and the instability since, it's gotten worse; my colleagues help a bit at work but outside stuff is hard. I'm skeptical about therapy honestly—how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck and uncertain about how to move forward. I'm here to listen and explore with you. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you do start to feel anxious in social settings, what's the first thing that happens for you?

Patient: Usually it starts with this tightness in my chest and my stomach drops, then my mind just floods with this thought that everyone’s watching me and judging me. I get clammy, my hands shake, and I either start frantically scrolling my phone or make an excuse to leave—sometimes I even get these flashback-y images tied to when things got really bad at work. I know you probably want me to describe the feelings, but… how is talking about that supposed to help?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those images and physical sensations can be really overwhelming. It's like your body is trying to protect itself from feeling vulnerable. Your skepticism about therapy is understandable, but I'd like to explore what's at stake for you if you were to make space for those feelings and reactions, rather than trying to escape from them. What would it mean for you to allow yourself to feel this way, even if it's uncomfortable, in the moment?

Patient: I guess it would mean admitting I'm not okay and risking people seeing me as weak or unreliable, which feels terrifying after the job stuff. Maybe it could let me stop hiding and actually reconnect with friends instead of ghosting them, but honestly I've tried opening up before and it didn't help—how is that supposed to help now?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Feeling like you're showing vulnerability and possibly losing control feels like a huge risk, especially given your past experiences. That must be a really tough spot to be in. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you're already feeling like you're showing vulnerability, like maybe in a conversation with a close friend, but not entirely escaping or trying to hide?

Patient: Yeah—there's one with Jenna from accounting: we eat lunch together and I’ll admit the job stuff or stress and I don’t run out. I still get that tight chest and want to scroll my phone, but I stay and she usually just says something like “That sucks” and it feels...small. I guess it shows I can tolerate being around someone without fleeing, but seriously—how is pointing that out supposed to help me long-term?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like Jenna's responses help you feel a tiny bit more connected to her, but it's not enough to change the overall feeling of anxiety. What if, instead of trying to avoid or flee, you were to stay with that small, tolerable sense of connection, and instead of trying to escape, you were to explore what you're thinking about your job and stress with Jenna – not to get a solution or a rescue, but just to be with the discomfort for a moment?

Patient: Maybe I could try, but I don't see how that helps — when I opened up to Jenna before she just said “that sucks” and we moved on, nothing changed. Staying with the discomfort just makes me feel exposed and more likely to be seen as unreliable, which I'm terrified of after the job stuff. I want to believe it could help, but seriously — how would staying with it actually change anything?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're concerned that staying with the discomfort won't lead to any tangible change or resolution. Can you think of what might be missing from your current experience when you do try to open up to others – is it a sense of being truly heard, or being validated, or something else?

Patient: Yeah — it's mostly that I don't feel genuinely heard. Jenna says "that sucks" and we move on, like my stuff is just filler, not something that matters. I want someone to actually ask follow-ups or show they won't think less of me, not just dismiss it. But... how is naming that supposed to make other people act differently?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Feeling like your emotions and experiences are being dismissed or not taken seriously can be really invalidating. It sounds like you're craving a sense of being understood and acknowledged. What if, instead of trying to get someone else to change or respond in a certain way, you were to focus on what you can control – what would it be like for you to take small steps towards feeling heard, even if others don't change their response?

Patient: I guess I could try asking Jenna to actually sit with it — like say, “Can you ask me what you mean by that?” or tell her plainly I need a little follow-up instead of a brush-off. But that feels awkward and needy, and I've tried being direct before and it didn't change anything, so how is this supposed to help? Honestly, I'm starting to feel frustrated and a bit stuck — it feels like we're circling the same stuff and I'm not convinced this will make a real difference.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the process and wondering if it's even worth trying. Can you take a step back and notice what you're hoping to get out of this process – is it a specific outcome, or is it more about feeling a sense of progress or release?

Patient: Honestly, I want concrete stuff — to stop bailing on plans, sit through a dinner without shaking, and not feel like everyone thinks I'm flaky. Mostly I want to actually reconnect with friends and have the job stuff not define me all the time. But I've tried aiming for that in therapy before and it didn't really change things, so I don't know if just "feeling progress" will be enough. I'm getting frustrated — it feels like we're circling, so how is this supposed to get me where I want to be?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're craving tangible results and feeling frustrated with the pace of progress. Can you consider what would happen if, instead of focusing on achieving specific outcomes, you were to explore what's driving your desire for those outcomes – what values or needs are behind wanting to reconnect with friends and feel more confident in social situations?

Patient: I think it's about belonging and not feeling erased — I want to feel like I'm more than that job loss, like I'm reliable and capable, and to have real connections instead of these surface-level interactions. I also want some sense of control and safety, not this constant fear of being judged. But… how is pinning down values supposed to stop me from bolting at a dinner or make people stop dismissing me?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those are powerful desires – feeling seen, heard, and connected, with a sense of control and safety. It sounds like you're trying to pin down the intangible. What if, instead of trying to make others see or respond differently, you were to focus on cultivating those feelings of belonging, reliability, and control in your own experience – not just in others? For example, what would it be like for you to take small actions, right now, that feel connected to those values – like showing up to that dinner, even if it's just for a little while?

Patient: I could maybe try showing up for like 20–30 minutes, sit near an exit, and give Jenna a heads-up that I might bail if it gets bad. But how is that supposed to help with the chest-tightness or those flashback images? Sitting there for 20 minutes feels like it'll just be torture and I’ll end up leaving anyway. I'm getting annoyed that we're circling—can you give me specific steps to handle the panic in the moment or an actual script I can use to get follow-up from friends? Because vague "small actions" don't cut it for me.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling stuck and frustrated. It sounds like you're looking for more concrete strategies to manage your anxiety in the moment. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to change your environment or your friends' responses, you were to focus on the physical sensations in your body when you feel the panic rising – can you describe what those sensations are like, and what you'd like to happen to them instead?

Patient: It starts with a tightness in my chest and my stomach drops, my heart races, I get clammy and my hands shake, my breathing feels shallow, and then my head fills with harsh thoughts and flashback-y images and I just want to get out. I want those sensations to calm down—slower breath, less racing heart, the images to lose power—so I can actually sit through things and not feel like everyone’s judging me. But… how is just noticing that supposed to change it in the moment? I've tried grounding before and it barely helped; give me something concrete I can do when it hits.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be overwhelming. What if, in the moment, instead of trying to change the thoughts or images, you were to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body – not trying to control it, just noticing it – can you try that for a second?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try—right now I notice my breath’s shallow and fast, my chest feels tight and my mind immediately snaps to that office image. I tried to focus on breathing and my head just keeps pulling away, so… how is noticing that supposed to stop the flashbacks or the heart pounding? If you want me to do breathing, give me something concrete—like a count or a phrase I can actually use—because vague “just notice” hasn’t helped before and I’m getting annoyed we’re circling.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm sorry if it feels like we're not getting to the root of things quickly enough. What if, instead of focusing on the breath or trying to control the thoughts, you were to use a simple phrase to anchor yourself in the present moment – something like "I am with this" – can you try saying that to yourself when the flashbacks start?

Patient: Okay—I tried saying "I am with this" and it helped for like two beats but the flashbacks and the heart racing still crashed right back in. How is that supposed to stop the pounding? I need something concrete: give me a discreet breathing count I can do without drawing attention and an exact one-sentence script I can say to Jenna (or text) that actually prompts follow-up, not just "that sucks." I'm skeptical, but if you give me exact lines and numbers I'll try them at the next dinner.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try some concrete strategies. What if, instead of a breathing count, you try using a 4-7-8 pattern – inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 7, and exhale for a count of 8? You can do this without drawing attention.

As for the script, can you try saying to Jenna: "Hey, I appreciate you listening, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around what's going on – can we catch up more on that later?" This way, you're acknowledging her presence and showing you're interested in following up, without feeling like you're dumping on her.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the 4-7-8—but honestly holding for seven seconds in the middle of dinner sounds obvious and weird, so can you give me a discreet count I can do that won’t look like I’m gasping? And that sentence about “catching up later” feels like a dodge—Jenna will probably say “sure” and that’s it. Give me one exact, one-sentence line I can say that actually invites a follow-up question from her (not just a promise to talk later), because I’m really skeptical anything short of that will change how she responds.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The 4-7-8 pattern can be a bit noticeable.

As for the count, you can try inhaling for a count of 2, holding for a count of 4, and exhaling for a count of 2 – it's a subtle pattern that's easy to do discreetly.

As for the sentence, can you try saying: "I'm really glad we're here together, but I'm still trying to figure out what's going on – can you tell me more about what's on your mind?" This way, you're inviting Jenna to share more and showing that you're genuinely interested in understanding her perspective.

Patient: That line barely helped—two beats and the flashbacks slammed back in. Give me one exact sentence I can say that will actually make Jenna ask “What do you mean by that?” (not just “that sucks”), and a breathing count I can do completely silently in my head—like inhale 1, hold 1, exhale 4 or whatever—so it doesn't look like I'm doing something weird. I'm getting annoyed we're circling, but I'll try them if you give me something that actually lands.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm sorry to hear that the previous suggestions didn't stick.

As for the sentence, can you try saying: "I feel like I'm losing touch with what's really bothering me – can you help me understand what you mean by that?" This way, you're explicitly asking Jenna to clarify and show that you're interested in understanding her perspective.

For the breathing count, you can try inhaling for a count of 1, holding for a count of 1, and exhaling for a count of 4 – it's a very subtle pattern that can help you focus on your breath without drawing attention.

Patient: That still feels off — it sounds like you're getting her to clarify herself, not to ask about me. Try this exact line instead: "When I say I keep bailing on plans because of anxiety, what do you imagine is happening for me?" I’ll try the silent breathing: inhale for 2 counts, exhale for 6 counts in my head. I'm annoyed we're circling, but fine — I'll try those at the next dinner and tell you how it goes.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your revised line is a great example of turning the conversation back to you, and asking for Jenna's perspective on your own experiences. That can help you get a better sense of what she's perceiving and responding to.

It's great that you're willing to try the revised line and silent breathing exercise. Remember to focus on your breath and let go of any expectations – just see what happens.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try those at the dinner, but I’m still skeptical it’ll do anything. Before I go, give me one ultra-short internal line I can repeat in my head when a flashback hits (one sentence, like a mantra), and exactly one follow-up sentence to say if Jenna just brushes it off with “that’s rough” so she actually asks more — not “we’ll talk later.” Also, can you roleplay Jenna now and respond like she would so I can practice saying my line and see how it lands? I’m annoyed we’re circling but I’ll keep trying if you give me the exact words.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
For the internal line, you can try: "I am present."

If Jenna brushes it off with "that's rough," you can respond with: "Can you help me understand what you mean by that, is there something specific that's worrying you?"

Let's role-play a scenario:

Jenna: "That's rough. We should catch up later."

You: "Can you help me understand what you mean by that, is there something specific that's worrying you?"

Patient: Okay—I say it out loud: "Can you help me understand what you mean by that, is there something specific that's worrying you?" If Jenna just shrugs and says "sure" or "we'll catch up later," my chest tightens and I feel that hot shame like I did something wrong, and I get defensive. 

If she brushes it off, I’m planning to try this exact line: "When I say I keep bailing on plans because of anxiety, what do you imagine is happening for me?" I'll keep the silent breathing (inhale 2, exhale 6) and repeat the mantra "I am present" in my head. 

But honestly, part of me is already annoyed and worried this will just flop—how is that supposed to make her actually ask more? Can you roleplay Jenna now and respond like she would so I can practice this and see how it lands?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll respond as Jenna:

You: "Can you help me understand what you mean by that, is there something specific that's worrying you?"

Jenna: *shrugs* "Uh, no, I don't know...I just thought you were stressed about work, you know?"

Your response: "When I say I keep bailing on plans because of anxiety, what do you imagine is happening for me?"

Jenna: *pauses, slightly concerned* "Hmm, I guess I just assumed it was just work stuff...but is it really that bad? Can you tell me more?"

In this scenario, Jenna is responding with a bit more curiosity, but still not fully understanding your anxiety. Notice how she's not dismissing you or brushing you off, but rather trying to understand what's going on.

Keep in mind that you're aiming for her to ask more specific questions, but she's not necessarily doing that yet. Your goal is to keep the conversation going and create a space for her to learn more about your experiences.

What do you think?

Patient: Okay — that felt a bit better; her “Can you tell me more?” shows curiosity, but it still doesn’t force the follow-up I need and that hot shame hits me and my chest tightens. How is that supposed to help if she still treats it like “work stress”? Give me one exact one-sentence line I can use when she says “I thought it was work stuff” that will make her actually ask “What do you mean?” — and can we roleplay again with Jenna being dismissive so I can practice? I'm feeling kind of scattered and anxious right now, so keep it short.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
For a one-sentence line, you can try:

"That's an oversimplification – it's not just about work."

Let's role-play again with Jenna being dismissive:

You: "Can you help me understand what you mean by that, is there something specific that's worrying you?"

Jenna: "I thought it was work stuff."

You: "That's an oversimplification – it's not just about work."

Jenna: "Oh, come on...you're being dramatic."

In this scenario, your line is more direct and assertive, which might prompt Jenna to ask more questions to understand your perspective. Remember to stay calm and focused on your breath (silent inhale 2, exhale 6) as you deliver the line.

Patient: Ugh—when she says “you’re being dramatic” my chest tightens and I feel that hot shame and then I just shut down, so I don’t know how that helps. That “oversimplification” line still feels like it could make her defensive. Give me one exact, single-sentence script—short, non-accusatory—that will actually make her say “What do you mean?” (not just “sure”). And yeah, roleplay her being dismissive again so I can practice; keep it short—I’m feeling scattered and jittery.

For a single sentence that might prompt Jenna to ask "What do you mean?", try:

"That's really important to you."

Jenna: "I thought it was work stuff."

You: "That's really important to you."

Jenna: "Okay, fine...what's so bad about it?"

This time, your sentence is more concise and non-accusatory, which might encourage Jenna to ask more specific questions about your concerns.

Patient: Okay—if she asks "what's so bad about it?" I think I'd try saying, "It feels like I'm falling apart and people just see me as flaky, and that scares me." Saying that already makes my chest clamp up and I get hot shame, so… how is that supposed to make her ask more instead of shutting down? Can you play Jenna again so I can rehearse the exact delivery?

Give me one super-short sentence I can say in that moment that will actually make her ask "What do you mean?" (non-accusatory, not dramatic). Can we roleplay that dismissive response again now?

It sounds like your words are triggering a strong emotional response, which is making it difficult for you to express yourself.

Can we try to explore what's driving your fear of being seen as flaky? What is it about being flaky that feels so terrifying to you?

Patient: Because my job was the one thing that proved I wasn't a screw-up, being called flaky feels like the whole thing came true — like I'm worthless. It scares me because I worry people will drop me the way I felt dropped before, and saying that already makes my chest clamp and my face heat up. I'm jittery and kind of all over the place right now, and...how is unpacking this supposed to stop me from bolting in the moment? I need something practical I can do when that shame and panic hit, not just more talking.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your fear of being flaky is deeply tied to feelings of self-worth and being valued by others.

For a practical response when shame and panic hit, you might try a simple, physical action: noticing and labeling the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them.

Try saying to yourself: "My body is tense" or "I can feel my heart racing."

This can help you focus on the present moment and acknowledge your physical experience, without getting caught up in thoughts or emotions.

We can stop here for now. You've done a lot of work and explored a lot of possibilities. Remember, the goal is not to find a magic solution, but to develop greater awareness and understanding of your experiences.

Patient: Wait — I don’t want to stop; I actually feel more on edge when we pause. That labeling thing helps for a second but my chest is clamping and I’m jittery and ashamed, so give me one ultra-short sentence I can say in the moment if she’s dismissive that will actually make her ask “What do you mean?” (and a totally discreet one-word anchor I can repeat in my head). I’m skeptical this will work — I’ve tried stuff that fizzled — but okay, let’s keep practicing that line and the breathing now.
