--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a 55-year-old high school teacher, and ever since my youngest left for college I get so angry at small things I swear it's ruining my relationships. My mind keeps predicting the worst — they won't come back, my friends will drift away, I'll lose my purpose at work and end up alone and useless — and that certainty makes me lash out. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't seem to stop the stories once they start.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those stories can be quite vivid and overwhelming, can't they? It sounds like they're not just about the potential outcomes, but also about your sense of identity and security. Can you tell me more about what happens for you when one of those worst-case scenarios starts playing out in your mind?

Patient: It usually hits like a movie in fast-forward: I picture them never coming back, friends drifting off, my classes collapsing into meaningless routines, and I just know it's going to happen — like it's settled fact. My chest tightens, my jaw clenches, I start rehearsing the cutting thing I'll say, and then I snap or slam a door because I can't stand the pressure. When someone suggests maybe it's not inevitable, I just can't buy it — the story feels real and that certainty is what makes me explode.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is creating a movie script, and you're right there in the director's chair, reliving the worst-case scenario over and over. That must be incredibly uncomfortable. Can you notice what happens for you when you try to pause the movie or step outside of that script for a moment?

Patient: When I try to pause it feels like the movie speeds up — my chest pounds and I get this urgent need to do something to stop the future I’m seeing, like if I don’t act it’ll definitely happen. I start rehearsing the cutting thing to say or imagining slamming a door to wake everyone up, and then I usually just snap because the certainty feels louder than anything else. If someone suggests a different ending, I just think they’re not seeing the obvious — it’s like they’re pretending the script isn’t already written.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a strong urge to try to change the course of the movie, but that certainty about the worst-case scenario feels overwhelming and feels like it's getting in the way. Can you explore what might happen if you were to pause the movie and instead of trying to change the script, you simply allowed yourself to feel the physical sensations in your body, like the pounding chest and the urge to act?

Patient: If I try to just feel it, it always blows up into a full-on panic — my chest tightens, I start crying or yelling, and everyone for sure sees me as unstable and starts avoiding me. That leads to people drifting away, my job getting questioned, and me being pushed out, so letting it in feels like handing them the proof they need. I know you're suggesting it might help, but I can't trust that; the movie never stops at "maybe" for me.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the attempt to pause the movie and simply feel the physical sensations has been met with a strong reaction, which has led to more of the very outcomes you're trying to avoid. That can be a really tough place to be. Would it be possible for you to take a tiny step back from the full-blown panic and just look at your reaction to feeling the physical sensations, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: I try to take that tiny step back, but the second I notice my chest I get certain everyone's already seen me as a mess and is quietly judging me, so I start rehearsing the cruel line or picturing myself storming out — and then the whole movie switches to how they'll leave and never come back. Even imagining just watching my reaction feels like turning the volume up on the disaster, like doing nothing will somehow make it happen faster. I want to try what you said, but it feels naive — the script feels written and I can't make myself believe otherwise.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind has already started to script the reaction, and it's hard to disentangle the physical sensations from the storyline. Would you be willing to try something a little more subtle, like simply noticing the sensation of the words "they're judging me" without judgment, without immediately picking up the script or rehearsing a response?

Patient: I can try, but the moment I notice those words in my head it turns into a loud alarm — my jaw clenches and I can feel my face getting hot. If I just "notice" it, the movie switches to them whispering, then telling others, then my boss calling me in, then being judged and pushed out, so letting it sit feels like signing my own eviction notice. I get why you're asking me to do it, but I honestly can't help thinking that's naïve — the story just keeps getting louder if I don't act.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you try to notice the thought, it gets escalated into a whole new level of drama. That can be really overwhelming. Would you be willing to try something even smaller, like simply observing the sensation of the words in your head, without labeling them as "judging" or "naive", just as they come up?

Patient: I'll try, but the moment I notice those words they blow up into a megaphone — people whisper, then gossip, then the principal calls me in and my job's on the line, so "just noticing" feels like signing my own dismissal. My chest's already tight thinking about it, so I can try to watch the words as words, but I can't promise I won't start rehearsing something sharp or storming out. Tell me how long you want me to hold it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a strong urge to react, even before you've started. I'm not asking you to hold it for a long time, just for a very brief moment, a breath or two, before you start to respond. Would you be willing to try holding the observation of the words just until your next breath, without trying to do anything with them?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it for one breath, but I’m already bracing because I can see the whole chain: whispering, gossip, the principal calling me in and firing me. Right now I’m noticing the words “they’re judging me” as just words… my chest’s tight, my jaw’s clenched, and I feel like I’m about to snap or say something ugly. I don’t know if I can hold it, but I’m trying now.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the tension in your body is still present, even as you're trying to observe the words as just words. That's okay. Can you stay with that sensation of tightness in your chest, and notice if there's any small part of you that's still leaning towards reacting, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: Yeah — there's a tiny sliver of me, maybe like 10%, itching to snap or slam a door. The second I feel that sliver it blows up into the whole disaster movie — whispering, gossip, the principal calling me in, losing my job, ending up alone — so even that small urge feels like the first step toward everything falling apart.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that small sliver of reaction is a pretty powerful trigger. Can you explore what happens for you when you think about that tiny 10% of you wanting to snap or slam a door? What's the sensation like, and what's the tone of your inner voice when it says "you're going to react"?

Patient: It’s like pressure in my chest that spikes into a hot rush behind my eyes — my hands clench, my jaw tightens, and everything narrows. The inner voice is flat and absolute, not like a question but a decree: “You’ll snap, they’ll gossip, the principal will call, you’ll be out,” said like it’s already happened. That certainty makes the urge feel inevitable, like if I don’t do something sharp right now the whole chain will start for sure.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that inner voice is a very powerful and unyielding one. Can you explore what happens when you try to speak to that inner voice, in a gentle, kind tone, simply saying "okay, you're feeling that urge, and that's okay"?

Patient: I'll try, but it already feels like a trap — like admitting it will let the movie start. "Okay, you're feeling that urge, and that's okay" — I can say it, but the inner voice immediately snaps back that saying that is just permission to lose everything: whispering, gossip, the principal calling, me getting pushed out. My chest tightens and I can feel my hands wanting to do something sharp the second that thought shows up.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the inner voice is very quick to counter your attempt to speak to it in a gentle tone. That can be really challenging. Can you try something even smaller, like simply acknowledging the inner voice, without trying to respond or react to it, just as it shows up: "that's what you're saying"?

Patient: I tried saying "that's what you're saying" out loud, but the instant I do the movie flips — whispering, gossip, the principal calling me in, my job gone, them never coming back, me alone. My chest clenches and my hands feel like they're about to do something sharp, like I'm already in mid-snap. I want to be able to do this without it blowing up, but admitting it feels like handing the script the match.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying "that's what you're saying" actually amplified the inner voice and the movie. Would you be willing to try a tiny experiment: not saying anything at all, not even acknowledging the inner voice, but simply noticing it as it shows up, without trying to respond or react?

Patient: I'll try, but silence already feels dangerous — like if I don't speak they'll take it as proof and the movie starts: whispering, gossip, the principal calling, me being pushed out, ending up alone. Just the thought makes my chest knot and my hands want to do something sharp. I can try to notice it without reacting for one breath, but I'm bracing because I don't trust that it won't blow up.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like silence is still a bit of a threat, and you're bracing for the worst. Can you try taking one more tiny step back: not just noticing the inner voice, but not even noticing your physical reactions to it, just observing them as they happen, without trying to change or respond?

Patient: I'll try, but I'm already all over the place — my attention keeps darting and I feel buzzy, like there's no room to just watch anything. When I try to observe without reacting my chest tightens and the thought machine immediately shouts: whispering, the principal calling, me being pushed out — it's so loud I can't stay still. I'm overwhelmed and distracted and I don't know how to hold it without exploding; can you walk me through a step I can actually do right now while I try to keep watching it?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling completely overwhelmed. Let's take a step that doesn't require you to try to control anything, just to anchor yourself in the present moment. I want you to focus on your breath, just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or react to anything else, just notice the sensation of the breath as it is, right now?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to focus on the breath but it's hard—my breaths are shallow and the second I tune in my chest tightens and my mind jumps to them whispering, the principal calling, me getting pushed out. I can feel the air at the tip of my nose for a beat, then the movie starts up again and I'm buzzy and can't hold it. Can you guide me through one tiny thing to do right now so I can actually keep watching the breath without everything spiraling?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you tune in to your breath, your mind is already hijacked by the thoughts. Let's try something that doesn't require you to focus on the breath or the thoughts, just to create a tiny bit of space. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, where they are, in this room, in this moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I'm trying to feel my feet but it's hard — I'm jittery and my attention keeps buzzing so I only get a second of weight under my heels before the movie starts: whispering, the principal calling, me being pushed out, ending up alone. I can feel a tiny pressure under the balls of my feet for a beat, then my chest tightens and my hands go clammy and it's gone. Can you give me one very small, concrete thing to do right now so I can actually keep my focus there?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thoughts are still very dominant. Let's try something that's very physical, and very small, that can help anchor you in the present moment. I want you to notice the sensation of the air on your skin, right now, where your cheek touches the cushion of your chair. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of that single spot, just for a moment, and simply notice how it feels?

Patient: Okay—I did notice my cheek for a second and it felt cool, then my chest slammed shut and the movie yelled “whispering, the principal calling, you out,” and I lost it. I’m really buzzy and distracted right now and can’t keep focus even on that spot—can you give me one tiny, exact thing to do right now (and tell me when to start) so I don’t just drift back into the disaster loop?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going to give you a new task to focus on, because it seems like you're not getting enough time to even notice it before the thoughts come back. Instead, I want to try something that might help you develop a tiny bit more space. I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to answer just with a nod, yes or no, without thinking too much about it. Are you ready to try this?

Patient: Yes — I'll try, but I'm already braced and my mind's racing toward the worst.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to ask you: is your chest tight right now?

Patient: Yes. My chest's really tight—like a vise—and I'm already picturing them whispering and the principal calling. I'm jittery and bracing; what do we do now?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like we've come full circle. Let's try to go back to the spot on your cheek that we noticed earlier. I want you to take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say "let go" to that tension in your chest, just for a tiny moment.

Patient: I took a deep breath and on the out-breath I said “let go” out loud like you asked — for a fraction of a second it felt like maybe something eased. Then the movie just roared back harder: whispering, the principal calling, me being pushed out — my chest slammed shut, my hands went clammy, and I’m jittery and buzzy again. Saying it felt kind of naïve; I don’t trust it to hold, so what’s one tiny, concrete thing I can do right now that I can actually keep doing before it spirals?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying "let go" was a brief moment of relief, but then the thoughts came back. This time, I want you to do something very simple and tangible that you can repeat to yourself, over and over, like a tiny mantra. I want you to say the words "I am here" to yourself, just one word at a time: I-a-m-here. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it. I said it one word at a time: I. am. here. For a single breath it loosened a little, then the movie slammed back — whispering, the principal calling, me being pushed out — and now my chest’s clenching, I’m buzzy and distracted, and I don’t trust that tiny phrase to hold. What’s one very small, exact thing I can do right now to keep from spiraling — tell me when to start.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the mantra had a small effect, but the thoughts came back. Let's try something very different. I want you to notice the sensation of the sound of my voice right now, the sensation of my voice producing the word "I am here". Can you focus on that sound, just for one second, without thinking about anything else?

Patient: I can try — I caught the sound of your voice saying “I am here” for a split second and it eased a bit, but then my brain immediately screamed “whispering, the principal calling, you’re out” and my chest tightened and my hands went clammy. I’m really jumpy and distracted right now; tell me exactly when to start so I’ve got something concrete to hang onto.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the focus on the sound of my voice was brief. This time, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground right now, the sensation of them touching the floor. I want you to focus on that sensation, just for one second, and then I'll ask you to do it again. When you feel ready, we'll try to build on that tiny bit of ground.

Patient: I did get a tiny feeling under my feet for a second, then my head exploded into the movie — whispering, gossip, the principal calling, me getting pushed out, ending up alone — it felt inevitable. I'm really jittery and can't hold attention; I need a very exact cue (like you saying "start now" and counting to one) or the disaster loop will swallow me. Tell me when to start.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment of focus on your feet was very brief. This time, I want you to pay attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, specifically the sensation of your nostrils flaring as you inhale. When you feel your nostrils flare for the first time, I'll say "start now" and you can try to stay with that sensation. Ready?

Patient: Yes — I'm ready, but I'm already braced and jittery. The moment you say "start now" I can feel my nostrils flare and the movie about whispering and the principal calling and me getting pushed out already starting, so I'm nervous, but go ahead.

Therapist Answer:
Go ahead and say "start now".

Patient: Start now. I caught the nostril flare for a split second and then the movie went full blast — whispering, the principal calling, me being fired, ending up alone — my chest slammed shut and I couldn't stay with the feeling. I couldn't hold it; can you give me a very concrete cue (like counting out loud "1…2…3") and tell me exactly when to start so I have something to grab onto?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the focus on the nostril flare was brief. This time, I want you to focus on the sensation of my voice saying "one". When I say it, pay attention to the sound of the word "one" and try to stay with that sound for just a moment. When I say "one", start paying attention to your nostrils flaring. Ready?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm really jumpy and buzzy right now; the second you say "one" my brain's already rolling the movie — whispering, the principal calling, me getting pushed out. I'll try to listen for the sound of "one" and notice the nostril flare, but I can't promise I won't get pulled into the disaster chain — say it when you're ready.
