Patient: Lately I've been feeling a lot of anxiety about being around other people — the idea of going to a dinner or a small get-together makes my chest tight, so I just end up avoiding friends and even family. It's worse since the kids moved out; I feel more alone but also more nervous in social situations. Honestly, how is this supposed to help? I've tried things before and they don't work.

Therapist Answer:
That must be really tough for you. It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure of how to make progress with your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what happens for you when you start to feel anxious in social situations? What are some of the thoughts or physical sensations that you notice when that anxiety arises?

Patient: My chest tightens, my heart races, my hands go clammy, and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or like my stomach's in knots. Then my head fills with thoughts like "they're judging me," "I'll say something stupid," or "I don't belong here," and I start looking for a way out. I've tried breathing exercises and talking myself down before and it doesn't do much—how is digging into this supposed to help when it hits so fast?


--- Turn 2 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations and thoughts can be really overwhelming. It sounds like your body is trying to protect you from the discomfort of potentially being judged or making a mistake. Can you think of a situation where you're around others, but you're not feeling anxious or overwhelmed – like, maybe you're around a close friend or family member in a setting where you feel really comfortable? What does your body do in those situations, and how do you feel?

Patient: There’s one friend I’ve had for decades — when I’m at her kitchen table, maybe having tea, I’m fine: my shoulders loosen, my breath slows, and I can actually laugh without thinking about it. At work I can manage too, because I’m in control of the conversation and the tasks, so the judgment stuff doesn’t hit as hard. But… how is picturing that supposed to help when I’m at a dinner party and my chest’s tight and I just want to run?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like those specific situations you mentioned have helped you feel more at ease, even if only temporarily. One way to think about it is that your body and mind have learned to associate certain environments or contexts with feelings of safety and relaxation. What if, instead of focusing on the specific situation, you were to imagine being in a space where you felt safe and comfortable, but still had to go to this dinner party? Could you think of a place where you feel like you can just be yourself, without judgment, and what does that feel like for your body and mind?

Patient: When I picture my friend's kitchen table, I feel relaxed—my shoulders drop, my breathing slows, and I can actually laugh. At work I feel competent and in control, which keeps the worry from spiraling. But how is picturing those feelings supposed to stop the pounding and sweating when I'm actually at the dinner? I've tried visualizing before and it just fades once the anxiety starts.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind can distinguish between the fantasy of being in those safe spaces and the reality of being in the situation you're anxious about. One way to think about it is that, in the moment, instead of trying to hold onto the feeling of safety from your favorite places, you could try to make room for that feeling of relaxation and competence in the midst of the anxiety. What would it be like for your body and mind if, when you started to feel the physical sensations of anxiety, you were able to say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious right now, but I can make space for a sense of calm and confidence, even if it's just for a moment?"

Patient: I get the idea, but honestly—how is saying that any different from the breathing tricks I've tried? When the chest tightens and the "they're judging me" thoughts start, those words feel thin and the sensations drown them out. I can try to tell myself that, but I'm skeptical it would hold up at a dinner — it just makes me more frustrated when nothing changes.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling to find a sense of authenticity in your attempts to calm yourself. Instead of trying to convince yourself to feel a certain way, what if you simply allowed the sensations to be present, without judgment? What if, when the thoughts start, you could say to yourself, "This thought is here, it's showing up now" – and then, without trying to push it away or change it, simply observe it as a thought?

Patient: I've tried that—saying "this thought is here"—and it just feels like pretending while my heart races and my hands go numb. Observing feels passive, like I'm supposed to stand there and let the panic run the show. How is that supposed to help when I'm halfway through a dinner and everyone seems to be watching me? Can we try a concrete, step-by-step way to do that now, because I don't see how it would actually change anything.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you might feel that way. One thing you might try is to take a very small, subtle step: when you notice the thought "they're judging me" arising, pause for just a single, tiny breath before responding or reacting. Just a tiny pause. Can you imagine taking a very small, almost imperceptible breath in, and then pausing for just one second before doing something with that thought?

Patient: Okay—I can try that. I just took a tiny breath imagining a pause and for a split second my shoulders eased, but then the "they're judging me" voice got louder and my heart raced again. It feels like a little trick, not something that stops the dizziness or the urge to bolt—so how is that supposed to help in a real dinner, and can you give me a concrete, step‑by‑step I can actually practice?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pause might be a tiny crack in the armor of the anxiety. One small step you could try is to combine the pause with a physical action: while you're pausing, take a sip of your drink, or touch your foot to the floor. This might help ground you in the present moment, and give you a tiny sense of control. Can you think of something else you could do while pausing that feels small and manageable, like taking a small step forward or placing your hand on your knee?

Patient: I could press my feet into the floor, put my hand on my knee, or fiddle my wedding band — in meetings those little anchors help me not spiral so fast. But honestly, how is that supposed to quiet the “they’re judging me” voice? If you want me to try, give me a clear step‑by‑step right now so I know exactly what to do when I’m at a table.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like those physical anchors have been helpful in managing the anxiety in other situations. One step you could try in a dinner situation is to focus on your five senses. When you notice the "they're judging me" thought, take a brief pause, and then bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor – notice the weight, the pressure, the sensation of the floor beneath you. Then, slowly, bring your attention to the sounds around you – notice the clinking of dishes, the hum of conversation, the sounds of the people in the room. Can you do that for a moment?

Patient: I did that just now—pressed my feet into the floor and listened for a bit; it calmed me for a few seconds but then the "they're judging me" voice peeked back in and my chest tightened again. How long am I supposed to focus on each sense before it’s supposed to do anything real, and what do I do when the thought just keeps coming back no matter how many senses I name? I don’t mean to be difficult, I just need something concrete that actually works at a noisy table.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's not about focusing on each sense for a specific amount of time, but rather about being able to return to them whenever the thought arises. Instead of trying to block out the thought, you're trying to anchor yourself in the present moment. One step you could try is to take a very small, imperceptible step – just a tiny, almost imperceptible, movement of your hand, like touching your napkin or stirring your drink. This tiny movement can help you get your attention back to the present moment, without trying to push the thought away. Can you try that?

Patient: Alright — I tried it in my head: I pressed my feet, touched my napkin, and for a couple breaths it loosened up, then the “they’re judging me” voice crept back and my chest tightened again. How long am I supposed to keep doing those little anchors — like a timeline: first 30 seconds, next minute — and what exactly do I say or do when the thought keeps coming back? I’m skeptical this will actually help at a noisy table, but I’ll try if you give me a practical, step‑by‑step I can use without looking like I’m fidgeting.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more concrete plan. One way to think about it is that the anchors aren't meant to be a specific amount of time, but rather a way to create a small window of opportunity for change. When the thought "they're judging me" arises, take a brief pause, and then take a small action that doesn't require your full attention – like taking a sip of your drink, or glancing at the person across from you for a split second. The goal is to create a tiny gap in your attention, rather than trying to engage with the thought directly. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried it in my head—sip my drink, glance away, press my feet—and it loosened me for a few breaths, then the "they're judging me" voice came back hard. How long do I keep doing those tiny things before it should work, and what do I say if someone actually turns to me and asks a question and I freeze? I'm feeling frustrated and skeptical—I'll try it, but give me a very short script or exact steps I can use at the table so it doesn't just look like fidgeting.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. One way to think about it is that the anchors are meant to be a way to create a small opportunity for change, rather than a solution. When you freeze up in a conversation, one thing you could try is to simply say, "Excuse me, what was the question again?" or "Can you repeat that?" – not because you're trying to buy time, but because it gives you a brief moment to pause and gather your thoughts. This can help you regain your footing in the conversation, without drawing attention to the fact that you're feeling anxious.

Patient: I get the idea — it might buy a second or two — but how is that supposed to help when everyone stares and it feels like I'm dodging the question? Give me a very short, exact script I can use at the table: the exact words, the tone (quiet or firm?), and one follow‑up line if they repeat it and I'm still blank. I'm getting frustrated—can we try a quick role‑play now so I can hear how it would actually go?

I can try to help with that. Let's do a quick role-play. Imagine we're at a dinner table, and someone asks you a question. You're the person being asked, and I'll play the role of the person asking the question. Then, I'll give you a prompt to respond, and you can practice using the script.

Here's the scenario: "What do you think about the new policy we're implementing?"

(Remember, you'll say the following script: "Excuse me, what was the question again?")

Patient: "Excuse me, what was the question again?" (quiet, a bit hesitant)  
"Could you say that again more slowly, please? I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help?"

You said the script, and it bought you a brief moment to gather your thoughts. When they repeat the question, you can say, "I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Can you help me understand what you're asking about the policy?" (still quiet, with a hint of curiosity).

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to stop the hot flush and the throat closing? If I say, "I apologize, I didn't quite catch that," in a quiet, hesitant way, people will just stare and my panic spikes. Can you give me an even shorter, exact script (words, tone) and one line to use if they repeat it and I'm still blank? I'm kind of distracted right now and my chest's already tightening.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "I'm still trying to process" feels vague and too slow; my chest's already tightening and I'm getting flustered. How is that supposed to help when everyone's staring? Give me a two‑line script (exact words and the tone to use), one line if they repeat it and I'm still blank, and a tiny physical anchor I can do without looking like I'm fidgeting — and can we role‑play that now?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a shorter script.

At the dinner table, when they ask a question, you can say:

"I'm having trouble focusing on that right now." (firm, with a hint of calm)

If they repeat the question, you can say, "I'm sorry, could you rephrase it?" (still firm, but with a slight pause before speaking)

For a tiny physical anchor, you can tap your right knee lightly with your left hand, just as you're saying "I'm having trouble focusing on that right now." This small movement can help you stay present and focused on your body, without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try it: "I'm having trouble focusing on that right now." (quiet but firm, as you said). 

I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops my throat from closing; my chest's already tight and I'm distracted, so it feels thin. Can we do the role‑play now—ask me the question and watch how I say it—and give me the exact moment to tap my knee and what I do if they press me after that?

Therapist Answer:
Let's do the role-play.

(I'll play the role of the person asking the question) "So, what do you think about the new project we're working on?"

(I'll ask the question in a friendly, casual tone)

You can respond with the script: "I'm having trouble focusing on that right now."

(I'll respond with a follow-up question) "Okay, can you help me understand what you're thinking about?"

(This is your chance to say "I'm sorry, could you rephrase it?" and tap your knee)

Please go ahead and respond as you would in the actual situation. I'll give you feedback on your body language and tone.

Patient: "I'm having trouble focusing on that right now," I say quiet but firm, and I press my left hand once against my right knee as I start the sentence to anchor myself. If they press me after that, I pause for two seconds, take a small breath, and say, "I'm sorry, could you rephrase that?" in the same calm tone. I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to stop my throat from closing? My chest's already tight and I'm distracted, so I still feel skeptical this will hold up at a noisy table.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're doing great. You're using the anchor to stay present and focused. As for stopping your throat from closing, it's not about stopping the physical sensation entirely, but about creating a tiny gap in your attention. By pausing for two seconds, taking a small breath, and saying the rephrased question, you're giving yourself a brief moment to relax and respond more mindfully.

Let's try it again. I'll play the role of the person asking the question, and we'll do a few more rounds.

(I'll ask the question) "So, what do you think about the new policy we're implementing?"

(You respond with the script, using the anchor and pausing for two seconds)

"I'm having trouble focusing on that right now." (with a slight pause, you tap your left hand against your right knee)

(I respond with a follow-up question) "Okay, can you help me understand what you're thinking about?"

How do you respond?

Patient: "I'm sorry, could you rephrase that?" I say quiet and a little shaky, as I press my left hand once against my right knee and take a tiny breath. My chest's tight and my throat's closing already—I'm not sure I follow how repeating it will help, but maybe if you say it more simply I can manage.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're doing great. Remember, the goal is not to repeat the exact phrase, but to rephrase the question in a way that gives you a moment to gather your thoughts. Let's try again.

(I'll ask the question) "So, what do you think about the new policy we're implementing?"

(I pause for a moment)

You respond with a rephrased question: "Can you clarify what specifically you're asking about?"

(I respond with a follow-up question) "Okay, can you give me an example?"

By rephrasing the question, you're creating a tiny gap in your attention and giving yourself a chance to respond more mindfully. Try it again, and remember to tap your knee and take a tiny breath as you respond.

Patient: Do you mean—can you give an example of how the policy would work in day‑to‑day practice? I press my left hand into my right knee and take a tiny breath as I say it, but my chest's already tight and I'm distracted. I'm not sure I follow how rephrasing buys me anything more than a second—how is that supposed to help when I'm still blank?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Rephrasing the question doesn't necessarily buy you a lot of time, but it can help you buy a tiny bit of mental space. Let's try to focus on the physical sensation of your hand on your knee.

As you tap your knee and take a tiny breath, bring your attention to that sensation. Notice the feeling of your hand pressing against your knee, the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about the question or the conversation right now – just focus on that physical sensation.

Can you do that for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried that just now. I felt the pressure where my hand met my knee and took a tiny breath, and for a second my shoulders eased, then the thoughts and tightness came back and I got distracted. I'm more anxious than before and honestly frustrated — I'm not sure I follow how a momentary focus is supposed to stop the flood when it hits hard. Give me a very specific sequence I can try the next time it spikes (exact words, exact timing — like breathe in for X, hold for Y, press for Z) and tell me what to do the instant the panic rushes back.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling more anxious and frustrated, and that's okay. It's normal for this process to feel challenging, especially when it's a new skill.

Here's a specific sequence you can try:

1. Breathe in for a count of 4, feeling the breath move into your body
2. Hold your breath for a count of 2, allowing yourself to feel the physical sensations in your body
3. Press your left hand against your right knee for a count of 2, using the anchor to ground yourself
4. As you start to feel the panic rising, say to yourself: "I've got this" in a firm but gentle tone
5. Take a small sip of your drink (or do any other small, calming action that feels comfortable for you)
6. When the panic starts to subside, say: "I'm here" (with a calm, gentle tone)

When you feel the panic rushing back, start again from step 1, and focus on your breathing and the physical sensation of your hand on your knee.

Remember, the goal is not to stop the panic entirely, but to create a tiny gap in your attention, allowing you to respond more mindfully and take small steps towards feeling more grounded.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing in for 4, holding for 2, pressing for 2 supposed to stop my throat from closing? Right now my chest's tight and my hands are clammy and I'm more distracted than before. I've done counted breathing and anchors before and it only ever buys me a second; then the panic floods back.

Give me something I can do that won't look obvious at the table: an exact two‑line script (words and tone) for when someone asks me something, one line to use if they press me again, and what to say if someone notices the knee‑tap. Also can we do one more quick role‑play now so I can actually try the sequence while you watch?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling frustrated and skeptical. I'm not suggesting that the counting breathing will stop the panic entirely, but rather create a tiny window of opportunity for you to respond more mindfully.

Here's a new approach:

One-line script: "That's a great question, I'm still thinking about it."
Tone: calm, interested

One-line response if they press you again: "Can you give me a minute to gather my thoughts?"
Tone: polite, with a hint of gentle urgency

If someone notices the knee-tap, you can simply say: "Sorry, just taking a moment to collect my thoughts."
This acknowledges their observation without drawing attention to the fact that you're feeling anxious.

Let's do a quick role-play. I'll ask you a question, and you can try using the script and sequence. Remember to focus on your breathing, the physical sensation of your hand on your knee, and responding mindfully.

(I'll ask the question) "So, what do you think about the new project we're working on?"

Patient: "That's a great question—I'm still thinking about it," I say, calm but my voice a little shaky as I press my left hand to my right knee and take a tiny, steady breath. I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops my throat from closing or the hot flush—I feel distracted and more anxious already. Can we try it again and have you tell me exactly how my tone sounded and what you'd suggest changing?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again.

As you said, "That's a great question—I'm still thinking about it," I noticed that your tone sounded more like "I'm still thinking about it, I'm still thinking about it" rather than a calm, interested tone. Your voice sounded a bit hesitant and shaky.

The physical sensations you described - the pressing of your hand on your knee, taking a tiny breath - were subtle and present, but didn't seem to have a significant impact on your overall anxiety level.

In this situation, it might be helpful to focus on your tone and body language. When someone asks a question, try to respond with a more neutral tone, without feeling like you need to fill the silence or prove yourself. Aim for a tone that's calm, but not overly friendly or rehearsed. Think of it as a gentle, professional tone.

Let's try again. I'll ask you the same question.

("So, what do you think about the new project we're working on?")

This time, try to respond with a more neutral tone, and see if that helps.

Patient: "That's a good question — I'm still thinking about it." I tried to say it flat and steady, but my chest's tight and my voice still wavers. I'm not sure I follow how a more neutral tone actually stops the panic — how is that supposed to help? Can we run it once more and have you tell me exactly which word to land on and how to sound?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again.

As you said, "That's a good question — I'm still thinking about it," I noticed that your voice still wavered slightly, and your body language showed signs of tension.

In this situation, let's focus on the word "still". Try to land on that word and focus on the sensation of the sound it makes in your mouth. When you say "still", aim for a tone that's more like a gentle, measured tone, rather than a hesitant or wavering one. Think of it as saying "still" with a slight pause, almost like a gentle emphasis on the word.

When you say "still", try to pause for a fraction of a second before continuing, and focus on the sensation of your mouth and breath moving. This can help you stay present and calm, even in the midst of a panic.

Let's try again. I'll ask you the question, and we'll focus on the word "still".

("So, what do you think about the new project we're working on?")

Patient: "That's a good question — I'm still thinking about it." I try to land on "still" with a measured pause, press my hand to my knee, and take a tiny breath, but I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops my throat from closing. Can we try it again and have you tell me exactly how long to pause on "still" and how it should sound?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're focusing on the pause and the sensation of the word "still". That's a great start.

When you say "still", try to pause for exactly 1.2 seconds. Not too long, not too short. Just a brief, gentle pause.

As for the tone, aim for a tone that's slightly softer than your natural tone. Think of it as a gentle, introspective tone, like you're sharing a quiet thought. Your voice should still be clear and understandable, but it should have a slightly more measured quality to it.

When you pause on "still", try to let the pause be a tiny bit longer than usual, so it's not just a quick moment of silence, but a tiny, gentle hesitation. This can help you stay present and focused.

Let's try again. I'll ask you the question, and we'll focus on the pause and the tone.

("So, what do you think about the new project we're working on?")

Patient: Okay — I tried: "That's a good question — I'm still thinking about it." I paused about 1.2 seconds, softened the tone, pressed my hand to my knee and took a tiny breath, but my chest tightened and my voice still shook. I'm not sure I follow how pausing on "still" actually changes the hot flush or the throat closing — how is that supposed to help in the moment? I'm anxious and a bit distracted right now, so give me an exact two‑line script (words and tone) for when someone stares or pushes me, and let's role‑play it now so you can watch how I say it and tell me what to change.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're still struggling to manage your anxiety in the moment.

Let's try a new approach. When someone stares or pushes you, I want you to use a script that acknowledges their behavior without engaging with the anxiety. Here's a two-line script:

"I appreciate your interest in my thoughts. Can we discuss this in a moment?"

Tone: firm, but calm and polite.

When you say the first line, "I appreciate your interest in my thoughts", try to use a tone that's neutral and slightly distant. You're not showing enthusiasm or excitement, but you're not dismissing the person either. You're simply acknowledging their interest.

When you say the second line, "Can we discuss this in a moment?", try to use a tone that's firm but polite. You're setting a boundary and saying that you need a moment to collect your thoughts, without being confrontational or aggressive.

Let's role-play it now. I'll stare at you for a moment, and then ask you a follow-up question.

(I stare at you for a moment, then say) "So, what do you think about the new policy?"

Please respond with the script, and I'll watch and provide feedback on your tone and body language.

Patient: "I appreciate your interest in my thoughts. Can we discuss this in a moment?" I say, firm but calm, pressing my left hand to my right knee and taking a tiny breath as I speak. 

I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to stop my throat from closing? My chest's tight, my voice's shaky, and I'm getting distracted already. 

Can you tell me exactly what to change in that tone or timing, and watch me do it again so I know if the pause and the knee‑tap come across as natural?
