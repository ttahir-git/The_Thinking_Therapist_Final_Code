Patient: Lately I've been consumed with this constant worry that I'm not doing a good enough job as a teacher, and that worry just makes me put off planning and grading until the last minute. I'm in my fifties, dealing with grief and ongoing money problems, so everything feels heavier right now. I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried different strategies before and they didn't stick, so how is this supposed to be different?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the weight of worry about being a good teacher is already adding to the heaviness of your grief and financial struggles. Can you tell me more about what happens for you when you try to plan and grade as you go, versus when you have a more structured plan in place?

Patient: When I do things as I go, it just spirals — I get distracted, the pile of grading grows, and I end up scrambling at the last minute which only proves to me I'm not doing enough. A plan helps at first, but then it becomes this rigid thing I’m terrified I'll fail to meet, so I stall instead of starting. I've tried schedules and checklists before and they never stick, so... how is talking about that supposed to help? I don't know, it feels like we keep circling the same fixes that don't fit my life right now.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the plan gets derailed by your fear of not meeting it, and that creates more stress. Can you tell me more about what's at stake when you think you might fail to meet your self-imposed expectations, and what you value about being a good teacher that's driving this fear?

Patient: When I think I might fail, it feels like everything could unravel — my students would suffer, my reputation at school would take a hit, and with money tight I really can't risk my job. Being a good teacher is one of the few things that makes me feel competent and useful, especially with grief making me feel small. That pressure makes me freeze: I set a plan then panic about not meeting it, so I put things off to avoid that blow to my self-worth. But honestly, how is talking about values supposed to help with the panic in the moment? I've thought about this stuff before and it didn't stop the avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pressure to be a good teacher is closely tied to your sense of self-worth and feeling competent. In that moment of panic, what's the thought that comes up that says "I should just put it off, because if I don't, everything will fall apart"? Can you acknowledge that thought without judgment, and just say what's happening in your body when that thought arises?

Patient: The thought is basically, "If I start and mess up, it proves I'm not cut out for this and everything will fall apart." When that comes, my chest tightens, my stomach knots, my hands get cold and my breathing gets shallow—I just freeze and want to hide from it. I can name that, but honestly, how is just noticing it supposed to stop me from ducking out? I've been aware of these feelings for years and it doesn't seem to change the knee‑jerk avoidance.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a strong emotional response to the thought, and just noticing it might not be enough to change your behavior. What would it take for you to feel like you're taking a step towards planning and grading, even if it feels uncomfortable or scary?

Patient: Maybe if I had a really tiny, specific step—like "spend 10 minutes sorting one stack"—and explicit permission that it can be messy, I might actually start. Having someone check in or a short, nonjudgmental routine would probably help too, but I've tried microtasks and accountability and they usually fizzled after a week, so I'm skeptical this will stick. I also need some real reassurance that one slip won't mean I'm finished, otherwise the panic just swallows me.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a gentle, non-judgmental way to ease into the task, and reassurance that it's okay to make mistakes. What would having someone check in with you while you work look like, and what kind of reassurance would need to be present for you to feel okay taking that tiny step of sorting one stack?

Patient: Okay—so a check‑in would have to be tiny and practical: a quick text or call right after I do the 10‑minute sort, something like "What did you do?" and "Anything get in the way?" — no lecture, just acknowledgement. The reassurance I'd need is someone explicitly saying "one slip doesn't mean you're done; try again tomorrow," and reminding me of small wins instead of fixating on mistakes. But honestly, how is that supposed to be different from the accountability buddies and apps I've tried? Who's going to do the checking in, and what if that fizzles like everything else?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more personalized, flexible approach that acknowledges your small wins, rather than just focusing on progress or setbacks. Would it be helpful to imagine that the checking in and reassurance could come from someone you already know and trust, like a colleague or a family member, rather than a new accountability buddy or app?

Patient: Maybe—having someone I already know, like a colleague who sees the load, sounds less awkward than a stranger. But who's got the time, and I don't want to burden them or end up with a lecture, so I'm worried it'll just fizzle like before. How is that supposed to be different unless we set a tight, time‑limited check‑in with a simple script—just "What did you do?" and "Anything get in the way?" and no advice?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Having someone you know and trust could make it feel less awkward. Having a simple, time-limited check-in with a script could help you feel more grounded. What if, instead of just checking in with someone, you were to say to yourself, "I'm committing to checking in with [colleague] for 5 minutes, and I'm going to follow that with a small action: just sort one stack" – would that give you a sense of what it would take to make a start?

Patient: Maybe—saying I'll do a 5‑minute check‑in and then sort one stack sounds less terrifying, but I'm skeptical it'll actually stick. Who's going to be the one to do the checking in, and how do I stop myself from panicking and chicken‑outing before I press send—people flake or I freeze. Can we try a quick role‑play now where you act like the colleague and I practice the short script, so I can see if I can actually follow through?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll play the role of your colleague, and we can practice the 5-minute check-in and sorting one stack. I'll send a simple text and then wait for your response. Let's try it out: "Hey, what did you do so far?"

Patient: I... I actually did about 10 minutes—just sorted the top stack and pulled out three papers to grade, but I didn't finish grading any. My chest got tight halfway through and I almost stopped, so I kept telling myself "just until the timer" to get through it. Can you just say, plainly, "one slip doesn't mean you're finished" so I can hear that and try again tomorrow?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
"one slip doesn't mean you're finished"

Patient: That actually helps a little to hear—it's like a small lifeline—but my chest is still tight and I'm worrying I'll freeze next time. How is that supposed to help when the panic kicks in and I just don't press send? Can you say the follow‑up line I'd want from my colleague: "Anything get in the way?" so I can try replying to that too?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
"Anything get in the way?"

Patient: Yeah — my chest tightened, I started scrolling through emails, kept thinking about all the ways I could mess up, and I nearly didn't press send. Hearing "one slip doesn't mean you're finished" helped a little, but I'm still worried I'll chicken out next time. Can we practice a very short, concrete line I can actually copy and text when I'm panicking — something I can press send on without overthinking?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try: "Okay, I'm starting again."

Patient: Okay... I can see myself texting "Okay, I'm starting again" — it's short enough I might hit send. But already I'm stuck on the next part: what if I send it and still don't do anything? How is that supposed to help when the panic freezes me before I even press send?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's a great catch. It sounds like you're getting to a new point of tension. What if, instead of trying to "get started" or "make progress", you simply acknowledged the panic that's arising, and said something like "I'm feeling anxious about getting started"?

Patient: I could see myself sending "I'm feeling anxious about getting started"—it's short enough I might actually hit send. But how is that supposed to help if they don't reply or if they say something unhelpful like "just do it" and I freeze more? My chest is already tight just thinking about saying it, and I worry I'll sound weak or like I'm fishing for pity. Can we role‑play some likely colleague responses now so I can practice a brief reply I could actually send when the panic hits?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try some possible responses from your colleague. Imagine your colleague says: "That's totally normal, we've all been there", "Take your time, no rush", or "Just send the update and we'll discuss in the morning". Now, can you think of a brief response that acknowledges their comment and doesn't require a lot of emotional energy or a big reaction?

Patient: Okay—short replies I could actually send:

- To "That's totally normal, we've all been there": "Thanks. That helps a bit."
- To "Take your time, no rush": "Okay. I'll try that."
- To "Just send the update and we'll discuss in the morning": "Alright. Sending a quick update now."

I can only manage very short texts like those right now. Can we role‑play the "Take your time" one so I can try actually saying it? But seriously—how is this supposed to be different when I still feel frozen?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the "Take your time, no rush" scenario. I'll respond with "Take your time, no rush". You can take a moment to gather your thoughts, and then send a brief response. Remember, you're just aiming for a brief acknowledgment.

(playing the role of your colleague) Take your time, no rush.

Patient: Okay. I'll try that. But honestly, how is this supposed to be different—can we role‑play the "Just send the update" line next?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the "Just send the update and we'll discuss in the morning" scenario. I'll respond with "Just send the update and we'll discuss in the morning". You can take your time, and then send a brief update. 

(playing the role of your colleague) Just send the update and we'll discuss in the morning.

Patient: "Update: sorted one stack and pulled 3 papers to grade. Did 10 minutes; still anxious but I started."

Can we do the next role‑play? I'm not sure how this actually changes things when I panic—how is this supposed to be different?

Therapist Answer:
Now that you've sent the update, let's try the "That's totally normal, we've all been there" scenario. I'll respond with "That's totally normal, we've all been there". How would you respond to that?

Patient: Thanks. That helps a bit. But I'm still tense—my chest tightens and I can feel myself backing away, so how is saying that supposed to stop me freezing? Can we try one more role‑play where you ask something simple like "How long did you work?" so I can practice a brief, factual reply?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the "How long did you work?" scenario. I'll respond with "How long did you work?". You can take a moment to respond with a brief factual answer, like "10 minutes".

By focusing on a simple, factual question, you're taking your attention away from the emotional tension and onto a more concrete aspect of the situation. Sometimes, acknowledging the present moment in a small way can help calm the nervous system.

Patient: About 10 minutes. My chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting away though.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is still wandering. Can you say to yourself, "My mind is wandering" without judgment?

Patient: "My mind is wandering." I can say that — my chest's tight, my thoughts keep jumping to the emails and the bills — but saying it out loud doesn't unstick me; how is that supposed to help when I still feel frozen and keep scrolling?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like saying "My mind is wandering" is a temporary fact, but it's not helping you get started. Let's try to focus on what you could do next, rather than getting caught up in your thoughts. What's one small, concrete action you could take right now to make progress on your task?

Patient: I could try a 5‑minute timer and just sort one small stack—nothing else. But I'm worn out and my chest's tight and my mind's already darting, so I'm worried I'll freeze before I hit start—how is that actually going to stop me from chickening out?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still struggling with the anxiety of starting. Let's try to break it down even further. What if, instead of trying to tackle the whole task, you just commit to doing one tiny step: hitting the "start" button on the timer, without worrying about the outcome or the rest of the task? Would you be willing to do that small action?

Patient: I can try. My chest's tight and my hands are shaky—how is just hitting start supposed to stop me from freezing? Still, okay, I'll try to press the 5‑minute timer now and see if I can get through it.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's a small step, but it's a start. As you hit the start button, take a deep breath and acknowledge the physical sensation of your hand pressing the button. Just acknowledge it, without judgment.

Patient: I hit the start — felt my fingers press the button and took a single shallow breath, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting to bills and emails. It did get me to do one tiny thing, but how is that supposed to stop me freezing when it's time to actually grade? I'm worn out and still worried I'll chicken out before the next step.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's small progress, but it's progress nonetheless. Let's focus on the present moment, without judgment. As you continue to work, bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body, especially your chest. Notice if there's any change in your tension, or if it's still present. Can you simply acknowledge the sensation of your chest, without trying to change it or judge it?

Patient: It feels like a tight knot in my chest that won't loosen—I can notice it and name it. But naming it doesn't make it stop; my thoughts keep darting and I still feel like I'm going to freeze. If noticing isn't enough, what do you actually want me to do next when this happens?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Notice that your mind is still wandering. When it does, can you say to yourself, "Back to the stack"? That's it. No judgment, no thought, just "Back to the stack". What happens if you say that to yourself?

Patient: I tried it — saying "Back to the stack" does pull me back for a beat, but my chest still tightens and my hands start fiddling with my phone. It feels like a weak little nudge against a wave of panic, and I'm worried it won't hold when I actually have to grade a pile of real papers. How is that supposed to be enough when the freeze hits hard? I'm worn out and I need to know what to do next when that phrase doesn't stick.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying "Back to the stack" is a small but helpful signal, but it's not a reliable anchor for when the panic hits hard. Can you think of a different phrase, one that's even simpler, that might help you refocus when you feel that wave of panic? Something like... "Sort one paper"?

Patient: Maybe something blunt and tiny — "One paper" or even just "Now." "One paper" feels like it might be doable. But my chest's still tight just thinking about it — how is that actually going to help when the panic takes over and I can't lift a hand? If I say it and it doesn't work, what do I do next?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
"One paper" is a simple, concrete goal. What if, when you say "One paper", you don't try to force anything else to happen, but just let your hand pick up one paper and gently touch it? No thinking, no planning, just the physical act of touching the paper. Would that be enough to get you moving?

Patient: Maybe—"just touch one paper" feels small enough that I could try it; I can picture my hand hovering over the stack. But my chest's still tight and if that doesn't break the freeze, what do I do next? How is this any different from the little tricks that always fizzle out?
