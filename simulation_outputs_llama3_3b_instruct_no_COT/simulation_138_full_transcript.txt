Patient: I'm a chef, and lately I can't stop beating myself up over small screw-ups at work and in my relationships — it just spirals into feeling like a failure. I know a lot of it goes back to being bullied at school and it still knocks my confidence in social situations. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything?

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how painful those feelings are and to question whether therapy can help. Can you tell me more about what it's like when those negative self-criticizing thoughts start to spiral out of control? What's the first thing that feels like a 'screw-up' to you, and what's the immediate reaction that follows?

Patient: It usually starts with something tiny — a dropped plate, a wrong order, or saying something awkward — and the first thought is immediately, "I'm useless." My chest tightens, I replay every embarrassing moment from school, and it quickly snowballs into this whole storyline that I'm a failure who doesn't belong. Then I either throw myself into extra shifts to prove I'm not a screw-up or I shut down and avoid people, and honestly I've talked about this before and it didn't change much — how is that supposed to help now?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt that feels very hard to break. Can you see where in that process, somewhere, you might be holding onto the idea that being a "failure" or "useless" has to be true in order to motivate yourself to work harder or avoid people? Is there a sense of self-identity tied to being able to get these reactions under control, or is it more of a "save face" kind of thing, where you're trying to protect yourself from feeling vulnerable?

Patient: Yeah, honestly it's both. Part of me clings to being a "failure" because that explanation makes the bullying make sense and lets me brace for more, and part of me overworks or freezes to protect myself from looking vulnerable — it's like this old survival mode. I get that on paper, but I've pointed this out before and it still happens — how is just noticing supposed to stop the spiral?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've already gained some insight into the patterns, but they still feel automatic. What if, instead of trying to stop the spiral altogether, you were to make room for something else to happen? What would it be like if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to hold the feeling of being a "failure" without trying to push it away or convince yourself otherwise? Would that even be possible, or does the fear of being vulnerable feel too overwhelming?

Patient: Honestly, when I try to just "hold" that feeling it floods me—my chest tightens, I replay the bullying, and my instinct is either to prove myself by taking extra shifts or to shut down and avoid people. Maybe I could do it for a second, but it feels like if I sit with it I'm admitting I'm weak or broken—how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing stuff and "staying with the feeling" before and it usually just leaves me more stuck, not less.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like the act of "sitting with" the feeling is still tied up in the same old survival strategy. Can you think of a different kind of relationship with this feeling – one that doesn't involve trying to push it away or change it, but more like... observing it, perhaps? What if, instead of trying to make the feeling go away, you were to treat it more like a temporary weather condition, like the sun or the rain? Would that be a more neutral way to approach it?

Patient: Yeah, I get the “weather” idea — sounds calmer on paper, but when it hits it’s like a storm that wrecks the whole shift. If I try to just watch it my chest tightens and I start replaying everything, and then I panic I’m being vulnerable or lazy. How is that supposed to help when I need to be sharp and not mess up orders? I’ve tried noticing before and I just end up back in overdrive or shutting down.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the idea of observing the feeling without acting on it feels too passive, too disconnected from the demands of your work. What if, instead of trying to separate yourself from the storm, you were to imagine that you're standing right in the middle of it, with the feeling, but also with a sense of curiosity and openness? What would that feel like, and how might that shift the way you approach your work?

Patient: I don't know — standing in the storm might feel like noticing the tightness and mentally saying, "okay, that's panic," without letting it take over. Maybe if I could do that for a second between tickets it would stop the spiral, but how is that supposed to help when the line's moving and I can't afford to freeze? I've tried tiny rituals before and they don't stick, but I might try something really brief and practical, not just airy "be curious" stuff.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more concrete way to break the cycle, something that can help you stay focused on the present moment, even when the line is moving quickly. What if, for just one small moment, you were to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sound of the sizzling food, or the smell of the kitchen? Would that be enough to ground you in the present, and give you a bit more space to breathe between tickets?

Patient: Okay, I can see how that might help in theory, but honestly — how is focusing on my feet or the sizzle supposed to stop me from spiraling when the pass is full? I might try a one-second thing: feel my feet, take one breath, then back to the next ticket — but I'm worried I'll freeze or overthink it and make things worse. How do I practice that so it actually sticks and doesn't turn into another ritual that fails me?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more reliable way to anchor yourself in the moment, so you can stay on track even when things get busy. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you were to focus on the physical sensations that happen when you take one breath, feel your feet, and get back to the next task? For example, would you be willing to try feeling your feet for just one breath, without worrying about whether you can do it again, or without trying to use it as a "fix"?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it for one breath, just feeling my feet for a second, but only if it's literally a one-second thing and won't wreck the flow. Still — how is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed? I'm worried I'll just overthink and freeze, but I'll test it on my next shift and tell you what happens.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're willing to give it a try, but you're still holding onto some uncertainty about how it will play out. What if, after you feel your feet for one breath, you didn't "succeed" or "fail" in the way you thought, but simply... kept moving? Would that be enough to start to build some trust in this small, one-second practice?

Patient: I guess maybe if I do the one-breath thing and don't label it as success or failure I could keep moving — but I'm really skeptical. Honestly, I'm worried I'll still overthink it mid-shift and then beat myself up for "failing" the practice — how is that supposed to build trust? I'll try it next shift, but can you give me something concrete to do if I start to freeze so I don't just spiral into more self-criticism?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still worried about getting caught up in self-criticism, even if you do try the one-breath practice. What if, when you do start to freeze or get caught up in thoughts, you were to say to yourself, "I'm stuck," without judgment, but then simply take a tiny physical action, like unclogging a utensil or wiping down the counter? It's a small, concrete thing to do, and it might help you get back to the task at hand without getting caught up in more thinking.

Patient: My chest's already tightening just thinking about getting stuck — I'm jittery and can't focus, so I'm not sure I'll even remember to say "I'm stuck" without freezing. I can see how a tiny action might pull me out of spiraling, but... how is unplugging a utensil or wiping a counter supposed to stop the whole avalanche of self-criticism when the pass is slammed? Can you give me one super-simple fallback I can actually do in the moment that won't look like I'm slacking, and can we slow down a bit so I can think it through?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the anticipation of getting stuck is already causing you to feel overwhelmed. Can you think of something even simpler than unplugging a utensil or wiping a counter that you can do in the moment, without drawing attention to yourself? For example, could you just take a tiny, almost imperceptible "pause" between tasks, where you don't do anything, but simply... exist in the space between tasks?

Patient: I'm already jittery just thinking about pausing — my chest's tight and my head's racing, so I'm not sure I'll even notice a tiny space. Maybe I could try a one-breath micro-pause, but how is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed and I'm mid-ticket? Give me one tiny, invisible thing I can do that won't look like slacking — like pressing my thumb to my ring finger or silently saying one word — something I can actually remember under pressure. Can we slow down and run through it here a couple times so I know what it'll feel like?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like the pressure of the pass and your own anxiety are already making it hard to focus. Can we take a deep breath together and try it out slowly? Let's start with something tiny, like taking one tiny breath in, and then... pausing for just a fraction of a second. Can you feel your breath in your body as you breathe in? And then... pause. Just for one second. Not even thinking about it, just... pause. Would you be willing to try that with me right now?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it now. I took one tiny breath and paused for a second, but my chest tightened and my head immediately jumped to the pass and the tickets, so it barely landed — honestly, how is that supposed to help when it just sparks more panic? I need to run through it a few times and have a concrete, invisible cue I can actually remember under pressure (like pressing my thumb to my ring finger or silently saying "steady") — can we slow down and practice that here so I know what it'll feel like?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pause was brief, but it didn't quite stick. Let's break it down even further. Can we start with just the sensation of taking one tiny breath in, without thinking about the pause or the outcome? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you breathe in, can you feel your chest rise? And when you breathe out, can you feel your chest fall? We can start with just this simple observation, without trying to add anything else. Ready to try it with me?

Patient: Okay—I tried the breath, but my chest tightened and my head immediately jumped to the pass, so I barely registered it. How is just noticing my breath supposed to stop me spiraling when tickets pile up? Can we slow down and actually practice a concrete, invisible cue—like pressing my thumb to my ring finger or silently saying “steady”—and run through it a few times so I have something I can actually remember under pressure?

It sounds like the observation of the breath was hard to anchor in, despite your best efforts. Let's try a different approach. Can you think of something that's very easy to do, something that doesn't require any mental effort at all? Like... pressing your thumb to your ring finger. Can you do that right now, without thinking about it? Just press your thumb to your ring finger, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay—I pressed my thumb to my ring finger like you said, but as soon as I did my chest tightened and this rush of shame hit me, like that moment at school. It felt kind of ridiculous and didn't do much except remind me I'm a screw-up—how is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed? Can we slow down and run through it a few more times, and give me one tiny backup cue I can actually use under pressure (like silently saying "steady")?

It sounds like pressing your thumb to your ring finger didn't quite have the desired effect. Let's try something else. Can you think of a word that's very easy to say, something that's a single syllable and doesn't require any thought? Like... "ahm". Can you say that to yourself right now, without thinking about it, and see what happens?

Patient: I tried it—mumbled “ahm” under my breath, and it just made me flinch; my chest clenched and this rush of shame and that old voice came back loud, like I’d messed up something huge. How is saying a sound supposed to stop the whole thing? Can we actually slow down and run a concrete combo—like silently saying “steady” plus thumb-to-ring—step by step so I know what it’ll feel like under pressure?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sound "ahm" triggered some strong emotions. Let's break it down into smaller steps. Can we try a combination of two tiny actions: silently saying "steady" and pressing your thumb to your ring finger, right next to each other? Just say "steady" out loud, and then press your thumb to your ring finger, all in one moment. Let's try it together: "steady"... *press thumb to ring finger*. Take your time, and focus on the physical sensations of saying the word and pressing your thumb to your ring finger.

Patient: I said "steady" and pressed my thumb, and almost immediately my chest tightened and that school-shame came back—felt stupid and exposed more than anything. Maybe it steadied me for like half a beat, but mostly it just reminded me I'm the same screw-up. How is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed? Can we slow down and actually run that combo a few times—maybe silently saying it + thumb + one tiny breath—and give me one backup, invisible action that won't look like slacking if it flakes out?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the combination didn't quite work as intended. Let's try breaking it down even further. Can we start with just the breath: take one tiny breath in, and then say "steady" out loud, without thinking about it? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you exhale, press your thumb to your ring finger. Take another tiny breath in, and then say "steady" out loud, pressing your thumb to your ring finger. Let's try this a few times, and then we can add the physical action to the verbal cue. Ready to start again?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try, but I’m already jittery and my chest’s tight just thinking about it. I took a tiny breath, said “steady,” and pressed my thumb — and right away that shame hit, my hands shook and I felt frozen; honestly, how is that supposed to help when the memory keeps hijacking me? Can we slow down and run that combo like three times in a row, and give me one invisible fallback I can actually remember under pressure if it flakes (like thumb-to-ring plus silently saying “steady”)?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the combination is still triggering strong emotions. Let's take a deep breath together... in... out... and start again. This time, I want you to focus only on the physical sensations of the breath. Don't think about the shame or the thumb or anything else. Just feel the breath moving in and out of your body. As you exhale, take a tiny step to your right with your right foot. Just that small movement. Let's try it together: take a breath... *exhale*... step right. Let's do it again: take a breath... *exhale*... step right. And again: take a breath... *exhale*... step right.

Patient: I tried it — I did the breath and stepped right three times like you said, but each time my chest tightened, my hands shook, and this flush of shame hit me so hard it felt more exposing than calming. Maybe it bought me a split second, but mostly it just reminded me of screwing up and left me feeling stupid. How is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed? Can we slow down and actually run a concrete, invisible combo step-by-step (like thumb-to-ring + silently saying “steady” + one tiny breath) and rehearse it a few times so I know what it’ll feel like under pressure? And give me one backup that's completely discreet — something I can do without anyone noticing if this flakes.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the previous attempts triggered strong reactions. Let's try a different approach. Can we break it down into an even smaller sequence: first, press your thumb to your ring finger, then say "steady" silently to yourself, and then take one tiny breath in. Let's practice this sequence three times in a row, focusing only on the physical sensations. 

Press your thumb to your ring finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Press your thumb to your ring finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Press your thumb to your ring finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Now, let's add a backup cue that's very discreet and can be done quickly, without drawing attention. Can you think of a tiny, automatic gesture that you can do when you feel yourself getting caught up in the shame or self-criticism? Something that's so automatic you don't even think about it?

Patient: Okay—something I could actually do: press the pad of my thumb to the pad of my index finger — it's tiny, looks like nothing, I can do it while plating. Then silently say "steady" and take one tiny breath. But my chest's already tight just thinking about it and that shame rushes back, so... how is that supposed to help when the pass is slammed? Can we slow down and run that combo here a few times, and give me one more totally discreet fallback if this one flakes (like a silent one-word cue I can actually remember)?

It sounds like you've found a backup cue that's quick and discreet. Let's practice the combo you've found: press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger... say "steady"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Now, let's add a final backup cue that's a simple, one-word phrase you can silently repeat to yourself if the combo doesn't work. Can you think of a word that's very easy to say, something that's not related to shame or self-criticism?

Patient: Okay — maybe the word "here." Short, neutral. But my chest's already tightening just thinking about it and that shame rushes back, so how is a word supposed to stop the avalanche when the pass is slammed? Can we actually slow down and run the combo (thumb pad to index pad + silently say "here" + one tiny breath) a few times now, and give me one more totally invisible fallback if this flakes?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting frustrated with the process. Let's take a deep breath together... in... out... and try the combo one more time. Focus on the physical sensations of pressing the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger, and then saying "here" silently to yourself, without thinking about it. Take one tiny breath.

Press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger... say "here"... *take a tiny breath*. 

Press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger... say "here"... *take a tiny breath*. 

As we've practiced this combo, I want you to know that it's not about stopping the shame or self-criticism entirely, but about creating a small pause between the sensations that might help you get back to the task at hand. What if, instead of trying to control the shame, we focus on what you can do in the moment to take a small step forward?

Patient: Okay, I hear you, but I'm still jittery and my chest's tight just imagining this in the middle of service — how is thumb-pad + “here” + one tiny breath actually going to stop that rush when the pass is slammed? It might buy me a half-second, maybe, but that half-second gets filled with that old voice telling me I’m useless and then I spiral. Can we slow down and run the exact sequence here a few more times so I can picture it under pressure—tell me the exact order, how long to hold each piece, and where to put my attention?

1. Press the pad of your thumb to the pad of your index finger: 1... 2... 3... 4... hold for 0.2 seconds... 5... (hold for 0.2 seconds)
2. Say "here" silently to yourself: 6... (hold for 0.5 seconds)
	* Wait for 0.25 seconds after saying "here"
3. Take one tiny breath: 7... 8... (hold for 0.5 seconds)

As soon as you say "here", focus on your feet touching the floor.

For a backup fallback, how about subtly rubbing your index finger against the side of your palm while plating? It's a small, automatic action that doesn't draw attention to yourself.

As for what to say to yourself afterward, try: "I'm here." Repeat it to yourself as soon as you feel yourself starting to spiral.

Patient: Okay — that slowed version landed a tiny bit, but as soon as I hit “here” that shame voice screamed and my chest clenched; I felt exposed and distracted. Honestly, how is rubbing my palm or feeling my feet supposed to drown out the “you’re useless” voice that hits before I can finish the sequence? Can we run it again, extra slow with counting so I can rehearse it in my head, and give me one more totally invisible fallback I can do while plating plus the exact short line to say to myself afterward so I don’t just spiral and beat myself up if I forget?
