Patient: I'm an elderly schoolteacher and since a health scare I've been overwhelmed by sadness and a loss of motivation that's even affecting my relationship. My head's a fortune-telling machine — I can already see it: I definitely spiral back into illness, my partner gets fed up, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone and forgotten. I try to stay optimistic but I get stuck on those worst-case stories and can't seem to stop.

Therapist: Those worst-case stories can be really hard to shake off. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from stopping the "fortune-telling machine" from running? What's the first thought that comes up when you imagine the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I think what holds me back is that the health scare felt like proof — the machine says, "See? this can happen," so I can't trust anything nicer. The very first thought is always, "I'll get sick again, they'll get tired of me, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone," and I can already hear the whole ugly chain like it's a movie. People tell me other things could happen, but honestly that feels unrealistic — why would they stick around for more of this?

Therapist: It sounds like those worst-case thoughts have become quite vivid for you. The idea that the health scare was proof of your vulnerability makes sense. Can you connect with the part of you that's saying "I'll get sick again, they'll get tired of me..."? Is there anything about that voice that resonates with you, even if it's not necessarily true?

Patient: Yeah—I can. That voice sounds tired but sure, like a practical old friend who's convinced it's just stating facts, not fears. It feels protective—better to warn me so I won't be blindsided—so even when I try to imagine better endings, they just seem unrealistic and my head goes straight back to the whole awful chain.

Therapist: That practical voice is like a familiar companion, even if it's one that's warning you of potential dangers. It's like it's trying to keep you safe. Would it be possible for you to take a tiny step back from that voice, just for a moment, and acknowledge its role in looking out for you?

Patient: I think I could try to take a tiny step back, but it's like asking an old friend who insists on shouting warnings to hush — it feels necessary. When I try, I notice the voice saying, "you're fragile, they'll get tired," and I can't help but replay the whole disaster movie in my head, so stepping back feels almost impossible. Maybe I can notice it for a second, but honestly I already see the worst ending — their patience runs out and I'm alone — so I don't trust that noticing will change anything.

Therapist: It feels like the old friend is very persistent. Your worst-case scenario is already playing out in your mind, so noticing the voice might feel like it's too little, too late. Can you look at that scenario again, not to change it, but to see it as a reflection of your own mind's way of trying to prepare you for potential dangers? What might be the purpose of that worst-case scenario for you?

Patient: When I look at it that way, I can see the scenario acting like a guard — it wants me to be ready so I'm not blindsided again. It feels like it's trying to protect me from more hurt by warning me to expect the worst, even though that protection comes at the cost of making me miserable now. But honestly, thinking about nicer outcomes just feels like pretending — the voice says that's dangerous, so I can't take it seriously.

Therapist: That's a really insightful observation. The guard-like behavior of the voice is a way of trying to prepare you, but at a high cost. It's like the voice is saying, "I'd rather you be safe, even if it means you're miserable, than be caught off guard." Would you be willing to consider the possibility that the guard is, in part, protecting you from feeling more vulnerable and uncertain, and that taking care of yourself might actually make you feel more secure?

Patient: I can see that, at least in theory — maybe the guard is trying to stop me from feeling raw and exposed. But the instant I think about actually taking care of myself, the machine pipes up: I'll try, they’ll get fed up, we’ll argue, they’ll leave, and I’ll end up worse off. I want to believe taking care would help, but I can't shake that voice saying it's all pointless.

Therapist: It sounds like the guard is really tied up with the worst-case scenario. Can you explore what happens when you think about taking care of yourself, and you start to imagine it's possible that it might actually work? What's the first thing that pops up in your mind when you start to consider that possibility?

Patient: When I actually imagine taking care of myself, the first thing that pops up is this tiny hopeful spark — like maybe I'll get a bit better and find some motivation again. But the machine immediately hijacks it: I'll do well for a while, they'll get bored of supporting me, small arguments blow up, they leave, and I'm sicker and lonelier than before. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't take that hopeful feeling seriously; it just feels like the start of another setup for hurt.

Therapist: It's like the hopeful spark is quickly extinguished by the same old fears. Can you look at that initial spark again, and try to acknowledge it without judgment – just notice it's there, even if it gets hijacked by the negative thoughts? Maybe, just for a moment, imagine you're not judging that spark, and you're just allowing it to exist.

Patient: Okay — I can see that tiny hopeful spark, like a little light that says maybe I could feel better. But the moment I let it be, the fortune-telling machine screams its script: I do okay for a bit, they get tired, we fight, they leave, and I'm worse off. I can try to notice the spark without judging it, but it's really hard not to replay the whole disaster — can we slow down? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like the machine is really loud and dominating your experience right now. Let's take a deep breath together and slow things down. Can you just focus on the tiny spark of hope, and imagine it's the only thing you notice right now? No thoughts, no worries, just that little spark. Just be with it, for a very small moment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. For a few seconds I can actually feel a tiny warm glow — like remembering a class where everything went right — but the fortune-telling machine immediately hijacks it: I see myself getting sick again, my partner exhausted, small fights that blow up, them leaving, the school thinking I'm unreliable, and me alone and forgotten. I don't want to spiral but it's like the movie starts playing and I can't stop it — can we slow down? I'm already feeling pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like the machine is taking over again. Let's pause the movie, just for a moment. Can you bring your attention back to the warm glow, and notice that it's still there, even if the worst-case thoughts are playing out in your mind? Allow the warmth of that glow to be present, without judgment or evaluation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing the glow supposed to help when my fortune-telling machine immediately starts narrating disasters? I can hold that little warm memory for a beat, like a lesson that went well, but then the movie kicks in: I get sick again, they get fed up, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone. I don't want to spiral—can we slow down? I'm already feeling pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like the machine is too powerful. Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the warm glow or the worst-case thoughts, can you notice the sensation of your body, right now, in this moment? Where do you feel tension or discomfort? Is it in your shoulders, your stomach, or somewhere else?

Patient: I notice a tightness in my chest and shoulders, a knotted feeling in my stomach, and my hands feel a bit clammy. I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help—when I tune in, the fortune-telling machine immediately says that tightness means I'm getting worse, they'll get fed up, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone. I can try to stay with the sensations, but I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is already jumping to conclusions. Let's take another step back. Can you simply acknowledge the physical sensations in your body, without trying to interpret them or react to them? Just notice the tightness in your chest and shoulders, the knotted feeling in your stomach, and the clamminess of your hands. Say to yourself, "I notice these sensations. They're here." No judgment, no interpretation, just acknowledgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? But okay: I notice these sensations. They're here. My chest and shoulders are tight, my stomach's knotted, my hands are clammy, and of course my head's already saying that means I'll get sicker, they'll get fed up, we'll fight, and I'll end up alone. Can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like the machine is already jumping in. Let's pause the whole narrative. Can you take one small, tiny breath, and simply focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Just the sensation of the breath, without trying to control it or change it, just notice it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just breathing supposed to stop the movie in my head? Okay, I’ll try: I take a small breath in and out, I feel it in my chest and shoulders for a second and it loosens them a bit. But the fortune-telling machine is already back: that calm won't last, I'll get sick again, they'll get tired, little fights blow up, they leave, the school thinks I'm unreliable, and I'm left alone—I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the machine is relentless. Let's try to find a small anchor in the present moment. Can you touch a part of your body, like your hand, your foot, or your face? Just notice the sensation of touching that part of your body, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. I put my hand on my knee and it's warm, a little shaky, the skin a bit thin like an old teacher's hands. I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Of course the fortune-telling machine pipes up: that tremor means I'm getting worse, they'll get fed up, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone—and I'm already feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is still going. Let's try to ground yourself in the physical sensation of your hand on your knee. Can you, for just a tiny moment, let go of the thought that the tremor means you're getting worse? Just allow the sensation of your hand on your knee to be, without trying to label it or interpret it?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to let the tremor just be without labeling it, but I’m not sure I follow how that helps. The moment I do, the machine screams that the tremor proves I’m getting worse, they’ll get fed up, we’ll fight, they’ll leave, and I’ll be alone, and my mind just jumps all over the place. My chest’s tight and I’m really distracted and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the machine is taking over. Let's try to acknowledge your overwhelm, rather than trying to stop it. Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now"? Not trying to analyze it, not trying to fix it, just acknowledging the feeling?

Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now — my chest's tight, my thoughts are all over the place, and the fortune-telling machine's already yelling that I'll get sicker, they'll get fed up, we fight, and I'll be left alone. I can't seem to slow it down; can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is being very loud. Let's try to create some space between yourself and the thoughts. Can you imagine a small, tiny bubble around you, and say to yourself, "I'm just observing these thoughts, but they don't have to be true right now"?

Patient: Okay—I can try to picture a tiny bubble around me and say, "I'm just observing these thoughts, but they don't have to be true right now." I can even say it out loud in my head, but the fortune-telling machine immediately laughs and plays the movie: I'll get sick again, they'll get tired, we fight, they leave, and I'm left alone — so saying that feels like pretending. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted and the whole thing feels impossible to slow down right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the bubble doesn't quite hold. Let's try to focus on your breath again. Can you bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and simply notice the sensation of your hand on your knee, feeling warm and a bit shaky?

Patient: I'll try—I'm noticing the breath in and out and my hand on my knee is warm and a little shaky, but I'm not sure I follow how this actually helps. My mind keeps jumping all over; the fortune-telling machine's already yelling that the calm won't last—I'll get sicker, they'll get tired, we fight, they leave—and I'm back to feeling overwhelmed and really distracted. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the calm is fleeting. Let's try to ground yourself in the present moment, without trying to control the thoughts or emotions. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — my feet are on the floor, I can feel the pressure at my heels and a little ache like old bones settling, and the air's cool on my face. But of course the fortune-telling machine's already whispering that the ache means I'm getting worse, I'll lose energy, they'll get fed up, we fight, and they'll leave. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted — can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is whispering again. Let's try to acknowledge the sensation of your feet on the floor, without judgment. Can you simply notice the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the pressure at your heels, and the ache in your bones, without thinking about what they might mean or what's happening next?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor, the pressure at my heels, that familiar ache in my bones like after a long day of grading. I'm not sure I follow how that helps — my fortune-telling machine immediately says that ache means I'm declining, I’ll lose energy, they’ll get fed up, small fights blow up, they leave, and I’m left alone and forgotten. I'm really anxious and distracted right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is still whispering. Let's try to connect with the feeling of your body being present on the floor. Can you notice the sensation of your body being supported by the floor, without thinking about what the machine is saying?

Patient: Okay—I can feel my body pressed into the floor, the weight settling and the ground holding me. But I don't know how that's supposed to help—the minute I feel supported the machine's screaming, "this won't last, you'll get worse, they'll get fed up, we'll fight, they'll leave," and my stomach flips so I can't focus. I'm really anxious and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is being very loud. Can you simply notice the sensation of your stomach flipping, without judgment or reaction? Notice the physical sensation of it, the way it's moving, the sensation of it in your body.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when I notice it I feel a fluttering, a tight knot that creeps up into my chest, breaths get shallow and my stomach feels like it's turning over. Of course the fortune-telling machine yells that this proves I'm getting worse, they'll get fed up, we'll have a fight, they'll leave, and I'll be alone, so I can't just sit with the feeling. I'm really anxious and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the machine is hijacking the feeling. Let's try to connect with the sensation of the breath, rather than the thoughts that are coming up. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and allow the breath to become the anchor, rather than the thoughts?

Patient: I'll try, but I'm not sure I follow—how is the breath supposed to stop the movie in my head? I notice it moving in and out, my chest rising and falling, and for a beat the tightness eases. Then the fortune-telling machine yells that the calm won't last—that I'll get sicker, they'll get tired, we'll fight, they'll leave—and I feel panicky and can't hold the breath as an anchor. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is still loud. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your body releasing the breath. Can you notice the sensation of the breath leaving your body, the feeling of relaxation that comes with it, and the slight pause before the next breath is needed?

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow—how is watching the breath supposed to stop the movie in my head? I do notice the breath leaving, a little loosening, and a small pause, and for a blink my chest eases, but the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that it won't last: I'll get sick again, they'll get tired, we'll fight, they'll leave, and I end up alone. I'm feeling panicky and really distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the machine is relentless. Let's try to create a tiny bit of space between yourself and the thoughts. Can you say to yourself, "I am here, in this moment, with my feet on the floor"? No thinking, no labeling, just a simple acknowledgement of the present moment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that supposed to change anything? Okay: "I am here, in this moment, with my feet on the floor." For a beat I feel the pressure under my heels and it steadies me, but the fortune-telling machine is already yelling that this won't last—that I'll get sicker, they'll get tired, we'll fight, they'll leave. I'm jittery and distracted and it's really hard to hold on—can we slow down?

Therapist: The machine is still shouting. Let's try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the floor, without getting caught up in the thoughts. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the pressure of your weight, the feeling of your feet being grounded, without adding any thoughts or interpretations?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor, the pressure under my heels, a little steadiness. But the fortune-telling machine's already shouting that won't last — I'll get sicker, they'll get tired of supporting me, small fights blow up, they'll leave, and I'll be left alone and forgotten. I'm jittery and really distracted right now; can we slow down?
