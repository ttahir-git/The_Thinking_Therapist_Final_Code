Patient: Well, lately I've been feeling really stuck — like my whole sense of self is just "social worker" and I don't know what matters to me beyond that. The financial stress and this adjustment disorder make everything feel directionless, and honestly I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried talking before, how is that supposed to change anything? I get distracted all the time and try things that don't work, so I don't even know where to start.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to admit feeling stuck and skeptical about seeking help. It sounds like you're carrying a sense of responsibility for finding a sense of direction, which can be really overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you try something new, and it doesn't lead to the sense of satisfaction or fulfillment you're hoping for?

Patient: Usually I go in hopeful—sign up for a class, pick up a hobby, or try one of those breathing exercises—but it fizzles fast; I get distracted, the bills keep nagging, and nothing really sticks or feels meaningful. I wind up feeling guilty, like I'm just patching things instead of actually changing anything. I've tried those things before, so seriously, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're constantly trying to put Band-Aids on your feelings, but not really addressing the underlying sense of disconnection. Can you notice what happens to the feeling of hope when you do get distracted by the nagging bills or other responsibilities? Does it feel like a part of you shrinks away, or does it just linger in the background?

Patient: It feels like a part of me just shrinks away — the hope gets quieter and I tuck it behind the next obligation, then guilt rushes in. Even when I notice that, nothing really changes because the bills are still there, so how is that supposed to help? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed just talking about it.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the hope gets buried under the weight of responsibilities, and the guilt creeps in as a way of trying to silence the hope. Would you be willing to try something with me that's just for a moment, to see if we can bring the quiet, shrinking hope back into awareness, without judgment or pressure to do anything about it?

Patient: Fine, I’ll try it, but honestly I’m doubtful it’ll change much — how is that supposed to help? Okay, for a moment I’ll try to notice that small hope: it’s like a little warmth tucked behind the bills and obligations, hard to keep hold of. I’m already feeling a bit uneasy about this, like I’ll get distracted, but I’ll stay with it for now.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That warmth is small, but it's there. Can you take a tiny step to acknowledge and hold onto that warmth, even if it feels fragile, without trying to do anything about it just yet? Maybe just allow it to be, and see if it changes when you're in this small, quiet space with it?

Patient: Okay, I can hold it for a second — it's like a tiny ember under a stack of bills, warm but barely there. My mind's already skittering to overdue notices and I feel guilty for pausing, so I'm doubtful — how's just noticing that ember supposed to help when the bills are still there?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The bills are still there, and it's natural to feel that sense of obligation. Can you notice what happens to the guilt when you're holding onto that small ember, and the thoughts about the bills come up? Does the guilt feel like it's trying to squish the ember, or does it coexist with it?

Patient: Mostly it feels like the guilt tries to squish it — I shove the warmth aside and tell myself I don't deserve it until the bills are handled. Sometimes it coexists, with the ember flickering while the guilt talks louder. But seriously, how is noticing that supposed to help when nothing about the bills or my situation has changed? I'm already getting distracted thinking of all the things I should be doing.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the guilt is trying to push the warmth away, and it's getting harder to hold onto as the thoughts about what needs to be done keep coming up. Can you imagine, for just this moment, that it's okay to allow the warmth to be present, even if the bills are still there, and that you're not responsible for making them go away right now?

Patient: I can imagine it, but it feels like a guilty little luxury — like I'm slacking off when there are real things to do. When I let the warmth be, it's a tiny relief, but the guilt and the to-do list rush back and I start thinking about the mortgage and client files. Seriously, how is that supposed to help when the bills don't change? I'm already getting uneasy and distracted, like maybe we should be doing something more practical.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The warmth is a tiny respite, but it's easily pushed aside by the sense of responsibility and urgency. Would you be willing to take another small step, to see what happens if you don't try to push the warmth away just yet? Instead, just notice what it feels like to exist, without trying to change it or do anything about it?

Patient: Okay... I’ll try to keep it a bit longer. When I just let it sit, the warmth is there — like a small, steady ember — and for a second the guilt quiets, but the mortgage and client files are still shouting in my head. Still, how is that supposed to help when the bills don't budge? I'm feeling restless already, so if this is supposed to lead anywhere, tell me what concrete next step you're thinking, because I get distracted fast.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The warmth is still there, steady and present. Can you take one more tiny step, to see what happens when you don't try to do anything about the bills or the restlessness? What if, instead, you simply acknowledge that the warmth is still here, and that it's okay to be with it, even if nothing else changes?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try to keep it a bit longer — the warmth is still there, like a small ember, and for a moment the guilt quiets. But then the to-do list barges back — mortgage, client notes — and I'm thinking, okay, that feels nice but how does sitting with a warm feeling pay the bills? I'm getting restless and distracted; if we're going to keep doing this, what's a concrete next step I can actually try that won't just fizzle out?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The warmth is still present, but the restlessness is coming back. Can you take a very small step towards doing something that doesn't involve trying to make the bills pay, but rather towards creating space for that warmth to stay? For example, would you be willing to commit to taking a very short break from the to-do list, just 30 seconds, to simply sit with the warmth and acknowledge its presence again?

Patient: Alright, fine — I’ll try the thirty seconds. I’ll sit with that little ember and not jump to mortgage or client notes, though honestly I’m skeptical — how is that supposed to help with the bills? My mind’s already nudging me to get up, so if this actually helps even a bit, what’s the next concrete step after the thirty seconds so I don’t just fizzle out again?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Taking that small break, even if just for 30 seconds, might be enough to give you some space to come back to. When you're ready, we can take it from there. For now, let's just focus on getting through the 30 seconds. When you feel the urge to get up, can you notice what it feels like to slow down, just a tiny bit, before you act on it?

Patient: Okay — when I feel the urge to get up, there's this tightness in my chest and my legs want to move, like my body's on autopilot to do something. I can slow down a tiny bit and my breath softens a fraction, but my head immediately floods with mortgage and client reminders, so I'm skeptical—how is that supposed to help beyond making me a little calmer for thirty seconds? If this actually helps even a bit, what's a concrete, practical next step I can do after the thirty seconds so I don't just fizzle out and dive back into the to-do list?

Therapist Answer:
The urge to get up is still strong, and the reminders come flooding back. Would you be willing to try something small to hold onto the softness in your breath, and the slight sense of calm, for just a tiny bit longer? After the 30 seconds, can you commit to doing one tiny physical act that doesn't involve the to-do list, like getting up and pouring yourself a glass of water, or taking a deep breath outside, or simply putting down your paper and not picking it up again for a little while?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to hold the breath a bit longer and do the 30 seconds. I have to say, though, a shameful memory just slammed into me and I feel small and prickly, like I should be doing something else right now. After the 30 seconds I’ll get up and pour a glass of water, but honestly—how is that supposed to help with the mortgage or this nagging failure feeling? If that shame flares while I'm pouring the water, what do you want me to do then?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame has surfaced, and it's making you feel small and prickly. When that happens, would you be willing to acknowledge it as just that – a thought, a feeling, a label – without trying to push it away or make sense of it right now? As you pour the water, I want you to focus on the sensation of the liquid flowing, the sound of the glass clinking, and the feeling of the water against your skin. Let the shame just be present, without judgment, as you're doing this small, everyday action.

Patient: Okay—I poured the water and I noticed the clink, the cool glass, the little rush of the liquid, but the shame was there too, like a bitter aftertaste that won't go away. I tried to name it and let it be, but my mind kept tugging back to the mortgage and that old failure and I felt small and prickly the whole time. How is that supposed to help with the bills or the stuck feeling? If the shame flares while I'm doing something practical, do I just stand there labeling it, or what concrete thing can I actually do next that won't fizzle out when I sit back down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is still present, and the practical act of pouring water wasn't enough to fully diffuse it. Can you try to notice what happens when you're labeling the shame, and the thought "I'm a failure" shows up? Does the shame seem to intensify, or does it feel like it's getting a bit more manageable? For now, after you've labeled the shame, would you be willing to take a tiny step towards doing something that brings you a small sense of pleasure or comfort, like savoring the taste of the water, or feeling the coolness of the glass against your skin?

Patient: When I label the thought "I'm a failure," it actually feels louder at first — like shining a spotlight on something that wants to hide. Sometimes the label settles it a bit, but right now my chest's tight, I'm jittery, and my mind keeps skittering back to the mortgage. I did try to savor the water — felt the cool glass and took a sip — but the shame rode right under it and I got distracted. So seriously, how is that supposed to help? If this doesn't stick when my anxiety spikes, what's a concrete next step I can do that won't just fizzle out?

Therapist Answer:
The labeling seems to have been helpful in acknowledging the shame, but it's still present, and anxiety is spiking again. Would you be willing to try something even smaller, to see if we can create a tiny pocket of stability in the midst of the anxiety? Instead of trying to do something big or ambitious, can you focus on bringing your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the chair beneath you? Sometimes, simply noticing where you are in the moment can be a small anchor.

Patient: Alright, I’ll try — my feet on the floor, the chair under me. It does help a tiny bit, like the jitteriness eases a notch and the tightness in my chest loosens for a second, but my head's still sprinting to the mortgage and that old failure. Seriously, how is grounding my feet supposed to help with the bills or stop me from spiraling back — what's a concrete next step after this that might actually stick when I'm feeling anxious?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing your feet on the ground was helpful in stabilizing your body, if not your mind. For a concrete next step, would you be willing to try a very small, everyday action that's already part of your daily routine, but with a twist? For example, can you take one small step towards doing something you've been putting off, but that doesn't have to be related to the bills or your failure? Maybe it's as simple as picking up a pen or looking at a nearby picture? Sometimes, taking a tiny action towards something you can control can help build momentum and create a sense of progress.

Patient: Alright—fine, I’ll do something tiny: I’ll pick up that pen on the table and write one short sentence, just to see if it helps. But seriously, how is scribbling a line supposed to help with the mortgage or this hollow feeling? The shame's already prickling at me and my attention’s jumping to the bills, so if the shame flares while I’m writing, what do you want me to do—keep writing, label it, or stop?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're already taking a tiny step towards writing, and that's a great start. When you pick up the pen and start writing, I want you to focus on the sensation of the pen moving across the paper, the sound of the scratch, and the feel of the pen gliding across the surface. If the shame starts to flare, can you try to acknowledge it as just a thought, without judgment, and simply continue writing without stopping? Don't worry about what the sentence says, just focus on the physical act of writing itself.

Patient: I picked up the pen — felt the scratch, the weight in my hand, and I forced out one sentence: "I don't know what matters besides work." My hand shook a bit and the shame shot up — the "I'm a failure" thought got louder when I named it, not quieter. So honestly, if that shame spikes while I'm writing, do you want me to just keep writing or stop and name it? How is that supposed to help when naming it seems to spotlight it?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame was still present, and naming it didn't make it quieter. When you felt the shame spike, instead of stopping, can you try to acknowledge it as a physical sensation, like a sensation in your body, rather than a thought? Instead of trying to label it or push it away, can you simply notice where it is in your body, and allow it to exist without judgment, while continuing to write?

Patient: I tried it — I noticed the shame as a hot, tight knot in my chest and a hollow sinking in my gut while my hand kept writing. It kind of softens a notch if I just feel it, but my hands still tremble and my head's sprinting to the mortgage, so the relief is tiny. Seriously, how is that supposed to help with the bills or stop the spiraling when it flares? If it spikes while I'm writing, do I just keep writing and sit with the tightness, or what concrete next step do you want me to try that might actually stick when I'm this anxious?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame's still present, but you were able to acknowledge it as a physical sensation, and that helped it soften a bit. When the anxiety spikes, instead of trying to keep writing, can you try to take a tiny pause, just a deep breath, before continuing? This small pause can help you gather yourself and come back to the writing. And as you breathe, I want you to ask yourself, "What would happen if I allowed myself to be in this moment, with this shame and this anxiety, without trying to push it away or do anything about it?"

Patient: When I ask that, I actually do breathe and the tight knot eases a hair — there’s a tiny space where the shame isn’t screaming — but then the failure-thought crashes back and I feel guilty for even stopping. I get that it helps "in the moment" a bit, but seriously, how is one breath supposed to help pay the mortgage or stop me from spiraling; what concrete next step should I take right after the breath that might actually stick when I’m this anxious?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The small pause and deep breath helped to create a tiny space for the shame to ease, but the failure thought is still present. After you breathe, instead of trying to push the thought away or label it, can you try to make a tiny commitment to yourself, something as simple as "I will sit with this feeling for 5 more seconds" or "I will write one more sentence"? This tiny commitment can help you build a sense of agency and create a sense of momentum.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it. I’ll sit with the feeling for five more seconds, take a breath if the shame spikes, and then write one more sentence. But I’m skeptical — how is that supposed to help with the mortgage or this stuck feeling in any concrete way?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Making a tiny commitment can be a powerful act of self-compassion. As you sit with the feeling for the next 5 seconds, and write one more sentence, I want you to pay attention to what happens when you're done. What do you notice about your body? Your mind? Your sense of self? Sometimes, simply noticing what's present after taking small actions can be a powerful way to build momentum and create a sense of progress, even if it's not directly related to the bills or the stuck feeling.

Patient: I did it — sat the five seconds, breathed when the shame hit, and wrote one more sentence: "I feel lost outside my work." My chest loosened a tiny bit and my hands steadied, and for a moment I noticed a sliver of something beyond being a social worker. But my head's still loud with mortgage worries and that failure voice, the relief was tiny, and I'm jittery — so honestly, what's a concrete next step I can do now that might actually stick when I'm this anxious and distracted?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You took a tiny step towards noticing a glimmer of something beyond your current identity as a social worker. That's a small but important breakthrough. As you are now, what's one tiny physical action you can take that doesn't involve the bills or your work, but rather feels connected to your current experience? For example, can you take a sip of water, or feel the weight of your feet on the ground, or simply look around the room? This small, concrete action can help you ground yourself in the present moment and create a sense of connection to your own body and experience.

Patient: Alright — I’ll take a slow sip of water and really notice the coolness and the clink of the glass. My hands are shaking, my chest is tight and that shame’s prickling under it all, and my head’s already racing back to the mortgage — so seriously, how is that supposed to help beyond a tiny pause, and if it doesn’t stick when I’m this anxious, what concrete next step do you want me to try?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the coolness of the water and the sound of the glass can be a tiny anchor in the midst of anxiety. After you take the sip, instead of trying to push the shame or the racing thoughts away, can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground again? Remember, it's not about getting rid of the anxiety, but about finding a small sense of stability in the midst of it. As you do this, I want you to ask yourself, "What would happen if I took one small step towards something that feels meaningful to me, even if it's just a tiny step?"

Patient: Maybe if I actually took one tiny step — like writing down three small things that used to matter to me (even one sentence each) and giving myself five minutes to do it — I might feel a little flicker of choice instead of just reacting to bills. My chest's tight and the shame's prickling, so I'm already thinking, how's that supposed to help pay the mortgage or quiet that failure voice? I'll try the three-item list now, but if it just fizzles like everything else, what concrete next step should I take so I don't just bail and dive back into the to-do list?

Therapist Answer:
That's a great idea to take small steps towards reconnecting with what matters to you. Writing down three small things that used to matter to you can be a powerful way to tap into your values and sense of purpose. As you start writing, I want you to focus on the physical act of writing itself, the sensation of the pen moving across the paper, the sound of the words flowing. Don't worry too much about the words themselves, just pay attention to the process of creating something, even if it's just for a few minutes. If you find your mind starts to wander or the shame spikes, can you try to acknowledge it and come back to the writing without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I wrote three things: 1) tending a small herb garden, 2) singing in a community group, 3) mentoring a younger colleague. I felt the pen scrape the paper, my hand trembled a bit, and the shame and mortgage thoughts kept barging in the whole time. Seriously — how is listing this supposed to help pay the bills or quiet that failure voice? If this is supposed to lead somewhere, what's one concrete next step you want me to commit to so it actually sticks (like scheduling five minutes tomorrow to do one tiny thing), because I’m worried I’ll just fizzle out.

Therapist Answer:
Writing down those three things can be a powerful way to reconnect with your values and sense of purpose. As you look at the list, I want you to notice what's different about this experience compared to when you're staring at the bills or the to-do list. Can you see how the act of writing, even with all the distractions and discomfort, still requires effort and attention? That's a small but important distinction. For tomorrow, I want you to commit to doing one of those things on the list for just 5 minutes, not because it will pay the mortgage or solve the problem, but because it's a small act of self-care and self-compassion that can help you feel more grounded and connected to yourself. Would you be willing to commit to that?

Patient: Alright—I’ll give it a shot. I’ll try the herb garden for five minutes tomorrow since it feels doable and not work-related, but honestly I’m skeptical—how is fiddling with plants supposed to help pay the mortgage or quiet that failure voice? I’m already anxious I’ll forget or bail, so can we make a concrete plan to help it stick—like set a specific time, pair it with a cup of tea, or have you hold me accountable next session?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Fiddling with plants might not be a solution to your financial or self-doubt problems, but it can be a small act of self-care and a way to create some space for yourself. As for making a concrete plan to help it stick, I can offer a small accountability for our next session. Would you be willing to commit to doing the herb gardening for 5 minutes at the same time tomorrow morning, and to share with me how it went? Sometimes having someone to report to can help build motivation and create a sense of accountability.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it. I’ll do five minutes with the herb pot tomorrow morning at 9am and pair it with my usual cup of tea, and I’ll set an alarm so I don’t forget, but I’m skeptical it’ll stick — I’ll probably bail if the anxiety spikes. If I don’t do it, can we use our next session to problem-solve a backup plan and hold me to it, because I’m already worrying I’ll fizzle out?
