--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm an older student and lately I've been stuck in this loop of really beating myself up over little failures—it's making me second-guess myself around people. I think a lot of it traces back to bullying in school, but I don't know. I guess it's making me avoid social stuff I used to enjoy.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and explore these feelings. Beating yourself up over failures can be really painful, and it's understandable that it's affecting your social interactions. Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself in this loop of self-criticism? What does that feel like in your body and emotions?

Patient: When it starts my chest gets tight and my stomach drops, like a knot that won't go away, and my thoughts just spiral—“you’re useless, you ruined it.” Then I either clam up around people or I start talking too much to cover it up. I don't know… I guess it feels like I'm shrinking, even though I hate feeling small.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That sounds incredibly uncomfortable. Your body is responding to these thoughts as if they're true, and that's causing you a lot of distress. The feeling of shrinking can be really confusing, since you mentioned you hate feeling small. Can you imagine taking a small step back from these thoughts right now, and simply noticing them without judgment - just observing them as they arise, without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: I guess I can try, but it's hard. When I try to just notice the thoughts they kind of swell up — my chest gets tight and I start planning what to say next or a joke to cover it. I don't know if I'm doing it right, and I keep wanting to move on.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like the more you try to observe the thoughts without judgment, the more they push back. That's okay - it's not about mastering a specific technique, but about exploring how your body and mind respond to these thoughts. What would happen if, instead of trying to control the thoughts, you focused on what you want to experience while you're with others - for example, connection, enjoyment, or a sense of being present?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd like to feel connected and relaxed, but as soon as I'm around people my brain jumps to "you messed up" and I either over-joke or shut down. This is getting uncomfortable—can we slow down? I'm not sure how I'd actually stay present without panicking.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is hijacked by the critical thoughts. I'm not asking you to be present without panicking, just for a tiny moment. What if, instead of trying to avoid or fight the thoughts, you simply allowed yourself to be with the discomfort of those thoughts, without judgment or reaction? Would you be willing to try sitting with the tension in your body for just a few deep breaths, without trying to change or escape?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try a few breaths, but it feels like if I do I'll just tumble into thinking about all the ways I messed up. Can you guide me through it slowly? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with just one breath. I want you to focus on your breath, feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Imagine you're blowing out any tension or discomfort with each exhale, and just observing your breath as it comes in. Can you bring your attention to your breath, and say to yourself, "I'm going to breathe in...?"

Patient: I'm going to breathe in... and breathe out. I don't know, it loosens my chest for a second but then my mind immediately jumps to all the mistakes I made. I guess can we go slower? I'm already feeling a bit panicky.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your body is responding to the increase in awareness, but that's okay. Let's slow it down even further. Instead of focusing on your breath, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you simply notice the weight of your feet, the feeling of your feet connecting with the floor, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: Okay, I can feel my feet on the floor—it's kind of steadying for a second, like a little break from the tightness. But then my brain snaps to "you messed up" and I start rehearsing what to say, and I don't know, I guess it only helps briefly. Can we slow down? I'm already worrying how I'd do this when I'm actually around people.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body and mind are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, and your brain is already preparing for the worst. I'm not looking for you to stop the thoughts completely, but rather to create some space between your thoughts and your reactions. Can you imagine, right now, a tiny gap between your thought "you messed up" and your reaction to it - like a small pause, a tiny bit of space where you could choose what to do next?

Patient: I can kind of picture that tiny gap, like a split-second where I might not blurt out something. But when I'm actually in it, I don't know... the pause never shows up and I just react. This is making me uneasy—can we talk about practical ways to make that gap longer? I guess I'm scared I won't remember any of this when I'm around people.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's not about creating a gap in the long term, but rather about creating a small gap in the immediate moment. One thing you could try is to use a physical gesture to signal to yourself that you need a moment to collect your thoughts. For example, you could make a small pause, take a sip of water, or excuse yourself to the bathroom. This can give you a tiny bit of time to collect yourself before reacting. Would you be willing to try something like that in a low-stakes situation, like with a close friend or family member?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try it with my sister or a close friend, but I'm worried it'll feel awkward and I'll blank out. Can you give me one really simple thing—something I won't have to think hard about in the moment, like a tiny physical cue? I'm already feeling a bit on edge, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Sometimes, a small, non-intrusive cue can be helpful. Let's try a very small thing. Would you be willing to take a tiny pause, just a tiny pause, and say "um" when you feel that critical thought rising up? It's just a small sound, a tiny pause, and it might give you just a little bit of space to breathe before reacting.

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying "um" sounds small enough that I might actually do it, but I'm worried it'll feel awkward and my brain will still race. Can we try it here slowly, like you cue me and I practice once or twice? I'm already feeling a bit on edge.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's start small, right here. I'd like you to take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say "um" just to yourself, and then take another breath out. That's it, just a tiny "um". Can you try that for me, just a tiny practice?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I'm taking a breath... um. I don't know, it loosens my chest for a second but my mind's already racing—I guess I still worry it'll feel awkward. Can we slow down? I'm feeling on edge.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body and mind are already on high alert, even with the tiny "um". Let's go back to the physical sensation of your feet on the ground. I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and notice if you can bring up any other sensations in your body, like tension or relaxation.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor—it's actually a little grounding for a second. But my shoulders are tight, my chest still feels knotted, and my mind keeps snapping to "you messed up." I don't know, I guess it eases for a beat but then I start panicking—can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like there's a small amount of calm that comes from focusing on your feet, but it's fleeting. Let's try to build on that small sense of calm. I'd like you to bring your attention to a small, neutral sensation in your body - something you can easily notice, like the sensation of the air on your skin or the sound of my voice.

Patient: I can feel the air on my skin and hear your voice—it kind of quiets things for a second. But then my brain snaps to "you messed up" and I start planning what to say. I don't know, I guess I'm afraid I won't remember any of this when I'm actually with people—can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the calmness is short-lived, and the critical thoughts come back. I'm not looking for you to remember everything we've talked about, but rather to start to notice that you're already practicing these skills right now, even if it's just in tiny moments. Can you take another slow breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I'm here, I'm present, I'm taking a breath"? Just that phrase, and let's see if that brings up anything.

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing in, and out — "I'm here, I'm present, I'm taking a breath." For a beat my chest loosens and I can actually hear myself, but then that "you messed up" voice sneaks back in. I don't know, I guess it helps a little, but can we slow down? I'm afraid I'll blank out and forget to do this when I'm around other people.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the phrase "I'm here, I'm present, I'm taking a breath" brings up a small sense of calm and connection to your body, but the critical thoughts still come back. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your breath, and as you exhale, I'd like you to say to yourself "okay". Just that one word, "okay". Can you try that for me, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing out — "okay." For a second my chest loosens, but then this hot shame hits and I get so frustrated with myself, like why can't I do this right. I don't know, I guess it makes me want to clam up or cover it with a joke. Can we slow down? I'm already worried I'll blank out when I'm actually with people.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the critical thoughts are getting stronger again, and you're feeling frustrated with yourself. I want you to acknowledge that feeling, rather than trying to push it away or judge it. Can you say to yourself, without judgment, "I'm feeling really frustrated with myself right now"? Just those words, and then take another breath in, and let's see what happens.

Patient: "I'm feeling really frustrated with myself right now." I don't know... saying that just lights this hot shame and I want to hide or make a joke to cover it. I guess can we slow down and stick to something practical I can actually do when I'm around people? I'm already worried I'll blank out.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the acknowledgment of your frustration has triggered another wave of shame. Let's focus on something even more immediate and concrete. Can you think of a small physical action you can take in a social situation that would help you create some space between your thoughts and reactions? For example, would it be helpful for you to take a sip of water, or to glance away for a second, or to take a deep breath before responding?

Patient: I guess a really small thing like taking a slow sip of water might work — something simple I can do without drawing attention. I don't know, even thinking about doing that makes me feel stupid and so ashamed, like I'm failing all over again. Can we slow down? I'm worried I'll just blank out when I'm actually with people.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the thought of taking a sip of water has become a source of shame, rather than a helpful tool. I want you to acknowledge that feeling of shame, rather than trying to push it away. Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling really ashamed about needing to take a sip of water"? Just those words, and let's take a deep breath together.

Patient: "I'm feeling really ashamed about needing to take a sip of water." Saying it out loud just lights this hot shame and I get so frustrated with myself, like I'm back in that awful place. I don't know, I guess I want to hide or crack a joke to cover it. Can we slow down and actually practice the sip thing once, with you coaching me through it? I'm already worrying I'll blank out.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the acknowledgment of shame has triggered another wave of negative emotions. I'd like to help you practice taking a sip of water in a way that's not about avoiding or hiding it. Let's do it in a safe space, right here. I'll guide you through it. Can you take a deep breath in, and then, on the exhale, slowly lift your glass of water to your lips, and take a tiny sip?

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing in and out. I lift the glass—take a tiny sip. It loosens my chest for a second but then this hot shame and frustration floods back and I get jumpy and distracted, like I can't do anything right. Can we slow down and try that again, but really slowly? I don't know, I guess I need you to coach me through it.

It's like the act of taking a sip of water has triggered another wave of shame and frustration. Let's slow down even further. I want you to focus on your breath, and on the sensation of the glass in your hand. I'll guide you through it, step by step. On the exhale, I want you to simply lift the glass to your lips. Don't think about taking a sip, just lift the glass. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing out and lifting the glass to my lips now. My hand's trembling, my chest is tight, and this hot shame just spikes—my mind's already racing and I feel jumpy and distracted. I don't know, I guess can we go even slower? Tell me each tiny step — when to set it down, how long to hold it — because I'm panicking a bit.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the act of lifting the glass has triggered a lot of anxiety. Let's break it down into tiny, tiny steps. On the exhale, I want you to lift the glass to your lips. Just lift the glass, don't think about taking a sip. Hold it there for a second, just a second. Can you do that for me? Hold the glass there, and don't think about anything else. Just focus on the sensation of the glass in your hand.

Patient: Okay... I'm holding the glass to my lips. My hand's trembling, my chest feels like it's caving, and this hot shame spikes — I don't know, I guess my mind just launches into all the ways I fail even though I'm only holding a glass. I'm really jumpy and distracted and it's hard to focus; can we go even slower and have you tell me each tiny step and count it, because I can't trust myself to do it alone right now?

It's like your mind is already racing and your body is reacting strongly. Let's take it down to a tiny, tiny step.

Now, look down at the glass. 3... look down at the glass. Don't think about anything else, just look at the glass.

Patient: Okay... I'm holding the glass to my lips. My hand's trembling, my chest feels like it's caving, and this hot shame just spikes — I don't know, I guess I'm panicking and my thoughts are all over the place. Can you go even slower and count each tiny step out loud for me and tell me exactly when to set it down? I'm trying, but I'm really jumpy and can't trust myself right now.

My hand's still shaking and my chest's tight and this hot shame just slammed back in — I feel jumpy and like I screwed it up even though it was just a tiny thing.

Now, on the exhale, I want you to take a tiny glance at the rim of the glass... 6... glance at the rim of the glass. And now, I want you to set the glass back down on the table... 7... set the glass back down. Can you do that for me, one tiny step at a time?

Patient: Okay... I can try, but I'm really jumpy—my hands are shaking and that hot shame's already creeping back in. Can you count each breath and cue every tiny move—like say "inhale," then "exhale, lift," then "hold," then "set down"?
