Patient: Hi, I've been carrying this heavy sadness and almost no motivation since that big family fight, and it's bleeding into my relationship and my job as a manager. My head won't stop predicting the worst — that the fight will ruin my marriage, my kids will turn away, I'll mess up at work and end up alone and penniless. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't help believing those outcomes and it's freezing me up.

Therapist: Those thoughts seem to be really unsettling for you right now. It's like you're caught up in a cycle of worst-case scenarios. Can you tell me more about what it's like when those thoughts come up for you – what's the physical or emotional experience like when your head starts predicting the worst?

Patient: Oh man, when those thoughts hit my chest gets tight and my hands go cold — my heart races and I feel this heavy tiredness like I'm moving through molasses. Then my brain starts its worst-case movie: the fight ruins my marriage, the kids stop calling, I botch something at work and get fired, and suddenly I'm alone and broke — I see the whole collapse so clearly it feels inevitable. I know that sounds dramatic, but I get totally hooked on those scenes and any softer outcome just feels impossible and kind of silly to even consider.

Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts can be really visceral for you. The physical sensations you described – the tightness in your chest, the coldness in your hands, and the heavy tiredness – they feel really real and immediate. It's like your body is responding to those thoughts as if they were actual events already happening. Can you tell me, what's the hardest part about being stuck in this "worst-case scenario" movie – is it the feeling of helplessness, the fear of those outcomes, or something else?

Patient: Honestly, the hardest part is feeling powerless—like the future's already decided and there's nothing I can do to stop the collapse. That certainty just drains my motivation; at work I procrastinate, at home I avoid my spouse because I keep picturing the fight ruining everything and my PTSD makes those images unbearably vivid. And if someone suggests it could turn out okay, I just wave it off—seems naive, like pretending the dam won't burst, and that just makes me more frustrated and exhausted.

Therapist: Feeling powerless in the face of those predictions is a really tough spot to be in. It sounds like that sense of inevitability is suffocating your motivation and interactions with others. It's like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, and that waiting is paralyzing. What would it take for you to start feeling like you're not completely at the mercy of those thoughts, like there's a glimmer of hope or agency that you can tap into?

Patient: I don't really see anything less than iron-clad proof stopping the collapse — like my spouse signing a promise, the kids calling every day forever, and my boss guaranteeing my job in writing — otherwise my brain just replays the catastrophe. Anybody saying "it might be okay" sounds naive; those ideas evaporate the minute something small goes wrong. I'm exhausted by hoping for a miracle, but I'm desperate to know if there's anything realistic I could actually do.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a more tangible way to prevent the worst-case scenario, a concrete plan to undo the damage. But the reality is that life is inherently uncertain, and no amount of guarantees can eliminate the possibility of unexpected twists. Would it be helpful for you to focus on what you can control right now, in this moment, rather than trying to control the entire future?

Patient: I want that to help — I really do — but the minute I try to focus on what I can control my head shoots straight to the disaster movie and I'm back at the dam about to burst. It makes me feel ridiculous and exhausted, like 'small steps' is some naive phrase, but... maybe I could try one tiny thing, though I'm not convinced it'll stop the collapse.

Therapist: It's like your brain is caught in a cycle of anticipation, and no matter what you do, it's always one step ahead, waiting to pounce on the next potential disaster. Taking small steps might feel like a tiny, futile gesture against the inevitable, but what if we experimented with taking that tiny step anyway – not to change the outcome, but simply to see what happens? Would you be willing to try doing one small, concrete thing, like making a phone call to your spouse or writing down a small goal for the day, just to break the pattern of catastrophic thinking?

Patient: I guess I could try one tiny thing, like sending a short text to my spouse, but my head's already filming the sequel — they misread it, we explode, the kids take sides, I start screwing up at work from the stress, and suddenly I'm exactly where I fear. Still, okay — I'll try to send a brief message today, though I'm sure I'll be panicking the whole time and it'll feel like stepping off a cliff.

Therapist: It sounds like even the smallest action has a giant, looming shadow over it, making it feel like a risk that could lead to all the worst-case scenarios you've been predicting. Would you be willing to take a step back from that "what-ifs" script, and simply focus on the physical act of sending the text itself, without judgment or expectation of a specific outcome – just the sensation of picking up your phone, typing, and hitting send?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try to focus on the phone itself: pick it up, type a short sentence, and hit send. My chest’s already tight and I can feel my hands trembling because I’m sure they’ll misread it and everything will spiral, but I’ll still try to notice each movement even if I don’t expect it to change the outcome.

Therapist: Noticing each physical movement can be a great way to bring some mindfulness into the situation. Let's try to take it one step further: while you're holding the phone and about to send the text, can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am holding a phone and preparing to send a message" – just a simple statement to anchor yourself in the present moment, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: Okay — I took the breath and said to myself, "I am holding a phone and preparing to send a message." It loosened my chest for a second, but then my head fired up the movie: they misread it, we explode, the kids pick sides, I mess up at work and lose everything. I'm typing with my hands shaking, convinced this will prove the collapse, but I'm going to hit send because I said I'd try.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still quite active, replaying the worst-case scenarios even as you're trying to take a small step. When you hit send, would you be willing to observe the physical sensations that come up in your body, like the shaking of your hands or the tension in your chest, without trying to identify them as "proof" of the impending disaster – just notice them as physical sensations, without judgment?

Patient: I tried to watch them — my hands are still trembling, my chest's tight, and there's this buzzy sick feeling in my stomach — and my head immediately goes, "see? proof it's all falling apart." Noticing it helps for a breath, then the catastrophe movie fires up again and I feel ridiculous and worn out. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the more you try to focus on your physical sensations, the more your brain pulls you back into the "catastrophe narrative". Sometimes, it's okay to slow down and pause the cycle. Can you take a moment to acknowledge how overwhelming this experience is for you, and then, if you're ready, we can take a break from the phone for a little while? No need to do anything or achieve anything; just take a moment to collect yourself.

Patient: Okay — I can set the phone down and try to catch my breath, but honestly I'm still convinced the worst is coming; putting it down just gives my brain time to plot the next collapse. My chest's tight and I'm drained, so can we slow down and do a short grounding exercise together? I don't want a syrupy "it'll be fine" — I need something concrete to hold onto right now.

Therapist: It's like your brain is always one step ahead, anticipating the next disaster. A grounding exercise can help bring you back to the present moment. I'd like to try a simple exercise with you: I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – just the feeling of the ground beneath you, the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body distributed on the earth. Can you bring your attention to that right now, without trying to change anything or achieve anything, just notice the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor: the heels pressing, the balls of my feet, a little warmth where they're touching; it steadies me for a beat. But of course my head immediately says, "If the ground can hold you now it won't hold your life" — the marriage will split, the kids will choose sides, I'll tank at work and be left with nothing, and it all feels inevitable. I'm trying to keep the sensation, but I'm getting pulled back into that movie — can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like your brain is still trying to hijack the grounding exercise with more catastrophic thinking. Let's try another small step. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body – feel the breath entering and leaving your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you focus on that gentle, constant movement, without trying to think about anything in particular, just observe the sensation of the breath?

Patient: Alright — I can notice the breath: cool air at my nostrils, my chest rising and falling, and it eases the tightness for a second. But my brain immediately starts the movie again — calming now just means the dam will burst later: my spouse will leave, the kids will take sides, I’ll mess up at work and be left with nothing — so it’s hard to stay with the breath. I’m feeling overwhelmed and pulled back into the worst-case story; can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the calmness of the breath is short-lived, and your brain is already trying to sabotage it with the old narrative. Let's try something else. I want you to notice the sensation of the chair or the surface you're sitting on – feel the weight of your body on it, the texture, the temperature. Can you bring your attention to that sensation, without trying to change anything or achieve anything, just notice the physical feeling of being in this moment, in this space?

Patient: Okay — I can feel the chair under me: the back pressing into my spine, the cushion giving a little, the fabric a bit cool where my hand rests, and it steadies me for a split second. Then my brain fires up: the chair won't hold, the marriage will crack, the kids will pick sides, I'll screw up at work from the stress and end up alone and broke — I see that whole collapse like a movie and get stuck. I'm feeling overwhelmed and dragged back into it already; can we slow down and try another grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of stability with the chair is short-lived, and your brain is already pulling you back into the catastrophic scenario. Let's try something even more concrete. I want you to notice the sensation of the air on your tongue – the sensation of it touching the roof of your mouth, the feeling of the air moving in and out. Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to think about anything else, just notice the feeling of the air on your tongue?

Patient: Okay — I can feel the air on my tongue, cool and faint against the roof of my mouth, and it steadies me for a second. Then my head kicks in the disaster movie: they’ll misread anything I say, we’ll have another explosion, the kids will take sides, I’ll mess up at work from the stress and end up alone and broke — I get totally hooked and can’t stay with the sensation. I’m feeling overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm with the air on your tongue is fleeting, and your brain is already pulling you back into the worst-case scenario. Let's try something even more tangible. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet pressing down on the floor – the weight, the pressure, the feeling of your feet connected to the earth. Can you bring your attention to that sensation, without trying to think about anything else, just notice the physical feeling of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet pressing down: the heels, the weight, the slight pressure under the arches, and it steadies me for a beat. Then my head jumps in saying even the ground will give way — the marriage will split, the kids will pick sides, I'll flub things at work and end up with nothing — and I get sucked into that movie. I'm feeling overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and try another grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm with your feet on the ground is still short-lived, and your brain is already trying to undermine it. Let's try to anchor yourself to the sensation of the feet on the ground, rather than the thoughts that come up. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor – not just the physical sensation, but also the sensation of the floor beneath your feet, the sensation of the air around you, the sensation of your body in this space. Can you just notice it all, without trying to think about anything else, just be with the physical sensations in this moment?

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing my feet on the floor, the weight through my heels, the air on my skin, the slight warmth of the chair; it steadies me for a second. Then my mind yells that it's temporary and the dam will still burst — the marriage will split, the kids will take sides, I'll screw up at work and be left with nothing — and I get pulled right back into that movie. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and try another simple grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm is still elusive, and your brain is already trying to undermine it. Let's try to bring your attention to your breath, specifically the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath without trying to think about anything else – just notice the sensation of the breath, the feeling of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Can you bring your attention to that sensation, without judgment, just notice it as it is?

Patient: Alright — I'll try to focus on the breath: cool air in my nostrils, my chest rising and falling, and it steadies me for a beat. But almost immediately my brain starts the movie — spouse leaving, kids taking sides, I mess up at work and end up alone and broke — and I can't stay with the breath. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and try another grounding step or something more concrete? I don't want sugarcoating.

Therapist: It's like the calmness of the breath is fleeting again, and your brain is already pulling you back into the worst-case scenario. Sometimes, a more concrete step can be helpful. I want you to notice your five senses, one by one, starting with what you can see – just notice the physical objects around you, without trying to think about anything else, just observe. Can you notice what you can see in this space?

Patient: I can see a lamp by the chair, a framed family photo on the wall, a certificate from work, a clock, and my phone on the table. The photo already starts the movie — my spouse will point to that picture and say things will never be the same, the kids will pick sides, my credibility at work will crumble because of the stress, and then I'm out on the street with nothing — I can see that whole chain like it’s happening. I'm getting hooked and feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm is still slipping away, and your brain is already getting pulled back into the catastrophic scenario. Let's try to bring your attention to your physical body, specifically your hands. I want you to notice the sensation of your hands in your lap – the weight of them, the feeling of the chair beneath them, the sensation of your fingers curled or relaxed. Can you focus on the physical feeling of your hands, without trying to think about anything else, just notice how your hands are right now?

Patient: My hands are resting in my lap — a little heavy, fingers curled, a faint tremor at the tips and the skin's a bit cool where they touch my knees. But of course my brain says that tremor proves everything's falling apart: I'll drop something important, my spouse will see I'm unstable and we'll have another blow-up, the kids will pick sides, I'll botch a meeting at work because I'm rattled and then lose everything and end up alone and broke. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't help believing it and it's making me really shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down and try another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm is still slipping away, and your brain is already trying to hijack it with more catastrophic thinking. Sometimes, we need to take a break from the thoughts and focus on something even more basic. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor – just notice the physical contact, the feeling of weight, the sensation of the floor beneath you. Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to think about anything else, just be with your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor: heels pressing, a bit of weight through the arches, the coolness of the floor under my soles. Of course my brain immediately shouts that even the ground won't hold me — the marriage will crack, the kids will choose sides, I'll start screwing up at work from the stress and be left alone and broke — and that makes my chest tight and my hands tremble. I'm getting really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and try another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm is still elusive, and your brain is already pulling you back into the worst-case scenario. Let's try to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, specifically the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath without trying to think about anything else – just notice the sensation of the breath, the feeling of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Can you simply observe the breath, without judgment, just as it is?

Patient: Okay — I'm watching the breath: in, out, chest rising and falling, and it steadies me for a second. But almost immediately my brain starts the movie again — spouse leaves, the kids pick sides, I mess up at work and end up with nothing — and I'm back to feeling panicked and drained. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and try another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the calmness of the breath is fleeting again, and your brain is already pulling you back into the catastrophic scenario. Let's try something even more basic. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils – just notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body, without trying to think about anything else. Can you focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, simply as it is, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to feel the air at my nostrils: cool coming in, warm going out, and it calms me for a breath or two. But then my brain kicks into the movie again — they’ll misread me, we’ll have another blow-up, the kids will pick sides, I’ll start screwing up at work from the stress and end up alone and broke — and I get totally hijacked. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step?

Therapist: It's like the calmness is still short-lived, and your brain is always one step ahead, hijacking the calmness. Let's try to bring your attention to the physical sensation of being in your body – not the thoughts, not the emotions, just the physical sensation of being here, in this moment. I want you to notice the sensation of your body being here, right now – the sensation of your body in space, the feeling of your body's weight, the sensation of your body's boundaries. Can you simply notice your body, as it is, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I can feel my body here — my weight in the chair, my shoulders tight, my stomach knotting — and it steadies me for a beat, but then my head starts the movie: my spouse will definitely leave, the kids will pick sides, I'll flub something at work and be out on the street. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop believing it, and hearing "it might be okay" just feels naive. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky — can we slow down and do another concrete grounding step or something practical I can hold onto right now?

Therapist: It's like the moment of calm is slipping away, and your brain is already pulling you back into the worst-case scenario. Let's try something very practical that you can hold onto right now. I want you to focus on your next breath – just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without thinking about anything else. And when you're ready, take one small action with your body, just one tiny step – can you touch your finger to the armrest of the chair, or shift your weight slightly to the left?

Patient: I took that breath and nudged my finger to the armrest — it steadied me for a beat, felt grounded. But of course my head went straight to the movie: that tiny tremor will be noticed, we'll have another blow-up, the kids will pick sides, I'll botch a meeting at work because I'm rattled and end up with nothing. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the small action you took with your finger steadied you for a moment, but your brain is already trying to undermine it with more catastrophic thinking. I want to try something even smaller, something that doesn't require any big actions. I want you to notice the sensation of your index finger touching the armrest – just the feeling of your finger making contact with the wood, the sensation of the pressure, the feeling of your finger relaxing. Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: My index finger's on the armrest — I can feel the grain of the wood, the slight pressure, and that tiny tremor at the pad of my finger. But of course my head leaps to the worst: someone notices I'm shaky, we explode again, the kids pick sides, I tank at work and end up with nothing. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the small sensation of your finger on the armrest is fleeting, and your brain is already pulling you back into the worst-case scenario. I want to try something very small, something that doesn't require any thoughts or emotions. I want you to notice the sensation of your finger lifting off the armrest – just the feeling of your finger releasing, the sensation of the air moving in, the feeling of your finger relaxing. Can you simply notice that sensation, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I can feel my finger lifting off the armrest — the tiny release, the little rush of air, the muscles letting go for a second. But my head's already screaming that someone will see I'm shaky, we'll have another blow-up, the kids will take sides, I'll flub a meeting and end up with nothing, so I can't stay with the sensation. I'm really overwhelmed and shaky; can we slow down and do something more concrete I can hold onto right now?
