Patient: Lately I've been stuck on how to manage this persistent anger and frustration after a difficult breakup—interactions with my ex just ignite this disproportionate irritability and rumination. I keep defaulting to analytical metaphors, like treating emotional triggers as signal-to-noise problems, which feels like a way to stay safely abstracted from the actual hurt. It's exhausting and erodes my confidence, but I find myself describing the pattern more than actually sitting with the feeling.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how exhausting this pattern has become. That kind of self-awareness is already a huge step. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're in the midst of that anger or frustration – what's the sensation in your body, the thoughts that are racing, and what's happening in your surroundings?

Patient: When it comes on I feel a tightness across my chest, my jaw goes rigid, and my breathing gets shallow and quick — like my autonomic system's been hijacked. Mentally I default to this editorial mode: I start cataloguing grievances, rehearsing counterarguments, and turning the experience into an analytical problem instead of naming the hurt. Around me everything narrows to triggering details — a message tone, a phrase, someone's body language — and I either clamp down or get this urgent need to control the interaction. I know that sounds like me intellectualizing again, but the physical agitation and the repetitive, accusatory inner monologue are real.

Therapist Answer:
The physical sensations you're describing – the tightness in your chest and shallow breathing – can be really uncomfortable. It sounds like your body is trying to tell you something, but your mind is getting in the way. Can you imagine sitting with that tightness in your chest, allowing it to be exactly as it is, without trying to change it or fix it – just noticing it as a physical experience?

Patient: I can imagine it, but when I try to actually sit with the tightness my brain immediately goes into analytic mode — measuring the intensity, mapping it to past triggers, calculating how long it'll last. If I force myself to slow my breath I notice a dull, burning pressure under my sternum, but I still translate it into metaphors and timelines instead of sensing its texture or rhythm. I'm trying to do what you asked, but I'm struggling—can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's okay, it's not about forcing yourself to slow down, but rather about acknowledging the effort you're making to slow down. Can you bring your attention back to the sensation of the burning pressure under your sternum, without trying to label it, measure it, or translate it into anything else? Just notice it as it is, like a sensation in your body, without judgment.

Patient: I'm trying to do that — when I bring attention there’s a dull, burning pressure under my sternum, like a tight band with a low, urgent pulse behind it. It feels hot and constrictive and makes my breath shallow, and for a brief beat I can notice it without turning it into a theory, but the urge to analyze spikes right away. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the intensity and the pull to intellectualize — can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm not asking you to slow down your thoughts, but rather to slow down your relationship with your body. Can you imagine this tight band under your sternum as a simple, unadorned presence – not as a problem to be solved, not as a story to be told, but simply as a sensation in your body, right now?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try. Sitting with it as just a raw sensation: a taut band across my chest, a steady warmth, a pulsing like an overactive metronome — that's the experience if I let it be. Even as I describe it that way, my mind immediately scaffolds explanations and hypothetical dialogues with my ex, like analysis is my refuge. I'm feeling that tug to intellectualize and it's getting a bit overwhelming — can we slow down so I can try to stay with the feeling longer?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is trying to create a narrative around this sensation, even as you're trying to stay present with it. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to analyze or make sense of this sensation, you simply let it be, without trying to label it, without trying to change it, without trying to push it away? What would it be like if you just allowed it to be, as it is, in this moment?

Patient: If I actually let it be, I imagine the band would just pulse there and maybe ease a little without me narrating it—like decoupling signal from noise. My analytic part immediately drafts a neurophysiological model saying that'll down-regulate my arousal and let the prefrontal cortex come back online, but emotionally it feels like stepping off a cliff—vulnerable and kind of terrifying. I'm trying to stay with it, but the urge to control and explain is loud; can we slow down so I can try to actually feel it?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's a very interesting observation about the decoupling of signal from noise. Can you imagine what it would be like if, instead of trying to control this sensation, you simply allowed it to be, and at the same time, what if you didn't try to be in control of how you feel about it? In other words, what if you allowed yourself to feel the vulnerability, the uncertainty, and the terror, without judgment or trying to push it away?

Patient: I can picture it: letting the vulnerability in would feel like my chest softening a notch, my voice getting thin, and this sudden animal-level exposure where my limbs go a bit shaky. Intellectually I immediately run a cost–benefit analysis—what does showing that cost me in terms of safety, reputation, control—so I end up talking about the feeling instead of inhabiting it. It's scary because it feels like relinquishing predictability, and I'm getting anxious just trying to stay with that thought—can we slow down so I can try to actually notice what that shakiness feels like without turning it into another model?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your mind is already running a script, even as you're trying to stay with the physical sensations. Can you try to notice the shakiness in your limbs, not as a problem to be solved, but simply as a physical sensation – without judgment, without trying to analyze it, without trying to turn it into a story? Just notice it as it is, in this moment, with no agenda.

Patient: Okay — when I focus there's a low, uneven tremor in my hands and forearms, a kind of hollow looseness in my knees, like a peripheral vibration synchronized with my heartbeat. My mind instantly names it as "fight-or-flight tremor," drafts a causal chain back to the breakup and predicts outcomes, and that scaffolding is pulling me out of the sensation. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by the urge to analyze—can we slow down so I can try to actually feel the shakiness without narrating it?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the familiar script is kicking in again. Can you try to hold onto the sensation of the tremor, the looseness in your knees, and the peripheral vibration, just as they are, without trying to label them, without trying to connect them to anything else? What if you simply allowed these sensations to exist, without judgment, without interpretation?

Patient: I can hold it for a moment — a low, irregular tremor in my hands, a hollow looseness in my knees, like a subsonic vibration riding my pulse. Immediately my mind labels it as an autonomic relic of attachment trauma and starts drafting remediation strategies, which yanks me out of the sensation; I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by that urge to explain — can we slow down so I can try to actually stay with the shakiness instead of narrating it?

Therapist Answer:
Your mind is trying to make sense of this sensation, even as you're trying to stay with it. Can you try to be with the sensation itself, not the thoughts about it, not the ideas about it, just the sensation of the tremor, the looseness, and the vibration? What if you allowed it to be a sensation, without trying to understand it, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try — there's a dense, low vibration in my hands and a hollow looseness in my knees, a steady, warm tension across my sternum that rides my heartbeat. Immediately my brain labels it as "sympathetic arousal" and starts running causal models and remediation algorithms — reflexive analysis more than actual feeling, probably from being a data scientist who defaults to pattern recognition. I'm getting pulled into that narrative and it's overwhelming me; can we slow down so I can attempt to stay with the raw sensation instead of narrating it?

It sounds like your brain is defaulting to its pattern recognition mode, trying to make sense of the sensations. Can you try to bring your attention back to the sensations themselves, without labeling them as "sympathetic arousal" or any other idea? What if you simply noticed the warm tension across your sternum, the dense vibration in your hands, and the looseness in your knees, just as they are, without trying to fit them into a story or a category?

Patient: Okay — when I actually try to notice it without naming it, there's a warm, constrictive band across my sternum, shallow quick breaths, a low buzzing in my hands and a hollow looseness in my knees. Even as I say that, my brain wants to relabel and systematize it, which pulls me out, and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down so I can try to stay with these sensations a little longer?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is still trying to categorize and understand the sensations, even as you're trying to notice them without labeling them. Can you try to notice the sensations a bit more subtly, a bit more quietly – like a whisper, rather than a declaration? What if you simply allowed the sensations to be, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to make sense of them?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to listen to it as a whisper. When I soften my attention it shifts into a diffuse warmth across my sternum, a low, distant thrum, breath reduced to tiny, shallow waves, and my hands carry a faint radio-static buzz rather than a full tremor. Almost immediately my brain wants to reclassify it into diagnostic categories and remediation plans — that reflex is loud and pulling me out, and I'm honestly feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down so I can try to stay with this quieter sensing?

It sounds like you're getting closer to noticing the sensations in a more subtle way. Can you try to stay with the diffuse warmth across your sternum, the low, distant thrum, and the faint radio-static buzz, without trying to fit them into a story or a category? What if you allowed these sensations to be a kind of background hum, rather than trying to analyze or understand them?

Patient: I can let it sit as a background hum for a few breaths — diffuse warmth across my sternum, a low thrum, faint static in my hands — and it actually softens a little. But almost instantly my brain drafts explanatory frameworks and remediation plans, which yanks me back into analysis and makes me anxious. I'm getting overwhelmed by that reflex; can we slow down so I can try to stay with it longer?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is still pulling you back into its default mode. Can you try to notice what happens when you allow the sensations to return to the background hum? What would it be like if, instead of trying to understand or analyze them, you simply allowed them to be there, without judgment, without trying to change them? No effort, no striving, just presence.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is simply "allowing" the hum supposed to help me? As a data scientist my reflex is to posit mechanisms (is this a form of exposure? interoceptive habituation? acceptance-based down-regulation?) and that very theorizing is my protective distance. I can attempt to let the warmth and thrum recede to background for a few breaths, but I'm already gearing up to label and strategize and that's making me feel overwhelmed — can we slow down and could you give one concrete cue (like a counted breath or a word to anchor to) so I have something tangible to do when the analysis spikes?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your reflex as a data scientist is to understand and explain, and that's what's keeping you stuck. I'm not suggesting you let go of your understanding or your analytical mind, but rather that you can have both – the ability to notice and understand, and the ability to simply be with the sensations. 

Instead of focusing on the hum itself, let's try something simple: can you bring your attention to your breath, and simply count it for 5, starting from 1, without trying to control it, without trying to change it, just noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that: inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3, exhale 4, inhale 5. That actually blunted the edge a little, but my brain immediately started labeling it as "short-form attentional reallocation" and drafting next-step strategies, which yanks me out of the moment. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by that reflex—can we slow down and could you give a simple ongoing cue (like a word to say on each exhale) so I have something tangible to anchor to when the analysis spikes?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting close to a breakthrough. I'm going to suggest a simple, ongoing cue to help you stay anchored in the present moment. Try saying to yourself "let go" on each exhale, "let go". Just say "let go" as you exhale, without thinking about it, without trying to analyze it, just letting the words themselves become a kind of anchor for your attention. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that: on the exhale, “let go,” inhale, “—” — saying it inwardly did blunt the edge a notch, like a tiny buffer between sensation and narrative. But honestly, I’m not sure I follow how repeating “let go” isn’t just another thing for my brain to categorize — it immediately labeled it as an attentional cue and started drafting optimization strategies, which yanks me out. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed by that reflex; can we slow down and could you either time a short guided minute with me or give a simpler cue (maybe a two-count exhale) so I have something tangible to latch onto when the analysis spikes?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is still trying to make sense of the new cue, even though you're trying to use it as a buffer. Let's try something a bit simpler. Instead of a single word, try a two-count exhale: "exhale... pause... inhale". This can give you a bit more space between your thoughts and allow you to notice the sensation more. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried it — exhale... pause... inhale — and it did blunt the edge a little, like a brief decoupling between the band across my sternum and the narrating mind. But my analytic reflex immediately named it "micro-pacing" and began optimizing the technique, which yanks me back into strategy and makes me feel overwhelmed. Can we slow down — could you either guide me through a short timed minute of that pacing or give a tactile cue (like a light tap) so I have something concrete to latch onto when the analysis spikes?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is still trying to analyze and optimize, even when you're trying to use a more simple technique. Let's try a different approach. Instead of pacing or a cue, I want to guide you through a short timed minute of simply noticing the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or change them. I'll guide you through it. When you feel the urge to analyze or narrate, I'll gently bring you back to noticing the sensations. Are you ready to try it?

Patient: Okay—I’m willing to try, but I’m ambivalent: part of me conceptualizes this as a mini-exposure that should down-regulate arousal, and the other part is already bracing to analyze every cue. I’ll need concrete scaffolding—can you time one minute, cue me every 10 seconds (or say “notice”) and gently bring me back when I start narrating? I’m feeling a bit anxious about doing this and—can we slow down before you start?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about trying something new, and also concerned about getting caught up in your analytical mind. I completely understand. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge that it's completely okay to feel anxious or uncertain. It's a normal part of the process.

Let's take a deep breath together and establish a clear intention: we'll take a slow, gentle approach, and I'll be here to support you. When we start, I'll give you a clear cue every 10 seconds, and we'll go at your pace. When you feel like you're getting caught up in analysis, I'll gently bring you back to noticing the sensations. Are you ready to take a deep breath and start with a moment of calm before we begin?

Patient: Okay — I’ll take a breath with you. My chest is already tight and I’m feeling anxious and ambivalent; part of me wants to model the process, part of me is bracing to analyze everything. Could we start with 30 seconds instead of a full minute, and please cue me with the word “notice” every 10 seconds and say “return” if I start narrating? Also — I’m not sure I fully follow how this reduces the analysis urge, so if you can briefly explain that as we go, it would help me stay grounded.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with 30 seconds. I'll give you a clear cue every 10 seconds, and we'll go from there. Remember, the goal is not to avoid analysis or conceptualization, but to cultivate a sense of presence and awareness in the moment.

When we start, you'll focus on noticing your physical sensations without judgment, without trying to change them or fit them into a story. This can help you develop a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than a need to control or analyze.

The technique we're using is called "basic mindfulness" or "sensory grounding." It's a way to bring your attention to the present moment, without getting caught up in thoughts or mental labels. By focusing on your physical sensations, you can create a sense of distance from your thoughts and emotions, which can help reduce the urge to analyze or conceptualize.

Ready to begin? Inhale... 1. Notice. (pause)

Patient: I inhaled — there’s that warm, constrictive band at my sternum and my breath is still pretty shallow; the “notice” cue did blunt it a touch. Of course my mind immediately auto-labels it as autonomic dysregulation and starts drafting remediation heuristics, which yanks me back into narration. I can feel the narrating ramping up — could you say “return” now? I’m getting a bit overwhelmed by how quickly I default to analysis; can we slow down so I can actually stay with the sensation for a few more breaths?

It sounds like we're making progress, but your brain is still trying to analyze and control. I'll give you a gentle reminder to return to the sensations. Let's slow down and take a few more breaths. Return. (pause) Inhale... 2. Notice. (pause)

Remember, the goal is not to change or fix the sensations, but to simply notice them as they are. Try to focus on the sensations in your body, without judgment or interpretation. Just notice the warm, constrictive band at your sternum, and the shallow breath. Allow yourself to be with those sensations, without trying to analyze or understand them.

Take another deep breath, and when you're ready, I'll give you the next cue.

Patient: I took that breath — there’s the same warm, constrictive band and a low buzz in my hands, but my brain immediately tags it as “autonomic dysregulation” and starts drafting corrective algorithms, which is yanking me out and making me feel overwhelmed. Can you say “return” now and slow the pace a bit? I want the next cue when I notice the narrating spike because I’m afraid I’ll drift straight back into analysis.

Patient: Return. Okay — saying that helped a bit, but the narrating just spiked: my chest tightened, breath shallowed, and my hands hummed. I can catch a breath-long background hum for a moment, but my brain immediately drafts fixes; can you give the next cue now and slow the pacing to about every 15 seconds so I have something tangible to latch onto when the analysis surges?

Longer pauses help because they provide a brief window of time for your brain to disengage from its habitual patterns of analysis and conceptualization, allowing you to momentarily re-set your attention and return to the sensations without the influence of your analytical mind.

Patient: That one-sentence explanation maps onto my internal model — longer windows plausibly let the prefrontal stuff re-engage — but saying it makes sense doesn't stop the reflex to narrate. I'm anxious and a bit disoriented still; can we slow down? Can we try a guided practice now: 3 minutes total, cues every 45 seconds with you saying “notice” and then “return” if you hear me narrating, and maybe one brief grounding anchor (like “hand to sternum”) I can use if the analysis spikes? I'm willing to try, but I need that scaffolding.
