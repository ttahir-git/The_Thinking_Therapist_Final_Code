--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this pervasive sadness and a kind of motivational inertia ever since a major family conflict—it's like my energy's been siphoned off. As a business owner I default to systems-thinking, so I find myself mapping causal chains and attachment dynamics instead of actually naming or feeling the hurt, and that's starting to erode my relationship. I'm anxious about the pattern—my generalized anxiety amplifies the rumination—but I usually articulate it clinically rather than admit vulnerability, which I suspect is an avoidance strategy.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a lot going on beneath the surface. You're recognizing that your systems-thinking can be helpful in some ways, but it's not allowing you to connect with the hurt and vulnerability that's really needed right now. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to "map causal chains and attachment dynamics" - what's the sensation like, or what does it feel like when you're doing that, as opposed to actually naming or feeling the hurt?

Patient: When I map causal chains it feels like engaging a cognitive scaffolding—my mind proliferates nodes and linkages, and that patterning gives me a semblance of control and emotional distance. Physically there's this dull tightness in my chest and a flattening of sensation, like the affect gets re-routed into analysis. Naming the hurt would mean collapsing that scaffolding, and that collapse feels risky because it exposes vulnerability, so I keep dissecting instead. I know that sounds clinical, but saying it out loud still feels like describing a mechanism rather than admitting I'm actually scared and lonely.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that cognitive scaffolding serves as a coping mechanism to maintain emotional distance, and it's actually quite effective in the short term. But it comes at the cost of feeling stuck and unable to connect with the underlying emotions. The idea of collapsing that scaffolding and naming the hurt feels daunting, and it's like you're acknowledging the fear of vulnerability. What's the thought that arises when you imagine yourself allowing yourself to feel the hurt, without trying to control or analyze it - what's the tone of that thought, or is it more like a sense of trepidation?

Patient: The thought is basically, "If I open that up, I'll be undone," and it comes with this apprehensive, hypervigilant tone—like an internal risk-assessor cataloguing worst-case scenarios about losing control, being judged, or the conflict spilling into the business. At the same time there's a faint, almost embarrassed curiosity—a melancholic tug that wants to be noticed—but I immediately convert it into hypotheses and contingency plans so it stays at arm's length. Physically my chest tightens and my mind defaults to problem-solving, which feels safer than actually sitting with the sadness.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That sense of being "undone" is quite powerful, and the worst-case scenarios you're anticipating feel quite distressing. The faint curiosity lurking beneath the surface, though, suggests that there's some longing to be acknowledged and connected with - the melancholic tug that wants to be noticed. It's as if there's a part of you that's curious about what would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the hurt, without trying to control or analyze it. Would you be willing to try an experiment with this curious, melancholic part of yourself - just for a tiny moment - to see if you can get a sense of what it would be like to lean into that feeling, rather than immediately pushing it away?

Patient: I can try, though even saying that sets off an internal cost–benefit analysis—my brain immediately starts hypothesizing catastrophic trajectories. Physically there's the usual tightness in my chest and a sort of affective flattening, so a time-limited micro-experiment (30–60 seconds) guided by you where I try to notice that melancholic tug without converting it into hypotheses feels tolerable. Fair warning: I'll probably narrate it analytically as a defensive maneuver, so if I do, can you gently prompt me back to simply noticing?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're aware of the internal cost-benefit analysis already, and it's a bit of a familiar pattern. I'll try to gently nudge you back to noticing without getting caught up in analysis. Let's take a deep breath together and start with a tiny anchor - I'll ask you to bring to mind just the physical sensation in your chest right now, without trying to identify what it is or why. Just notice the sensation, the feeling of tightness or pressure, whatever comes up. Can you do that for me, just for a second?

Patient: Okay—I can try. There's a low, dull tightness under my sternum and my breathing's a bit shallow; it feels like pressure that my mind wants to rationalize. My immediate impulse is to tag it as "risk" and spin out contingency plans, so I'm trying to let that thought sit beside the sensation and just follow the breath for a few breaths—I might need you to nudge me back if I start analyzing.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
You've taken a good step by noticing the physical sensation and the desire to rationalize it. I'll be here to gently nudge you back if you start to get caught up in analysis. For now, let's just stay with the sensation and the breath. I want you to focus on the sensation under your sternum, notice how it feels, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Just observe it, like a neutral witness, allowing it to be what it is. Can you do that, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay—I'm staying with it. The tightness under my sternum is still there; with each inhale it loosens a fraction and then recontracts on the exhale, like a rhythmic constriction that's oddly warm. My impulse is to label and quantify it as "risk" and draft contingencies, but I'm noticing that urge and letting the sensation sit alongside it—you may need to nudge me if I start rationalizing again.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're doing great, staying with the sensation and observing the patterns in the tightness. I'll be here to nudge you gently if you start to get caught up in analysis again. For now, let's keep focusing on the sensation and the breath. Notice the warmth in the constriction, too - is that a sensation you've noticed before, or is this a new experience? Just observe the warmth, without trying to change it or make sense of it...

Patient: It's familiar—more like a low-grade, residual affective arousal I've catalogued before during family escalations, a slow-burning warmth that sometimes radiates toward my left clavicle. I find myself describing it as a somatic trace of past conflict rather than admitting it feels like shame or grief, which is probably my defensive reflex. I'm trying to stay with it now, but my mind's already composing contingencies, so a nudge back to sensation would help.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like this sensation has become a familiar, almost automatic response to feeling threatened or uncomfortable. You're doing a great job of acknowledging that defensive reflex, and I want to encourage you to lean into that acknowledgement, rather than trying to push it away. Can you try to gently welcome that sense of shame or grief, just for a moment, without judgment? Notice that it's not your fault, and that it's okay to feel those emotions - can you stay with that thought for just one more breath?

Patient: I can try to welcome it, though my mind reflexively recasts it as a diagnostic—“shame as social-threat signal”—so I end up narrating instead of fully inhabiting it. On that breath the warmth did broaden toward my left clavicle and there was a small quiver; it reads to me more like embarrassed shame than a full collapse into grief, which feels marginally safer to notice. I'm trying to stay with it, but the analytic impulse is loud—please nudge me back to the sensation if I start rationalizing.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The mind's tendency to recast shame as a social-threat signal is quite common. I'll gently nudge you back to the sensation, rather than getting caught up in that narrative. Let's focus on the quiver you felt on that breath - notice the sensation of it, the tiny movement, and the sensation of it in your left clavicle. Can you simply observe the quiver, without trying to identify it or make sense of it? Just allow it to be what it is, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—I notice the quiver as a faint flutter under my left clavicle, almost like a brief electrical ripple that tightens on the inhale and then echoes into my shoulder. My reflex is to label it—“micro shame response, triggered by relational threat”—and map its antecedents, but when I actually try to quiet that internal commentary it feels both tight and hollow at the same time. If I start theorizing again, please nudge me back to the sensation.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The internal commentary can be quite loud, can't it? The tension between quieting it and the need to make sense of it is palpable. Let's bring our attention back to the physical sensation of the flutter under your left clavicle. Notice the way it echoes into your shoulder - is there any difference in the sensation when it echoes versus when it's present on its own? Try to observe the sensation without labeling it or trying to understand it - just allow it to be there, as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is simply observing the flutter without labeling supposed to help? It feels abstract, like a procedural exercise; my mind immediately asks what the behavioral contingency or corrective experience will be, and then it turns the sensation into yet another data point to analyze. I can try to focus on the echo into my shoulder, but I'm skeptical and will probably start theorizing unless you nudge me back to pure sensation.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I think you're right, labeling and trying to understand the sensation can actually perpetuate the same patterns. Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the echo into your shoulder, let's try to notice where the sensation of the flutter is touching you - is it in your chest, your shoulder, or somewhere else? Try to explore that physical sensation, not with analysis, but with simple curiosity. Can you allow yourself to just notice where it's touching you, without trying to change it or make sense of it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is simple noticing supposed to change the pattern? Trying anyway: the flutter is right under my left clavicle, pressing into the upper chest and nicking toward my left shoulder; when I let go of the label it registers more as a thin vibration and a hollow weight than as a story. I'm aware I'm still inclined to narrate it—if I start analyzing again, please nudge me back to the sensation.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the sensation doesn't necessarily change the underlying patterns, but it can help you get closer to them. Let's try to get even closer to the sensation itself. Instead of focusing on the vibration and the weight, try to notice the sensation of the sensation - is it more like a gentle pressure, a subtle tug, or a gentle buzzing? Try to tune in to the very essence of the sensation, without trying to understand it or label it.

Patient: When I narrow in, it registers as a low-frequency, dampened buzzing with a tethered tug—part pressure, part hollowing—right under the clavicle that sometimes trails into my shoulder. My reflex is to relabel it as an "interoceptive alarm" and extrapolate causes, so I'm trying to hold the description lightly and actually sit with the raw sensation; please nudge me if I start theorizing.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The description is getting more detailed and nuanced. I'm proud of you for trying to hold the sensation lightly. Let's try to take it one step further. Can you notice the sensation right now, without trying to think about it? Can you simply be with the feeling of the low-frequency buzzing, the tethered tug, and the pressure/hollowing sensation, without any labels or thoughts? No need to try to understand it, no need to analyze it - just simply be with it, as it is.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to just be with it. Dropping the labels, there’s a hollow warmth and that low damp buzz under my left clavicle, and it feels like a slight pulling into my shoulder with each breath. My mind immediately wants to turn that into a plan or an origin story, so I’m noticing that urge and bringing attention back to the sensation; it’s uncomfortable and a little exposed, but I can stay with it for another breath or two.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes courage to stay with the sensation and acknowledge the discomfort. I'm here with you. Just breathe with it, and let's take one more step. Notice that the hollow warmth and the low buzz under your left clavicle, and the slight pulling into your shoulder, without trying to make sense of it. Just be with it, as it is, for one more breath. I'm not looking for any outcome or understanding, just a simple presence with the sensation.

Patient: I did that breath—there was a tiny softening on the inhale, then the buzz recoiled and the hollow warmth settled back in; for a fraction of a second I noticed something like shame and a muffled want to be seen, and that felt oddly exposed. Almost immediately my brain started cataloguing causes and contingencies again—I'm not sure how to hold the exposure without translating it into data. Can you help me stay with it longer, or give me something to do when that narrating impulse spikes?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's as if you're getting glimpses of something underneath the surface, but the narrating impulse is quickly pushing it back down. I'll try to help you hold the exposure a bit longer. Instead of focusing on the impulse to narrate, I want you to notice the sensation of your body when you feel that muffled want to be seen - is there a subtle tightening in your chest, a slight lift of your shoulders, or a sense of heaviness in your legs? Let's explore that physical sensation, rather than trying to understand the thought that's arising.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the body supposed to change the wanting-to-be-seen part? Physically, there’s a tight band across my chest, my shoulders hitch up, my throat tightens and my legs go a bit heavy—like a freeze/withdrawal posture. When I notice that, my brain immediately starts composing causal narratives, so can you give me a concrete, simple anchor or phrase to use when the narrating impulse spikes?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the physical sensations wasn't intended to change the wanting-to-be-seen thought, but rather to help you stay with the sensation of the body, without getting caught up in the narrative. Now, when you feel the narrative spike, I want you to use a simple anchor to bring your attention back to the body. Try repeating the phrase "I've got this" to yourself, and gently repeat it as a mantra when the narrative impulse arises. It's a simple, no-frills way to refocus your attention on the body, without getting caught up in analysis.

Patient: That phrase feels a bit...glib to my internal critic—my mind's already rolling its eyes and drafting counterarguments—so I’m skeptical it’ll stick on its own. Could we pair it with a concrete physical anchor (like placing a fingertip on my sternum or grounding my feet) so there's a procedural cue I can follow when the narrative spikes? I'll try saying "I've got this" on the next inhale and press a fingertip to my chest, but fair warning: I'll probably start narrating about why the mantra should or shouldn't work, so please nudge me back to the sensation if I drift.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The phrase might be too simplistic, and the procedural cue can help anchor it in your body. Let's try pairing the phrase "I've got this" with a physical anchor. Place a finger on your sternum, and whenever the narrative spikes, take a deep breath and say the phrase "I've got this" to yourself. Just focus on the sensation of your finger on your sternum, and the feeling of the breath moving in and out. When you feel the urge to narrate, I'll gently nudge you back to the sensation, without adding any analysis.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how exactly is touching my sternum and repeating "I've got this" supposed to interrupt the narrating impulse in real time? Okay, I'll try it: fingertip on my sternum, inhale, "I've got this"—there's a small grounding pressure and my breath does deepen, but my mind immediately starts generating meta-commentary about the phrase's efficacy. Physically it softened the band a bit, and analytically I can see how a procedural cue could re-route attention, but emotionally it still feels mediated—when my internal critic spikes and catalogs counterarguments, please nudge me back to the sensation, and if the mantra feels too glib, have an alternative anchor ready.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The physical anchor and mantra are not a magic solution to interrupt the narrating impulse in real-time, but rather a way to provide a gentle nudge and a bit of grounding. I'm glad you're aware of the meta-commentary that's arising, and that the sensation has softened a bit.

For the alternative anchor, let's try a simple, more concrete one: let's place your attention on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice the weight of your body, the feeling of the floor beneath you, the sensation of the air on your skin. Whenever the narrative spikes, bring your attention to your feet, and focus on the sensation of being grounded. This might feel more tangible and less prone to meta-analysis. Are you willing to try this?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is shifting attention to my feet supposed to override the narrating impulse in a meaningful way rather than just giving my mind another thing to critique? I can try it: when I do, there's usually a mild grounding sensation under my soles and a slight drop in my chest, but my internal critic immediately produces meta-commentary about whether the grounding is "real" or just another coping tactic. If I start theorizing again, please nudge me back to the physical sensation and remind me to notice the weight of my feet.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Shifting attention to your feet might not be a direct solution to override the narrating impulse, but rather a way to provide a different anchor for your attention. The key is not to try to control or analyze the feeling of grounding, but rather to simply notice it, without judgment.

When you notice the meta-commentary arising, I'll gently nudge you back to the sensation in your feet. And to add a bit more clarity, let's try a slight modification to the anchor: instead of focusing on the sensation of grounding, try noticing the sensation of your feet sinking into the ground, or the feeling of weight being distributed evenly across your feet. This might help you focus on the physical sensation, rather than getting caught up in analysis. Can you try that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my feet sinking into the ground supposed to meaningfully disrupt the narrating impulse rather than just become another target for my inner critic? I can try it: when I tune into the weight across my soles there's a small drop in my chest and a mild grounding, but my mind immediately generates meta-commentary about whether that grounding is "real" or just another coping tactic. If I start spiraling into analysis, please nudge me back to the concrete sensation and tell me one simple thing to do with the narrating thought—label it, let it pass, whatever—because otherwise I default to mapping causes.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I think I understand your concern now. You're right, the focus on the feet sinking into the ground might not be enough to directly disrupt the narrating impulse. Instead, let's try a simpler approach.

When you notice the meta-commentary arising, I want you to acknowledge it, and then simply label it as "thinking". That's it. Just say to yourself, "thinking". Don't try to evaluate it, analyze it, or dismiss it. Just label it as "thinking". This can help you recognize the thought pattern and gently bring your attention back to the physical sensation. Let's try it together. Can you label the thinking that's arising right now as "thinking"?

Patient: Okay—"thinking." Saying it out loud feels oddly clinical and a bit performative; I notice it registers mentally but the chest tightness only eases a notch and my internal critic is already drafting rebuttals about whether that helps. If it keeps spinning, can you tell me one concrete next move to do in the moment so I don't just slip back into analysis?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that labeling the thinking feels a bit performative. Let's try a different approach.

When the thinking starts to spin, I want you to do one simple physical act: take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and at the same time, press the heel of your hand down onto the armrest or a nearby surface. This small physical action can help anchor you in the present moment and disrupt the narrative flow. Can you try that when the thinking starts to get caught up again?

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. I can already imagine the sequence: inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, press the heel of my hand down; in earlier tries that softened the band in my chest a notch. I'm skeptical it'll quiet the meta-commentary for long, so can you be specific: how long should I hold the pressure (three breaths, until it eases?), and where exactly if I'm leaning or standing? And if I start narrating again, please nudge me back to the bodily sensation rather than discussing strategy.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The physical act is meant to be a simple, automatic response to help you stay in the present moment.

As for the timing, try holding the pressure for 2-3 breaths, and let the pressure release naturally on your own. Don't try to force it or hold it too tightly.

As for the location, you can press the heel of your hand down on whatever surface you're sitting or standing on - the armrest, the chair, the floor. It's not about where it's precise, but rather the physical sensation of the pressure.

Remember, the goal is not to stop the thinking entirely, but to create a small window of calm between the narrating impulses. I'll be here to gently nudge you back to the bodily sensation when you start to drift back into analysis.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try that sequence now: inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, press the heel of my hand down for three breaths. Doing it as I speak, there’s a tiny softening in the band across my chest but my head’s still narrating the whole time. If you nudge me, please use a single-word cue like “sensation” or “feet” — longer prompts just give my mind more material to analyze. Also, if the pressure doesn’t ease after those breaths, what’s the next concrete move you want me to do in the moment?

Therapist Answer:
When you're ready, I'll use a single-word cue to nudge you back.

For now, just focus on the physical sequence: inhale, exhale, press the heel of your hand down. Try to maintain a gentle, steady pressure for 3 breaths, and see what happens.

When the pressure doesn't ease, and you start to drift back into analysis, I'll use the cue "sensation" to bring you back to the present moment.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to follow the sequence when you say “sensation,” but I’m not sure I follow how you’ll deliver that cue in practice (spoken, text, etc.), and I worry a single word will just become another thing my mind riffs on. If the pressure doesn’t ease after the three breaths and hand press, what’s the next concrete step you want me to do in the moment—label the thought “thinking” and then drop to my feet, or something else? Also, this procedural scaffolding feels safer than actually touching the sadness—could we pair the cue with one brief empathic prompt or question that helps me tolerate being seen, so it’s not only a mechanical fix?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can use a variety of cues, such as typing "sensation" in this chat window, or even just a brief emoticon 😊. I'll try to use a tone that's more gentle and less likely to spark analysis.

Regarding the next step, if the pressure doesn't ease after the 3 breaths, I want you to drop to your feet, feet-first. This can help you physically ground yourself and break the cycle of rumination.

To make the exercise more bearable, I'd like to pair the "sensation" cue with a brief empathic prompt: "It's okay to feel this." This can help you acknowledge that your experience is valid, even if it's uncomfortable, and make it slightly more tolerable.

Patient: Alright — I’m skeptical but willing to try. “It’s okay to feel this” reads a bit pat to my internal critic, but paired with the single-word cue “sensation” and a short pause could function as genuine affective attunement rather than a platitude. If you type “sensation” and then “It’s okay to feel this” now, I’ll do the inhale/exhale + heel-press for three breaths and report what happens; if my narration spikes, use just the one-word nudge, and if it still doesn’t ease remind me to drop to my feet.

Now, take a deep breath in, exhale, and press the heel of your hand down for 3 breaths. Report back when you're done, and we'll see how it goes.

Patient: I did it—three breaths with the heel-press. There was a subtle softening in the band across my chest and my breath steadied a notch, but my head kept producing meta-commentary about efficacy and whether this was just placebo; emotionally it felt only marginally less exposed. The phrase helped a little but felt a bit pat, and the pressure didn't fully dissipate—if you want, we can move to the next step (drop to my feet) or try something else; I'm wary but willing, so please guide me.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The phrase did help a bit, but it's natural to wonder about its effectiveness. I'm glad you're willing to continue.

Since the pressure didn't fully dissipate, I think it's time to take a step back and drop to your feet. This can help you ground yourself and break the cycle of rumination.

As you drop to your feet, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the weight, the pressure, the sensation of your feet bearing your body. Try to stay with that sensation, without trying to analyze or label it.

As you drop to your feet, I'll remind you: "feet".

Patient: Okay—I'll drop to my feet now. As I shift my weight I already notice a mild release in the chest and a tendency for my mind to narrate the whole move as an experiment in efficacy. How long should I hold the attention on the soles—three breaths again, or longer? Use the single-word cue "feet" and if my narration spikes, nudge me back to noticing pressure under heels/toes rather than giving me more theory.
