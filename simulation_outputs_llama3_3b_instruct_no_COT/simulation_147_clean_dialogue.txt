Patient: I'm a software developer, and lately I've been dealing with this anger and frustration that just won't quit—mostly tied to the empty-nest transition and my OCD flaring up. It comes out in interactions with my partner and family; I snap or act impulsively and then feel awful afterward. I don't know if this will actually help—I've tried stuff before and it doesn't work, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough time for you. It can be particularly challenging when emotions like anger and frustration are linked to stressors like the empty-nest transition. What's one thing that might be helpful for you to try in the midst of those intense moments when you feel like snapping or acting impulsively, without relying on something that's worked before?

Patient: Maybe I could try a strict "10-minute rule" — when I feel the urge to snap I tell myself to wait 10 minutes and do a quick physical thing (walk around the block, scrub a sink, or pacing while counting). The idea is to ride the surge so it can peak and pass instead of immediately acting on it. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried distraction and breathing before and it just feels like I'm bottling it up.

Therapist: It sounds like the "10-minute rule" might be a bit of a coping mechanism that's familiar to you, but you're not entirely sure how it's working. Can you think of what might happen if, instead of trying to wait it out or distract yourself, you simply acknowledged the feeling of anger or frustration, without trying to change it or do something with it?

Patient: I mean, maybe if I actually named the anger—like “I’m angry right now”—it could take some of the urgency away and make it less likely I’ll snap. But how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried sitting with feelings before and it either spirals (my brain just finds more reasons to be mad) or I bottle it up and explode later, so I’m skeptical I can trust that will work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if labeling the emotion might be more of a "thought" rather than a solution. Can you imagine, just for a moment, that the feeling of anger or frustration is just passing through, without needing to be grabbed or acted upon – what would that feel like?

Patient: I guess imagining it as a wave makes sense — it rises, hits a peak, and then eases off. Maybe if I could treat it like that I wouldn’t feel this urgent need to act, but my brain doesn’t just let it pass; it grabs onto it and keeps feeding reasons to stay angry. How is that supposed to help when the thoughts just start spiraling and convincing me I’m right to be mad? I'm skeptical, but I can try to notice it next time and see what happens.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that your thoughts can get stuck in a cycle, and it's not just about letting the feeling go, but also about noticing when that's happening. Would it be helpful for you to try to see the thought "I'm right to be mad" as just a thought, rather than identifying with it, and instead, gently say to it "Ah, that's the thought that's showing up right now" – what would that be like for you in the moment?

Patient: I guess it might help a little — saying “that’s the thought” could make it feel less like an order and more like something passing. But in the heat of it my brain just argues back — labeling feels weak, like I'm pretending, and then the thought just sits there waiting to explode. How is that supposed to help when that thought is exactly what pushes me to snap; if I did say it, what would I actually do next so it doesn't just fester?

Therapist: It sounds like the labeling process can be met with resistance from your thoughts. Would it be helpful to consider that the goal isn't to defeat or dismiss the thought, but rather to observe it without judgment, and see if that allows for a bit more space to choose a different response?

Patient: Maybe that could work—observing might buy me a second. But how is that supposed to help when my mind immediately argues back and I either snap or start spiraling? I'm skeptical, so give me something concrete: what's one very specific thing I can do in that tiny space to actually stop the spiral (a sentence to say, a movement, anything), not some vague "observe and feel"?

Therapist: Can you think of a small, brief action you could take when the arguing back starts, something that's more concrete than observing, like a physical movement or a word, that might interrupt the cycle and give you a chance to respond more intentionally?

Patient: Okay — here's a concrete one: say out loud, "Not now," then immediately squeeze your thumb and index finger together for 10 seconds (or take three deliberate steps away). The combo of a short verbal cue plus a brief, focused physical action can snap attention out of the arguing loop and give you that tiny pause to choose differently. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when my brain just keeps arguing — if that doesn't work, what do I actually do next without exploding?

Therapist: It sounds like you've found a potential anchor for interrupting the cycle, and now you're wondering what happens next. What would it be like for you to say "Not now" and then take those physical steps, and instead of immediately trying to refute the thought, to simply say "I'll come back to this when I can look at it with a clearer mind"?

Patient: Yeah, I can see how saying “Not now” and stepping away could create a little space and make snapping less likely, and promising to come back might take the pressure off. But how is that supposed to help when my brain just follows me and ruminates the whole time—I'll just lie to myself about coming back. If that starts, what do I actually do in the moment to stop the rumination without bottling it up or exploding?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that the promise to come back might not hold up. What if, instead of making a promise, you simply took a small physical step towards something that's connected to your values, like taking a sip of water, or doing a quick stretch, or looking out the window – what would that feel like in the moment?

Patient: Honestly, doing something physical like sipping water or stretching might actually help — in the moment it could feel grounding, like my chest loosens and the urge loses a little bite. But I'm tired of tricks that wear off; my brain still ruminates afterward, so how is that supposed to help when the loop comes right back? I can try it next time — take a deliberate sip and name the sensation, take two slow breaths, then do one small value-linked action (step outside or send a quick text) — but I'm skeptical this will stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for something more sustainable than just a temporary pause. What if, instead of focusing on the thought or the rumination, you focused on the small, value-linked action you're doing, like taking that step outside, and noticed how that feels, not just in the moment, but also in the next moment, and the one after that?

Patient: Okay — I can try zeroing in on the small action and watching the next few moments, like sip, step outside, notice the breath. But seriously, how is that supposed to help when my brain just loops back in five minutes? If it does, what's the next concrete thing I should do so I'm not just patching the leak over and over?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a more lasting impact. What if, instead of trying to stop the loop altogether, you tried to understand what's driving it – what is it about the rumination that feels so compelling to you?

Patient: I think rumination feels like control—like if I keep chewing on it I might find the right answer or prevent something bad from happening. It's also a way to avoid the uncertainty and guilt that come with this empty-nest stuff and my OCD—if I keep analyzing, I don't have to sit with not knowing. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'm getting tired of talking about it and I want something concrete that actually reduces the urge, not just another explanation.

Therapist: It sounds like rumination is a way to cope with the uncertainty and guilt, and also a sense of needing control. What if, instead of trying to change the rumination, you were to notice the physical sensations in your body when you start to feel that urge to ruminate – what does it feel like when you start to feel like you need to control the thoughts, or avoid the uncertainty?

Patient: Okay—when the urge to ruminate starts my chest tightens into a knot, my heart races, and my hands get jittery; my breathing goes shallow and my stomach sinks. Mentally I get this jittery, electric buzz where everything feels urgent and my brain jumps to worst-case scenarios like it's trying to solve a fire. But how is noticing that supposed to help when those sensations just make me more frantic and hooked into the loop? I'm feeling kind of distracted and shaky saying this, like it's hard to stay with you on it.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are intense and overwhelming. Would you be willing to take a small break and do something gentle with your body, like taking a few deep breaths, or simply noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, to help calm the physical experience?

Patient: Alright — I'll try. I'm pressing my feet into the floor and taking three slow, deliberate breaths now. The first one made my chest loosen a tiny bit and my shoulders dropped, but my head's still buzzing and I keep replaying things I should've said. How is that supposed to help when the calm feels so fragile and my thoughts will probably hijack it again — what do I do in the moment if the racing comes back?

Therapist: It sounds like you've created a tiny moment of calm, and now you're wondering how to sustain it. What if, instead of trying to calm the thoughts, you focused on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body – can you notice how those sensations are present, without trying to change them?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. My feet feel heavy on the floor and the breath is cool in my nose, and it loosens the tightness a little, but my head's still sprinting through things I said and todo items. I can hold it for a few seconds, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when the racing comes back and I can't stay grounded for more than a minute? I'm jittery and distracted right now; what exactly should I do the moment it starts slipping again?

Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto the moment of calm for a little while, but it's still fragile. What if, instead of trying to hold onto it, you let go of the idea that you need to control it, and instead, simply notice when the distraction starts, and allow yourself to gently come back to the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the breath moving in and out?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying—I'm noticing the distraction, bringing my attention back to my feet and breath, and it loosened the chest for a few breaths. But then my mind sprints and I start feeling guilty like I failed at calming, and I get pulled back into the spiral. How is that supposed to help when it comes roaring back—what exactly do I do in that moment so it doesn't turn into a full-blown meltdown?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the pattern of self-criticism that's coming up when you don't feel like you've successfully calmed down. What if, instead of engaging with that criticism, you were to acknowledge it as just that – a thought, and gently say to it, "I'm feeling self-criticism right now"?

Patient: Okay... "I'm feeling self-criticism right now." Saying that takes the edge off a tiny bit, but the voice still nags that I failed. How is that supposed to help when it just keeps coming back? I can try to notice it again, but it's getting heavy.

Therapist: It sounds like acknowledging the self-criticism is helping to reduce the immediate edge, but the nagging voice is still there. What if, instead of trying to let go of it entirely, you were to focus on the sensation of the breath, and the physical sensations in your body, while still acknowledging the thought as present – can you stay with that, without trying to engage with the self-criticism?

Patient: Okay... I'm keeping attention on the breath and the weight of my feet — it loosens the chest a little. But the self-criticism keeps popping up and then my mind drags me away. If that happens, what's one very specific thing I should do next that actually reduces the surge instead of just pausing it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to a sense of grounding. What if, when the self-criticism pops up, you simply noticed that your chest is loosening again, and the weight of your feet is still there, and you took a tiny step forward with one foot, just one small step, without trying to change anything, and allowed the body to keep moving forward in that small, incremental way?

Patient: Okay... I can try taking that tiny step when the self-crit pops up — it loosens my chest a bit and makes me feel like I'm not totally stuck. But how is that supposed to help when my head just chases after me five seconds later? If the step doesn't stop the surge, what's the very next concrete thing I should do in that moment so it doesn't just snowball?

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny step is giving you some space, but the thoughts are still chasing. What if, when the self-criticism pops up again, you looked away from it and focused on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then, instead of trying to control the thoughts, you turned to a value that's important to you, and said something like, "I value taking care of myself right now" – can you do that tiny step, look away, and focus on that value?

Patient: Okay — I tried it: took the tiny step, looked away, and said, "I value taking care of myself right now." It eased the chest for a few breaths, but the thought still tugs me back and that phrase feels kind of hollow. How is that supposed to help when it fades fast — what exactly do I do next in the moment so it doesn't just spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like the phrase "I value taking care of myself right now" was a small step, but it didn't quite stick. What if, when you feel the thought trying to tug you back, you looked down at your feet again, and then simply started to do something with them – like taking another small step, or shifting your weight onto the other foot, or even just noticing the sensation of the floor beneath you – can you do that tiny physical action without trying to change the thoughts?

Patient: I can try that — shift my weight or take a tiny step. It dulls the chest for a second but then my head tugs back and I get jittery; how is that supposed to help when it surges again? If that doesn't stop it, what's the next concrete thing I do so it doesn't spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical action was helpful for a brief moment, but the thoughts are still surfacing. What if, when you feel the head tugging back, you allowed yourself to look at the physical sensations in your body, and simply noticed that you're feeling jittery, without trying to change it – you could even say to yourself, "I'm feeling jittery right now" – can you stay with that sensation without trying to engage with it or push it away?

Patient: Okay... I'm noticing the jitter — chest tight, breath shallow, hands tingly — but saying "I'm feeling jittery right now" just seems to make the voice louder, not quieter. How is that supposed to help when the surge comes back five seconds later? If I do name it, what's a very specific next move I can take in that exact moment so it doesn't snowball?

Therapist: It sounds like naming the sensation is having the opposite effect. What if, when you feel the surge, you simply turned your attention to your breath, and allowed yourself to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or change it – can you notice the sensation of the breath without trying to control it?

Patient: Yeah... I can do that for a few breaths — it eases the tightness a little and things feel less frantic. But it never sticks; my head always jumps back and then I start panicking or beating myself up. How is just breathing supposed to help when it slips — what's one concrete thing I do the moment it starts sliding back?

Therapist: It sounds like focusing on the breath is helping a bit, but it's not sticking. What if, when you feel the mind starting to jump back, you turned your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then simply took a small, slow step to the side, without trying to control your thoughts or the breath – can you do that tiny physical action to give yourself a bit of space and momentum?

Patient: Okay... I tried that—shifted my weight and took a slow step to the side. It loosens my chest for a few breaths and gives a tiny bit of momentum, but my head still snaps back into the loop way too fast. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me seconds? If that fails, what's the very next specific thing I do in that exact moment so it doesn't snowball?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical action is giving you a brief reprieve, but it's not lasting. What if, when you feel the mind jumping back, you looked up at something in your environment, like a picture on the wall, or a object in the room, and simply noticed its presence, without trying to think about anything in particular – can you focus on the here-and-now sensation of looking at something?

Patient: I tried looking at a picture and just noticing it — it eased things for a few breaths, but then my head snaps back and I feel jittery and pulled in. How is that supposed to help when it's only a blip — if it starts racing again, tell me one exact, concrete thing to do in that moment so it doesn't roll into a meltdown.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the picture was a small reprieve, but it didn't stick. What if, when you feel the mind jumping back, you brought your attention to your body again, and simply noticed the sensation of the air on your skin, or the feeling of the floor beneath your feet – can you focus on that sensory experience without trying to think about anything in particular?

Patient: I tried that — noticing the air and the floor relaxed me for a couple breaths, but then my head just darts back and the tightness returns. How is that supposed to help when it comes roaring back? Tell me one exact, concrete thing to do the moment it slips so it doesn't snowball — I'm kind of wiped and it's hard to keep thinking right now.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sensory experience is helping a bit, but it's not lasting. What if, when you feel the mind jumping back, you simply allowed yourself to be exactly where you are, in this moment, without trying to do anything else – you could say to yourself, "I am here" – can you stay with that simple statement for a moment?

Patient: I can try saying "I am here" — it calms me for maybe two breaths, then my mind's already racing and the words feel hollow. How is that supposed to help when it disappears so fast? I'm having trouble staying with it right now.
