Patient: I've been stuck in this loop where anxiety about the business and job instability makes me overanalyze everything. I keep intellectualizing my feelings—turning fear and discomfort into charts, plans, and logic so I don't actually feel them. I guess I know it's avoidance, but I don't know how to sit with the feelings instead of turning them into ideas.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware that intellectualizing can be a way to avoid feeling anxious discomfort. That takes a lot of self-awareness. What's it like to sit with the anxiety when you catch yourself doing that - like, what happens in your body when you try to intellectualize instead of feeling?

Patient: Honestly, when I try to sit with it my chest tightens and my head gets loud—this loop of worst-case scenarios and my breathing gets shallow. So I start breaking it down into logic: timelines, pros/cons, contingency plans—anything to make it a problem to solve instead of something to feel. I don't know, I guess it feels safer to be clever than vulnerable, and then I get kind of annoyed with myself for avoiding it.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your chest tension and shallow breathing make sense, given the strong physiological response to anxiety. It sounds like you're using intellectualization as a way to protect yourself from feeling the discomfort, and that can lead to self-criticism when you catch yourself doing it. Would it be okay with you to explore what might happen if you let go of the need to solve the problem or intellectualize the anxiety, and instead focused on the physical sensations in your body, even if it feels a bit scary or uncertain?

Patient: I don't know… I guess we can try, but it feels really scary—my chest already tightens just thinking about it. Can we go slowly? I'm worried I'll just slip into planning and analysis instead of actually feeling anything.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with something very small. I'd like you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your attention to land gently on the sensation in your chest right now, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just notice it, okay? No trying to solve, no thinking, no labeling. Just the sensation. Can you bring your attention to that?

Patient: Okay… I tried. My chest feels like a tight band under my ribs and my breath is kind of stuck. My brain already wants to jump to plans and lists—anything to avoid the feeling. I don't know, I guess it just feels safer to keep analyzing than to sit with this.


--- Turn 4 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The band-like sensation in your chest makes sense. It's like your body is already trying to protect itself from feeling vulnerable. And it's funny how quickly your brain wants to jump into problem-solving mode again. Can you notice what happens when you try to acknowledge the thought, "I don't want to sit with this feeling," and let it go, just for a moment, without acting on it?

Patient: I tried—when I notice the thought "I don't want to sit with this," my chest actually tightens more and my brain immediately flips into planning mode to get away from it. I don't know, I guess admitting it even briefly makes me feel exposed and then I get irritated at myself for being exposed. Can we slow down a bit? This feels like a lot.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The tightening and brain's swift response to the thought make sense. It's like your body and mind are working together to maintain that sense of control. It's understandable that admitting to feeling exposed might feel uncomfortable, especially if you're not used to it. Let's take another small step. Can you bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, without judgment or trying to change it? Just be with the physical experience, and notice what happens when you don't try to react to the thought "I don't want to sit with this"?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. When I bring my attention back, the tight band is still there and my breath is shallow, but if I just notice it without jumping to a plan it doesn't spike as hard — it kind of sits there like a weight. My head is still loud with thoughts wanting to fix it, and I don't know, I guess they feel less urgent if I don't chase them. Can we keep going slowly? I'm worried I'll start analyzing again.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The weight-like sensation is a good way to describe it - it's like the tension is still there, but it's no longer escalating. And it's interesting that the thoughts feel less urgent when you don't engage with them. Let's see if we can find a way to give this weight some space. Can you allow it to be there, without trying to do anything about it, even if it's just for another breath?

Patient: Okay... I tried to just breathe and let it be. The band is still there but it didn't spike as much—more like a dull pressure, though my head keeps handing me plans to fix it. I don't know, I guess it helps a little when I don't act on the thoughts; can we stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The pressure is still present, but it's more of a dull hum now. And it's good that you've noticed how helpful it is to not act on the thoughts. Let's keep exploring this. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the feeling of your back against the chair... see if we can anchor ourselves in the present moment, a bit more, and let the tension in your chest be just that - tension - rather than trying to do something about it?

Patient: Okay... my feet feel grounded, the air is cool in my nostrils, and my back is against the chair — that actually helps a bit. The band in my chest is still there, more like a dull pressure, and my head keeps tossing up plans but they're quieter right now. I don't know, I guess this is okay for now, but can we stay here a bit? I'm worried I'll slip into analyzing if we move too fast.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's good that you've found some stability with your physical sensations. The plans are quieter, and the pressure in your chest feels more contained. Let's take a moment to really notice that it's okay for things to be this way, for now. Can you allow yourself to be with the tension, the plans, and the present moment all together, without trying to change or act on anything? No judgment, no pushing to go further, just being with what is.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to be with it. The band is still there but it's more like background pressure now, and my head keeps handing me plans that I can notice and not follow. I don't know, I guess it actually feels kind of tolerable—can we just stay here a bit longer? I'm nervous about going deeper.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The background pressure is a good way to describe it. It's no longer in your face, but still present. And it's interesting that you're able to notice the plans and not follow them. Let's keep exploring this sense of tolerability. Can you take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice what happens to the pressure in your chest, and what's happening with the thoughts, and see if you can find some more room to be with them, just as they are?

Patient: After that breath the pressure eased a little—like it shifted down and got more manageable. My head is still full of plans and contingency ideas, but I can notice them and not grab them for once. I don't know, I guess that actually feels a bit freeing, but I'm nervous about going deeper—can we stay with this a bit longer or do something if it starts to spike?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The pressure shifted down and became more manageable. That's a good sign. And it's interesting that you're noticing the plans and not getting caught up in them. The feeling of freedom is a good thing to hold onto. Let's take another step. Can you start to ask yourself, what would it be like if you didn't have any plans, if you didn't have to think about what to do next, and just... were present, with the thoughts and the pressure, without trying to change or act on anything?

Patient: I don't know… I guess it would feel empty and kind of panicky, like I'm neglecting something important if I don't do anything. My chest tightens and my brain immediately wants to draft contingency plans, so I'm nervous—can we stay here slowly? I'm worried I'll just start analyzing again if we move too fast.

Therapist Answer:
The feeling of emptiness and panickiness makes sense, and it's like your body and mind are trying to protect you from feeling that way. And it's good that you're noticing the tightening in your chest and the brain's automatic response to draft plans. Let's take a slow step. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" - just three simple words, repeating them to yourself, without trying to change or analyze anything, just being present with the words themselves?

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I said "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" as I breathed. It helped a bit, but it also pulled up this sharp shame and frustration that made me want to reach for plans instead of staying with the feeling. I don't know, I guess can we stay slow? I'm nervous about going deeper.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and frustration came up, which is understandable. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable. Let's be gentle with that. The fact that it came up is not a failure, but rather an opportunity to explore it. Can you look at that shame and frustration, and instead of trying to push it away or change it, see if you can simply observe it, like a cloud passing by in the sky - acknowledge its presence, and then let it go, without judgment, just for one more moment?

Patient: I tried to look at it — when I do the shame just gets hot and tight in my chest and I start getting really frustrated with myself, like I should've done better. I don't know, I guess I can name it and notice it, but that just makes me want to grab plans to make it stop. Can we stay slow and just sit with this for a bit? I'm nervous it'll spike if we push.

Therapist Answer:
The shame and frustration are coming up again, and it's like a familiar pattern. You're naming it, which is a good start, but then the hotness and tension in your chest are getting worse. Let's take a step back. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils - just notice one of those sensations, without trying to change or analyze anything?

Patient: Okay—I tried to focus on my feet and the breath. They felt planted, but that shame just flared up again—hot and tight in my chest—and I got really irritated with myself, like I should've fixed this already. I don't know, I guess I keep wanting to jump into plans to make it stop; can we stay slow? I'm worried it'll spike if we push too fast.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and frustration are coming up again, and it's like you're getting pulled back into the cycle. The feeling of being planted was a good start, but the shame and irritation are still here. Let's try to create some space for that feeling, rather than trying to push it away. Can you say to yourself, "I am with this shame, I am with this frustration, and I am with this feeling of not being able to control it"? Say it slowly and gently, without judgment, and see what happens when you acknowledge the feeling, rather than trying to change it?

Patient: I said it slowly—“I am with this shame, I am with this frustration, and I am with this feeling of not being able to control it”—but saying it made the shame heat up in my chest and my face feel hot, like I want to bury it. My brain immediately offered up plans to fix it and I got really irritated with myself for not just handling it; I don't know, I guess it makes me feel... small and stupid. Can we keep this slow? I'm worried it'll spike and I'll start analyzing to escape.

Therapist Answer:
The shame and frustration are still here, and saying those words actually made them more intense. That's not surprising, but it's interesting that you're noticing the feeling of smallness and stupidity. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable again. Can you take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently ask yourself, "What would it be like if I allowed myself to feel this smallness and stupidity, without trying to change or fix it"? Just notice the question itself, without trying to answer it or analyze it, just explore the sound of the words.

Patient: I don't know... asking that makes this old shame flare up—my chest goes hot and I feel small and stupid, like I'm failing. I guess if I allowed it I'd feel exposed and panicky and probably want to bolt into plans to make it stop. Can we stay really slow? I'm worried it'll spike and I'll just start analyzing to get away.

The shame is coming up again, and it's like your mind is trying to push you away from feeling vulnerable. You're right that allowing yourself to feel this smallness and stupidity might feel exposing and panicky. Let's take a very small step. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change or analyze anything? Just bring your attention to the sensation of your feet, and see what happens, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: Okay... my feet feel planted and kind of heavy against the floor, and the breath is cool in my nose. But that shame just flared up—hot in my chest—and I got immediately pissed at myself, like I should've fixed this already. I don't know, I guess I can keep focusing on my feet if we go really slow?

Therapist Answer:
The shame is still here, and it's like your mind is trying to jump into self-criticism again. You're doing a good job of bringing your attention back to your feet, and it's a good anchor for you. Can you keep looking at the sensation of your feet, without trying to change or analyze anything, and simply see if you can allow the shame to be there, without judgment or reaction? No trying to fix it, no trying to push it away, just being with it, as it is?

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to keep my attention on my feet — they're planted and a bit heavy — but that shame just flares up hot in my chest and my face feels warm. I get snappy with myself, like I should've fixed this already, and my brain instantly offers plans to escape it. I don't know, I guess can we stay really slow?

The shame is still coming up, and it's like your mind is trying to escape into planning and self-criticism. You're doing a good job of bringing your attention back to your feet, and it's a good anchor for you. Let's try to find some more space. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently say to yourself, "I am here, I am here, I am here" again - just the three simple words, without judgment, without trying to change or analyze anything? See if this small repetition can create some more space between you and the shame?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I tried saying "I'm here" before and it just pulled up that hot, ashamed feeling and made me want to jump into plans to fix it, so I don't know, I guess I'm skeptical. Can we try it really slowly and can you explain what I'm supposed to notice so I don't just get louder in my head?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you might be skeptical. It's possible that the repetition of "I am here" can be triggering for you, especially if you're not ready for it. Let's take a step back. Can you just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, the feeling of the air moving in and out, and see if you can bring your attention to that, without judgment or distraction.

Patient: I'm trying to focus on the breath — it's shallow and kind of cold in my nose — but the moment I notice it the shame heats my chest and my brain starts drafting plans to "fix" it. I don't know, I guess I'm skeptical this will help; can you guide me step-by-step for like one minute so I don't drift into analysis or start solving it?

Let's try to take it very slowly. I'll guide you through a gentle process. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and I'll speak to you in a very calm and gentle voice. Can you put one hand on your belly, and the other on your chest, and just notice the sensation of your body relaxing? As you exhale, can you say to yourself "relax" and just let your body release a little, without trying to control it or analyze it? Just relax...

Patient: Okay... I'm putting my hands on my belly and chest. My breath's shallow and—when I try to say "relax" it actually makes my chest tighten and this hot shame comes up and I get mad at myself and my brain starts drafting fixes. I don't know, I guess we can try one slow, guided breath-by-breath? Tell me when to inhale and exhale and keep it really slow.

Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. I'll guide you through a breath-by-breath process. When I say "inhale", take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am here". Don't try to analyze or change anything, just say it as a simple statement. When you're ready, we'll move on to the next breath. Are you ready to start?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready, but I'm nervous and my chest's already tight. Go really slow—tell me exactly when to inhale and exhale, and remind me to say "I am here" on the out-breath.

Let's start very slowly. I'll guide you through the breath. When I say "inhale", take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four: 1... 2... 3... 4...

(pause) And exhale, saying "I am here" again. Can you do that with me?

Patient: I don't know… I'm confused — how is counting to four supposed to stop my head from leaping into plans? I guess I can try one breath, but the shame's already hot in my chest and I'm worried I'll freeze or start analyzing.

When I say "inhale", take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you do, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it or analyze it, just notice it. Take a deep breath in: 1... (pause) inhale... 

As you inhale, don't say anything yet. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. Now, exhale slowly through your mouth, and as you do, say to yourself "I am here" in a soft, gentle voice: I am here. (pause) Take a deep breath in: 1... (pause) inhale... 

Don't say anything yet. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. When you're ready, we'll try again.

Patient: Okay... I tried to inhale — it felt shallow — and on the exhale I barely managed "I am here" but it just made that hot shame spike and my brain started firing off fixes. I don't know, I'm confused — this is supposed to help but it just makes me feel small and stupid, like I'm failing at something basic.

It can be frustrating when things don't go as planned. Let's try one more time, very slowly. I'll count each second for you. When I say "one", inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four: 1... inhale... (pause) 2... inhale... (pause) 3... inhale... (pause) 4... inhale... 

Now, as you reach the top of the inhale, pause for a second. Now, exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four: 1... exhale... (pause) 2... exhale... (pause) 3... exhale... (pause) 4... exhale... 

As you exhale, say to yourself "I am here" in a soft, gentle voice: I am here. 

Take a moment to breathe, and don't worry if your mind starts to wander. We'll try again if you're ready.

Patient: I did that breath — it helped a tiny bit, but then this sharp shame came up and my chest tightened and I felt really small and stupid, like I’d failed at something basic. I’m not sure I follow how the counting stops my head from launching into plans; I get confused and start trying to fix it. Can we do one more super-slow breath, you telling me each second, and tell me what to do if the shame spikes so I don't just bolt into analysis?

As you exhale, say to yourself "I am here" in a soft, gentle voice: I am here. 

But here's the important part: if the shame spikes and your chest tightens, I want you to pause, and instead of trying to analyze or fix it, I want you to notice that the shame has come up again. Say to yourself "ah" or "oh" or any other word that feels like a gentle acknowledgment of the sensation. Don't try to do anything with it, just acknowledge it. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay... I'll try, but I'm not sure I follow how saying "ah" is supposed to stop my head from racing — it just tends to make me feel small and stupid when the shame spikes. I don't know, I guess I'll try to pause and say "ah" if it comes up. Start counting when you're ready and tell me when to inhale and exhale, and please remind me to just notice instead of fixing it if it gets loud.
