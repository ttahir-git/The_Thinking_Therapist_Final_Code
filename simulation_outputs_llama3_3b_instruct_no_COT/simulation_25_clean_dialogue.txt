Patient: I've been leaning into work lately—longer hours and extra projects—because it gives me a measurable sense of control after the death in my family and the subsequent conflicts. I can enumerate rationales for productivity as adaptive, but it increasingly feels like an anesthetic against the discomfiting elements of grief. As a manager I find it easier to quantify outcomes than to sit with the messy, ambiguous territory of family tensions, so I default to tasks instead of presence.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the complexity of your emotions and the ways in which your work is influencing your experience. It sounds like you're using your productivity as a way to avoid some of the discomfort that comes with not knowing how to navigate the family dynamics. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel that discomfort – what's the first thing that shows up for you?

Patient: Usually the first thing is a kind of constrictive tightness in my chest and a low, restless energy, but my reflex is to translate that into cognition — I start drafting agendas, prioritizing, turning it into actionable items. Then there's the compulsion to stay late or take on more so the emotional noise gets diluted by measurable outputs. I notice I'm narrativizing and analyzing the sensation instead of actually sitting in the sadness, which feels both safer and frustrating.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where your body is trying to signal that something's off, but your mind is immediately jumping into problem-solving mode. It's like you're trying to override the physical discomfort with productivity as a way to avoid the uncertainty and ambiguity of your emotions.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when you do finally sit with the sadness, though? What's the experience like when you allow yourself to stay with that feeling, rather than trying to push it away or analyze it?

Patient: When I actually sit with the sadness it’s physically heavy—like a pressure in my chest and my breathing gets shallow; sometimes the tears come and that surprises me because I’m not used to letting that happen. Almost reflexively my mind then catalogs causes, drafts timelines, and converts the feeling into something to be managed, which gets me back to planning and doing. I can linger for a few minutes and it’s this raw, unmoored loneliness that feels intolerable, which is precisely why work becomes appealing as a stabilizer. I'm aware of the gap between noticing the feeling and actually inhabiting it, but I don’t really have a strategy for staying with it longer.

Therapist: It's like there's a sense of fragmentation – your body's emotional response is intense, but your mind tries to break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. And then, as you mentioned, the cataloging and planning that follows can feel like a way to escape from that intense feeling of loneliness.

It sounds like you're struggling to find a way to stay with that raw, unmoored feeling without getting pulled back into your usual coping mechanisms. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that you could allow yourself to be with that feeling without trying to change it, without trying to analyze it or manage it? What would that feel like?

Patient: I picture it as a slow, dense pressure—like gravity in my chest that makes time feel thicker, with a hollow coldness behind my sternum and a tightness in my throat that sometimes leads to tears. In theory that’s tolerable, but in practice I reflexively start operationalizing it into tasks because the feeling feels like it could proliferate without boundary. I'm trying to stay with that image, but I can already feel the impulse to escape—can we just slow down and identify one small, non-actionable sign I could notice when it comes up?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to anchor yourself to that image of the dense, oppressive pressure, but your mind is already starting to plot a way out. 

Let's try something small. Can you notice the sensation of your breath right now, without trying to do anything with it, without trying to push it away or change it? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or analyze it. See if you can simply observe it, as it is, for just a few breaths.

Patient: Okay—I tried. My breaths are shallow, mostly upper-chest, with a little catch at the top and an exhale that feels truncated; my mind immediately labels it—'thoracic breathing, sympathetic arousal'—instead of letting it be. That distancing makes it more tolerable but keeps me disconnected; can we slow down and just stay with the sensation for a minute without me turning it into a checklist?

Therapist: It sounds like you're able to observe the physical sensations in your body, but your mind is still trying to categorize and analyze them. It's like you're stuck in a loop of labeling and categorizing, which keeps you disconnected from the actual experience.

Let's try to simplify it even further. Can you just focus on the sensation of the catch at the top of your breath, without trying to label it as "symptomatic arousal" or anything else? Can you simply notice the sensation itself, as it is, without trying to make sense of it? Just for one more breath.

Patient: I did one more breath—shallow, with that catch, like a brief hitch in my throat and a cold knot under my sternum. Immediately my head started annotating it—'sympathetic arousal, vagal withdrawal'—which paradoxically makes the sensation feel more tolerable but also keeps me removed from it. I'm feeling a bit exposed trying to sit with this; can we slow down and pick one tiny, non-actionable sensation I can focus on when the catch comes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're able to observe the sensation of the catch in your throat and the knot under your sternum, but your mind is still trying to turn it into a formula or a diagnosis. 

Let's try to find a tiny anchor that's even smaller than the catch itself. What if, instead of focusing on the catch, you simply noticed the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Can you just pay attention to that sensation, without trying to change it or make sense of it, for just one moment?

Patient: Okay—I noticed my feet: the heels and balls pressing into the floor, a faint coolness along the outer edge, nothing dramatic. My mind immediately labeled it a “grounding cue” and started evaluating whether it’s effective, which makes me feel a bit self-conscious and resistant. It does take the edge off the chest tightness a little, but I can feel the pull to analyze—can we stay with this sensation for a bit longer without turning it into another task?

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to make the sensation of your feet on the ground into a tool to manage your emotions, rather than just noticing it for its own sake.

Let's try to slow it down even further. Can you just notice the coolness along the outer edge of your feet, without trying to evaluate its effectiveness or use it as a coping mechanism? Can you just allow yourself to be with that slight coolness, without trying to change it or make sense of it, for just another breath?

Patient: I focused on that cool edge for another breath — it's faint but the chest tightness eased a notch, though my mind immediately reclassified it as "grounding cue efficacy" and started drafting a plan to institutionalize it. I'm feeling a bit exposed trying to just be with it; can we slow way down and try staying with the sensation for a few breaths without any labeling while you hold the space?

Therapist: It sounds like you're able to notice the sensation of the cool edge on your feet for a bit longer, but your mind is still trying to turn it into a useful tool.

I'm here with you, and I'm not going to label or evaluate what's happening. I'm just going to hold the space for a few more breaths, allowing you to be with whatever is showing up, without judgment or commentary. Can you just be with that sensation, whatever it is, for just a few more breaths?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is you "holding the space" supposed to stop my reflexive narrativizing? I can try to stay with the coolness for a few breaths; my chest loosens a bit but then my internal commentator immediately starts annotating, which makes me feel exposed and oddly irritable. Can we actually slow down—maybe just sit in silence for five breaths while you stay present and don't prompt me to analyze—so I can see if I can tolerate it without turning it into a task?

Therapist: I'll sit in silence with you. No talking, no prompts, no anything. Just sitting. I'll be here with you, present and still, while you focus on your breath. We'll just be together in silence for five breaths, and I'll let you be with whatever comes up, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: Okay — I did the five breaths. At first there was a slight loosening in the chest, then a brief sting behind my eyes, and almost immediately my brain launched into a metanarrative: evaluating the "efficacy" of the silence as if I were auditing a project. It helped a little, but it left me feeling exposed and oddly irritable; I don't know if silence alone is enough because my default is to scaffold everything into a process. Can you offer one tiny, non-actionable cue I can notice the moment that narrativizing starts, so it doesn't automatically hijack the entire experience?

Therapist: It sounds like the silence didn't quite have the impact you were hoping for, and your mind still tried to analyze and evaluate it. 

Let's try to find a tiny anchor that can help you pause before you start narrativizing. Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the ground when you start to feel the urge to evaluate or analyze what's happening? That slight feeling of your feet connecting with the floor might be a tiny sign that your mind is about to start spinning a narrative. Can you simply notice that feeling, without trying to change it or do anything with it, for just a moment?

Patient: I can notice it — a firmer pressure under my heels and a faint coolness along the outer edge — but I'm not sure I follow how that sensory note actually interrupts the cascade of narrativizing; it feels like proposing another tool to be optimized. My reflex is to turn even this into a procedure, which makes me skeptical and a little irritated, so could you just try something minimal: when you hear me start annotating, quietly say "feet" and then stay silent with me for a few breaths so I can attempt to orient there without being coached?

Therapist: I'll try that. When you start to annotate, I'll quietly say "feet" and then stay silent. See if that helps you notice the sensation a bit before your mind starts spinning a narrative. Just focus on the sensation of your feet, without trying to change it or do anything with it, and let's see if you can stay with it for a few breaths.

Patient: Okay—I'm willing to try, though I remain skeptical that this won't just become another procedural tic to optimize. If you say "feet" when my metanarrative starts, I'll try to reorient to the heels and outer edges and hold that sensation for three breaths without converting it into an agenda. Say it when you're ready.

Therapist: When you feel the urge to start annotating or evaluating, I'll quietly say "feet". Let's wait for it to happen.

Patient: Okay—I can feel the narrativizing sliding back in—my head's already compiling metrics about the silence and annotating my tolerance, which makes me irritated and a bit exposed. Say "feet" now so I can try to drop into the heels and hold that sensation for three breaths without turning it into another project.

Therapist: "Feet".

Patient: Okay — I shifted to the heels and outer edges, held for three breaths: there was a subtle grounding, a slight slackening in the chest, and then my head slid back into commentary, cataloging whether that slackening was "meaningful." I'm feeling a bit exposed and irritable by how quickly I default to analysis. Can we try it again but for five breaths, and this time say "feet" a second time halfway through so I have a cue to notice when I start narrativizing?

Therapist: "Feet". Let's wait and see what happens. We'll give it five breaths this time.

Patient: I did the five breaths — the first two gave a small, tangible grounding and the "feet" cue at breath three helped me drop into the heels, which eased the chest a bit. Immediately after that relief my head started auditing the change—measuring its significance—and that counting made me feel exposed and pretty annoyed. Can we try another round where you only say "feet" once on the third breath and then stay completely silent for ten breaths so I can see if less prompting reduces my urge to proceduralize it?

Therapist: "Feet".

Patient: You said "feet" already — I was trying to wait for the cue on the third breath, so that threw me off and now I'm more jittery; my chest tightened and my thoughts are ricocheting between the heels and an internal audit. Can we reset and try the sequence as I asked: a brief pause to settle, then ten breaths with you only saying "feet" on the third breath and absolute silence afterward? I need that specific pacing because otherwise my metanarrative immediately hijacks the sensation and I can't tell if I'm actually grounding or just performing it.

Therapist: Let's try it again, exactly as you asked. Take a moment to settle, then wait for my cue...

Patient: Okay — I took a moment to settle, though I'm feeling more jittery and brittle than I expected: chest tight, thoughts ricocheting. I'm ready to try the sequence you described — ten breaths, say "feet" on the third breath, then absolute silence — and I'll try to focus on the heels and outer edges without immediately turning it into an audit. Go when you're ready.

Therapist: Let's start now.

Patient: Okay—starting now. Breath one: shallow, upper-chest; breath two: tighter, my head already kicking into metanarrative mode; breath three: I'm bracing for the cue—there's a fizzing anxiety behind my sternum and it's hard not to start auditing everything. Say "feet" when you're ready.

Therapist: Feet

Patient: I heard it — I shifted my focus to the heels and outer edges and held for a breath; there was a tiny easing in my chest but my head immediately started auditing the whole thing and now I'm jittery and restless. I'm not sure if I'm actually grounding or just performing another ritual to quiet the anxiety. Can we go silent for five breaths now, and only say "feet" once more if you notice me slipping back into commentary? I need that specific space to see if it settles without me turning it into another project.

Therapist: *I remain silent*

Patient: I tried to do the five silent breaths but couldn't settle — my chest tightened, my thoughts ricocheted into an audit about whether I was doing it “right,” and that made me more jittery and restless. It felt performative, like I was running a post-mortem on each inhale instead of actually grounding. Can we try again with you saying “feet” on the third breath as we agreed? I think that tiny external cue is the only thing that reliably interrupts the narrativizing for me right now.

Therapist: "Feet".

Patient: You said "feet" again — that early cue threw me off and made me more jittery; my chest tightened and my head immediately went into audit mode. I'm feeling exposed and annoyed by how quickly the narrativizing reappears. Can we reset and do exactly what I asked: a brief pause to settle, then ten breaths with you only saying "feet" on the third breath and absolute silence afterward? I need that precise pacing to see if it actually grounds me or if I'm just performing another ritual.

Therapist: Let's try again, exactly as you asked. Take a moment to settle, then wait for my cue...

Patient: Okay — I took a brief moment to settle, though I'm feeling jittery and brittle and there's that tightness in my chest; my mind is already forecasting outcomes and narrativizing the whole thing. I'm ready to try the ten-breath sequence with "feet" on the third breath; I'll wait for your cue and try to focus on the heels and outer edges without auditing it. Go when you're ready.

Therapist: Let's start.

Patient: Okay—starting now. Breath one: shallow, upper-chest, a brief hitch; breath two: tighter, and my head's already compiling metrics and projecting outcomes; breath three: I'm bracing for the cue—please say "feet" now so I can try to reorient.

Therapist: Feet

Patient: I heard it—I dropped to my heels and felt a tiny easing, then my mind immediately relaunched its metanarrative, auditing whether that easing “counts,” which just makes me jittery and restless. I don’t know if this is real grounding or another procedural tic; can we go silent for a full minute with no prompts so I can see if it settles without me turning it into an agenda?

Therapist: *I remain silent*

Patient: The silence tightened my chest and made my thoughts ricochet worse—there was a brief easing and then the audit returned and I got more jittery and restless. I'm feeling exposed and pretty irritated that the silence alone just becomes another thing to evaluate. Can we reset now: a short pause, then the ten-breath sequence with you saying "feet" only on the third breath and absolute silence afterward? I need you to stick to that exact timing so I can tell if it actually helps or if I'm just performing it.

Therapist: Let's try again, exactly as you asked. Take a moment to settle, then wait for my cue...

Patient: Okay — I took a moment to settle, though I'm jittery and my chest is tight and my head's already drafting contingencies. I'm ready for the ten-breath sequence: say "feet" only on the third breath, then absolute silence. Start when you're ready.
