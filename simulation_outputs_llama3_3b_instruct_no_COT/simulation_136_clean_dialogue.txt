Patient: I'm in my early thirties, a manager, and lately I've been feeling stuck and directionless—like there's nothing to me beyond my job. The second I try to plan anything, my brain goes straight to the worst: I’ll burn out, screw up a big project, get fired, and then no one will hire me because all I have is this managerial title, and I'll end up back at square one living with my parents. I know that sounds dramatic, but it feels inevitable — other outcomes just don't seem realistic to me.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the possibility of losing control and falling back into a place that feels unfulfilling. Can you tell me more about what it's like to experience this fear of losing control in the moment? What's going through your mind when those thoughts arise?

Patient: It hits like a fast-forward in my head: one small mistake turns into a failed project, I get fired, no one hires me because all I have is a managerial title, and I'm back at my parents' kitchen table — that's the movie I play on loop and it feels inevitable. Physically my chest tightens, I can't sleep, my hands shake, and I either freeze or overwork trying to prevent the first domino; it makes every decision feel paralyzing. I know other outcomes are possible, but honestly they feel like fantasy — the disaster story is the only one that feels real, and that's what makes it so overwhelming.

Therapist: It sounds like that catastrophic thinking can be really debilitating, making everyday moments feel like high-stakes decisions. That sense of paralysis is understandable, given the intensity of the fear. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with that racing narrative? What if, for just a brief moment, you allowed yourself to fully experience and acknowledge that catastrophic story, without trying to stop it or change it?

Patient: Alright, I'll try. The movie is brutal: I miss one deadline, the client freaks out, leadership pins it on me, HR starts a file, recruiters see that and skip my applications, and within months I'm back at my parents' house with nothing to show for my life — no career, no credibility, everyone’s judgment resting on that one failure. Saying it makes my chest tighten and my mind goes into overdrive like it's proof this will happen, and I can't shake the feeling that there's no comeback from it.

Therapist: You're allowing yourself to fully experience the emotional impact of that story, and it's still really intense. Your body is reacting to the feeling of being trapped and judged by others. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from the perceived harm. Would you be willing to take a tiny step back from that story, and instead, focus on your breath for just a second?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to focus on my breath for a second. I notice the inhale and exhale, but it doesn't quiet the movie — if anything, the silence gives my brain room to add details: the HR email subject line, recruiters skipping my profile, my team whispering about the failure. Slowing down just feels like giving the story more time to prove itself, honestly.

Therapist: The details are still there, even in the silence. It sounds like your mind is trying to justify the catastrophic outcome by adding more fuel to the fire. Can you explore what's keeping you from letting go of the story? Is it a desire to be prepared, or is there something else driving it?

Patient: I think it's more than wanting to be prepared — it's this certainty that if I don't foresee the worst, it will happen and I won't survive it. My worth feels totally wrapped up in being a competent manager, so any screw-up in my mind equals being worthless: fired, unemployable, back at my parents' table, everyone judging me. I know that sounds awful, but imagining that chain makes me feel like I'm preventing it, even though it just freezes me or makes me overdo everything.

Therapist: That sense of worth is deeply tied to your competence as a manager. It sounds like the fear of being a failure is closely linked to your sense of identity. What would it be like for you to make room for a different possibility – one where you're not defined solely by your job or your competence?

Patient: I can't really picture that without it turning into another disaster — if I stop leaning on my job as proof I matter, I lose the edge that keeps me from slipping up, which leads to mistakes, then a demotion, then no one wants me on their team, and I'm back at my parents' place with nothing. It sounds like a nice idea in theory, but it feels like a setup for a bigger fall, not a way out. I want to believe it could be different, but right now the worst-case scenario is the only one that feels real.

Therapist: You're caught between holding onto the edge that keeps you afloat and the fear of falling off. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from potential failure, but in doing so, you're actually creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Would you be willing to take a small step towards trying to find that edge, not in terms of your job performance, but in terms of what gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment outside of being a manager?

Patient: I get why you'd suggest that, but the second I try to imagine something outside work it turns into another disaster movie: I take up a hobby or volunteer, I’m tired from evening activities, I miss a project detail, a deadline slips, leadership blames me, and I’m out of a job — back at my parents' kitchen table with nothing. I know you're asking for a low-risk first step, but other outcomes feel unrealistic; the dominoes always start somewhere. Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here — can we slow down? I feel kind of stuck and overwhelmed by even thinking about this.

Therapist: It's like the possibilities for escape are getting tangled in more worries. I'm not asking you to take on anything new or try to escape, but rather to slow down and get a sense of what you need right now. What's the one thing, in this moment, that feels like it might be enough to help you feel more grounded and supported, without trying to change anything or anticipate the worst?

Patient: Okay — right now the one thing that might help is holding a warm mug of tea, feeling its weight and temperature, and naming three things I can see around me. But I can't help it — my brain instantly adds the worst: I spill it on a report, it becomes "proof" I messed up a deadline, and the whole failure-movie starts again. I'm trying to do it, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit stuck — can we slow down?

Therapist: The struggle to stay present is real. It sounds like your mind is already getting ahead of itself, even in a moment that feels relatively simple. Can we take a deep breath together and focus on the sensation of the tea in your hand for just one more moment, without trying to analyze or worry about what might happen with it?

Patient: Okay — I'm taking a breath and holding the mug. I can feel the warmth and its weight, but my brain immediately pictures me spilling it on a report and that single stain turning into the chain that gets me fired; it tightens my chest and I keep expecting the next domino. I want to stay here but I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Your body is already responding to the thought, even in the midst of the simple act of holding the mug. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that tension in your body, without trying to change it. Would you be willing to simply observe the physical sensation of your chest tightening, without judgment, and see if that changes anything?

Patient: I can try to notice the tightness, but the second I do my brain treats that noticing like proof the movie's happening — the squeeze under my sternum becomes the first domino. I can name it: shallow quick breaths, a knot in my chest, jaw clenching, but it doesn't quiet the chain — I still see the spill, the missed deadline, the firing. I'm feeling overwhelmed and kind of stuck; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the act of noticing the physical sensations is actually triggering more of the catastrophic thinking. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your breath, without trying to name it or analyze it. Can you just pay attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I can feel the air moving — shallow, quick, like I'm bracing — but focusing on it just gives my brain more room to narrate the disaster: each inhale feels like preparing for the next domino, each exhale like sinking. It's not calming; it just makes the movie louder, and I'm getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down?

Therapist: The focusing on the breath is actually making the story louder, rather than quieter. Let's try to ground yourself in the present moment, without focusing on your breath or the thoughts. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin, without trying to think about anything?

Patient: Okay — my feet are on the floor, it's solid, the air's cool on my arms, but I can't stop my brain from turning that into the start of the dominoes: feeling steady becomes complacency, I slip up on a tiny email, then the whole failure-movie kicks in. It's overwhelming and I feel stuck; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the ground beneath your feet is being pulled into the narrative. I'm going to try something different. Can you simply allow yourself to be in this moment, with your feet on the floor, without any expectations or outcomes? Just be with what is, without judgment or thought.

Patient: I'm trying to be with my feet on the floor, but the moment I stop expecting something to go wrong my brain fills the quiet with the failure-movie — steady feet mean I'm letting my guard down, which means a tiny slip, then a missed deadline, then I'm fired. My chest tightens and I feel helpless; I want to stay here but I'm getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the quiet moment is an invitation for the story to take over. Let's try something gentle. Can you acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm, without trying to change it or fight it. Just say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now" – and then pause.

Patient: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Saying it lands like a hot weight in my chest, but the pause just gives my brain more space to run the failure-movie — the silence becomes the next domino. I'm flooded and kind of frozen; can we slow down?

Therapist: The pause didn't quite slow down the movie. Let's try a different approach. I'm going to take the "I'm feeling really overwhelmed" and look at it from a slightly different angle. What if, instead of focusing on the overwhelm, we looked at it as a signal that you're getting close to a threshold – a point where you're feeling the weight of your worries and fears.

Patient: I get what you mean, but in my head that "threshold" isn't a warning so much as the exact moment the countdown starts — once I'm near it, one tiny slip and the whole failure-movie kicks off and it's inevitable. Saying it's a signal to pay attention just feels like rearranging the same proof that I'm doomed; my chest tightens and I can't see any other ending. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting stuck in a cycle of reinforcing the same catastrophic thinking. Let's take a step back and look at this from a different perspective. Can you think of a time in your life when you were on the verge of a difficult situation, but ultimately managed to navigate it in a way that was okay? Not okay, just okay. What did you do in that moment?

Patient: There was this big client pitch last year — I overprepared, rehearsed every possible question, double-checked the deck, and asked a mentor to run it with me. It went okay — they signed, people said good things — but even then my brain was convinced it was a fluke and kept playing the follow-up: they pull the contract, leadership blames me, and I'm back at square one. That strategy works sometimes but it's draining and doesn't stop the panic. I'm feeling worn out and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you've found a way to temporarily contain the catastrophic thinking, but it's come at a cost. You're exhausted and feeling worn out. Let's explore what might happen if you took a different approach to dealing with this anxiety. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you focused on what you could do in the present moment to take small, manageable steps towards your goals?

Patient: I get the idea of small steps, but the second I try to plan one my brain fast-forwards: I do the extra thing, get exhausted, miss a tiny detail, leadership pounces, and I'm fired — it feels like every small move just starts the dominoes. That pattern makes even tiny steps feel like traps, and just thinking about it drains me—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the planning and trying to control the outcome are actually perpetuating the same pattern of catastrophic thinking. Let's try something completely different. Can you imagine yourself in a situation where you're not trying to control the outcome, but simply being present with what is, without judgment or expectation? For example, imagine you're standing in a situation where you're waiting for a response from the client, but you're not worrying about the outcome. Just being with the present moment, without trying to push the dominoes or control the outcome.

Patient: I try to imagine that — just waiting for the client and not worrying — but it instantly turns into the failure-movie: I let my guard down, miss a tiny email, a deadline slips, leadership blames me, I'm fired, and I'm back at my parents' kitchen table. Fantasizing about calm just feels like a trap; other outcomes don't seem realistic, and thinking about it is kind of draining, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even imagining a calm, present moment has become a setup for the same catastrophic thinking. I'm going to try something different. Can you simply acknowledge the sensation of feeling drained and overwhelmed, without trying to change it or think about the outcome? Just notice the feeling of exhaustion and let it be, without judgment.

Patient: There's this heavy, dull pressure in my chest and a fog in my head — my shoulders feel like they're weighed down and thoughts are slow and muffled. I can feel the exhaustion sitting there without wanting to change it; it makes everything feel flat and hard to move through. I'm overwhelmed and stuck—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're allowing yourself to be with the exhaustion, without trying to push through or change it. I'm going to wait with you in this moment, without adding anything to it. Just be with the heaviness, the dullness, and the slow thinking. We can just sit with it, together.

Patient: Okay... I can sit with the heaviness for a moment, but even that quiet feels like the movie's opening scene — being still means I'm not watching the details, so I miss the tiny thing that starts the dominoes, and then I'm fired and back at my parents' place. Saying it out loud doesn't help much; it just makes the chest tighter and everything feel numb. I'm getting worn out by this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment of stillness is still getting pulled into the narrative. I'm going to try to help you notice the sensation of numbness and tightness in your body, without trying to change it or add anything to it. Can you just notice the numbness in your body, without labeling it or trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I can feel this dull numbness, like my limbs are wrapped in cotton — I notice it, and the quieter I get the louder the failure-movie gets: missing a tiny thing, the dominoes start, I'm fired, back at my parents' place. It's wearing me down... can we slow down?

Therapist: The more you focus on the numbness, the more the narrative takes over. I'm going to try to help you come back to the sensation of your breath, without trying to do anything with it. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: I can feel the breath — it's shallow and each inhale just feeds the countdown in my head. The quieter I try to be the louder the failure-movie gets: one missed breath turns into a missed email, then a missed deadline, then I'm fired and back at my parents' kitchen table. It's all getting heavy and slow; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the breath is becoming even more tightly wound up in the narrative. I'm going to try to help you notice that the breath is not the problem, but rather a part of the story. Can you place the breath alongside the other sensations in your body, without trying to change it or use it to try to stop the countdown?

Patient: Okay — I can kinda place the breath with the numbness and the tightness, but it just feels like different parts of the same disaster soundtrack: shallow breaths, heavy limbs, jaw clenched — all of it feels like the setup for missing one tiny thing, which starts the firing-movie. I'm worn thin and it's really hard to stay here — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the different sensations are still getting pulled into the same narrative. I'm going to try to help you come back to the physical sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or understand them. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to think about anything else? Just the feeling of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: They're planted — solid, a little cool under my shoes — but even that becomes the start of the movie: steady feet = complacency, I miss a tiny email, deadline slides, leadership blames me, I'm fired, back at my parents' kitchen table. I'm worn out and it's getting hard to stay here; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the sensation of your feet on the ground has become the setup for the catastrophic thinking again. I'm going to try to help you come back to the sensation of your body in a different way. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet in your shoes, without trying to think about what it means or what might happen next? Just be with the sensation of your feet, without judgment.

Patient: They're snug, a little warm where my foot presses against the shoe, a dull pressure on the top of my feet. But of course my brain turns that into the next domino — I trip on the stairs, scuff a client's laptop, miss an email because I'm dealing with the fallout, leadership blames me, and I'm fired and back at my parents' kitchen table. I'm getting worn out and it's hard to keep going — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the sensory detail of your feet has become a trigger for the catastrophic thinking again. I'm going to try to help you come back to the physical sensation of your body in a way that's not related to the story. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, without trying to think about anything else? Just the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

Patient: I can feel the air — cool at my nostrils, shallow and a bit ragged — but the quieter I try to be the louder the failure-movie gets: a paused breath becomes a missed email, the dominoes start, I'm fired, back at my parents' kitchen table. It's all getting really exhausting to hold; can we slow down?
