Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling crushed by this sadness and can't seem to get motivated since the job situation went sideways—it's started to mess with my relationship and I snap at my partner a lot. I still teach, but I drift through the day, get distracted, and keep thinking I'm useless, which makes everything feel pointless. I don't really expect therapy to fix anything—how is this supposed to help when I've tried things before and nothing sticks?

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the challenges you're facing. You're already recognizing that your emotions are overwhelming, and that's a good starting point.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel that sense of worthlessness, and what thoughts come up for you in those moments?

Patient: When it starts my chest gets tight and my mind goes into this loop—“I’m useless,” “I’ll never find another job,” “I’m letting everyone down”—and I just freeze. I end up avoiding applications, scrolling to distract myself, then feel guilty and snap at my partner for tiny things. I know it’s irrational but it feels real and nothing I’ve tried sticks—how is talking about these thoughts supposed to help when that hasn’t worked before?

Therapist Answer:
Those words feel very powerful and capable of completely paralyzing you. It's as if your mind is trying to protect you from feeling the emotional pain of letting yourself down, but in doing so, it's causing more harm.

Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to push away those thoughts, you simply acknowledged them as thoughts - just as they are, without judgment - would that feel different for you?

Patient: I mean, maybe in theory that makes sense, but when I try to notice the thought it just spirals and gets louder—“I’m useless” turns into a verdict. How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried mindfulness apps and it just becomes another thing I fail at, though I guess I could try not trying to fix it right away.

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to catch a thought in the act of being just a thought, especially when it's feeling so overwhelming.

Can you tell me about what happens when you do take a step back from those thoughts - even if it's just for a moment - and you do start to make space for something else? What's the first thing that might arise, or what's the smallest, seemingly insignificant thing that might start to show up?

Patient: When I actually manage to step back, the tiniest thing shows up — like noticing the hum of the classroom lights or the warmth of my coffee — and for a few breaths the “I’m useless” voice loosens. It’s dumbly small, but it reminds me I’m not completely broken for a second. Then the guilt or the “you should be doing something” voice barges back in and I lose it, snapping at my partner. How is noticing that five-second pause supposed to help me build real motivation when I’ve tried pausing before and it never sticks?

Therapist Answer:
Those small moments of pause can be a lifeline, even if they're fleeting. It's as if they remind you that there's still some life in you, even when the "I'm useless" voice is loud.

What if, instead of trying to build motivation or control the thoughts, we focus on finding a way to show up for those small, precious moments of pause - like noticing the hum of the classroom lights or the warmth of your coffee? What would it mean for you to prioritize those moments, even if they're just for a brief moment, and see if that changes anything?

Patient: I get the idea of prioritizing tiny pauses, but how is that supposed to help? Noticing the hum for five seconds doesn't pay the bills or stop me from snapping at my partner when I feel useless — it just feels like another thing to fail at. Maybe I could try aiming for one small pause a day, just to see if it reminds me I'm not completely broken, but honestly I'm skeptical this will shift my motivation. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to see how these small moments might be connected to the bigger picture. Let's try to slow down together.

Can you tell me about what's at stake for you when you snap at your partner? What is it about those moments that feels like it's worth saving - is it your relationship, your sense of self-worth, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's the relationship — I'm scared I'll keep pushing them away and end up alone, which would just confirm that whole "you're useless" story in my head. Snapping leaves me full of shame and then that shame feeds the job panic and everything spirals. I know it's worth saving, but honestly how is talking about this going to stop the snapping? Can we slow down — I'm trying to see how this connects and I'm struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like the fear of being alone and the shame of snapping are deeply intertwined for you. That's a really tough knot to untangle.

Let's take a step back from the goal of "saving" the relationship or the job, and instead focus on what's present in this moment. Can you bring to mind what's happening right now, in this moment, that's connected to your fear of snapping - what's the sensation in your body, what's the sensation of your breath, what's the physical sensation in your face or chest when you think about snapping at your partner?

Patient: When I think about snapping, my chest tightens and my breath gets shallow like I can't take a full inhale. My jaw clenches, my face heats up, my hands get restless, and there's this heavy knot in my stomach — sometimes my throat feels like it's closing and I want to either yell or run out of the room. Then the shame hits and everything goes fuzzy and self-critical. I get why you're asking, but how is noticing that supposed to help? Can we slow down — I'm trying to see how this connects and I'm struggling.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your body is telling you a story of intense physical tension and discomfort when you think about snapping at your partner. It's like your body is trying to alert you to the possibility of that scenario, even if your mind is already telling you that you're a failure.

Let's focus on the sensation of that physical tension, rather than the thoughts or emotions that come with it. Can you bring to mind the sensation of that knot in your stomach, or the feeling of your jaw clenched, and see if you can allow it to be, without trying to change it or judge it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try — when I focus on the knot in my stomach it’s tight and dull, like a weight, and my jaw feels locked; letting it be just feels like sitting in the middle of the mess and sometimes makes me panic more. How is sitting with that supposed to stop me from snapping or make me apply for jobs? I can try to notice it for a few breaths, but I'm skeptical and getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to sit with that physical tension without feeling like you're getting stuck in it.

Can you try something small? Instead of trying to let the knot be, what if you simply allowed it to be, without judgment or trying to change it? And then, instead of focusing on the knot, what if you simply noticed your breath? Just the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without trying to control it or change it.

Patient: Okay, I'll try — when I actually pay attention my breath's shallow and quick, and noticing it just makes the knot and my heart feel louder. I can slow it for a few breaths and it eases a tiny bit, but it doesn't stop the panic or the urge to snap or avoid job stuff. How is that supposed to help with anything real? Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and I'm struggling to see the connection.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the panic and the knot are still there, even if the breath is a tiny bit calmer. That's okay. Can you allow that to be, without trying to control it or change it? And then, instead of focusing on the panic or the knot, what if you simply noticed the sensation of your body sitting on the couch or in the classroom, where you are right now? The sensation of the chair, the feeling of the floor beneath you, the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: Alright — when I bring attention to my body I can feel the chair under my thighs, the soles of my feet flat and kind of heavy on the floor, and the air on my forearms; it steadies me for a second so the knot loosens a bit. It helps for like five breaths and then the guilt or the panic barges back in and I think, how is noticing my butt in a chair supposed to stop me from snapping or get me a stable job? I'm getting overwhelmed and frustrated — can we slow down? I'm honestly struggling to see how this connects.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the body's sensations are giving you a tiny bit of stability, but the larger emotions are still swirling around. That's okay. Let's take a step back from trying to control the emotions or the thoughts, and instead focus on the sensation of being present in this moment.

Can you simply notice the sensation of your body relaxing a tiny bit, from being tight to being a bit more heavy? Not trying to change it, not trying to control it, just noticing that it's a bit more heavy, like a gentle weight that's still present?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my shoulders drop a little and my legs feel heavier against the chair, like something's settling in, and that steadies me for a breath or two. But it takes so much out of me to keep doing this, and honestly how is noticing my body supposed to stop the snapping or help with finding steady work? Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see the connection.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the body's relaxation is giving you a small sense of calm, but it's still exhausting to maintain. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. 

Can you try to approach this from a different angle? Instead of focusing on what the noticing is supposed to accomplish, let's explore what's happening for you in this moment, just as it is. What's the sensation of your body relaxing, your shoulders dropping, your legs feeling heavier? Is there anything in this moment that feels pleasant, or even just tolerable?

Patient: My shoulders have actually dropped a bit and my legs feel heavier, like a dull weight that loosens the knot for a breath or two. The warmth from my coffee and the hum of the lights are kind of faintly pleasant — barely, but it's something tolerable. It takes a lot out of me to keep doing this and I keep thinking, how is noticing that supposed to stop me from snapping or make the job thing less awful? Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see the connection.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're finding a small sense of calm in the midst of the chaos. That's a tiny victory.

Can you allow yourself to notice the faint pleasantness of the warmth from your coffee and the hum of the lights without trying to amplify or make it better? Just notice it as it is, without judgment. And then, I want to ask, what would it mean for you if you could tolerate the pain and discomfort of being in this moment, just for a moment longer? Not trying to change it, not trying to make it better, just tolerating it as it is.

Patient: I guess if I could tolerate it a bit longer, it might mean I can ride out the urge to snap and not ruin the moment — maybe it would feel like proof I’m not completely broken, even if it’s tiny. But honestly, how is just sitting with it supposed to stop the cycle or help me find steady work? I’m getting jittery and worn out trying to stay here — can we slow down? I’m really struggling to see the connection.

Therapist Answer:
It's like tolerating the discomfort might give you a tiny bit of confidence that you can handle it, but you're still worried about the bigger picture.

Let's try to focus on the small, tangible aspect of what's happening right now. What's the sensation of your body, just as it is, in this moment? What's the sensation of your breath, the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the chair beneath you? Can you bring that to the surface, without trying to think about the bigger picture or the emotions that come with it?

Patient: Okay — my breath's shallow and fast, my chest feels tight, jaw clenched; my feet are heavy on the floor and the chair supports me, and that steadies me for a second. But my mind keeps darting to all the worst things and I get jittery, like I can't hold the moment. How is focusing on this supposed to help stop the snapping or get me a steady job? Can we slow down — I'm really struggling to stay here.

It's like your breath is still shallow and your body is still tense, and your mind is still racing. That's okay.

Can you try to acknowledge the fact that you're already doing something, right now. You're sitting in a chair, you're breathing, you're noticing your body. That's a small act of courage, just by being present. What does that feel like, in this moment?

Patient: Yeah — sitting here and actually noticing my breath and the chair feels...quiet, like for a second I'm not collapsing under everything. It's small and fragile, and I'm worn out just trying to hold it. But seriously, how is that supposed to stop me from snapping or fix the job mess? Can we slow down? I'm having a hard time staying with this.

It's like there's a small sense of calm, but it's fragile and fleeting. That's okay.

Can you try to notice the sensation of your body being worn out, of being exhausted, without judgment? Not trying to change it, not trying to fix it, just noticing it as it is. What does that feel like, in this moment?

Patient: It feels like my whole body is made of lead — shoulders and legs heavy, eyelids drooping — but my head's fizzing and won't settle. There's a hollow tightness in my chest and a jittery restlessness in my hands, like I'm exhausted and on edge at the same time. I can notice it, but it takes everything not to bolt, and honestly how is paying attention to this supposed to stop me from snapping or help me get a job? Can we slow down — I'm really struggling to stay here.

It's like your body is a jumble of heavy and light, of exhaustion and agitation. That's a really intense feeling.

Can you try to pay attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or fix it. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without judgment. Can you allow the restlessness in your hands and the jitteriness in your chest to be present, without trying to calm them down or make them go away?

Patient: Okay...when I tune into my breath it's shallow and jerky, my hands won't stop fidgeting and my mind keeps flipping to the worst-case stuff. It settles me for a breath or two but then the panic spikes again, and I really don't see how this is going to stop me from snapping or help me find steady work. Can we slow down? It's taking a lot out of me to keep doing this and I'm struggling to stay here.

It's like your breath is still shallow and your body is still restless, and the worst-case thoughts are still swirling around. That's okay.

Can you try to notice that you're doing the best you can, right now, in this moment. That you're showing up, that you're trying to pay attention, that you're being kind to yourself by sitting with this difficult feeling. What does that feel like, in this moment?

Patient: Yeah... I can tell myself that, and for a breath or two it feels like a tiny softening in my chest — like a thin patch over a big sore. But it feels fragile and useless next to the real stuff — bills, the job hunt, not snapping at my partner — so I keep thinking, how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm having a hard time staying here.

It's like that softening in your chest is a small oasis in the midst of the bigger pain and worry. That's okay.

Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the chair beneath you, the sensation of the air on your skin? Can you allow yourself to be present with those sensations, without trying to think about the big picture or the emotions? Just notice what's right here, in this moment.

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor, the chair's kind of firm under my thighs, and the air on my forearms is cool — it calms me for a breath or two. But I keep getting drained trying to do this and I honestly don't see how noticing that will stop me from snapping or get me a steady job. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay present.

Patient: Okay... if I really let myself stay there my shoulders drop a bit more, the knot in my stomach loosens for a few breaths, and my breathing gets a little deeper — it feels like a tiny gap in the noise. For that moment I don't want to bolt or snap, which is...something. But then the guilt and the "you should be doing more" voice sneaks back and I wonder, how is this supposed to help with finding steady work or not wrecking my relationship? Can we slow down?
