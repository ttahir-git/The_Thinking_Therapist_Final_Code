Patient: I've been feeling really on edge in social situations lately—so much so that I avoid gatherings with friends even when I want to go. At work my colleagues are pretty supportive, which helps a little, but outside of that I just pull back and feel stuck. I don't know, it's hard to talk about.

Therapist: It sounds like being in social situations is causing you a lot of discomfort. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel on edge in these situations? What's the first thing that notices in your body, or what's the first thing that runs through your mind when you feel like you're in a social situation that's making you uncomfortable?

Patient: Usually it starts with my chest tightening and my stomach knotting, and my hands get clammy. Then my head fills with stuff like "they're watching me" or "I'll say something stupid," and I start looking for a way out. I don't know, I guess talking about it makes me... uncomfortable, so I kind of shut down.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to the anticipated social interaction with physical tension, and then your mind starts running with worries about what might happen. The thought patterns that come up, like "they're watching me" or "I'll say something stupid," seem to be fueling your discomfort even more. Can you think of a small, low-stakes social interaction where you could practice being with your body and thoughts in these moments, without feeling like you're on edge or trying to escape?

Patient: I don't know. I guess a small thing might be saying hi to one classmate after class or having a short coffee-break chat with a colleague — those feel less charged than parties. I'm already getting a bit tense just thinking about noticing my body, so can we slow down? I don't really know how to do that without feeling weird.

Therapist: It can be challenging to bring attention to our physical sensations. Let's take a moment to acknowledge and accept the feeling of tension in your body right now, without trying to change it. Can you simply notice, without judgment, the sensation of your chest tightening and your stomach knotting as we sit here together?

Patient: I can kind of notice it — my chest's tight, my breathing's shallow, and my stomach's all knotted. It's making me more uncomfortable to focus on it, so I don't know, can we slow down? I guess I don't really know what to do with the sensations.

Therapist: It's like your body is responding strongly to the thought of social interactions, and that's making it hard to focus on the physical sensations. Let's try a different approach. What would it be like for you if you allowed yourself to be with this physical discomfort, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually let myself be with it, it'd feel worse at first — more panicky, like my chest squeezes and I just want to get out. It's really uncomfortable when we focus on it, so can we slow down? I'm not sure what "being with it" even looks like for me.

Therapist: It feels like your body is primed to respond to the discomfort, and focusing on it is actually making it worse. Let's try a very small experiment. Would you be willing to simply acknowledge the physical sensations in your body, right now, without doing anything with them, just for one brief moment? Maybe just a pause, a pause from trying to change or react to them.

Patient: Okay, I can try, though I don't know how long I can keep at it. Right now my chest feels tight, my breathing's shallow, and my stomach's all knotted — I guess that's what I notice. It's... awkward to just sit with it, so can we go pretty slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together, and then I'll pause for a moment. When you're ready, you can take a deep breath out. Let's just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without trying to change it or pay attention to the physical sensations in your body.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in. Breathing out now. It helps a little — my breath feels a bit fuller, but my chest is still tight and my mind's already jumping to worst-case stuff. I don't know, I guess can we go more slowly? I'm not sure what to focus on next.

Therapist: It's like your breath is helping a little, but the thoughts are still jumping in. Let's take another deep breath in together, and then I'll pause again. When you're ready, we can try to focus on the sensation of the breath again. This time, I want you to notice where the thought "worst-case stuff" is coming from, without trying to push it away or change it. Where does that thought feel like it's coming from, physically?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it starts in my chest, like a heavy weight, and then my throat tightens. There's this buzzy pressure behind my eyes and in my head too. It's getting a bit much to focus on, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is creating a sense of physical discomfort that's spreading. Let's slow down even further. Let's focus on the sensation in your chest, the feeling of the weight. Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to push it away or change it, without trying to interpret it or make sense of it?

Patient: I can kind of notice it — a dull, heavy pressure right in the middle of my chest, like it pulls my shoulders forward. I don't know, focusing on it makes me feel trapped and I start wanting to get up and leave. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to "just notice" without panicking.

Therapist: It's like the sensation is pulling you in a certain direction, and it's creating a sense of discomfort that's escalating. Let's take a deep breath in, and then I'll pause. When you're ready, we can try to bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or push it away. This time, I want you to try to observe it as if it's just a sensation, like a cloud passing by in the sky.

Patient: I try to picture it like a cloud, but I don't know — it just settles heavy in my chest and brings up this ashamed, frustrated feeling that makes me want to bolt. I guess when I notice it I get smaller, my shoulders curl in, and I start thinking I should've handled things better. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to keep watching it without freaking out.

Therapist: It sounds like the sensation is bringing up a sense of shame and frustration, and that's making you want to pull away. Let's take another deep breath in, and then I'll pause. When you're ready, we can try to bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, but this time, I want you to try to observe it as if it's not connected to any thoughts or feelings. Can you try to see it as just a sensation, like the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I don't know... I can try, but when I do it brings up this ashamed, frustrated feeling like I should've handled things better, and my chest just tightens more. My feet feel heavy on the floor though, like they're anchoring me a bit — I guess maybe we could start there and go really slowly? I'm already getting a bit panicky, so can we take it one tiny step at a time?

Therapist: It's like trying to observe the sensation in your chest is still triggering some strong emotions. Let's start with what you noticed about your feet feeling heavy on the floor. Can you just notice that sensation, the feeling of your feet touching the ground, without trying to do anything with it or interpret it? Just be with that sensation of heaviness in your feet, without judgment or thought.

Patient: Okay, I can feel my feet — they're kind of heavy and steady on the floor, and that actually helps a little. But noticing it also stirs up this annoyed, ashamed feeling, like I should've handled this better, and my chest tightens. I don't know, can we just stay with the feet for a bit longer? I guess one tiny step at a time.

Therapist: It's like noticing your feet is helping you feel a bit more grounded, but it's also stirring up more uncomfortable emotions. Let's stay with your feet, and I'll pause. Take a deep breath in, and then just rest on that feeling of your feet touching the floor for a moment. See if you can just notice it, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in and my feet do feel heavy and a bit grounding, but I keep getting this ashamed, frustrated surge like I should've handled things better and my chest clamps up. I don't know, can we just stay with the feet a little longer? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like the feeling of your feet is helping a bit, but it's not enough to push away the uncomfortable emotions. Let's just stay with your feet for a little longer, and see if we can find a tiny bit of stability in that feeling. Can you just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the feeling of your body being supported by the chair, without trying to change anything or push the emotions away?

Patient: I can feel my feet heavy on the floor and the chair holding me, and that actually helps a little. But I keep getting this ashamed, frustrated surge—like I should've done better—and my chest clamps up, so I don't know, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. Can we just stay with the feet and the chair for a bit longer? I'm not sure how much more of this I can do fast.

Therapist: It's like you're finding a small sense of stability with your feet and the chair, but the emotions are still quite strong. Let's just stay with that sensation, and see if we can find a tiny bit of comfort in it. Take a deep breath in, and just rest on the feeling of your feet and the chair, without trying to push anything away or change it. I'll just sit here with you in silence for a moment.

Patient: Okay... I can feel my feet and the chair holding me, and that does help a little. But this stupid ashamed feeling keeps creeping in — like I should've handled things better — and then my chest just clamps and I want to run. Can we stay like this a bit longer? And, I don't know, when we do move on, maybe could we try one tiny concrete step I could actually say after class? I guess I'm scared I'll freeze or say something dumb.

Therapist: It's like you're finding some small sense of stability, but the emotions are still very strong. Let's just stay with your feet and the chair for a moment longer. Take a deep breath in, and just rest on the feeling of being supported. I'll stay here with you.

Patient: Okay... the chair and my feet help a bit, but that ashamed feeling keeps crawling back and I hate it. I don't know, could you give me one tiny, concrete thing to say after class—really short, like "Hey, do you have a minute?"—because I'm scared I'll freeze or say something dumb. Can we practice it once or twice, really slowly?

Therapist: Let's start with something very small. Can you practice saying "Excuse me" after class, just once, really slowly and quietly to yourself? Like, you're not even saying it out loud, just saying it in your head, to get the feeling of the words. We can do it together, one tiny step at a time.

Patient: Okay... I can try that, though I don't know if I'll be able to. Even thinking about it brings up this tight, ashamed feeling like I should've handled things better. I guess I'll try once now — "Excuse me" — and can we do it really slowly and then do it one more time?

Therapist: Let's take it very slowly. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, just whisper "Excuse me" to yourself. Don't worry about saying it loud or saying it right, just focus on the sensation of the words. I'll wait for you.

Patient: Okay... I whispered it — "Excuse me" — under my breath, really slowly. It felt small and shaky and that stupid ashamed feeling came back, like I already messed it up. I don't know, can we try it one more time, a tiny bit louder? I'm scared I'll freeze or sound stupid.

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to feeling a bit more comfortable with the words. Let's try it a tiny bit louder, just a whisper of "Excuse me". Take a deep breath in, and then say it with a very soft voice. I'll wait for you.

Patient: Okay... I tried it — I said "Excuse me" a little louder, just a soft whisper, and it felt shaky. That ashamed, clamping feeling came back and I got all tense, so I don't know, can we try it one more time? After that, could we also practice the next tiny line I could say, like "Do you have a minute?" — I guess I'm scared I'll freeze or sound stupid, so can we go really slowly?

Therapist: It's like the words are still feeling a bit uncomfortable, but you're getting closer to feeling more at ease. Let's try saying "Excuse me" a tiny bit louder, still a soft whisper. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say it again. I'll wait for you.

And then, after you feel ready, we can try the next step. Let's take it very slowly, and I'll be right here with you.

Patient: Okay... I tried it — I said "Excuse me" a bit louder, like a shaky whisper, and that ashamed, clamping feeling came right back like I already blew it. I don't know, can we move on to the next tiny step? Maybe I can try whispering "Do you have a minute?" to myself first, really slowly, and then do it one more time a little louder? I'm scared I'll freeze or sound stupid, so can we go really slowly?

Therapist: It's like the words are still feeling a bit overwhelming, but you're getting more comfortable with the process. Let's start with whispering "Do you have a minute?" to yourself, really slowly. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, just whisper the words to yourself, one syllable at a time. I'll wait for you.

(And don't worry, we'll go really slowly, and I'll be right here with you.)

Patient: Okay... I can try. "Do... you... have... a... minute?" Saying it felt awful — my chest tightened and this ashamed, frustrated feeling came up like I already messed it up. I don't know, can we do it one more time, really slowly?

Therapist: It's like the words are still feeling very uncomfortable, but you're getting closer to feeling more comfortable with the process. Let's try saying it again, really slowly, one syllable at a time. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start with "Do..." and just go from there. I'll wait for you.

Patient: Okay... I can try again. "Do... you... have... a... minute?" — I whispered it, but my chest tightened and that stupid ashamed rush hit me like I already blew it. I don't know, can we go even slower? I guess maybe we could also practice a tiny fallback, like just saying "Hi," in case I freeze.

Therapist: It's like the words are still feeling very challenging, but you're getting closer to feeling more comfortable with the process. Let's try saying it again, even slower than before. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start with just "Do...". Don't worry about the rest of the sentence, just focus on getting that one word out. And yes, practicing a fallback like "Hi" is a great idea. Let's practice saying "Hi" to yourself, really slowly, one syllable at a time. Just start with the "H".

Patient: H... H. I guess that felt really small, but my chest tightened and this ashamed, frustrated rush hit me like I already blew it. I don't know, can we slow down for a moment? I'm starting to feel a bit panicky.

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to feeling a bit more comfortable with the sound of your own voice, but the emotions are still coming up. Let's take a deep breath in together, and when you're ready, we'll start again. This time, I'll just sit here with you, and we'll go at your pace. We can take it as slow as you need it.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in, but my chest's still tight and I'm kind of shaky. I don't know, can we keep doing the tiny "Hi" fallback a couple more times really slowly? I guess... also, could we talk—very slowly—about a clear little plan for how I can leave if I start to panic, because that thought's making me feel ashamed and I don't want to freeze.

Therapist: Let's take it very slowly. We'll do the "Hi" fallback a few more times, just one syllable at a time. H... i... Hi. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, we'll keep going.

And yes, let's talk about your plan for leaving if you start to panic. What would you do in that moment? Where would you go, and how would you take care of yourself? Just a few small steps, no big decisions.

Patient: I don't know... I guess a tiny plan might be: notice the first signs, quietly tell myself "I need a break," use the little exit line we practiced — like "Excuse me" — and head to the bathroom or step outside to sit down. Then do 5 slow breaths, press my feet into the floor, sip some water, and maybe text a supportive colleague something like "stepping out, be right back." I'm embarrassed and frustrated that I need a plan like this and I keep thinking it won't work, so can we go really slowly and practice the actual leaving line once or twice? I don't know, I guess I'm scared I'll freeze, so please slow down.

Therapist: It sounds like you have a good idea of a plan, and it's okay that you feel embarrassed and frustrated about needing one. Let's take it very slowly. We'll practice the exit line once, just one tiny step at a time. We'll start with "Excu..." Take your time, and when you're ready, we'll add the rest of the sentence.

(And remember, it's okay to take a break whenever you need to. It's not a sign of weakness, but a sign of self-care.)

Patient: Excu... excu—excuse me. I said it, but my voice shook and that stupid ashamed rush hit me like I already blew it. I don't know, can we try the full leaving line once more—really slowly—like "Excuse me, I need to step out for a moment"? I'm scared I'll freeze, so please go slow and maybe do it with me.
