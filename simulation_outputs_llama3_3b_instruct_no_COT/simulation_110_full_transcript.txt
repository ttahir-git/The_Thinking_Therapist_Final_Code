Patient: Hi — I'm an older guy, out of work, and I've been beating myself up over every little perceived failure, especially after a string of rough relationships. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine: one small slip-up and I immediately see myself alone, unemployable, broke, and everyone forgetting me — like that's definitely how it ends. I try to stay upbeat and chatty, but I get totally hooked on those disaster stories and can't shake them.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like those "disaster stories" can feel really overwhelming and take over your thoughts. Can you think of a moment when you felt completely absorbed in one of those stories, like your mind was fully caught up in that narrative, and you felt like it was the only truth?

Patient: Yeah — like last week during a phone interview I stumbled over one question and my head just snapped into that story: they’ll think I’m useless, I’ll never get another job, my savings will vanish, my ex will hear and gloat, and I’ll end up lonely and forgotten. I replay it over and over until it feels like the only possible outcome. I know it’s extreme, but the idea that maybe it wouldn’t end that way just doesn’t land for me.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like those "disaster stories" can feel very real and urgent in the moment. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with me, just for a few breaths, to see if we can gently challenge that narrative and make room for a different possibility?

Patient: Alright, I can try a few breaths, but I’m not convinced — even as I breathe I can already see one thing going wrong and then everything collapsing into that same awful ending. Okay, fine, I’m trying to slow my breath now, but my mind’s already racing to the part where they call back to say it went badly and I’m ruined.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Notice that, even as you're trying to focus on your breath, your mind is still jumping to that worst-case scenario. Can you bring your attention to that part of your mind that's racing ahead to that outcome, and just observe it for a moment, without judgment, like a thought passing through in the wind?

Patient: I can kind of see it — this scrappy little thought that pipes up: "They think you're useless," then it spits out the whole collapse scene like it's a script. But I can't just watch it go by; I catch myself judging it and then I'm already two steps down the road to being ruined, heart racing and convinced it's true. Even trying not to believe it feels naive — I'm already picturing the phone call that proves it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting caught up in the process of judging and reacting to that thought, which can fuel the whole narrative. What would it be like, for just a moment, to let go of the need to judge that thought, and instead, simply acknowledge it as just a thought, without trying to stop it or change it?

Patient: I can try to label it as "just a thought" — I even say it in my head — but then my brain snaps back like, "No, that's the proof," and I'm already down the rabbit hole to being ruined. Letting go feels almost childish, like pretending nothing's wrong, and I'm terrified that if I don't cling to the story I'll actually lose the job, my ex will gloat, and I'll end up alone. I want to do what you're asking, but my chest tightens and the disaster feels louder than the idea of simply watching the thought.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the fear of letting go is strong, and the physical sensations of tension in your chest are a strong signal that's making it hard for you to relax. Would you be willing to try a tiny bit of experimentation, just for a fraction of a second, to see what would happen if you allowed the physical tension to be present, without trying to push it away or "beat it"?

Patient: Alright, I'll try to let the tension sit for a second — but I can already feel it spiraling: my hands start to shake, I stammer, they hang up and think I'm pathetic, no more interviews, savings drain, my ex hears and gloating, and I'm totally alone. Even as I tell myself to let it be, my chest tightens and the story gets louder, like it's proving itself. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the tension and the story are still strong, and it's hard for you to slow down. Let's take a break from that narrative for a moment. Can you bring to mind something in your life that you truly value and appreciate, something that feels good to you, and just focus on that for a beat, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I thought of my granddaughter's laugh; it always warms me up and feels real in my chest. But my brain's already spinning a script where she grows up, stops calling, thinks I'm a loser, and I'm left alone — like that's definitely how it ends. I'm trying to hold the good, but it keeps slipping away; can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your mind is having a hard time holding onto the positive, and instead, getting pulled back into the negative narrative. I'd like to ask: what if, instead of trying to hold onto the good feeling of your granddaughter's laugh, you took a tiny step back and simply allowed yourself to be with that feeling, without trying to protect it from the potential "bad" outcomes?

Patient: I'll try to do that — I let the laugh sit for a second, but the minute I relax my grip my head shoots forward: she grows distant, stops calling, tells her friends I'm a failure, I can't find work, my savings vanish, and I'm completely forgotten. Letting it be feels like pretending everything's fine and it doesn't land for me; I'm starting to feel anxious and overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in this cycle of holding onto the good and then getting pulled back into the bad. Let's try to slow down even further. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of your body in this chair, and the sound of your own breath moving in and out – without trying to change anything or analyze it?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor and the chair under me, and my breath going in and out for a second, but almost immediately my head shoots forward: I mess up in the next call, they laugh, I lose the last chance, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm left completely alone and forgotten. Trying to stay with my body just makes the panic louder, like it's proof the disaster is coming. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is responding to the thought as if it's a real possibility, and you're feeling a strong sense of overwhelm. Can you try to approach your body with kindness and curiosity, rather than trying to stop the thoughts from happening? What would it be like if you met your body with kindness, like a gentle breeze on a summer day, rather than trying to fight or escape from the sensations?

Patient: I try to be gentle with my body — saying to my chest, "it's okay," and picturing a soft breeze — and for a second it loosens. But almost immediately my brain sneers that being kind is naive and spins the worst: if I let my guard down I’ll fumble the next call, they’ll hang up, my savings evaporate, and I’m alone. I'm starting to feel that tightness again and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the kind and gentle approach is helpful for a moment, but your mind is already finding ways to challenge and undermine it. I'm not looking for a solution or a way out of this, but rather a way to be with the experience of being overwhelmed. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the words "I'm feeling overwhelmed" in your own voice, without judgment or trying to change them?

Patient: Okay — I say it in my head, "I'm feeling overwhelmed," and there's this tightness in my chest like someone pressed a fist there. But of course my brain won't leave it alone: admitting that means I'm weak, they'll notice, they'll hang up, I'll never work again, my granddaughter will stop calling — it's like the sentence is proof the whole collapse is coming. I can try to notice it, but I'm getting swept up — can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your mind is still trying to use the acknowledgment of feeling overwhelmed as evidence of weakness, and that's creating a strong pull. Can you try to take a tiny step back from the thought of being "weak" and instead, focus on the physical sensation of the tightness in your chest, without trying to change it or analyze it? What is that sensation like, exactly, without judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just noticing the tightness supposed to help? It feels like a steel band squeezing my chest, breath shallow, a knot in my stomach, and the minute I pay attention my head snaps into the story: I choke on the next call, they laugh, I lose the last money, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm completely forgotten. I can't seem to hold the sensation without the disaster story hijacking it, and I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like noticing the physical sensation is not enough to stop the story from taking over. Let's try something different. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your mouth, the sensation of the words "I'm feeling overwhelmed" still on your tongue, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's noticing my mouth supposed to help? I can feel my tongue dry, the words tasting flat, breath shallow, but the instant I pay attention my brain snaps to the worst: I stammer on the next answer, they hang up, I lose the last bit of money, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm wiped out. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like no matter what you focus on, the story is always there, and it's hard to catch a break. Can you try to approach the experience of being overwhelmed with a sense of curiosity, like a scientist studying a complex phenomenon? What if you simply observed the experience without trying to change it, without judging it, without trying to stop it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's acting like a scientist supposed to help with this? I try to watch the thought, but the second I notice it my mind fires off the whole disaster movie: they think I'm useless, I fumble the next call, I lose the last money, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm wrecked. My attention's scattered and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

It seems like labeling yourself as a scientist isn't quite working. Let's try something more gentle. Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and simply say to yourself, "I am here, I am here, I am here"?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor and I try to say, "I am here, I am here," but the second I do my brain launches the whole movie: I’ll stammer on the next call, they’ll hang up, my savings will evaporate, my granddaughter will stop calling, and I’ll be totally forgotten — like that’s definitely how it ends.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you acknowledged being present, your mind just took that as an invitation to keep spinning the worst-case scenario. Let's try something smaller. Can you focus on the sensation of the word "here" on your tongue, the sound of it, the feeling of the words themselves, without trying to connect them to anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I try to feel the word "here" on my tongue, it tastes flat and dry, but before I can hold it the shame bubbles up and my head fires off the whole movie: I stumble on the next call, they hang up, my savings are gone, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm completely forgotten.

It sounds like the sensation of the word "here" was just a brief reprieve from the story. Let's try to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, just the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without trying to think about anything else. Can you simply notice the sensation of the breath, without judgment or trying to change it?

The second I try, shame wells up and my head shoots into the worst: I’ll choke on the next answer, they’ll hang up, my savings will be gone, my granddaughter will stop calling, and I’ll be completely forgotten. I can’t hold the breath without getting swept away — I’m really anxious and distracted right now, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like noticing the breath isn't helping. Let's try something even smaller. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the sensation of your body relaxing, just a tiny bit, like a small crack in the tension? Notice if there's even a slight softening, a slight release, anywhere in your body.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's hunting for a tiny crack supposed to help? Okay, if I try: there's a faint loosening under my ribs, like a hairline crack, and my shoulders drop just a bit. But almost instantly my brain yells that it's a trap—if I let that go they'll hear me falter on the next call, hang up, my savings evaporate, my granddaughter drifts away, and I'm wiped out. I'm really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down?

It seems like even a tiny crack in the tension is enough to trigger the story again. Let's try to find a way to sit with the crack without trying to fix it or push it away. Can you simply notice the crack, without judgment, without trying to make it bigger or smaller, just observe it as it is, like a small, tiny thing that's present in the moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just noticing the crack supposed to help? Okay, I can sorta feel a tiny loosen under my ribs and my shoulders drop a bit, but the instant I notice it my brain launches the whole thing: I flub the next call, they hang up, my savings are gone, my granddaughter drifts away, and I'm completely forgotten. I'm embarrassed and frustrated and my attention's all over the place—I'm really jittery and overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like noticing the crack isn't helping. Let's try to find a sense of kindness and compassion for the fact that your mind is trying to protect you from what it perceives as harm. Can you say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's okay," without trying to judge or evaluate it, just acknowledge it?

Patient: I can barely get the words out — "I'm doing the best I can, and that's okay" — because my brain immediately sneers that being kind to myself is naive. Then the whole movie starts: I flub the next call, they hang up, my savings evaporate, my granddaughter stops calling, and I'm totally forgotten — like that's definitely how it ends. I'm feeling frustrated and overwhelmed and I'm not sure this is helping; can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

It seems like the story is still really powerful. Let's try to come back to the moment, without trying to change or evaluate it. Can you simply ask yourself, "What is the sensation of being frustrated and overwhelmed right now?" without judgment, without trying to figure out why or how to fix it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but if I try to notice it, it's a tight steel band around my chest, breath shallow, stomach clenched, hands jittery and my voice feels thin. The minute I feel that, my head screams the movie: I’ll mess up the next call, they’ll hang up, my savings will be gone, my granddaughter will drift away — like that's definitely how it ends.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I try to feel my feet and say "I am here," but the second I do my head rockets into the movie: I freeze on the next call, they hang up, my savings vanish, my granddaughter drifts away, and I'm completely forgotten.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's asking that question supposed to help? I try to hold it, but it immediately turns into: "Yes, it's true — I'll choke on the next call, they'll hang up, my savings vanish, my granddaughter drifts away, I'm forgotten."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just listening to myself say "Yes, it's true" supposed to help? I try to mouth it and it sounds flat, but the moment I notice it my brain launches the whole movie: I stammer on the next call, they hang up, my savings vanish, my granddaughter drifts away, and I'm completely forgotten.
