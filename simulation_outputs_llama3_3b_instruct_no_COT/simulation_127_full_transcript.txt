Patient: I've been using exercise as a way to escape this empty-nest stuff—running and pushing myself so I don't have to feel anything. My head is like a fortune-telling machine: it says if I stop numbing, I'll spiral, mess up at work, my kids will drift away, and I'll end up totally alone and ruined — and it feels like that's definitely what's going to happen. I know that sounds over the top, but I can't seem to shake the stories; they grab me and I can't see any other outcome.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that these thoughts are holding you back. Can you tell me more about what it's like when these thoughts show up and you feel like you're not making progress, and how that feeling of not making progress makes you feel?

Patient: When those thoughts show up my chest tightens and this urgent itch starts — like I have to run or lift until I can't feel anything. The fortune-telling part of my head starts narrating the worst: I stop numbing, I mess up at work, my kids drift away, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — and it feels like that's definitely going to happen. Not making progress feels like proof I'm failing, which makes me frantic and push even harder with exercise, so nothing actually changes. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't seem to see any other outcome; the stories just yank me around.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body and mind are really reacting to the uncertainty of this empty-nest time. That urgent itch you mentioned, it feels like it's pulling you in the direction of exercise as a way to avoid those feelings, even though it's not making a difference in the long run. Can you explore what might happen if you were to make room for a different experience, like sitting with the feeling of uncertainty and discomfort, without needing to immediately respond with exercise?

Patient: When I try to sit with it, my mind screams that if I don't burn it off I'll crack open—cry in a meeting, say the wrong thing, get demoted, lose the house, the kids will stop calling, and I'll be left totally alone—like I can see that chain happening for sure. The chest tightness becomes unbearable so I can't stay; exercise is the only thing that short-circuits that story. I get that you're suggesting something else, but honestly that feels unrealistic to me—like I'm just waiting for the disaster if I don't act.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sense of safety you're trying to maintain is tied to the idea that you need to be able to immediately respond with exercise to avoid the worst-case scenario. You feel like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, and that's what's driving your behavior. What would it be like for you to pause the narrative for just a brief moment, and instead of acting on the urge to exercise, you simply acknowledge the feeling in your chest, without judgment, without trying to escape or change it?

Patient: If I pause even a few seconds my head yells that the whole chain starts — I'll get shaky, say something dumb in a meeting, get reprimanded, get demoted, lose the house, the kids stop calling, and I'm totally alone. Just picturing that makes my chest slam and I start reaching for my shoes before I can think. I know it sounds irrational, but it feels absolutely certain, so pausing feels impossible and almost reckless. I'm getting overwhelmed just imagining not doing it and I don't know how to even start.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where the uncertainty of pausing and the potential for the worst-case scenario are felt as equally unworkable. It's like you're stuck between the two extremes of acting on the urge to exercise to avoid the potential disaster, or being paralyzed by the fear of what might happen if you don't. What's the one thing that your values tell you is important to you about being a parent, or a person, that might be worth holding onto, even in the midst of this uncertainty?

Patient: I really want to be someone my kids can count on—to stay connected, show them kindness, and model that it's okay to struggle. But the fortune-teller in my head immediately says if I stop numbing I'll blow it—I'll say something stupid, they'll pull away, and I'll lose them for good. I do want to hold those values, but I'm scared stiff and don't know how to keep them without the exercise crutch.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being a supportive and kind parent is a core value that's really important to you. And yet, the voice in your head is telling you that you're not good enough to embody that, that you'll fail and your kids will suffer as a result. Would it be possible for you to take a tiny step, just a small moment, to hold onto the value of being present and kind, even if that means being unsure or vulnerable, without the need to exercise to avoid the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I guess I could imagine a tiny step—like standing there for thirty seconds before I put my shoes on—but the fortune-teller in my head screams that those thirty seconds will start the whole chain: I’ll get shaky, say something stupid in a meeting, get reprimanded, demoted, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling. Just picturing that makes my chest slam and I start reaching for my shoes; it feels reckless to even try. I’m getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don’t know where to start.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like even a small attempt to take a tiny step feels daunting because of the intensity of the fear of failure. Can we try to break it down even further? Instead of focusing on standing for thirty seconds, let's start with just noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground right now, without getting up or doing anything else. Just be present with your feet and the feeling of them touching the ground.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try — I can feel my feet on the floor for a beat and it actually feels a little grounding, but the fortune-teller immediately screams that those seconds will lead to me fumbling in a meeting, getting reprimanded, and eventually losing everything, even my kids. My chest’s already tightening and my hand’s reaching for my shoes; this is really hard — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the mind is already racing ahead to the worst-case scenario, even as you're trying to focus on the present moment. Can you pause for just a single breath, without getting up or doing anything else, and simply acknowledge the sensation of your chest tightening and your hand reaching for your shoes? Can you name that physical sensation, just as it is, without judgment?

Patient: Okay—taking a breath: my chest feels like a heavy clamp, my breathing is shallow, my stomach's tight, and my hand is already curling toward my shoe. I can try to name it without judging, but the fortune-teller immediately screams that those sensations mean I'm about to fumble in a meeting, get reprimanded, and everything will spiral—so the physical stuff feels like proof, not just a feeling. This is really intense—can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with it longer without panicking.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical sensations are being used as evidence for the worst-case scenario, making it feel even more overwhelming. Let's try to explore this further. Can you touch your hand to your leg, just to ground yourself in the physical sensation of the touch, and see if that changes anything?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my leg. The warmth and the slight pressure actually feel a bit grounding, like my chest eased just a hair and my breath slowed. But the fortune-teller immediately screams that this tiny calm is a trap — that I'll relax, fumble in the meeting, get reprimanded, and then everything unravels — so my other hand's already half reaching for my shoe and I'm panicking again. I'm really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep doing this.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the moment of calm is already being turned into a threat by the fortune-teller. Let's try to explore this further. What would happen if, instead of trying to push through the panic, you were to simply acknowledge the story that's arising, without judgment? Not trying to stop it, not trying to change it, just noticing it as it is?

Patient: If I try to notice the story, I can say to myself, "that's the fortune-teller saying I'll mess up in the meeting, get demoted, lose the house, and end up alone," but naming it doesn't make it quieter — it feels like I'm watching a train wreck in slow motion and my chest just tightens more. Acknowledging it almost feels like giving it permission, so instead of calming down it fuels the panic and my hand's halfway to my shoes. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with it without falling apart.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like naming the story is actually fueling the panic, rather than calming it down. Let's try a different approach. What if, instead of focusing on the story, you were to turn your attention to the sensation of your hand on your leg, and just see if that can be a kind of anchor for you? Can you gently bring your attention back to the physical sensation of your hand touching your leg, without trying to analyze or label it?

Patient: Okay... my hand on my leg is warm and kind of steady for a beat, and that actually feels a little calming. But the fortune-teller is already yelling that if I relax I'll fumble in the meeting, get reprimanded, lose the house, and end up alone, so my other hand's already itching for my shoes. I'm feeling pretty drained—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like even the brief moment of calm is being threatened by the fortune-teller's narrative. I'd like to try something different. Can you just look at the hand on your leg, without trying to analyze or label it, and instead, simply ask yourself: "What would be the kind of experience that would make this hand feel safe and at ease on my leg?"

Patient: Maybe if the hand felt steady and warm, like I had permission to just breathe for a minute and not have to do anything—no urgency, no performance—that would make it feel safe. But the fortune-teller screams that that permission is reckless, that if I relax the whole chain starts—I'll fumble at work, get reprimanded, lose everything, and the kids will drift away. It's wearing me out—can we slow down? I don't know how to keep going without panicking.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the idea of feeling safe and at ease is being twisted into a threat by the fortune-teller. Let's try to explore this further. Can you imagine yourself in a situation where you're able to feel safe and at ease, without the pressure to perform or avoid the worst-case scenario? What would that look like for you?

Patient: I can picture a smaller version—sitting on the porch with a cup of tea, the kids popping over for a casual visit, me listening more than performing, and if I fumble a little at work it's noticed but forgiven. But the fortune-teller in my head immediately says that's a trap—that if I let myself be at ease I'll slack off, make a big mistake in a meeting, get demoted, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling and I'm ruined. Even as I try to hold the calm image, it feels like a fragile postcard about to be shredded, and I can't really trust it. I'm kind of worn out by all this—can we slow down a bit?

It sounds like the calm image you pictured is being threatened by the fortune-teller's narrative, and you're struggling to hold onto it. Let's try to ground ourselves in the present moment, without trying to grasp onto the image or analyze it. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to think about the fortune-teller or the narrative?

Patient: My feet feel solid on the floor and the air on my skin is cool for a second, and that actually quiets me a little. But the fortune-teller is already yelling that if I stay calm I'll fumble in the meeting, get demoted, lose the house, and be alone—my hand's already edging for my shoes and I'm pretty wiped; can we slow down?

It's like the moment of calm is fragile and fleeting. Let's try to hold onto that quiet feeling for just a tiny bit longer. Can you take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow the sensation of your feet feeling solid on the floor to stay with you, without trying to analyze or change it?

Patient: Okay—I breathe out and for a second my feet feel solid and it eases a bit. But the fortune-teller's already yelling that this calm is a trap—that I'll fumble in the meeting, get demoted, lose everything, and the kids will drift away—my hand's already inching for my shoes.

It sounds like the fortune-teller's narrative is becoming more insistent. Let's try to explore this further. What if, instead of trying to push through the narrative or analyze it, you simply acknowledge it, and then let it go, without judgment? Can you say to yourself, "That's the fortune-teller saying... and then just let it go"?

Patient: I can try—"that's the fortune-teller saying I'll fumble in the meeting, get demoted, lose the house, and end up alone"—but saying it out loud just seems to make it louder, like I'm naming it hands it more fuel. My chest clamps and my hand's already for my shoes; I'm kind of beat—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying it out loud actually amplified the narrative. Let's try something a bit different. Can you simply look at the sensation of your hand on your leg, and notice that it's still warm and slightly steady?

Patient: It's warm and steady for a beat and that actually eases my chest a little, but the fortune-teller's already shouting that if I relax I'll fumble in the meeting, get demoted, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling.

It sounds like the moment of calm is being disrupted again. Let's try to anchor ourselves in the physical sensation of your hand on your leg, and see if we can find a way to stay with it for just one more moment. Can you notice the sensation of your hand touching your leg, and allow yourself to stay with that sensation, without trying to change it or think about the narrative?

Patient: Okay... my hand on my leg is warm and kind of steady for a beat and that actually calms me a tiny bit, but the fortune-teller's already shouting that if I relax I'll fumble in the meeting, get reprimanded, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling. My other hand's twitching toward my shoes and my chest's clamping—I'm jittery and my mind's scattered, so I'm really struggling to stay with it. Can we slow down a lot?

Just the sensation of the breath, the sensation of the air moving in and out, and the sensation of your body feeling the breath.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to notice the breath—it's shallow and fast in my chest, and even when I take a deeper one it only eases a fraction before the fortune-teller starts yelling that if I don't burn this off I'll fumble in the meeting, get reprimanded, demoted, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling.

It sounds like the breath is still being disrupted by the fortune-teller's narrative. Let's try to create a tiny bit of space. Can you simply place one hand on your leg, and then bring the other hand to your heart? Just place one hand on one leg, and one hand on your heart, and notice the sensation of both hands in the body.

Patient: Okay — one hand on my leg, the other on my heart. The leg feels warm and steady for a second, my heart's pounding under my palm and my breath's shallow, but the fortune-teller's already yelling that this means I'll fumble in the meeting, get reprimanded, demoted, lose the house, and then the kids will stop calling.
