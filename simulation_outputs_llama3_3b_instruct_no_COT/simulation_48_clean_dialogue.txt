Patient: I moved a few months ago and since then I've been stuck in this sadness and zero motivation — it's bleeding into my relationship and I don't know how to fix it. I'm a chef, usually full of energy, but lately I can't get myself to care and my OCD's worse with the new place. I don't know if talking will help — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the move has really disrupted your sense of stability and security, and that's impacting many areas of your life. Can you tell me more about what it means to you when you say that your OCD is worse now?

Patient: Since the move everything feels off — I can't stop checking the oven and counters, rearranging the kitchen over and over, and washing my hands until they're raw because the new place just feels... wrong. It's eating time, making me late and snappy at work, and my partner's fed up with the fighting and my distance. Okay, but seriously — how is talking about that supposed to help? I've tried CBT-ish stuff before and it didn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like your OCD is really amplifying your feelings of unease in the new environment, making everyday tasks feel overwhelming. It's like the kitchen has become a source of anxiety for you. Can you think of a moment when you felt most present in your kitchen before the move – what were you doing, and what was that feeling like?

Patient: Yeah — before the move I’d get into this flow during dinner service: the sizzle, the rhythm of chopping and plating, and I felt totally in control and calm, like everything clicked. Thinking about it just makes me realize how far from that I am now, and honestly — how is picturing that supposed to help with the checking and the hand-washing?

Therapist: It's like you're comparing the present to a sense of mastery and flow you had before, and it's highlighting the disconnection you feel now. Would it be helpful to try a small experiment with your hand-washing, just for a moment, without the obsessive thoughts, and see what happens to your physical sensations? Maybe we can explore that in a way that doesn't feel like "curing" your OCD, but more like observing it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I've done exposure-ish things before and if I try to not wash I get panicky and it makes me late for shifts, so it just doesn't stick. If we're trying an experiment, make it tiny and safe — like a one-minute delay before washing — because I need something that won't mess up my job or my relationship.

Therapist: It sounds like the small successes from past experiments didn't translate to real-life situations. A one-minute delay might be a tiny step, but it's a start. Can you imagine what would happen if, for just one minute, you waited to wash your hands after handling food, and instead just acknowledged the thought to wash them, without acting on it? Would that tiny pause make a difference in how you feel afterwards?

Patient: I can kind of picture doing a one-minute pause, but when I try that my chest tightens and I get panicky — at work I can't afford to be that slow or distracted. Maybe I could try it at home when I'm not handling food, but I'm skeptical it'll actually carry over to service or help with how distant I feel from my partner. How is that supposed to help me feel less checked-out or fix the fighting we're having?

Therapist: The panic response can be intense when we're on the verge of acting on a compulsive urge. Let's explore the relationship between those feelings of being checked-out and your partner's concerns. What's one thing you value about your relationship with your partner, and how can you, in small ways, start to nurture that connection despite your current emotional distance?

Patient: I really value how patient and steady they are — they stick by me even when I get moody or snap, and that means a lot. Maybe I could try something tiny like a five-minute check-in after my shift or leaving a short note before I head to work so they know I’m thinking of them. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I feel numb and my checking ruins our evenings? I'm skeptical it'll actually fix anything, but I guess I could try one small thing that won't blow up my schedule.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to bridge the gap between your current emotional state and your valued connection with your partner. Those small gestures might seem like a tiny drop in the ocean, but they could be a start. What if, instead of trying to change the situation, you focus on the value of your partner's presence in your life – can you imagine what it feels like to know that they're thinking of you, even when you're not feeling your best?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — like a warm background hum that I know is there but can't reach when I'm checked-out. When the panic or the checking kicks in, that warmth feels miles away, and just imagining it doesn't stop the urges or the numbness. I could try the five-minute check-in or a note, but seriously — how is that supposed to help when I can't even feel it in the moment?

Therapist: The warmth and connection you're describing sounds like a sense of safety and security that's elusive when you're in the grip of OCD. Can you think of a moment when you felt that warmth, even if it was just for a brief moment – perhaps a memory or a feeling you've had in the past when you were more grounded and present?

Patient: Yeah — there was this night after a brutal dinner service at the old place where my partner was waiting with cold fries and we just sat on the prep counter, laughing about nothing, and I felt totally present and safe for the first time in days. I can picture that warmth, but when the checking or the numbness hits it feels useless — like a postcard from another life. If you're gonna ask me to hold onto that memory, show me how that's supposed to help me stop washing my hands or stop shutting them out in real time.

Therapist: It's like the warmth of that moment is a distant memory, and you're struggling to hold onto it when the current feelings of numbness and checking take over. Let's focus on the sensations in your body right now, when you're feeling that numbness. Can you bring your attention to the physical sensations in your hands, feet, or body, and simply notice them without trying to change them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "noticing" stuff supposed to help when I go numb or panicky? Right now my hands feel kind of cold and tingly, my chest is tight, and my stomach's in knots, but when I try to pay attention I just want to jump up and wash or do something to make it stop. I can try to focus on it for a minute, but honestly I'm skeptical it'll help in the middle of service.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be intense and overwhelming. In that moment, what if you didn't try to change or escape from them, but instead, simply acknowledged them as they are, without judgment? Could you take one tiny breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am with this" or "I am in this moment"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "I am in this" while breathing supposed to stop the urge to wash? Fine, I take a slow breath... my chest's still tight and it just feels like wading through syrup, not fixing anything. I can try it at home between shifts, but how the hell would I do that when service is chaos and my hands go on autopilot?

Therapist: It's like trying to do a mindfulness exercise in the middle of a hurricane. Can we try something a bit more concrete, then? What if, during service, you made a tiny commitment to yourself to stay present and focused on the task at hand, even when your OCD wants to take over? It's just a small promise to show up, not to change everything, but to stay with what's in front of you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is promising to "stay present" in the middle of a rush supposed to stop my hands from going on autopilot? Maybe I could try something tiny and concrete: like pick one dish or one station per shift and commit to staying focused on just that for five minutes, or force myself to take a single 10-second breath before I touch anything. I'll try it, but honestly I'm worried it'll be useless and I'll just end up feeling worse about letting my partner down when it doesn't stop the checking.

Therapist: You're looking for a tangible action that can help you build momentum. Taking control of one small aspect of your work, like focusing on a single dish or station, might be a way to anchor yourself in the present moment. What if, instead of trying to stop the checking altogether, you aimed to reduce it to just one small, manageable aspect of your task – like only checking the oven temperature for that one dish?

Patient: I guess I could try picking one dish and only checking the oven for that — but I'm anxious just thinking about it, my hands are twitchy and my chest's tight, and usually when I try to limit one thing my brain just jumps to something else. How is that supposed to help when service is chaos and I don't have time to count checks? If I'm going to try it, tell me exactly what counts as one check and how long I should stick with it so I don't just half-ass it and feel worse.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already experiencing a sense of overwhelm and anxiety, which can make it hard to focus. Let's take a step back and simplify the process. What if, for just one shift, you commit to only checking the oven temperature for that one specific dish, and you only do it for exactly 10 seconds? That's it – just 10 seconds. Would that be a tiny, manageable commitment for you to make during service?

Patient: I'm already anxious just thinking about doing that in service — my hands are twitchy and my chest's tight. I could try one shift, one dish, and limit myself to checking the oven for exactly 10 seconds, but be specific: what counts as a "check" — a glance, touching the dial, or standing there for the 10 seconds? If I start panicking before the 10 seconds are up, what am I supposed to do so I don't mess up the plate or timing? And how many shifts should I try this for before we decide if it actually helped — because one shift feeling worse would just make me feel more hopeless. How is that supposed to help with the numbness and the fights with my partner, anyway?

Therapist: You're feeling anxious about the specifics of the task, which is understandable. Let's break it down further. For the 10-second check, just focus on the physical action of touching the dial – not necessarily checking the actual temperature, but the sensation of your hand on the dial. As for panicking, if you start to feel overwhelmed, you can simply acknowledge the feeling and take a deep breath, without rushing back to the task. One shift seems like a good starting point – if you don't feel like you can stick with it, we can reassess. As for helping with the numbness and relationship issues, it's not about finding a quick fix, but about developing more flexibility and presence in your daily life, which can, over time, help with relationships and other areas of your life.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — so the plan is one shift, one dish, touch the dial for exactly 10 seconds and notice the feeling. My chest's already tight just thinking about it and I can feel myself getting wired; if I panic halfway through, what exactly am I supposed to do so I don't mess up the service — stop and breathe for how long, or fake it and keep going? Also, how many shifts do we try this before we decide if it helped, because one bad shift will just make me feel worse, and honestly how is that supposed to help me feel less numb with my partner? I can try it, but I need real specifics that actually fit a chaotic service.

Therapist: I can see you're feeling anxious about the specifics. If you feel yourself panicking, take a brief pause – 30 seconds to 1 minute – to breathe, acknowledge the feeling, and then come back to the task. If that feels too long, start with 10 seconds, but take a deep breath before touching the dial. We'll reassess after 2-3 shifts. For the chaos of service, let's simplify it further: just take a deep breath, notice your hand on the dial, and then do the minimum necessary to complete the task – don't worry about getting it "right" or "perfect." Can you imagine doing this during a busy shift, without making a big deal about it?

Patient: I can sort of imagine it, but I'm already wired just thinking about it — my chest's tight and my hands are twitchy. I don't see taking 30–60 seconds in the middle of a rush happening; 10 seconds and a couple deep breaths before I touch the dial sounds barely doable. How do I handle it if the bell rings or someone needs me mid-check — do I drop it and restart, or what? Also, how many shifts do we actually try this for before we decide it's working, and honestly — how is that supposed to help the numbness with my partner? I'm skeptical, but I can try the 10-second version if we make the rules concrete.

Therapist: Let's break it down further. If the bell rings or someone needs you, take a deep breath, acknowledge the interruption, and quickly return to the task. You don't need to drop everything or restart. For the 10-second check, just take a brief pause before touching the dial, breathe in, and then touch the dial briefly – 10 seconds, that's it. We'll start with one shift, and if you find it manageable, we'll add more. As for the numbness with your partner, this isn't about fixing that right now, but about building flexibility and presence in your daily life, which can help you be more present and engaged with your partner. Can you imagine doing this 10-second check during a busy shift, and then, after the shift, taking a moment to connect with your partner – not necessarily to talk about the shift, but just to be with each other?

Patient: I mean... I can kind of imagine doing the 10-second thing, but I'm already wired just thinking about it — chest tight, hands twitchy — and if a bell rings mid-check I know I'll freak and either rush it or bail. How is that supposed to help me feel less numb with my partner afterward? And about that post-shift moment — what exactly do I do so it doesn't feel like another task when I'm beat or still wound up?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really anxious about the 10-second check, and that's impacting your ability to even consider it. Let's take a step back. What if, after the shift, you just sat down with your partner, no agenda, no expectations, and just... were with them? No thinking, no trying to talk about the shift, no doing anything – just presence. Can you imagine doing that?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — just sitting there with no agenda — but it already feels like another thing on my to-do list and I'm worried I'll just stare at the wall or fall asleep. How is that supposed to help when I'm still wired and checked-out? If I try it, give me something concrete: how long should we sit, where, and what do I do if my chest tightens or the checking starts — leave, breathe, or pretend to be present?

Therapist: It sounds like you're still worried about the 10-second check, and the idea of just sitting with your partner isn't feeling very calming. Let's try something small. For the 10-second check, we'll make it super concrete: we'll agree to sit in the quiet area of the kitchen, behind the counter, for exactly 10 minutes after your shift. During that time, you'll sit, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. If your chest tightens or checking starts, you'll just acknowledge it, take a deep breath, and continue sitting. No talking, no doing anything – just sitting. Can you commit to that?

Patient: I can try, but 10 minutes feels like forever when I'm that wired — can we start with 5 minutes instead? If my chest tightens or the checking starts, do I just take a couple deep breaths and stay seated, or am I allowed to step away for a minute and come back? Honestly, I don't see how this won't just feel like another box to tick, but I'll give the shorter version a shot for two shifts.

Therapist: Let's start with 5 minutes and see how it goes. If your chest tightens or checking starts, take a quick deep breath, and if that's not enough, you can get up and take a 1-minute break before returning to the seat. Don't worry about "sticking to" or "finishing" the 5 minutes – just focus on showing up and sitting, without judgment. Can you agree to try this for two shifts, and we'll reassess after that?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 5-minute sit for two shifts, but I’m skeptical it won’t just feel like another box to tick and my chest’s already tight just saying it. Be concrete for me: where exactly should I sit (prep counter behind the pass?), do I start immediately after I clock out, and if I stand up for that 1-minute break do I restart the five minutes or is that counted? Also — how is that supposed to help if my partner’s not around afterward or I’m still wound up?

Therapist: Let's make it super concrete. For the 5-minute sit, you'll sit at the prep counter behind the pass, immediately after clocking out. Take a deep breath, and when your chest tightens or checking starts, take a quick 1-minute break to stand up, take a few deep breaths, and then return to the seat. The 1-minute break doesn't need to be counted – just use it to collect yourself, and then come back to the seat. As for how this will help, it's not about fixing everything, but about building small moments of presence and self-compassion that can help you feel more grounded and connected, even when your partner's not around or you're still feeling wound up.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 5-minute sit at the prep counter for two shifts, clocking out first and using a 1-minute break if I need it, but I’m already skeptical it won’t just feel like another box to tick. My chest’s tight just saying it — if the chef yells at me or someone drags me back to service mid-sit, do I restart the five minutes or just pick up where I left off? And seriously, how is sitting there supposed to help my numbness with my partner when they’re not even around after shifts?

Therapist: If the chef yells at you or someone needs you back to service, take a few deep breaths, acknowledge the interruption, and come back to the seat when it's safe to do so. Don't worry about "starting over" – just pick up where you left off. As for your numbness with your partner, I'm not saying that this 5-minute sit will fix everything, but it's a small step towards building more awareness and presence in your daily life, which can, over time, help you connect more with your partner on a deeper level. Can you think of a small, everyday moment when you feel more connected to your partner, even if it's just a brief glance or a kind word?

Patient: Yeah — there’s those tiny things: my partner slipping a note in my bag, or bringing me cold fries after a shift, or that quick hug at the pass before I clock in. For a second I feel seen and less hollow, but it vanishes fast when the checking or numbness kicks back in. How is noticing those little moments supposed to actually change how I feel when I'm checked-out or make the fights stop?

Therapist: Those tiny moments are great examples of what you value in your relationship. Let's explore what happens when you notice those moments, but then they vanish. What if, instead of focusing on what's gone, you try to hold onto the feeling of being seen, even if it's just for a brief moment? What would that look like, and how might it shift your experience of the numbness and checking?

Patient: I guess holding onto it would mean when they slip me those fries or a note I actually pause for a beat and try to feel “seen” instead of letting the numbness swipe it away — maybe say thanks, squeeze their hand, or just breathe into it for a few seconds. But seriously, how is that supposed to stop the checking or the panic when I'm already wired? I can try noticing and holding the feeling for, like, 5–10 seconds after those small moments for a couple shifts, but I’m skeptical it won’t just evaporate. If I do it and the panic or checking starts, what exactly should I do in the moment so I don’t just bail or feel worse afterward?

Therapist: You're wondering how holding onto the feeling of being seen can actually help with the checking and panic. Let's try to make it concrete. For the 5-10 seconds after noticing those small moments, I want you to focus on the physical sensation of your body, not the thought "I'm being seen." When the panic or checking starts, don't try to stop it or change it – just acknowledge it, and take a deep breath into your body, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head. As you breathe, try to bring awareness to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change it or move. Can you imagine doing that?

Patient: I can kind of imagine pausing and breathing into my feet for 5–10 seconds, but my chest’s already tight just thinking about it. How is that actually supposed to stop the urge to check right then — do I keep breathing through the panic, or step away and for how long? I’ll try it after those small moments for a couple shifts, but give me exact timing and what counts as “doing it right” so I don’t just feel like I failed.

Therapist: I can see you're still feeling anxious about the 5-10 seconds of breathing into your feet. Let's simplify it. After those small moments, take a deep breath in for 4 seconds, and then out for 6 seconds. As you breathe out, bring awareness to your feet, notice the sensation of them touching the ground. If the panic or checking starts, don't try to stop it, just keep breathing in a slow, steady rhythm, and acknowledge the physical sensations in your body without judgment. You can take a 1-minute break if needed, but try to return to the seat as soon as possible. For now, let's focus on the 4-6-4-6 breathing pattern – can you try it for one of those small moments after your shift?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 4-6 breathing for one of those small moments after a shift, but my chest’s already tight just thinking about it. How exactly do I count the 4 and 6 — is that seconds in my head or do I breathe however feels right? If I’m still panicky or someone pulls me back to service mid-breath, am I supposed to keep counting or step away and restart? I’m skeptical this will stop the checking, so can we slow down and make it even more concrete so I don’t just feel like I failed?

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. For the 4-6 breathing pattern, focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, rather than counting it in your head. Try to breathe in for as long as feels natural, and then exhale for a slightly longer time. Don't worry about the exact length, just focus on the sensation of the breath. If you're still panicky or pulled away from service, don't worry about the breathing – just acknowledge the interruption, take a quick breath, and come back to the seat when it's safe to do so. Let's start with just one small moment, and I'll be here to support you. Can you agree to try the 4-6 breathing pattern, even if it feels uncomfortable or imperfect?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the 4-6 breathing for one small moment after a shift, even though I'm already tight and skeptical — honestly, how is that supposed to help? Be specific: if someone pulls me back mid-breath do I stop and restart later or keep going, and what would actually count as a sign it's working so I don't just feel like I failed?

Therapist: Let's be super specific. If someone pulls you back to service mid-breath, you don't need to stop and restart. Just acknowledge the interruption, take a quick breath, and come back to the seat when it's safe to do so. As for what counts as a sign it's working, I don't want you to wait for anything specific – just focus on the process of showing up and trying. Instead, I want you to notice how your body feels before and after the small moment. Can you think of a time when you felt even slightly more calm or centered after doing something small, like taking a short walk or doing a quick stretch? That's what we're aiming for.

Patient: Yeah — once after a brutal double I ducked outside for a five-minute walk and when I came back my chest felt a little less tight and my head wasn't as foggy, so I wasn't snapping at everyone for a bit. It helped briefly, but it always fades and I’m worried it won’t hold up during a full-on service. How is that supposed to help in the long run — like, how long should that calm last before we call it “working,” and what exactly do I do if someone yanks me back mid-break or the panic spikes again? I’m anxious just thinking about trying it, but I could do one walk if you give me clear rules for when and how long.
