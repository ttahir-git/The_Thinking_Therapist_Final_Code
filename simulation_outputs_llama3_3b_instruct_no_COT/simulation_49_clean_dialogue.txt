Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of constantly asking people for reassurance — about my presentations, my artwork, even tiny social stuff — because it calms my social anxiety for like five minutes. Since I started this demanding program it's gotten worse; I keep checking classmates and friends and it's eating my time and confidence. I don't really buy that talking will fix it though — how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the reassurance you're seeking from others is providing a temporary sense of calm, which is helpful in the short-term, but it's not addressing the underlying anxiety. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to not seek reassurance from others, even if it meant feeling a bit anxious or uncomfortable for a little while?

Patient: Honestly, if I didn’t ask for reassurance I’d probably spiral — my mind would race and I’d obsess over every little thing, assuming I messed up or people hate my work. I’d feel exposed and might avoid people or freeze during presentations, which would mess with this program and my art. I’ve tried sitting with the anxiety before and it just doesn’t seem to get better; it feels like I’m just torturing myself. How is that supposed to help when the anxiety just keeps looping?

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the pattern and have tried to confront it, but it's still really challenging for you. Can you think of a time when you've done something valued, like creating something in your art or giving a presentation, despite feeling anxious about it? What would you've liked to have felt or experienced in that moment, even if it meant tolerating some discomfort?

Patient: Yeah — last month I had to present my portfolio to the cohort, and even though I was shaking and my heart was racing I went through with it. For a few minutes after I actually felt proud and kinda relieved, but it was fleeting because I immediately started pestering people afterward asking if it was good or if I’d messed up. I wish I could've kept that quiet confidence — to trust my work without needing constant validation — but honestly, how is feeling proud for a minute supposed to stop me from needing everyone to tell me it's okay?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to distinguish between your genuine pride and the validation-seeking that often follows. Can you imagine if, instead of asking for reassurance, you were to simply acknowledge your own pride and say to yourself, "I'm proud of this work, and I trust that it's worth sharing"? What would happen to your experience if you held onto that feeling, even if others don't comment or don't say anything?

Patient: I can picture trying to hold onto that pride, but in practice my brain just fills the silence with worst-case stories — if no one says anything I assume they hated it. I’ve tried pep-talks like that and they evaporate the second I see someone not reacting. How is telling myself “I’m proud” supposed to compete with that noise, and what would actually make it stick in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to silence the inner critic that keeps popping up with worst-case scenarios. Can you notice where in your body that sense of dread or anxiety arises, and what kind of sensations or thoughts typically accompany it when you start to think "they hated it"? What would happen if you allowed those sensations to be present, without trying to push them away or fill them with more thoughts?

Patient: It's this hollow tightness in my stomach that spreads up to my chest and makes my throat feel thick, and my hands go numb like I could drop everything. The thoughts are nonstop — images of people whispering, emails piling up calling me out, me freezing and ruining everything. When I try to just sit with it, it initially feels like I'm turning the volume up on the panic and it gets almost unbearable, and then sometimes after a long while it dulls — but usually by then I’ve already texted someone for reassurance. How is just "allowing" that supposed to stop me from reaching for my phone or spiraling into those worst-case stories? I'm honestly exhausted by trying stuff that just doesn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations and thoughts are a really powerful trigger for your anxiety. Would you be willing to try something more concrete, like taking a few deep breaths with your eyes closed, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push away the thoughts?

Patient: Alright, fine — I'll try, but I'm skeptical it actually helps. Closing my eyes and breathing in, it's hard to slow — my chest's still tight and the thoughts about people hating it just keep racing. After a few breaths it almost feels like I'm amplifying the panic instead of calming it, and the urge to text someone for reassurance is already getting louder. How is breathing supposed to stop that impulse or make the silence not feel like rejection?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations and thoughts are so intertwined that even trying to calm the breath feels like it's fueling the anxiety. Can you think of a different way to approach the silence, one that doesn't rely on trying to stop the thoughts or feelings, but rather what would be needed to create some space around the silence? For example, what would need to be true for you in that moment for the silence to feel not so empty or uncomfortable?

Patient: I guess I'd need something that actually convinces my brain the silence isn't punishment — like a really solid, believable inner line I can say to myself or an external anchor (a note I leave, a short recording, a timer) that proves silence doesn't equal disaster. But honestly, I've tried self-scripts and anchors and they just disappear when my heart's racing — how is a timer or a note supposed to compete with the flood of worst-case thoughts? Right now I feel drained and like I'm repeating the same failed experiments; I want something that works in the moment, not something that only helps later.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a more immediate, in-the-moment solution that can withstand the intensity of your anxiety. Can you think of something small, concrete, and tangible that you could use right now, in this moment, to mark the passage of time, even if it's just for a few seconds? Like, what would it take for you to keep your eyes open, without checking your phone or getting up, for just one minute?

Patient: I could try holding something in my hand — a smooth stone or my pen — and just focus on the texture or a tiny spot on the wall for a minute, or set a one-minute timer on my watch so I don't have to look at my phone. But honestly, when my chest tightens and my hands go numb, that stuff blurs out and all I want to do is text someone; how is staring at a rock really supposed to override that urge? Still, I could try it now if you want me to.

Therapist: It sounds like you're considering some physical anchors, which is a good start. Instead of trying to overcome the urge to text, I'd like to ask: what would happen if you were to make a small, tiny, tiny commitment to yourself, just for this one minute, to keep your eyes on the stone, the wall, or the timer, without any expectation of success or failure? Not even "try" or "I'll see what happens," but just a simple, small commitment to do this, exactly as is, for one minute?

Patient: Okay, fine — I'll try it. I'm grabbing my pen and I'll focus on a spot on the wall for one minute, but honestly I doubt it'll stop the urge to text — my chest's tight and my hands are already going numb. If I actually manage to sit through it, what do we do next so I don't immediately reach out for reassurance?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the effort you're making right now. Notice that you're willing to sit with the discomfort and focus on the pen, even if it feels hard. Now, I'd like to explore what might happen if, after the minute is up, you were to simply take a deep breath and ask yourself: "What's the next small, tiny step I can take towards what's valued, even if it's just a tiny one?"

Patient: Okay, I did it — kept my eyes on the pen for a minute. My chest is still tight but the urge to text felt a hair less sharp, so maybe that's something. A next tiny step could be opening my sketchbook and doing a 5-minute doodle or setting a 10-minute no-phone timer to work on one small piece, but... how is that supposed to stop me from reaching for my phone the second the panic spikes? What would actually make me stick to the timer when my brain starts yelling at me?

Therapist: You've taken a small step, and that's worth acknowledging. Now, I'd like to explore what's holding you back from taking that next step, even when the panic spikes. Can you notice where you're feeling the "yet" in your mind, the sense that "next time" will be different, that you'll be able to push through? What's keeping you from taking that small step towards your sketchbook or timer, even when you know it's not a guarantee?

Patient: I feel the "yet" as this tight, ugly knot in my chest and a tightness in my throat—like a small, sneering voice that already assumes I'll flub it and everyone will see. What keeps me from the sketchbook is that shame and the ugly certainty that whatever I start will prove I'm not good enough, so my brain wants the quick hit of reassurance instead of the slow, unreliable payoff of trying. I've done the tiny steps before and they evaporate when that panic/embarrassment flares up, so honestly I'm doubting that just noticing it will stop me — how is pointing it out supposed to make me actually sit down and stick with the timer when the panic kicks back in?

Therapist: The knot in your chest and the sneering voice can be a powerful force. I'm not suggesting that noticing the knot or voice will magically stop the panic, but rather that acknowledging them might help you approach your creativity and the timer with a bit more kindness and curiosity. What if, instead of trying to push through or overcome the shame, you were to ask yourself: "What would be required for me to show up to the sketchbook with a sense of curiosity and play, even if I'm not sure I'm 'good enough'?"

Patient: I guess I'd need a real, explicit permission to be awful — like a non-negotiable rule that for five minutes nothing gets judged and I won't ask anyone about it — because the shame kicks in so hard it makes me bail. I’d also want a tiny, concrete anchor that can actually compete with the urge to text — a one-minute timer, a silly prompt to draw, or someone sending a single “stay” message so I don’t have to decide in the moment. But I'm skeptical: how is that actually supposed to help when the panic hits and my brain just screams “text someone”? Give me one specific thing to try right now that could actually hold up in the moment.

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving a sense of safety and permission to create without judgment. Can you think of a very small, very simple thing that you could do right now, with your eyes closed, to give yourself that permission? For example, could you say to yourself, or write down on a piece of paper, just two words: "I am allowed"?

Patient: Okay — fine, I'll say it: "I am allowed." Saying it out loud makes me feel ridiculous and a hot shame rushes up like I shouldn't even be trying. For a beat the knot in my chest eases, but then the urge to text snaps back — how are two words really supposed to stop that?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-doubt are still very present. Let's explore what might be driving the urge to text in this moment. Can you notice what's happening in your body when you feel that urge to text - is it a physical sensation, a thought, or an image?

Patient: It's that hollow knot in my stomach that spreads to my chest, my hands go numb, and this quick image of people whispering or a red email pops up while the thought "they hated it" starts looping. It feels urgent — like I have to fix it now by texting — and I don't really see how just noticing that would stop me in the moment; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations and the image are triggering a strong desire to escape or fix the situation through texting. I'm not asking you to stop the urge to text, but rather what if, while your hands are still numb, you were to take a tiny, small action that doesn't require your brain to think or solve the problem - just a tiny action that you can do with your body?

Patient: I guess I could press my feet into the floor and squeeze my pen a few times—something physical that doesn't need any thinking. Saying that makes me feel kind of stupid and ashamed, like it's too little, but... okay, I'll try pressing my feet and squeezing the pen for thirty seconds. Not sure it'll stop me from texting when the panic spikes—how is that supposed to actually help?

Therapist: Pressing your feet and squeezing the pen can be a small, physical anchor. I'm not asking you to think about stopping the panic or fixing anything, but rather what if, while you're doing that physical action, you're able to just be with the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor and the pen in your hand, without judgment? Can you find a tiny bit of space to observe that sensation, without trying to change it or use it to solve anything?

Patient: Okay... I did it — pressed my feet and squeezed the pen. I can feel the pressure and the dent in my hand, and for a second the chest knot eases a tiny bit, but the image and the urge to text are still there, loud and accusing. It feels almost pathetic that something so small makes any difference, and I'm already bracing for the moment when it won't — how is that supposed to stop me from reaching for my phone when the panic spikes, and what do I actually do next when the crack it creates closes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto the small comfort of the physical sensation, but the anxiety is still there. I'm not asking you to rely on the physical anchor to stop the panic, but rather to use it as a tiny foothold to anchor yourself in the present moment. What if, instead of waiting for the panic to spike again, you were to take a tiny step forward, even if it feels scary or uncertain - just a small action, like taking a deep breath, or stretching your arm, or opening your eyes and looking around the room?

Patient: I could try that — take a slow breath, open my eyes, look around, then flip my sketchbook open and do five minutes. But I'm so drained and the shame creeps in like it always does, so tell me one concrete thing I can do in that exact moment that actually keeps me from reaching for my phone when the urge hits.

Therapist: Let's focus on a tiny, immediate action that you can take in this exact moment. Can you bring your hand to your mouth and say the word "okay" without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without judging it? Just say "okay" with your lips moving and your hand closing around your mouth.

Patient: Okay.

Saying it felt small — my hand closed over my mouth and my voice went thin. For a beat the knot loosened, then the shame flared and the urge to text is still loud. How is this actually supposed to stop me from grabbing my phone when it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "okay" was a small, brief reprieve. Let's try something even more immediate. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, and simply notice how it feels in this moment, without trying to change it or use it to calm anything?

Patient: My feet feel solid against the floor — a cool pressure under my soles and a slight ache in my arches — and for a second the chest knot loosens, but it barely changes the noise in my head. That knot drags this old shame with it, and the urge to check my phone is still loud; how is noticing my feet really going to stop that when it always wins? This takes so much effort and it already feels like it's going to fall apart.

Therapist: It sounds like you're exhausted and feeling like the effort is not yielding the results you want. I'm not asking you to "win" or to overcome the shame, but rather what if you were to let go of the idea that you need to stop the shame or the urge to text? Can you try allowing yourself to feel the shame and the anxiety, without judgment, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can try, but that idea already feels brutal — when I "allow" it the shame just gets louder and I want to run to my phone. There's this heavy, burning embarrassment in my chest that makes me feel small and stupid, and letting it sit feels like I'm doing nothing while it's eating me alive. But... okay, I'll try to notice it without fixing it for a minute — it’s hard, and I don't expect it to magically make the urge stop.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step forward, not by trying to "overcome" the shame, but by simply acknowledging its presence in this moment. Can you make a tiny, tiny gesture of acknowledgment, like a small nod or a slight twitch of your head, to acknowledge the shame and the anxiety, without trying to engage with it or change it?

Patient: I give a tiny, almost pathetic little nod — barely anything. It eases the knot a hair, but the shame's still loud and the urge to text is humming; if this is the move, how does that actually stop me from grabbing my phone when it spikes?

Therapist: Let's try to ground yourself in the present moment, even more than that tiny nod. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, and notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you, the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change anything or engage with your thoughts?

Patient: Okay... I'm trying. My feet are solid on the floor, the air feels a bit cool on my skin, my breath is shallow but there. There's this hot, sinking shame that rushes up my chest and the same image/voice starts looping — it quiets a hair when I notice it, but the urge to text is still loud and impatient. How is just noticing supposed to stop me when it spikes — what do I actually do next in that moment so I don't grab my phone?

Therapist: You're staying with the sensation of your body and the present moment. Instead of trying to stop the urge to text, can you try to see what would happen if, when the urge spikes, you were to simply pause for a tiny fraction of a second before reaching for your phone? What would be required for you to pause, just for that tiny instant, before acting on the urge?

Patient: I think I’d need something automatic and stupid-simple — like a pre-agreed rule (wait 30 seconds), my phone across the room so grabbing it’s annoying, plus a tiny interrupt I can do without thinking (press my thumb and forefinger together and say “wait” or squeeze the pen and breathe twice). And I’d have to rehearse it so it feels like a muscle, not a new idea my brain can ignore. But honestly — how is that really supposed to help when the panic’s already screaming?

Therapist: You're looking for a way to create a small, automatic barrier between you and your phone. I'm not asking you to rely on this new strategy to "fix" the panic, but rather to use it as a small tool to create a tiny bit of space. Can you imagine rehearsing this tiny interrupt, this "wait" or "squeeze", over and over, until it feels automatic, until it's more like a reflex than a thought?

Patient: I can see the rehearsal — 30-second rule, squeeze-the-pen-and-say “wait,” phone across the room, repeat until it’s automatic — but that intrusive shame flashes up and tells me I’ll just mess it up. How many times am I supposed to do this before it actually feels automatic, and what if I practice and the panic still wins — what’s the realistic backup then? I’m so drained by all this repetition, but fine — give me one stupid-simple thing I can practice right now that won’t feel pointless.

Therapist: The shame is always lurking, and it's okay. Let's try to focus on a tiny, immediate action that doesn't rely on the shame or the anxiety. Can you simply bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, and then, without thinking about it, take a deep inhale, and then exhale, and then inhale again? Just the physical sensation of the breath moving in and out, no thoughts, no trying to control anything.

Patient: Okay... I did it — inhale, exhale, inhale. It loosened the knot for a second, then that hot shame came back and the urge to text is still loud and panicked; I don't get how breathing like that actually helps me keep the phone down when it spikes — what do I do in that exact moment?

Therapist: You're back to the familiar pattern. Instead of trying to "stop" the panic, can you try to find what's slightly different about the physical sensation of the breath when it's "loosening" - what's different about it when it feels slightly calmer, even if it's still not calm?

Patient: When it loosens even a bit my inhales sneak down into my belly instead of my chest, the exhales get fractionally longer, my throat eases and the numbness in my hands thins out for a second. It helps for a beat, but the shame and that old, awful certainty snap back fast and I still want to grab my phone. I've noticed this before and it never seems enough — so what do I actually do in that exact instant when the panic spikes so the noticing doesn't just fade?
