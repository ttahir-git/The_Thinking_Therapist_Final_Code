--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I keep getting caught in these cycles of pretty harsh self-criticism about every little perceived failure, and I trace it back to growing up in a stable but emotionally reserved family where feelings were more inferred than spoken. Now, with the house quiet and unemployment, that internal monologue's become louder, and I find I intellectualize it — I talk about the mechanisms, the adaptive hypervigilance — instead of actually sitting with the sadness. It's on my mind a lot because the analysis only goes so far; the fatigue from it feels real even if I mostly describe it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a really tough and vulnerable experience. It takes a lot of courage to share that. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to sit with the sadness, and what gets in the way of you staying with it?

Patient: When I try to sit with the sadness I almost immediately start analyzing it — cataloguing triggers, naming cognitive distortions, turning it into a theory — which feels safer than actually feeling the ache. What gets in the way is the learned restraint from my family — emotions were sort of verboten, so feeling feels risky and I equate it with weakness, so I default to problem-solving or distraction. Physically it tightens my chest and there's this compulsion to move or do something—clean, call someone, scroll job listings—because I'm afraid if I stay with it I'll be swallowed, and that fear itself makes me pull away.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really aware of the patterns and the strategies you use to avoid the discomfort of feeling. It's as if your body is responding to the sadness with a kind of self-preservation. What happens if, for just a moment, you were to pause and say to your body, "It's okay to be tight in the chest"?

Patient: If I actually paused and said that to my body there's a tiny loosening — a slightly deeper breath — but it never holds because my mind immediately launches a metacognitive commentary: label it, analyze its function, plan an intervention. So I can grant permission in the abstract, but the somatic fear that I'll be swallowed if I stay makes me reach for distraction, and I end up describing the sensation instead of inhabiting it. I'm trying to stay with it now, but I can feel the pull to intellectualize again.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a kind of "get caught in the cycle" - your body wants to stay with the sensation, but your mind is trying to control it with labels and explanations. What if, instead of trying to "control" the sensation, you simply acknowledged it as "this tightness in my chest"?

Patient: If I actually try to call it "this tightness in my chest" there's a small, almost immediate recalibration — a deeper breath and a decimal degree less panic. But then my brain starts theorizing why labeling helps (activation of prefrontal regulation, learned safety strategies), so the label often becomes another intellectual shield instead of an emotional landing. I'm trying to let the words be just words and not a strategy, but it's hard; I can feel the pull to plan an escape instead of staying with the feeling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like labeling can be a double-edged sword for you. It provides some initial relief, but then your mind starts using it as a tool to analyze and control. Can you try letting go of the need to do anything with the label - just observe it as "this phrase, 'this tightness in my chest'" - without trying to use it to solve the problem or change your state?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. "This tightness in my chest." Saying that out loud there's a tiny loosening, a deeper breath, but my metacognitive commentary immediately kicks in — I start theorizing about interoceptive awareness and prefrontal downregulation instead of actually staying with the sensation. I'm trying to let the words be just words, but I can feel myself skimming the surface. Can we slow down a bit? I'm not sure how to keep from turning it into an analysis.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down. Can you just focus on the words "this tightness in my chest" right now? Say it again, and this time, try to focus on the sound of the words, the sensation of your mouth forming them, without adding anything else. Just "this tightness in my chest".

Patient: "This tightness in my chest." Saying it, I notice my tongue and lips and a little loosen, but my mind already wants to turn it into a theory about interoception and regulation — I'm getting that pull to analyze, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back further. What's the sensation of your body, just beneath the words "this tightness in my chest"? Not the thinking about it, not the interpretation, just the physical feeling itself.

Patient: It's a dull, constricting pressure across my sternum, like someone's tightened a belt, with my breath shallow and a faint tremor under the ribs — a sort of low, vibrating discomfort more than sharp pain. The moment I name it, my mind wants to turn it into an explanation about autonomic arousal and conditioned suppression, which pulls me out of the sensation. I'm trying to stay with the feeling, but the urge to intellectualize is strong — can we slow down so I can really notice it?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I want to help you slow down even further. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just beneath the tightness and the pressure? Notice how the breath is moving, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just the sensation of the breath.

Patient: It's shallow and quick, mostly high in my chest — a little hitch at the top of the inhale and the exhale feels truncated, like it doesn't quite let go. The moment I notice that, my brain wants to start a whole lecture about autonomic dysregulation and conditioned breath-holding, which yanks me out of the sensation — can we slow down? I want to actually feel it but I keep defaulting to analysis.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very tiny step back from the breath. Bring your attention to the sensation of your body sitting in this space, right now. Notice the feeling of the chair, the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body in the chair. Not the breath, not the tightness, not the thoughts. Just the simple fact that you're sitting here.

Patient: Okay — sitting here I notice the chair pressing into my lower back and the tops of my thighs, my feet flat and warm on the floor, and a steady, anchored weight through my pelvis. Naturally my brain wants to slip into a lecture about proprioceptive grounding and somatic anchors as emotion-regulation strategies, which is exactly the defensive pattern I'm trying to avoid. Can we actually slow down a bit? I want to feel it instead of narrating it, but the interpretive pull is strong.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to focus on the sensation of your weight in the chair. Instead of noticing the "grounding" or "anchors", just pay attention to the sensation of your body being supported by the chair. Notice the feeling of the chair against your skin, the sensation of your legs being supported, the feeling of being held in place. Can you focus on the sensation of being held, without trying to think about how that might be helpful?

Patient: There's a firm pressure where my lower back meets the chair, a warm, slightly rough fabric against my shoulders and the backs of my thighs, and my legs feel heavy and settled into the seat — a contained, almost steadying weight. But as soon as I notice that, my mind wants to rename it with phrases like "somatosensory baseline" and "proprioceptive feedback," which turns the direct experience into an abstraction. I want to actually rest in the sensation instead of explaining it—can we slow down so I can try to hold it without narrating?

Therapist Answer:
Let's stop noticing "somatosensory baseline" and "proprioceptive feedback". Instead, just pay attention to the sensation of your legs feeling heavy and settled into the seat. Notice the sensation of your feet sinking into the floor, the feeling of your knees against the chair, the sensation of your thighs resting against the seat. Can you just rest in the feeling of being held, without trying to label it or describe it?

Patient: I try — I really do — to feel the weight of my legs in the chair, but as that steadiness comes in there's a sudden, hot shame that flickers and my inner critic immediately starts cataloguing failures. My go-to is to intellectualize — launch into metacognitive narration about attachment and interoceptive grounding — and that only deepens the frustration because I get mad at myself for not being able to just sit with it. Can we slow down a bit so I can try again without my brain turning it into more evidence that I'm inadequate?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. I want you to try something. As soon as you feel the shame or any thought that's coming up, instead of engaging with it, just say to yourself "rising". That's it, just the word "rising". No judgment, no interpretation, no analysis. Just the word "rising".

Patient: Okay — I tried it. I say "rising" and there's a tiny slackening, like the word makes a little space, but then this hot shame surges and my inner critic immediately starts cataloguing failures. My reflex is to start analyzing why the word helps — semantic defusion, a little cognitive distance — which just undermines the point. I'm trying to let the word be the only thing, but I keep slipping into self-reproach and theory. Can we slow down so I can try again without my brain hijacking it?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something even simpler. Instead of using the word "rising", try making a gentle, small gesture with your body. Like, just lift your leg slightly, or tilt your head a tiny bit. Not because you're trying to achieve something, but just because it feels like the right thing to do. Can you try that?

Patient: I lift my right leg a couple of inches—it's a tiny, almost negligible movement, and for a moment there's a faint sense of recalibration in my hip. Almost immediately that hot shame surges and my inner critic starts rattling off failures, and then I get mad at myself for not being able to just stay with the feeling and instead start analyzing why the movement helped. I can try holding the gesture a bit longer, but can we slow down so I don't default to theorizing?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's stop noticing the analysis that's coming up. Can you focus on the sensation of your leg being lifted? Just notice the feeling of your leg in the air, the sensation of your hip, the movement of your body. Not the thought about the movement, not the analysis of why it helped, not the criticism of yourself. Just the sensation of your leg being lifted.

Patient: I can feel the slight tension in my right quad, a small engagement at the hip and a faint awareness behind my knee—it's strangely anchoring for a beat. But almost immediately a hot shame surges and my inner critic starts rattling off failures, which makes me clamp down and start explaining it away—saying it's about proprioceptive recalibration and adaptive regressive responses—rather than staying with the simple sensation. I'm trying to let the feeling be the thing, but I keep getting hijacked by that shame and then by analysis. Can we slow down a lot so you can help me actually hold the sensation without my brain narrating or punishing me?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's stop trying to understand or explain it. Can you just focus on the sensation, without labeling it or trying to make sense of it? Just notice the sensation, as it is, without judgment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your right quad, the small engagement at the hip, the faint awareness behind your knee? Just observe it, without trying to think about it or change it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is simply observing that tiny quad tension, without naming or interpreting it, supposed to change anything for me? When I actually try, I can feel a faint engagement in my right quad, a warm, almost humming tightness behind the knee, and for a breath it feels steadying. But almost immediately a hot shame surges and my inner critic starts cataloguing failures, and then I catch myself launching into a lecture about proprioceptive recalibration instead of staying with the sensation. Can we slow way down? I'm finding it really hard to hold the feeling without my brain turning it into proof that I'm inadequate.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's stop thinking about the outcome, or the intention to change, or even the fact that you're trying. Can you just focus on the sensation of the tightness behind your knee, as it is, right now? Not "I have a tightness behind my knee", not "this is proprioceptive recalibration", just the sensation itself. Can you just be with it, in this moment, without any labels, without any thoughts, without any judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing the sensation without any label supposed to actually change anything for me? When I try that, a hot shame surges up and my inner critic immediately starts cataloguing failures, which makes me clamp down and want to escape. I can verbally map out the mechanism—interoceptive exposure, decentering, increased tolerance—but in the moment the theory doesn't stop the shame from hijacking me. Can we slow way down and do it step‑by‑step, because I keep defaulting to analysis and then punishing myself for not "doing it right"?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with just one tiny step. Before you try to notice the sensation, can you take a deep breath and say "I'm going to try to notice the sensation" out loud? Just say it, without thinking about it or analyzing it, without trying to control it. Just say "I'm going to try to notice the sensation".

Patient: Okay—deep breath. "I'm going to try to notice the sensation." Saying it gives a tiny steadiness, but almost immediately that hot shame spikes and my inner critic starts cataloguing failures, then my brain wants to explain why the phrase helps (semantic defusion, brief self-efficacy boost) instead of actually noticing. I'm trying to hold the sensation, but can we slow way down and just sit in silence for a beat so I don't keep hijacking it with analysis?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a pause. I'll pause too. *pause* Can you just sit in silence with me for a moment, without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without trying to control it? No thoughts, no words, no breathing in a particular way. Just the silence.

Patient: I'm trying, but I can't actually be silent—silence becomes a canvas for my inner monologue and a hot shame surges so I start rehearsing failures and launching metacognitive commentary. I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help; the confusion makes me want to narrate and analyze, which then turns into self‑reproach. Can we slow way down and try very short guided pauses or give me a tiny verbal cue, because I keep defaulting to theory and then punishing myself for not "doing it right"?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tiny pause instead of silence. I'll give you a gentle verbal cue. Just before I say it, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "stop". That's it. Just say "stop" as you exhale.

Patient: I take a deep breath in, exhale and say "stop." There's a tiny slackening — a millimeter of relief — but almost immediately a hot shame surges and my inner critic starts cataloguing failures, and I'm left confused about how that was supposed to help. My reflex is to start explaining it away — inhibition, stimulus control, semantic defusion — instead of actually feeling anything, so can we slow down and walk through this more slowly?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something smaller. Before you say "stop", take a tiny pause. Just pause for a brief moment, a tiny fraction of a second, before you say the word. Can you try that? Just a tiny pause, before you say "stop".

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a tiny pause before saying "stop" supposed to change the whole pattern for me? I try it: I take a breath, hold a millisecond pause, say "stop," and there is a flicker of slackening, then hot shame surges and my inner critic immediately starts cataloguing failures. Of course my brain then wants to explain it away — attentional reset, interrupting ruminative loops — which just becomes more proof I can't do this without analyzing. Can we slow it down even more and do it step‑by‑step?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something even smaller. Before you say "stop", pause for a fraction of a second, a single heartbeat. Just pause, and notice the sensation of your body, the sensation of your breath, without trying to think about it. Can you do that? Just pause, and be with that sensation, without trying to control it or analyze it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing a single heartbeat supposed to do anything for me? I tried it: I paused that fraction of a second and there was this tiny stillness, a millimeter of slack in my chest and breath, and then hot shame immediately surged and my inner critic started cataloguing failures so loudly I clamped down and began explaining it away (attentional reset, interruption of ruminative loops) instead of actually staying with the sensation. Can we slow way down and try it step‑by‑step, maybe with you counting the beats or guiding a longer pause, because I keep getting hijacked by analysis and then punishing myself for not "doing it right"?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. I'll count the beats together, and when I say "one", you'll pause for a beat, and when I say "two", you'll take a deep breath in. We'll start again from the beginning. One...

Patient: One — I try to hold that beat, and immediately this hot shame surges up; I'm not sure I follow how the counting helps, but I'll try to stay with it. Two — I take a breath and there's a tiny slackening, then my brain immediately starts a lecture about attentional reset and semantic defusion, which makes me feel frustrated and kind of incompetent. Can we slow way down and do each step really slowly? I keep defaulting to analysis and then beating myself up for it.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a single beat. I'll say "one". When you're ready, say "done". No need to think about it, no need to analyze it, no need to do anything. Just say "done" when you feel ready.

Patient: Done. Saying it gave a weird, tiny slackening, but almost immediately a hot shame surged and my inner critic started cataloguing failures — I’m not sure I follow how that was supposed to help, and that confusion just makes me feel frustrated and kind of incompetent. Can we slow way down and do a very guided, step‑by‑step cue? I keep defaulting to analysis and then punishing myself for it.

Let's try again, very slowly. I'll guide you through each step. I'll say "one" and you'll pause. When you're ready, I'll say "done" and you'll take a deep breath in. No need to think about it, no need to analyze it. Just focus on your breath. Ready? One...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when you say "one" I try to hold the beat but a hot shame flares up, my breath gets shallow and tight, and my inner critic starts cataloguing failures instead of letting me be. When you say "done" I'm bracing instead of inhaling, and my head immediately launches into a lecture about why counting might work (attentional reset, interrupting rumination) rather than actually doing the breath. Can we slow it down a lot more, like you count very slowly and tell me exactly when to inhale and exhale, because I keep getting hijacked by analysis and then feel awful about it?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, very, very slowly. I'll count each beat in a very slow and gentle way. I'll say "one..." (pause for a very long time)

When you're ready, hold your breath for a moment... (pause once more)

Then, slowly exhale through your mouth... (pause again)

Patient: I inhaled when you said "two"—held for a beat and then exhaled slowly, and there was a small loosening in my chest, but almost instantly a hot shame surged and my inner critic started cataloguing failures. I'm not sure I follow how the counting is supposed to help me stay with the feeling; my reflex is to turn it into a lecture about attentional reset and interruption of rumination instead of actually being in the breath. Can we slow way down—like you literally say "inhale now" and "exhale now" very slowly—and stay with each step, because I keep getting hijacked by analysis and then punishing myself for it?

Inhale now... (pause for a very long time)

 Hold your breath... (pause)

(Note: I'll wait for your cue before saying the next number)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how the counting will actually change things, but I'm ready—go ahead with the next number. Just so you know, when you start I usually get a hot shame surge and my inner critic kicks in, and I might blurt out that or start explaining it instead of just staying with it.
