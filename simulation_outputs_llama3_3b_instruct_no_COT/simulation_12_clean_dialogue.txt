Patient: Hey, uh… lately I keep making jokes or getting sarcastic whenever stuff at the new job feels heavy — I guess it's my way of numbing it. I'm a construction guy in my fifties and this whole adjustment thing's been getting to me, but I don't know, it's kinda awkward to talk about.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using humor as a way to cope with the discomfort of adjusting to a new job. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're making jokes or using sarcasm – what do you think it's trying to protect you from, or what's it trying to achieve for you in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I start joking it's to stop things from getting heavy — makes the guys laugh so nobody asks why I'm lagging or sweating. It sort of hides that I'm scared I can't keep up with the new pace, but saying that out loud feels weird. Sorry, I keep wanting to make a joke instead of saying the serious stuff.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using humor to maintain a sense of control or normalcy in a situation where you're feeling uncertain and vulnerable. Can you think of a moment when you were in a situation where saying how you really felt would have been helpful, but you ended up using humor instead?

Patient: I don't know... I guess last week we were behind on a big pour and the foreman was asking why. I made some dumb joke about needing more coffee and everybody laughed, but inside I was panicking 'cause I couldn't keep up and didn't dare say I needed help — it just felt wrong to admit that.

Therapist: It sounds like you felt like admitting your struggle would make you look weak or vulnerable in front of your colleagues. Would it be helpful to try making room for a more honest, albeit potentially uncomfortable, expression of your struggles in situations like that, even if it means taking a risk of being seen as vulnerable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it could help sometimes if I actually said I was struggling — maybe someone would help instead of just laughing. But it feels risky; I'm worried they'll think I'm soft or can't handle the job. I keep wanting to make a joke instead because talking about it just feels... awkward.

Therapist: It's like there's a mix of fear of being perceived as weak or vulnerable and the discomfort of having an honest conversation. Would it be helpful to explore what values or parts of yourself you're trying to protect by avoiding these conversations – is it about maintaining a certain image, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm protecting my reputation — don't want the guys thinking I'm soft or can't handle the work. It feels like pride and wanting to be the dependable one, but honestly talking about that makes me squirm. Can we... maybe go over how I could actually say I need help without sounding weak?

Therapist: Let's explore the idea of framing your request for help in a way that still feels authentic and connected to your values. Can you think of a phrase or sentence that you could use to ask for help without feeling like you're admitting defeat or weakness?

Patient: I don't know... I guess something simple like, "Hey, I'm falling behind on this pour and could use an extra set of hands—can someone help?" Or even, "Can I get a hand here? This one's tighter than I thought." Saying it out loud still makes me squirm, though.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to phrase it in a way that still sounds confident and capable, but it's not coming naturally. What if we take a small step further and try saying it with a slightly different tone or emphasis – like, what if you focus on the specific request for help, rather than the underlying feeling of struggle?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try something like, "Hey, could someone give me a hand on this pour? I'm running behind and could use an extra set of hands." That sounds practical, but saying it out loud still makes me feel like I'm not pulling my weight. Can we, uh, practice how I'd say that so it doesn't feel so... weak?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. Can you say it with a slight pause after "Could someone give me a hand" – just a brief pause before you ask for help?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try.  
"Could someone give me a hand... I'm running behind on this pour and could use an extra set of hands."  
Ugh, that felt awkward — I almost wanted to throw in a joke. Can we do it again, maybe make it sound firmer so it doesn't come off like I'm whining?

Therapist: It's like the pause was a bit too noticeable. Let's try removing the pause, and instead, focus on using a slightly firmer tone. Can you try saying it with a bit more assertiveness, like this: "Someone give me a hand. I'm running behind on this pour and could use an extra set of hands."

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try.  
"Someone give me a hand. I'm running behind on this pour and could use an extra set of hands."  

Ugh — that felt awful. My chest tightened and this wave of shame hit me, and I almost blurted a joke to cover it. Can we do it again and work on making it sound like I'm dependable but just need backup, so it doesn't read as whining?

Therapist: The shame and defensiveness that came up for you is interesting. Let's try to separate that from the request for help. Can you focus on the practical aspect of needing extra hands, without worrying about how others might perceive you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to stick to the task part. Maybe something like, "I need two more hands on this pour so we can get it done on time" — saying that still makes me feel small and pissed at myself, like some old screw-up is poking at me. Can we try practicing that once more, and maybe keep it short so I don't start making jokes?

Therapist: The focus on needing extra hands is clear, but the underlying emotions still show up. Let's try to keep it brief and to the point, without emphasizing the self-criticism. Can you try saying it in a single breath, without any pause or self-deprecating language?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try.  
"Someone give me a hand I'm running behind on this pour and need two extra hands."  

Ugh, that landed weird — my chest tightened and this wave of shame hit like an old screw-up. Can we try it again and make it sound more firm and businesslike? I'm worried I'll come off soft.

Therapist: The shame is really showing up again. Let's try to focus on the action needed to get the job done, without any emotional emphasis. Can you try it with a very straightforward, no-nonsense tone, like you're simply stating a fact?

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow how that helps. Okay, here goes: "Someone give me a hand I'm running behind on this pour I need two extra hands."  

That landed flat and — ugh — this old shame hit me hard, made me want to crack a joke to cover it. Can we try it again? Maybe tell me how to make it sound more solid so I don't feel like I'm asking to be babysat.

Therapist: It's like the shame is really hard to shake. Let's try to connect with the value of being able to ask for help without feeling embarrassed. What if, instead of trying to sound "solid" or "not asking to be babysat," you focus on the value of having a team that can get the job done together?

Patient: I don't know... thinking about the team sounds good, but when I try to say that I get this hot flash of shame like some old screw-up is staring at me. I guess I want to make a joke to dodge it, 'cause admitting I need the crew feels like admitting I'm weak. Can we... try practicing a line that focuses on the crew and the job—something short and blunt—so I don't spiral into the usual deflection?

Therapist: The shame is really close to the surface. Let's try to focus on the physical act of asking for help, without getting tangled up in the emotions. Can you try saying it in a very straightforward, no-nonsense way, without any hint of self-doubt?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try.  
"Need two extra hands on the pour — let's get it done."  
Ugh, that still tightened my chest and I almost made a joke to cover it; can we do another round so it sounds solid and not like I'm whining?

Therapist: It's like you're really close to making it sound solid, but the shame is still just out of reach. Let's try something even more direct: can you say it without any hint of justification or apology, just a straightforward statement of fact?

Patient: I don't know... okay. "Need two extra hands on the pour. Let's get it done."  
Ugh — saying that tightened my chest and this stupid shame hit me like that old screw-up all over again, and I nearly cracked a joke to mask it. Can we run it again? I keep wanting to dodge it with humor.

Therapist: It's like the shame is still lurking just beneath the surface. Let's try to focus on the physical act of taking action, without getting caught up in the emotions. Can you try saying it with a completely flat tone, no inflection, no emphasis, just a straightforward statement?

Patient: I don't know... okay. "Need two extra hands on the pour. Let's get it done."  
Ugh — it felt flat but my chest locked up and that stupid shame hit me, I almost threw in a joke to cover it. Can we try again? Maybe give me a cue so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless.

Therapist: The flat tone didn't quite reach the mark. I'd like to try something a bit different. Can you try saying it while taking a deep breath in, and then out, before saying it – that might help you feel more grounded and less reactive?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I tried the breath. (In my head.)  
"Need two extra hands on the pour. Let's get it done."  

Ugh — chest tightened and that stupid shame came flooding back, like that old screw-up's staring at me, and I almost cracked a joke to cover it. Can we keep practicing that with a cue or something so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless?

Therapist: It's like the shame is really strong. Let's try something a bit different. Can you try saying the phrase while standing up straight, and looking around the room with a sense of purpose – maybe that will help you feel more grounded and confident?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I tried standing up straight and looking around. I said, "Need two extra hands on the pour. Let's get it done," but my chest tightened and this wave of shame hit me and I almost cracked a joke to cover it. I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and try it in smaller steps or give me a cue so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless?

Therapist: It's like the shame is overwhelming. Let's take a step back. Can you try just saying the phrase without the "Let's get it done" part – just say "Need two extra hands on the pour." See how that feels, and then we can try adding the rest.

Patient: I don't know... okay. "Need two extra hands on the pour." Ugh — my chest tightened and that stupid shame hit me like that old screw-up all over again, I almost cracked a joke to hide it. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and add the rest in smaller steps or give me a cue so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless?

Therapist: It's like the shame is still very present. Let's try something even smaller. Can you just say the phrase without the words "Need two extra hands on the pour" – just say "I need some help" – and see how that feels?

Patient: I don't know... okay. "I need some help."  

Ugh — that felt terrible, chest tightened, got this hot shame flash and I almost blurted a joke to cover it. Can we slow down? Maybe practice how I'd say it on the site so it doesn't sound like I'm whining.

Therapist: It's like the shame is really close to the surface. Let's try a tiny step back. Can you just say the word "help" – just the word "help" – without any context or inflection, and see how that feels?

Patient: I don't know... "help." Ugh — saying that made my chest tighten and this stupid shame wash over me like that old screw-up again, and I almost cracked a joke to cover it. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and practice how I'd say it on the site so it doesn't sound like whining?

Therapist: It's like the shame is really hard to shake. Let's try to focus on the physical sensation of your body in the moment – where are you feeling it? Is it in your chest, shoulders, or somewhere else?

Patient: I don't know... it's mostly a heavy tightness in my chest, like my breath gets shallow and my shoulders bunch up. My jaw clenches and my stomach knots, and then this wave of shame hits like that old screw-up again and I want to crack a joke to cover it. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed — can we slow down and keep doing smaller steps?

Therapist: It's like the physical sensations are really intense. Can you try to just acknowledge those sensations without trying to push them away or change them – just notice them as they are, and then see if you can bring your attention to the phrase "I need some help" again?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm noticing the tightness in my chest, shoulders up by my ears, breath shallow, jaw locked — it all gets louder when I try to say it. When I bring "I need some help" into my head my mouth goes dry and that stupid shame creeps in, like that old screw‑up's staring at me, and I immediately want to throw a joke out to cover it. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed — can we slow down and do even smaller steps, or maybe you say it with me so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless?

Therapist: It's like the shame is really hard to shake. I'd like to try something that might help you feel more grounded. Can you try repeating the phrase "I need some help" very slowly and quietly with me, together, and see how that feels?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try.  
"I need... some... help."  

Ugh — that tightened my chest and that stupid shame hit like that old screw‑up again; can we slow down and say it together so it doesn't feel like I'm admitting I'm useless?

Therapist: Let's try it again, even slower. Can you say "I need... some... help" with just a tiny bit of space between each word, and a very soft, gentle tone?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try.  
"I... need... some... help."  

Ugh — my chest tightened and that stupid shame hit like that old screw‑up again, and I almost blurted a joke to cover it. Can we slow down and say it together or do even smaller steps?

Therapist: Let's take it down even further. Can you try just saying "I... need" in a very soft, gentle voice, and then pause for a moment before adding the next word?

Patient: I don't know... okay. I... need.  

Ugh, that pause made my chest tighten and that stupid shame rushed in like that old screw‑up again, and I instantly wanted to throw out a joke to dodge it. Can we say the rest together or go even slower? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.
