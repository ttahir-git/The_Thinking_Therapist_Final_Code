Patient: I've been on edge since the move — I get angry and frustrated over little things, mostly when dealing with the new place, neighbors, or unpacking. I'm used to fixing things with my hands, not dealing with stuff that messes with my head, so it feels... off. I guess I don't know how to keep it from bubbling over.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit disoriented and struggling to adapt to this new environment. Unpacking can be overwhelming, especially when it feels like there's a lot of emotional labor involved. It's as if your mind is getting tangled up in the mess of your surroundings. Can you explore with me what happens when you try to engage with these feelings of frustration, rather than trying to push them away or fix everything with your hands?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to sit with it it just gets louder — my chest goes tight and I feel like I'm gonna snap. I usually end up doing something physical, tearing into a project or pacing, or I bottle it up and then blow up at someone over something small. I guess I'm not great at talking about this; can we focus on some concrete things I can do when I feel it coming on?

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to acknowledge the feeling, it's like a storm is brewing inside, and you might feel like you're losing control. It's like your body is a riot, and you're searching for a way to calm it down. In that moment, what would it be like if, instead of trying to calm the storm, you simply allowed yourself to feel the tension in your body – just notice it, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice it, it just gets louder — chest gets tight and I feel like I gotta move or I'm gonna snap. I guess maybe it could help if I did it while doing something small, like standing outside or focusing on my breath, but can we go over some concrete steps I can actually use when I'm on the job or unpacking?

Therapist: It seems like when you try to notice the tension, it's like the body is resisting it. Let's explore this further. What if, when you feel the urge to move or snap, you could pause and ask yourself: "What's the one small, tiny thing I can do right now to create some space for myself in this moment?"

Patient: I guess the one tiny thing would be to step away for a minute — go outside, put down the tool, and take three slow breaths. On the job I could say to a coworker "give me five" and count to ten; when unpacking I could set a five‑minute timer and only work on one box. I don't know, it feels a bit dumb, but having those simple, concrete moves might actually stop me from blowing up.

Therapist: That's a great start – taking small breaks and creating space feels like a good way to calm down. It's not dumb at all, by the way; sometimes the smallest actions can make a big difference. I'd like to explore this further – what would happen if, instead of using a timer or counting to ten, you started by simply saying to yourself, "Okay, I've had enough" – no explanation, no justification, just those simple three words?

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying "Okay, I've had enough" might actually help — it's simple and doesn't need any explaining. It feels weird, like admitting defeat, but maybe that's what would let me step away before I snap. On the job I could murmur it and head to my truck for a minute; at home I could set a box down and make a coffee.

Therapist: It sounds like recognizing that you've had enough can be a powerful way to create some distance and prevent a reaction. And it's interesting that you bring up the idea of it feeling like admitting defeat – sometimes acknowledging our limitations can be a form of self-care. Can you think of a time when you used that phrase in a different context, when you were feeling overwhelmed or tired, and how did it feel to say those words to yourself then?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one time was after a brutal shift — machines kept breaking and I kept snapping at the crew, so I said "Okay, I've had enough" and went to sit in my truck for five minutes. It felt stupid, like I was giving up, but after a minute the tightness eased a bit, like letting pressure out of a pipe. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "Okay, I've had enough" can be a way to release the pressure and calm down, almost like a valve opening. And it's okay that you felt like giving up – it's a normal response to feeling overwhelmed. What if, instead of focusing on that initial feeling of giving up, you could explore what happens when you do manage to step away, like after the five minutes in the truck? What does your body feel like after you take that break – is it more relaxed, or do you still feel wound up?

Patient: I guess after those five minutes my shoulders unclench a bit and my breathing slows — the knot in my chest eases, not all the way but enough that I'm not seeing red. I don't know... the anger's still there like a low hum, and I'm worried it'll come back as soon as I pick up the next thing. Can we go over concrete tricks I can use when I can't actually step away on the job?

Therapist: It sounds like your body has a chance to recover a bit after taking the break, but the underlying tension is still there. Let's explore this further – what if, when you can't step away, you could use a physical sensation as a signal to pause and take a few deep breaths, rather than just letting the anger simmer? For example, when you feel the anger start to build, you could focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the chair beneath you, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you think of a specific physical sensation that might serve as a gentle reminder to pause and breathe?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the simplest one is feeling my boots on the ground — noticing the weight in my feet and the contact with the floor. When it starts up I could press my heels down, take three slow breaths, and keep moving; feels dumb but might stop me from snapping.

Therapist: Noticing the sensation of your boots on the ground can be a great anchor for staying present. And it's a small, low-stakes way to create some space. It's not dumb at all – sometimes the smallest actions can be the most helpful. I'd like to explore this further – what if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you could also use the sensation of your feet to shift your focus towards a valued action? For example, if you're feeling anxious about a task, you could focus on the sensation of your feet moving, and then imagine yourself taking a step towards completing that task, even if it's just one small step.

Patient: I don't know... I guess focusing on my boots and imagining taking one small step could help. I'm not great at thinking up steps on the spot — can you give concrete examples of tiny, low-key steps I could picture or do on the job or when unpacking? It helps if it's something I can do without making a scene.

Therapist: Let's focus on some tiny, low-key steps you can picture or do on the job or when unpacking. One example might be taking a small sip of water from your coffee cup, or wiping your hands on a cloth instead of using a towel, or simply straightening your back when you're standing. These small actions can help create a sense of control and make the big picture feel less overwhelming. What if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you could picture yourself taking one of these small actions, like straightening your back, and then imagine taking one small step towards the task at hand?

Patient: I don't know... I guess picturing straightening my back and taking one step sounds doable. On the job I could replant my boots and breathe, shift a board a foot instead of trying to finish the whole thing, or when unpacking I could tape one box closed and set it aside — small, quiet moves. I'm kinda skeptical it'll stick though; can we make a short, easy list I can actually remember when I'm right in the middle of it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see some possibilities for small, low-key actions that can help you stay grounded. Creating a list can be a great way to make it more concrete and accessible. Here's a simple list you can carry with you: "Replant my boots", "take a deep breath and shift a board", "tape one box closed", "straighten my back", "take one small step". Keep it short, and you can refer to it when you need to. What's the first one you can commit to trying in the next 10 minutes?

Patient: I guess I'll try the "replant my boots" thing — press my heels down and take three slow breaths before I lift anything. I don't know if it'll stick, but I'll do that in the next ten minutes; can we talk about a quick cue I can use so I don't forget when I'm busy?

Therapist: That's a great starting point. For a quick cue, what if you could use a personal anchor that's easy to recall, like a small phrase or a physical gesture? For example, you could say "Check my feet" to yourself when you need to replant your boots, or you could tap your heels gently on the ground. What's something that feels like a natural part of your daily routine, something you do without thinking about it, that could serve as a cue for you to take a moment to replant your boots?

Patient: I guess a natural cue would be whatever I do without thinking — like adjusting my gloves or hitting my hammer against my belt when I pause. When I do that I can press my heels, take three slow breaths, and keep going. Do you think that's a good enough trigger, or should I pick a phrase instead?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a natural cue that feels authentic to your daily routine. Using a physical action like adjusting your gloves or hitting your hammer against your belt can be a great way to create a consistent trigger. Pressing your heels, taking three slow breaths, and then continuing can help you stay grounded. Since this already feels like a built-in habit for you, I think it's a great starting point.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds doable — use the glove adjust or hammer tap as the cue and press my heels and breathe. I'm skeptical it'll stick, but I'll try it next shift. I'm kinda overwhelmed thinking about keeping it up all day; can we talk about ways to practice it so it feels automatic?

Therapist: It's normal to feel skeptical, but taking small steps can add up. Let's explore ways to make it feel more automatic. One idea is to practice this skill in low-stakes situations outside of work or unpacking. For example, you could try it when you're waiting in line, or during a commercial break while watching TV. See if you can use the glove adjust or hammer tap as a cue to press your heels and breathe, without feeling like you're "practicing" or "trying" too much. Can you think of a situation where you could try this out and make it feel more like a habitual action, rather than something you're forcing yourself to do?

Patient: I guess I could try it in the truck before I step out in the morning, or during slow spots on the site when I naturally adjust my gloves or tap my hammer. I don't know if I'll remember when I'm fired up, but I could also practice it while waiting in line or on a coffee break so it feels less forced.

Therapist: Those are great ideas for practicing this skill in everyday situations. By making it a part of your daily routine, you can help it feel more automatic. And it's okay if you don't remember every time, especially when you're feeling fired up – the goal is to create a foundation for more mindful moments. What if, instead of focusing on remembering to practice, you could focus on simply showing up and doing the action, without expecting yourself to remember? Can you try that – just focus on the physical sensation of pressing your heels, taking a breath, and letting go?

Patient: I guess I can try that — press my heels, take one slow breath, and try to let some of it go. I did it once in the truck and it helped a bit, so maybe I can get into the habit during slow spots. I'm worried though — when I get really mad I just forget, and I don't know how to catch myself then.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the challenge of getting caught up in strong emotions. One approach is to focus on the physical sensations that come before you get really mad – the feeling of your heart rate increasing, your muscles tensing, or your breath getting shallow. Can you explore what those sensations might be like when you're feeling overwhelmed, and then imagine yourself taking a step back, pressing your heels, and taking a breath right as those sensations start to arise?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the early signs are my chest getting tight, my jaw and hands clenching, my face heating up, breath getting shallow and I start fidgeting or grinding my teeth. If I imagine stepping back, pressing my heels and taking a slow breath when that first twinge hits, my shoulders loosen a bit, but I worry I won't notice it soon enough — once I'm really mad I'm on autopilot. Can we go over some concrete ways to catch those early signs sooner or simple reminders I can use on the job?

Therapist: Those physical sensations are great to recognize. One idea is to use a physical anchor that you can use as a subtle reminder to pause. For example, you could place a small sticky note on your keyboard or monitor with a simple phrase like "Check in" or "Pause". When you start to feel those early signs, you can glance down at the note and take a deep breath, pressing your heels and letting some of the tension release. Another idea is to use a vocal cue, like saying "Ah" or "Hmmm" to yourself when you feel the tension starting to build. What do you think of these ideas, or is there something else that might work for you?

Patient: I don't know... sticky notes sound fine for home, but not on a noisy site. I guess the glove adjust/hammer tap still feels more natural — maybe add a rubber band on my wrist or a little bead on the glove so it's a tactile nudge when I fidget. I could also ask one crew member to give me a short word like "hold" if they see me getting tight, but I'm skeptical it'll work when I'm already fired up — can we come up with something that actually catches me in that first twinge?

Therapist: Sticky notes might not be practical on a noisy site. I like the idea of using a glove adjust/hammer tap with a tactile nudge, like a rubber band or bead, to help you remember to pause. For a more discreet option, you could try a simple word or phrase that you can say to yourself when you feel the tension starting to build, like "Ah" or "Okay". Alternatively, you could use a discreet gesture, like tapping your wrist or the armrest of your chair, to remind yourself to take a deep breath. What if, when you're on the job, you could also try using a phrase like "Breathe in" or "Relax" to yourself, even if you're already in a high-stress situation? The key is to find something that feels natural and can be used in a moment when you're already feeling overwhelmed.

Patient: I don't know... my hands feel jittery just thinking about it, so sorry if I'm all over the place. I still like the bead/rubber band on the glove — that's something I can feel without making a scene, and a tiny inward word like "easy" or "check" might work if I keep it quiet. I'm worried I won't notice the first twinge though — how do I practice so that the cue actually grabs me right when it starts, and how do I get a crew member to give a discreet reminder without making it weird?

Therapist: No need to apologize - it's completely normal to feel a bit anxious about trying new strategies. I'm here to support you. One way to practice the cue is to imagine yourself in a situation where you might feel the twinge, and then imagine yourself reacting to it. For example, imagine you're working on a challenging task and you start to feel tension building up. As you imagine the twinge, say to yourself "easy" or "check" and feel the physical sensation of pressing your heels and taking a breath. Repeat this process a few times, and see if you can start to develop a sense of what that physical sensation might feel like. As for getting a crew member to give a discreet reminder, you could try explaining the situation to them and asking if they could give you a brief word like "hold" or "check in" when they notice you starting to tense up. You could say something like "Hey, I'm feeling a bit tight on this project, can you keep an eye on me and give me a nod if I start to get worked up?"

Patient: I don't know... my hands are shaky just thinking about it. Maybe I'll practice in the truck a few times — slap the bead, say "easy," press my heels, breathe, repeat until it's not weird. For the crew, I guess I'd pick one guy I trust and ask him to say "hold" or nod once if he sees me clench, and we can rehearse it so it feels normal. Can you give me one short sentence I can use to ask him, something simple I won't overthink?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about the physical sensations, and it's great that you're willing to practice in a low-stakes setting. Practicing in the truck with the bead and saying "easy" can help you build confidence. For asking your crew member to give you a discreet reminder, how about this: "Can you just keep an eye on me and let me know if I need a break?" It's simple and straightforward, and it allows him to respond with a nod or a word without drawing attention to the situation.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds simple enough. I'll try saying, "Can you just keep an eye on me and let me know if I need a break?" — feels weird to ask, but I'll practice it in the truck a couple times; how should I rehearse it so it doesn't come out awkward?

Therapist: Rehearsing the phrase in the truck can help you feel more comfortable with the words. Try saying it to yourself while driving, without looking at your crew member. Repeat it a few times, and focus on the sensation of your voice saying the words. Then, practice saying it to an imaginary person, like a friend or family member, who can respond with a nod or a simple acknowledgement. This will help you get used to the sound and feel of the words in a more relaxed setting. When you feel ready, you can start rehearsing it with your crew member, and they can respond with a nod or a "hold" to help you feel more comfortable with the feedback.

Patient: I don't know... I'll try saying it in the truck a few times so it sounds normal. It's taking a lot just to think about saying it out loud—can you give me one tiny, two‑word line I can use with the guy so I don't fumble? I guess something like "watch me" or "hold up"?

Therapist: Saying it in the truck a few times will help you get more comfortable with the words. For a one-word cue, how about "check"? It's short, simple, and can be a discreet way to ask your crew member to keep an eye on you.

Patient: I don't know... "check" feels okay, I think. If he says it, should I just press my heels and take one slow breath, or do something else first?

Therapist: When your crew member says "check", you can simply respond by pressing your heels and taking one slow breath. No need to do anything else - just focus on the physical sensations in your body and let the breath calm you down.

Patient: I don't know... I guess if he says "check" I'll press my heels and take one slow breath. My hands are all jittery just thinking about it and I'm not sure I'll hear him or stop in time — feels like too much sometimes. Can you give me one tiny fallback I can do if I'm already mid-swing and can't really pause?

Therapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about hearing the cue in a noisy environment. For a tiny fallback, how about taking a small, quick pause - just a brief moment to drop your grip on the tool and press your heels, without taking a full breath? It's a tiny pause, just a brief moment to collect yourself, and it might be enough to give you a chance to regroup before you continue working.

Patient: I don't know... that tiny pause sounds okay if I can actually let go for a split second. If I'm holding something heavy maybe I could just loosen my grip and press my heels — I guess that'd be safer. Can you give me one tiny sentence or cue to say to myself mid‑swing so I don't overthink it?

Therapist: A small change in grip can make a big difference. For a tiny sentence to say to yourself mid-swing, how about "Let go"? It's a simple reminder to release your grip and press your heels, without drawing attention to yourself or overthinking the situation.

Patient: I don't know... "Let go" might work. My hands are all jittery just picturing being mid-swing, so maybe I'll whisper it under my breath and loosen my grip at the same time — quick, quiet, nothing fancy. Feels like too much to plan right now; can you give me one tiny practice I can do in the truck to make that automatic?

Therapist: It's better to start small. For a tiny practice, try this: while driving in the truck, do it just once, quietly, without thinking about it too much. Whisper "Let go" to yourself and loosen your grip on the wheel (or whatever you're holding) as you say it. Don't worry about doing it perfectly, just focus on the sensation of your fingers releasing and your heels pressing down. Can you do that for me, just for a few seconds?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I tried it — whispered "let go," eased my grip, pressed my heels. Felt a bit less tight, but my hands are still jittery and my chest's kinda jumpy. Can we go over what to do if I don't notice it in time when I'm already heated?
