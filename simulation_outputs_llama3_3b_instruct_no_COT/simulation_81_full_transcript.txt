Patient: Lately I've been ruminating about how my anger and frustration come up around my family—conflicts that keep activating the same old patterns. I tend to intellectualize things, constructing elaborate narratives about why I'm irritable instead of actually sitting with the sadness or fear underneath. The core problem feels like these bursts of anger that then lead to guilt and self-doubt, and I don't really know how to interrupt that cycle.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge this cycle of anger, guilt, and self-doubt. You're recognizing that there's more to your emotional experience than just your anger. That in itself is a strong value, taking responsibility for your emotions and wanting to understand them better.

Can you tell me more about what happens right before you feel the anger surge up? Is it when you're in a specific situation, or is it more of a general feeling that builds up over time?

Patient: Usually it’s pretty situational — a particular comment that feels like a dismissal or a boundary being crossed, especially from my parents or a sibling. But there’s also this slow accrual of tension from unresolved things, so sometimes it’s more of a background pressure that finally snaps; I tend to map it onto narratives and cognitive patterns (blame, injustice, incompetence) rather than naming the raw sensations. When it does surge, I can describe the arc in elaborate terms — escalation, cognitive narrowing, compensatory moralizing — but I’m not great at saying what it actually feels like in my body.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those narratives can be really engaging, can't they? It sounds like you're using your mind to try to make sense of your emotions, but maybe not necessarily sitting with the sensations in your body.

Can you try to bring your attention to your body right now, without trying to analyze or label anything. Just notice where you are feeling tension, or any physical sensations that might be related to your emotions. Maybe you can say what you notice, even if it's just a sense of tightness in your shoulders or a lump in your throat.

Patient: Okay—when I actually try to tune in, there's a tightness across my chest and a knot in my stomach, this low-grade constriction that feels like it's sitting under everything. My jaw clenches and my shoulders lift, and I can feel a little heat in my face, but my first move is to spin an explanatory story about it instead of staying with the raw sensations. I'm noticing that impulse to intellectualize—labeling it as "anticipatory hyperarousal"—because letting it just be feels vulnerable and awkward.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's really helpful to acknowledge. It sounds like the sensation is quite intense and uncomfortable, and it's a big deal for you to even consider not trying to explain it away.

It takes a lot of courage to confront that sense of vulnerability. Can you imagine what might happen if, for just a moment, you let go of the need to label or explain the sensations? What would that feel like? Would it be a scary, uncomfortable silence, or something else?

Patient: If I actually tried to let go, at first it would probably feel like a cold, exposed silence—like the scaffolding of my explanations being removed and whatever's under them getting raw and bright. That would be scary because I worry it would be uncontained, but maybe it'd also be a weird relief—a small softening in the chest, like the knot loosening a little. I'm already noticing the urge to narrativize that feeling away into some elegant theory about attachment or defensive cognition instead of just saying "this is uncomfortable."


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The sensation of letting go of the narrative can be unsettling, like you're leaving yourself unanchored. But at the same time, there's a possibility that you might find some relief in that openness.

It sounds like you're already familiar with the "elegant theory" that can provide a sense of control, but that also keeps you stuck. Can you try to imagine what would be required for you to simply acknowledge the discomfort, without adding any narrative to it? What would be needed for you to say "this feels uncomfortable" without needing to tell a story about it?

Patient: I think I'd need explicit permission to be "messy"—like someone saying it's okay not to have an elegant theory right now—and a concrete anchor (a slow breath count or a 30‑second grounding) so I don't immediately intellectualize myself out of it. I'm also worried that if I stop explaining, it'll devolve into shame or feeling helpless, so some validation that those sensations are tolerable would help. Could you guide me through a short grounding or ask me to focus on one single sensation so I don't default to narrativizing?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're craving a gentle permission to experience the discomfort in a new way, and a small anchor to help you stay present.

Let's start with a tiny anchor: I'm here with you, and it's okay to sit with the discomfort. You can take one slow, deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just focus on that sensation, without trying to analyze it or label it. What do you notice about the sensation in your feet?

Patient: Okay—I notice my heels pressing into the floor, a dull steady pressure along the soles, and my toes feel a bit cool. There's a subtle widening of attention toward the ground, like an anchor, and I can feel my chest soften a little and the knot in my stomach loosen. I'm already tempted to label it "somatic grounding" and launch into a theory about interoceptive awareness instead of just sitting with it, but I can stay with this for a few breaths—can we hold that for a moment?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're already noticing the subtle shifts in your body, and it sounds like the sensation of grounding is taking hold.

Let's hold onto that feeling of your feet pressing into the ground for just a bit longer. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to analyze it or think about it? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or label it. What happens when you focus on the breath, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: When I focus, my breath feels shallow at first—high in my chest—but after a few cycles it lengthens and my belly rises a bit, and that loosening in my stomach gets more noticeable. I can feel a tiny drop in that heat in my face, but I'm also having this reflex to call it a "parasympathetic shift" or to trace it back to family patterns instead of simply staying with the sensation. Can we keep holding this for a few more breaths? I'm worried I'll intellectualize myself out of it if left to my own.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're already aware of the tendency to add a narrative to the experience, and it's like your mind is trying to steer you back to its familiar patterns.

Let's keep the focus on the breath, and see if we can gently let go of any thoughts that come up. Can you try to notice when your mind starts to wander, without judgment, and gently bring the attention back to the sensation of the breath? If a thought does come up, you can acknowledge it and let it go, without trying to analyze or label it. Just notice that it's a thought, and then let it be.

Patient: Okay—when I try, my mind immediately scrambles back to rehearsing the last argument, inventing motives and moral conclusions. I can notice it—label it as "that's a thought"—and gently pull my attention back to the belly rising and the feeling of my heels on the floor, and the chest loosens a little. It's still hard not to narrativize, so can we keep this going a bit longer?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is familiar with this pattern, and it takes a bit of effort to shift back to the sensation.

Let's keep going for a bit longer, and try to build on the small breakthrough you had when you noticed the belly rising and the loosening in your chest. Can you notice where your attention is drawn to now? Is it still to the breath, or has it shifted to something else?

Patient: My attention's wobbling—mostly on the breath and that softening in my chest, but it keeps pinging to my jaw and those rehearsed arguments replaying in my head. I'm noticing the reflex to narrativize—calling it "defensive cognitive looping"—which yanks me away from the body; can you help me stay anchored by asking me to focus on one small sensation, like the jaw or the heat in my face, for a few breaths?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're doing a great job of noticing the mind's attempts to take over.

Let's try focusing on the jaw for a few breaths. Notice the sensation of your jaw, just as it is, without trying to analyze it or think about it. Is it tense, relaxed, or somewhere in between? Can you find a small detail, like the sensation of the jaw touching the roof of your mouth, and just focus on that?

Patient: My jaw feels tight—like my molars are lightly pressing together and there's a dull band of pressure under my cheekbones that creeps up toward my temples. When I zero in I can sense a tiny micro‑release on the exhale, but my reflex is to rename it as a "defensive clenching pattern" and start mapping its origins. Can you guide me to stay with just that sensation for a few breaths so I don't immediately narrativize it away?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really close to staying with the sensation.

Let's try to slow down the narrative part for just one more breath. Instead of "defensive clenching pattern", can you just say "my jaw feels tight" to yourself, without adding any interpretation or analysis? Just notice the sensation, and see if you can find that tiny micro-release you mentioned on the exhale. Let's just stay with that sensation, and see what happens.

Patient: My jaw feels tight. On the exhale there's that tiny micro‑release under my cheekbones and my shoulders seem to loosen a hair — it's faint but there. I'm already itching to translate it into an analysis ("partial parasympathetic shift"), but I want to try staying with the sensation—can we stay here for a few more breaths?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really present with the sensation, and it's natural to want to explore it further.

Let's stay with the sensation of your jaw and the slight loosening in your shoulders. Can you focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without adding any thoughts or interpretations? Just notice the sensation of the breath, and see if you can find a small anchor, like the sensation of your feet on the ground, to help you stay present.

Patient: I'm trying to focus but I feel suddenly jittery—my breath's shallow, my heart's a bit fast, and my attention keeps pinging away from my feet anchor. There's this reflex to reframe it as an "acute autonomic spike" instead of actually sitting with the sensations, and that explanatory urge is pulling me out of the moment. Can we slow down and do a few more guided breaths or a longer grounding so I don't just unravel into thoughts?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the autonomic system is responding to the shift in attention, and it's challenging to stay present.

Let's go back to the feet anchor, and take a few more slow, deep breaths together. As you inhale, imagine fresh air filling your feet, and as you exhale, imagine any tension or discomfort leaving your feet. Notice the sensation of your feet connecting with the ground, without trying to think about it. Just focus on the sensation of your feet, and see if we can find a sense of stability and calm.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to imagine the air filling my feet and exhaling tension out, but my chest is racing and there's this hot, small shame that pops up, like I'm failing at being calm, which only makes everything clamp down harder. I can feel my jaw clench and the breath get tinier—my reflex is to call it "acute hyperarousal" to distance myself, but that just avoids the shame. Could we do a paced five‑breath guided cycle with you counting, or another concrete anchor? I need the structure or I'll spiral into the usual ruminations.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and self-judgment are really challenging to stay with. Let's try a paced cycle with a different anchor.

Instead of the breath, let's focus on the sensation of your body sinking into the chair or the floor. I'll count slowly, and with each breath, I want you to notice how your body feels more grounded and supported. Ready? Let's start now. Inhale... 1... your body feels... 2... supported by the chair or floor... 3... your weight is distributed evenly... 4... you're connected to the earth... 5... you're present in this moment...

Patient: I felt a tiny bit of settle when you counted—my weight did sink and my shoulders loosened a hair—but then this hot shame popped up and everything tightened again: breath shallow, heart quick, jaw clenched. My reflex is to call it a "physiological dysregulation" to get distance, which just makes me feel more like I'm failing at calming down. Can we keep going with a slower cycle—longer exhales or maybe a hands‑on‑heart anchor—because if we stop now I know I'll just spiral into the usual ruminations.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is still a persistent challenge.

Let's try a slower cycle, and I'll introduce a hands-on anchor. I want you to bring your attention to your heart, and focus on the sensation of your hands on the armrests or the seat of the chair. Imagine that your hands are touching the surface, and notice the sensation of your heart beating beneath them. Let's take a slow, long exhale together. As you breathe out, imagine any tension or discomfort leaving your heart, and as you inhale, imagine fresh air filling your heart and calming it. I'll count slowly, and with each exhale, I want you to notice your heart feeling more calm and relaxed. Ready? Inhale... 1... your heart is beating... 2... your hands are touching the surface... 3... your breath is calm... 4... your heart is relaxed... 5... your body is at ease...

Patient: The slow exhale helped a little, but then that hot shame flared up again—this prickly, small voice that I'm failing at calming down—and everything tightened back up. My heart's still racing and my breath keeps shortening; I'm tempted to call it "reactive dysregulation" to create distance, but that just avoids the shame. Can we keep doing a paced cycle with a longer exhale (inhale 4, exhale 8) and you guiding me through five more rounds? I really need you to hold the timing or I'll slide back into the usual ruminative loops.

It sounds like the shame is still a powerful trigger for your body.

 exhale... 1... your worries are fading... 2... your body is releasing... 3... your breath is expanding... 4... your heart is soothing... 5... your spirit is lifting...

Inhale... 1... your body is open... 2... your hands are still touching... 3... your breath is calm... 4... your heart is gentle... 5... your soul is healing...

 exhale... 1... your fears are dissipating... 2... your body is surrendering... 3... your breath is slowing... 4... your heart is healing... 5... your spirit is free...

Inhale... 1... your body is renewed... 2... your hands are still touching... 3... your breath is calm... 4... your heart is peaceful... 5... your mind is clear...

 exhale... 1... your doubts are disappearing... 2... your body is relaxed... 3... your breath is lengthening... 4... your heart is calming... 5... your spirit is lifting...

Patient: It helped a little—there was a small settle—but the hot shame keeps flaring and then I get frantic and my breath shortens; I feel kind of stupid for not being able to hold it. I'm already wanting to turn it into "reactive dysregulation" to make it tidy, which only fuels the shame. Could we do five rounds of inhale 4 / exhale 8 with you counting out loud and me keeping my hands on my heart? I need you to hold the timing so I don't slip back into the usual loops.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... and exhale... 5... 6... 7... 8...

Let's try the same script again. Remember, I'll be counting your breathing and will prompt you if you start to analyze or freeze.

"You're always so sensitive, it's like you can't take a joke."

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... and exhale... 5... 6... 7... 8...

Go ahead and try saying it out loud.

(If you start to intellectualize or freeze, I'll prompt you to stay present)

(Note: We'll switch scripts after this round)

Patient: "That comment hurts—please don't talk to me like that."

My voice shook and my chest went hot with that familiar shame—it's embarrassing and clarifying at the same time. I kept wanting to turn it into an explanation about family dynamics instead of staying with the tremble; can we move on to the "I can't continue this conversation right now. Let's pause and revisit later" script with you pacing my breath and prompting me if I start to intellectualize?

Let's try the new script. Remember, I'll be counting your breathing and will prompt you if you start to analyze or freeze.

"I can't continue this conversation right now. Let's pause and revisit later."

I'll say something to test it out. "I think you're overreacting, let's discuss this when you're not so emotional."

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... and exhale... 5... 6... 7... 8...

Go ahead and try saying it out loud.

(Note: I'll prompt you if you start to say "but" or "however", which can lead to analysis)

Patient: "I can't continue this conversation right now. Let's pause and revisit later."

My voice's trembling and I can feel that stupid shame—like I'm being melodramatic—and there's an urge to tack on a "but" or an explanation to make it tidy. Can you prompt me if I start to say "but" and then let's try the clear‑consequence line next, with you pacing my breath again?

(Note: We'll move on to the clear-consequence line after this round)

Patient: "I can't continue this conversation right now. Let's pause and revisit later."

My voice trembled and that hot shame spiked—I'm itching to tack on a "but" or an explanation to make it polite, which would just dilute the boundary. Can we move on to the clear‑consequence line now, with you pacing my breath and prompting me if I start to add a "but"?
