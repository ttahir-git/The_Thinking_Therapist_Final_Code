Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this persistent sense of being stuck and directionless — I can't really see what matters to me beyond running my business. I find myself doing these elaborate intellectual inventories about purpose, isolation, and burnout instead of actually feeling what's under them. I worry it's all analysis to avoid the rawer stuff, but I can't seem to get past it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in a cycle of trying to figure things out intellectually, rather than stepping into your experience of the present moment. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do take a step back from these intellectual inventories and try to just be with your body and emotions, without trying to solve or analyze anything? What might you notice?

Patient: When I try to step back there's a low-grade tightness in my chest and a kind of hollow, muted feeling under my ribs, like an alarm that's been turned to whisper. Almost immediately my brain ricochets into theorizing — attachment patterns, role-identity, narrative coherence — instead of just naming "sad" or "scared." So what I notice is this flip between somatic dullness and verbose analysis; it feels protective but also exhausting, and I don't really know how to stay with the rawness without turning it into a concept.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a kind of push-and-pull between acknowledging the physical sensations of discomfort and getting caught up in intellectual explanations. This feeling of exhaustion is quite common, by the way. Can you think of a time when you've been in a situation where you've felt physically numb, like this hollow feeling under your ribs, and you've noticed that your mind hasn't immediately jumped to an explanation or a story?

Patient: Rarely — when it happens it's usually during repetitive, embodied activities like long walks or working with my hands (gardening, sanding wood) where the rhythmic sensorimotor input seems to blunt the narrative mind. Even then I tend to intellectualize the interruption as an attentional-load phenomenon or a transient deregulatory state, which means I describe the quiet more than I inhabit it. Once, at a silent retreat, the numbness persisted long enough for me to notice a sort of background ache, but I catalogued it more as data than as an experience.

Therapist: It sounds like you have moments where the narrative mind is less dominant, and you're able to tap into a more basic level of experience. And when that happens, you're still trying to understand it intellectually, even if it's not necessarily descriptive. Would it be possible to explore what would happen if, in one of those moments, you didn't try to catalog or analyze the experience, but instead allowed the ache to simply be present without trying to understand it or label it as "sad" or "uncomfortable"?

Patient: If I actually try to let the ache be, there’s an almost immediate somatic upwelling — a tightening, a smallness — and then my mind launches into a taxonomy of causes, as if naming them neutralizes the feeling. I can frame it in neuroscientific terms (habitual prefrontal appraisal, threat-avoidant coping) and that feels safe, but underneath that language I’m just... impatient and a little frightened to let it widen. I want to sit with it, but I end up narrating instead, and that makes me feel stuck and a bit ashamed; I’m not sure how to move from description to experience.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of discomfort that arises when you try to let go of the narrative, and that discomfort is tied to a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty. You're not just describing the experience, but also the emotions that come up, like impatience and shame. Can you think of a time when you felt like you were stuck in this way, and you ended up doing something that felt like a way to avoid the discomfort, but ultimately wasn't very fulfilling or meaningful?

Patient: Yeah — last year when the directionlessness peaked I doubled down on the business: pushed a risky acquisition and a full rebrand, framed it as a “strategic solution” to the malaise. It filled the calendar and gave a veneer of purpose, but mostly it was avoidance — 80‑hour weeks, fewer dinners with my partner, and that hollow under my ribs that the new KPIs couldn’t touch. I even signed up for a painting class and immediately turned it into an exercise in aesthetic theory instead of getting messy, which feels embarrassing and tired to admit. So I ended up more exhausted and isolated, and honestly frustrated with myself for falling into the same pattern.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been using busyness and external accomplishments as a way to temporarily distract yourself from the discomfort of uncertainty and directionlessness. And when you tried to try something new, like painting, you fell into the same pattern of analysis instead of allowing yourself to experience it. It's like you're stuck in a loop of trying to control and understand everything, rather than just being with what's present. Would you be willing to try a small experiment, right here and now, to see what would happen if you simply allowed the physical sensation under your ribs to be, without trying to label it, analyze it, or do anything with it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. Right now there's a low, persistent tightness under my ribs and my breath is a little shallow; my immediate impulse is to name it — anxiety, exhaustion, existential drift — as if labels will shrink it. If I take three slow breaths and try to just sit with the physical sensation, it eases a hair but then my mind immediately starts mapping causes and coping strategies, which feels like a protective reflex and also like cowardice. I'm managing maybe ten seconds of genuine holding before the narrative returns; I'm impatient and a bit frightened to let it widen, and I don't know how to stay with it without making it a thesis.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a bit of a reflexive pattern emerging here, where you're trying to anticipate and prepare for the discomfort, rather than simply experiencing it. Can you notice what's happening just before you start labeling the sensation? Is there a particular thought or feeling that comes up, that makes you feel like you need to know what's causing it or how to fix it?

Patient: Just before I start labeling, there's a quick physiological jolt — a shallowness in my breath and a tightness at the back of my throat — and then this epistemic anxiety kicks in: "I need to know, categorize, and fix this now." It feels like a protective script, born of fear of incompetence or irrelevance, so naming becomes a containment strategy instead of actually feeling anything. I'm embarrassed by that reflex and a little desperate for a reliable handle, honestly. What would you want me to pay attention to next if we tried staying with that sensation a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the role of this epistemic anxiety in triggering your attempt to label and analyze the sensation. Would you be willing to try to sit with that anxiety, rather than trying to push it away or fix it, and instead just observe it as it arises? What if, instead of trying to "contain" the sensation, you allowed the anxiety to simply be present, without judgment or reaction?

Patient: I can try — right now when I let the anxiety be, there's a tight, hollow pressure under my ribs and a heat behind my sternum, and my breath shallowens; as soon as I notice that, my mind catalogs causes (midlife role-identity, entrepreneurial narcissism, burnout circuitry) to make it tolerable. If I keep watching, the tightness wants to widen into something more like grief or fear, and that scares me — I leap for an explanation because I’m afraid it’ll spill into meaninglessness or incompetence. I’m not great at staying with it; can you help me stay here for another minute and tell me what to focus on so I don’t immediately narrativize?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to a sense of openness and willingness to explore the sensations. I'd like to gently guide you in observing the sensation without trying to label it or explain it. Can you bring your attention to the physical sensation of your breath? Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, the feeling of the air on your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the breath supposed to help with this hollow tightness? When I try, I notice my breaths are shallow, the tightness under my ribs intensifies, and then my mind immediately mobilizes into a taxonomy of causes so that the breath becomes another piece of data to dissect. If we're actually doing this, tell me precisely what to attend to — nostrils, chest rise, tempo? — because otherwise I'll just intellectualize and derail us.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the sensation. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to label it, and don't try to change it. Just notice the sensation as it is. Pay attention to the physical sensation of the tightness in your chest, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Notice if there's any sensation of pressure, expansion, or contraction. Can you focus on that sensation, without any particular goal or outcome in mind, just the sensation itself?

Patient: Okay — when I try to do that I notice my breaths are shallow, a coolness at the nostrils, a subtle lift in the upper chest but almost no movement in the belly, and this dull, pressurized hollow under my ribs that feels both constricted and a little empty. Almost immediately my mind launches into causal narratives and epistemic drift — timelines, role-identity explanations — which yanks me out of the sensation. I can attempt to stay with the raw qualities for maybe thirty seconds, but I’ll probably need a brief prompt or reminder when I start analyzing; could you give me a short cue to bring me back if I go off into theory?

Therapist: I'll give you a gentle reminder: "The sensation, not the story." When you start to drift into narratives, I'll say this softly, and you can bring your attention back to the sensation. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready to try again. Use "The sensation, not the story" if I drift; I’ll probably need one or two gentle reminders because my reflex is to leap into causes and theory. Go ahead when you’re ready.

Therapist: I'll wait until you're ready to start. Take a deep breath in, and when you're comfortable, let's begin. Just notice the sensation in your body, without trying to label it or analyze it. I'll wait...

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing in now. I notice cool air at the nostrils, a slight lift in my upper chest and almost no belly movement, and that dull, pressurized hollow under my ribs like a muted alarm. As I try to hold it, my mind immediately composes causal narratives — midlife role dissolution, entrepreneurial identity fatigue — which yanks me out; I'm impatient and a little frightened it will widen, so please use "The sensation, not the story" if I start explaining.

Therapist: "The sensation, not the story."

Patient: Saying "The sensation, not the story" actually tugs me out of the analytic spin and I can feel that hollow under my ribs again — a tightness, a small catch in my throat, breath staying high. But even noticing that, my mind immediately turns the cue into another concept — a behavioral anchor, a stimulus-response experiment — which is exactly the reflex I'm trying to interrupt, and it's kind of infuriating and a little shameful. If you could repeat the cue gently whenever I slip, I think I can stretch the time I actually stay with the feeling from twenty seconds toward a minute; maybe also prompt me to name one physical quality per inhale so I have something concrete to attend to. I'm willing to try, but I'm wary I’ll just make the exercise another intellectual project unless you keep nudging me back.

Therapist: I'll repeat the cue whenever you drift, and I'll also guide you in focusing on specific physical qualities with each inhale. Here we go: "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your breath moving in. Can you describe the sensation of your nostrils opening, the sensation of the air entering your body?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the nostrils supposed to help with that hollow under my ribs? When I breathe in I notice a cool, slightly tingling sensation at the nostrils, a minimal flare as the air passes, and the movement barely reaches my belly — upper‑chest dominant and shallow — but even saying that my mind immediately translates it into a diagnosis (thoracic breathing, sympathetic arousal) instead of actually feeling it. So I can describe the mechanics, but I'm confused about how this anchors the underlying tightness without my turning it into yet another analytic exercise.

Therapist: You're right, the focus on the nostrils might not be directly related to the sensation under your ribs. Let's try a different approach. As you inhale, I'd like you to notice the sensation of your chest rising. Can you describe the sensation of your chest moving upward, the sensation of your ribs expanding, and the feeling of the air filling your lungs? And then, as you exhale, notice the sensation of your chest falling, the sensation of your ribs collapsing, and the feeling of the air leaving your lungs. When I say "The sensation, not the story," I'll wait for you to notice that the sensation is present, rather than analyzing or labeling it.

Patient: Okay — as I inhale my chest lifts, the ribs expand outward a little, mostly upper‑thoracic movement; on the exhale the chest falls and there's a small deflation, while that hollow under my ribs remains. Right when I try to sit with that, a hot spike of shame and frustration floods in — I can't quite place it, but it’s a sharp, self‑critical ache that immediately makes me want to explain or justify, which is infuriating. I can try to stay with the sensations if you keep using the cue and prompt me to name one simple physical quality each breath — otherwise I'll almost certainly drift back into theorizing.

Therapist: "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your lower back expanding outward. Can you describe the sensation of it expanding?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on my lower back supposed to help with that hollow under my ribs? When I inhale I can notice a subtle outward rounding at the lumbar area, a mild pressure against my lower spine and a faint warmth, but almost immediately my mind reinterprets it as a posture or diaphragmatic-breathing problem instead of actually feeling it. Right as I try to stay with that sensation a hot spike of shame and frustration washes over me — makes me want to justify or explain — and that derails me. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can you repeat the cue and prompt me to name just one simple physical quality each breath so I don't slip back into theory?

Therapist: I'll keep the cue simple. "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your stomach. Can you describe it?

Patient: When I inhale my stomach barely rises — a faint outward rounding with a thin, tight band across the lower belly and an almost empty, hollow quality beneath it. Almost immediately my reflexive mind frames it as diaphragmatic underuse or chronic thoracic-breathing, and a hot flush of shame and frustration wells up — I get self-critical and start explaining instead of feeling. I'm a bit overwhelmed by how quickly I revert to analysis; please use "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality per breath so I can try to stay with it.

Therapist: "The sensation, not the story." As you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you describe the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my feet supposed to help with the hollow under my ribs? When I do it: there's a firm, almost dull pressure under the heels and the balls of my feet, a coolness along the soles, and a subtle spread of weight toward the outer edges; a faint tingling runs up the arches. Immediately my mind labels it as a grounding anchor or somatic-regulation trick (epistemic distancing again), and a hot spike of shame and frustration flares because I turn it into another theory instead of actually feeling it. Can you repeat "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality per breath so I don't drift?

Therapist: It seems like your mind is trying to make sense of every physical sensation as a way to feel more grounded or in control. I'll try a different approach. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath itself. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in. Can you describe the sensation of the air entering your nostrils?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the nostrils supposed to help the hollow under my ribs? When I do it I notice a cool, slightly tingling breeze at the nostrils, a faint prickling, and the inhale feels thin and shallow. Almost immediately my mind turns that into a breathing-dysfunction diagnosis and a plan, which sparks a hot, shamey frustration — I get annoyed at myself for narrating instead of feeling. Can you say "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality per breath so I don't drift?

Therapist: It seems like you're getting stuck in a cycle of diagnosis and self-criticism. Let's try a different approach. I'll give you a gentle reminder: "The sensation, not the story." As you exhale, notice the sensation of your shoulders. Can you describe how they feel?

Patient: As I exhale my shoulders drop a little, then that familiar brace comes back — a heavy, gritty tightness across the tops of my shoulders and a knot in the upper traps, like I'm lugging invisible weight. The loosening is fleeting and my mind immediately slaps a label on it — "holding responsibility" or "protective armor" — which makes me feel annoyed and a bit ashamed for turning it into theory. Could you give the cue and ask me to name one simple quality on the next exhale so I don't drift?

Therapist: "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your diaphragm. Can you describe how it feels?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the diaphragm supposed to help with that hollow under my ribs? As I inhale there’s a faint downward tug, a brief pressure pushing into the upper belly that barely completes before the inhale stops, so it feels inhibited and oddly mechanical; my mind immediately calls it "diaphragmatic underuse" and I get a hot spike of shame and frustration for turning it into a diagnosis instead of feeling it. I can try to stay with it if you keep saying "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality each breath.

Therapist: I think we're getting somewhere. Let's try to stay with the physical sensations directly. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body. Can you describe the sensation of the air as it fills your lungs? Just notice what's happening, without trying to analyze or label it.

Patient: I notice a cool flutter at the nostrils, a thin ribbon of air, an upper‑chest expansion with barely any diaphragmatic descent — the inhale feels truncated, like inflation that's been curtailed. Of course my mind immediately labels it as chronic sympathetic arousal and a habitual thoracic pattern, which drags me into explanation and then a quick flush of shame for not just feeling it. If you say "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality each inhale, I think I can lengthen the time I actually stay with it.

Therapist: Let's try again. "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your mouth. Can you describe what's happening in your mouth, without trying to analyze it?

Patient: When I inhale there's a coolness at the back of my throat, my lips part just a little, the tongue sits lightly against the roof, and there's a faint dryness or metallic tang—nothing dramatic, just muted. Of course my brain immediately frames it as conditioned oral tension or sympathetic arousal, which makes me feel annoyed and a bit ashamed for turning it into another theory; could you say "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality on the next inhale so I don't drift?

Therapist: "The sensation, not the story." As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Can you describe the sensation of the breath moving out?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the exhale supposed to help with that hollow under my ribs? When I breathe out I feel warm air at the nostrils, a slight collapse across the upper chest and a fleeting loosening in my shoulders, but the hollow under my ribs remains like a partly emptied balloon; the release feels arrested, as if something prevents it from fully letting go. Of course my reflex is to morph that into a diagnostic narrative (autonomic dysregulation, chronic bracing), which immediately sparks a hot, shamey frustration—so please say "The sensation, not the story" and prompt me to name one simple quality on each exhale so I don't drift into theory.

Therapist: I think we're getting close to breaking through. "The sensation, not the story." As you inhale, notice the sensation of your hands. Can you describe how they feel, where they are, and what they're doing, without trying to analyze or label it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my hands supposed to help with that hollow under my ribs? My hands are resting on my thighs: palms warm, a slight pressure where they meet fabric, fingers a bit splayed and tense at the knuckles, a faint tremor under the skin and a coolness at the fingertips. Saying that brings a hot flush of shame and frustration—I'm already tempted to turn it into a metaphor about control and grounding instead of just feeling the simple qualities.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that your mind is still trying to use your physical sensations as a way to feel more grounded or in control. Let's try to separate the sensation from the need for control. "The sensation, not the story." As you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you simply acknowledge the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without trying to analyze or label it?

Patient: I'm noticing my feet — a firm pressure under the heels and balls, a coolness along the soles, a subtle spreading as the weight settles. There's a faint tremor and a small sense of being anchored, which is oddly calming, and then my mind immediately wants to turn that into a metaphor about "grounding" and whether it's real. I feel a flush of shame for needing to interpret; could you say "The sensation, not the story" and nudge me to stay with the pressure for a few more breaths?
