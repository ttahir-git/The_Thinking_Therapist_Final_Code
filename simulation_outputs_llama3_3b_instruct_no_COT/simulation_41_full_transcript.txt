--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in a loop of harsh self-criticism whenever I perceive myself as failing, and I keep tracing it back to bullying in school that seems to have encoded a persistent internal narrative. On the surface I'm outgoing and adaptable, but I default to intellectualizing—deploying theories and analyses—to keep a safe distance from the shame and social anxiety that undermine my confidence, especially after recent job instability. I'm here trying to parse why I keep reenacting these patterns in both social and career contexts instead of actually processing the hurt and insecurity underneath.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself intellectualizing or using those theories to avoid feeling the emotions that come up after a perceived failure or when you're struggling in a situation? What's the immediate sensation or feeling that arises in your body or mind when you feel like you're not meeting your own expectations?

Patient: When I catch myself intellectualizing, it’s like a running commentary—an arsenal of hypotheses and meta-narratives that reframes the moment into something analyzable so I don't have to sit in it. In my body I notice a tightness in my chest, my jaw clenches, and there's a prickly adrenaline that narrows my focus into rehearsing explanations or counterarguments instead of feeling whatever vulnerability is there. I almost immediately start labeling the process—protective cognitive strategy, dissociative distancing—because saying "I'm scared" or "I feel small" feels dangerously exposed.

Therapist Answer:
Those mental and physical sensations of discomfort, like the tightness in your chest and the adrenaline rush, make sense. It's like your mind is using intellectualization as a way to buffer against feeling those uncomfortable emotions. And it's interesting that you mention labeling the process as "protective cognitive strategy" and "dissociative distancing." Can you explore what might happen if you were to momentarily let go of that label and simply acknowledge the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or explain them?

Patient: If I actually let go of the label I think I'd notice a tightness in my chest, a hollow sort of weight in my stomach, and my breath getting shallow and a little fast—maybe a buzzing behind my eyes. But my reflex is to immediately translate those sensations into jargon—'autonomic arousal,' 'interoceptive avoidance'—because turning it into a theory creates a protective distance. There's a real worry that if I sit with it un-narrated it'll swell into shame or panic, so I preemptively analyze to feel like I'm managing it. I can try right now to just notice the breath and the chest tightness without putting words on it, though I expect I'll start narrating it again within seconds.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is accustomed to using analysis as a way to maintain a sense of control over those uncomfortable emotions. And it's understandable that you'd worry about getting overwhelmed by shame or panic if you don't have a framework to understand and manage it. Can you bring your attention back to the sensations in your body right now, without labeling them or trying to make sense of them? Simply observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and notice the tightness in your chest. What happens when you try to focus just on that physical sensation, without trying to interpret it?

Patient: If I actually try to focus, for a few seconds the breath gets shallow, there's a tight band across my chest and a hollow weight low in my stomach, with a faint buzzing behind my eyes. Almost immediately the reflex commentary kicks in—I start labeling it "autonomic arousal," mapping it to past bullying and failure narratives—because that's my way of making it manageable. If I push to stay with the sensation, I feel small and on the verge of tears and a faint panic at the edges, so I usually switch to analysis to avoid that. I can try to sit with it longer now if you want, but I'm warning you I'll probably narrate the whole time—how would you like me to proceed?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is trying to tell you something, but your mind is jumping in with a pre-prepared response. I'd like you to try to stay with the sensation for just a little longer, even if you do end up labeling it. I'm not looking for you to stop narrating entirely, but rather to notice what happens just before you start labeling. Can you try to catch the exact moment when you're about to say to yourself "Oh, this is autonomic arousal" or "This reminds me of past bullying"? What happens right before that thought arises?

Patient: Right before the label there’s this tiny void—a quick inhale that doesn’t quite fill, a hollow drop in my stomach, and this flash of shame like a kid getting called out. It’s so brief but sharp, and then my brain scrambles and tosses up a label because putting a word on it somehow makes it less dangerous. Saying that already feels like my default move, but the raw part is that hollow, the brief wanting-to-hide.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's as if that brief moment of vulnerability, the "hollow drop in your stomach," is trying to surface and get your attention, but your mind is pulling away from it. The flash of shame is particularly striking, isn't it? It's like your body is saying, "Hey, I'm feeling exposed and vulnerable right now." Can you try to acknowledge that feeling, even though you say you're used to labeling it, without immediately trying to push it away or fit it into a narrative?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Right now there's a hollow drop in my stomach, a tight band across my chest, my breath feels shallow, and I feel small and exposed like I want to disappear. I can feel my brain gearing up to name it and explain it, but the raw feeling underneath is that shame and a frantic wanting-to-hide.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're hovering just above that feeling, not quite ready to acknowledge it, but still feeling its presence. Your brain is still poised to intervene with a label, but the sensation of shame and the desire to hide are still there, waiting to be acknowledged. Can you try to allow those feelings to be present, without trying to push them away or fit them into a narrative? Just permit them to be, without judgment or analysis, for just this one breath?

Patient: Okay — I tried to take that breath and actually let the feeling be. The inhale made the hollow in my stomach sharper, a heat behind my eyes and a lump in my throat, like the urge to crawl into a void; my chest eased a hair but the shame felt louder. Already my mind is drafting an explanation—schema activation, internalized critic, defensive intellectualization—but I'm trying not to follow it. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down? I don't want to shut down, I just need some guidance staying with it.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to hold onto the feeling, even as your mind is already preparing to push it away. That takes a lot of courage. I'm not looking to speed up the process, but rather to support you in staying with it. Let's try a small adjustment. Instead of focusing on the sensation, I'd like you to notice the sensation of your body relaxing, even just slightly, as you're allowing the feeling to be present. Can you notice any areas of your body that might be releasing a bit, or feeling more open?

Patient: I can feel my shoulders drop a hair and a faint looseness low in my belly, like a tiny unclenching, but my chest is still tight and my jaw's locked. My reflex is to translate that into jargon—'somatic unloading' or 'cortical downregulation'—but underneath the analysis there's this embarrassed, exposed ache, like being caught again. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we keep this slow and you give me small prompts so I don't immediately retreat into explanation?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to recognize a small shift in your body, but your mind is still caught up in analysis. That's completely understandable. Let's keep it very small. I'd like you to notice just the sensation of your jaw relaxing, without thinking about it. Can you focus on the feeling of your jaw dropping, just slightly, and let go of any thought about what that means? Just be with that physical sensation, without interpretation?

Patient: Okay — when I focus the jaw does drop a hair, there’s a tiny unclench under my ears and my mouth feels less tight. Almost immediately my brain wants to name it—'facial muscular release,' link it to my fight/flight schema—and that explanatory urge is louder than the sensation. Underneath that, though, there's a prickly vulnerability, like if I let it go more I might actually cry, so can we keep this really slow and you give me another small prompt?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is trying to explain the physical sensation, but you're also feeling a bit apprehensive about exploring the vulnerability that's underneath. Let's take another tiny step. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without thinking about it. Just observe the sensation of the breath, the rise and fall, the way it feels to breathe. No thoughts, no analysis, just the breath. Can you be with that sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I took that breath. It felt a little deeper, the hollow in my stomach softened a notch and my shoulders dropped again, but my chest stayed a bit tight. Of course my brain immediately labels it—'vagal tone increase,' 'brief parasympathetic shift'—because naming it makes it less raw, but underneath that there's a small embarrassed, scared kid feeling like they might be seen. Can we keep going slowly? Another tiny prompt would help so I don't default into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're taking small steps to allow yourself to be with the sensation, but your brain is still trying to interpret it. Let's keep going at a very slow pace. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just notice that sensation, without thinking about it. Don't try to analyze it, just be with it. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet, for just one more moment?

Patient: Okay — I put my attention on my feet and felt a steady pressure under my heels and a faint warmth spreading to my toes, like a small, stabilizing anchor. Almost instantly a wash of shame and irritation rises — a hot, tight feeling — and my brain wants to reframe it as "proprioceptive grounding" or "somatic feedback" so it feels manageable. I'm trying to stay with the sensation but it's getting loud and pinch-y; can we keep this really slow and you give me one more tiny prompt so I don't drift into explaining it away?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is trying to ground you in the physical sensations, but that's also creating a new layer of interpretation. Let's try to stay with the sensation, without trying to make sense of it. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your nostrils. Specifically, I want you to notice the sensation of the breath when you inhale, just before your nostrils open. Can you pay attention to that sensation, without thinking about it?

Patient: Okay — on that inhale there's a faint coolness at the tip of my nostrils, then a quick little catch, and almost instantly that hot stab of old shame and frustration floods in and tightens my chest. My brain already wants to label it "anticipatory arousal" to make it tolerable, but my energy is thin and it's getting harder to keep narrating. Could you give me one more very small prompt so I don't slip into explaining it away?

It's like your brain is trying to make sense of the sensation, but it's also getting more and more turbulent. Let's try to stay with the sensation, without trying to label it. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your lips. Can you simply observe the sensation of your lips, without thinking about it? Just notice the shape, the feeling, the sensation of them being present. No thoughts, no analysis, just the sensation of your lips.

Patient: They feel a little dry and cool at the edges, a faint tremble when I inhale, and my mouth wants to clamp shut—then that hot sting of shame and irritation flickers under it. My attention keeps jumping away and the reflex to name or explain it is loud, even though I'm trying not to. Could you give me one more very small prompt so I don't drift into analysis?

Can you notice the sensation of your skin meeting the fabric or the floor, without thinking about it? Just the feeling of contact, without analysis.

Patient: There's a steady, muted pressure where my back and thighs meet the chair and the fabric feels cool against my skin, but my attention keeps skittering away—this hot sting of shame and irritation flickers up and I feel jumpy and kind of on edge. My energy's thin so it's harder to hold focus; could you give me one very small prompt to anchor me—maybe stay with the contact for just one more slow breath?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to anchor yourself in that physical sensation. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and try to keep your attention on that for just one more slow breath. As you inhale, notice the sensation of your feet connecting with the ground, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet releasing, without thinking about it. Just stay with the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground, and try to let go of the rest.

Patient: Okay — on the inhale I feel a definite pressure under my heels, like a tiny anchor, and on the exhale it loosens a bit and my toes spread. But that hot stab of shame and irritation keeps popping in and my attention skitters—I'm jittery and a bit foggy and my brain is already wanting to label it as "proprioceptive grounding" so it's tolerable. Could we do one more very small prompt—maybe guide me through one slow counted breath so I have something to hang on to?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to slow down even further. I'd like you to breathe in for a count of 4, focusing only on the sensation of the breath moving in... 1... 2... 3... 4. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your breath moving out, and then pause for a moment before taking your next breath. Focus only on the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. Can you just be with the breath for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I did that 4-count. The inhale felt a bit fuller, my shoulders eased, but that hot stab of shame still surged and my attention kept darting away; my brain's already primed to translate it into 'parasympathetic shift' so it's less raw. My energy's thin and I'm jittery—could you guide me through one more very slow counted breath, maybe a 4 in and a 6 out, so I have something concrete to hold onto?

Let's try a slightly longer exhale to give you something to focus on. I'd like you to breathe in for a count of 4, and then exhale for a count of 6.

As you exhale, notice the sensation of your breath moving out. Focus on the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. Can you stay with it?

Patient: I did the 4 in/6 out — the inhale filled more, the exhale eased my shoulders, but then that hot sting of shame surged and a flash of that old "I didn't measure up" feeling lit up and my attention scattered. My chest's still tight, my jaw's clamped, and my energy feels thin, so I'm jittery and keeps wanting to narrate it away. Could you count with me for one more really slow breath — 4 in, 6 out — so I have something concrete to hang on to?

As we exhale, notice the sensation of your body releasing, without thinking about it. Focus on the sensation of the breath, and try to let go of any thoughts or narratives. Can you stay with it, even for just one more moment?

Patient: I did that — the exhale loosened my shoulders and my feet felt a bit more anchored, but then that hot, “I didn't measure up” shame flared and my attention scattered; I'm jittery and a bit foggy and my brain's already drafting an explanation like 'parasympathetic shift' to make it tolerable.
