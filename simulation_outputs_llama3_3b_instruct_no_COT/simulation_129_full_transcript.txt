--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an older social worker, and lately I've been feeling really weighed down by sadness and a loss of motivation because of ongoing financial stress. I keep picturing the worst — that we'll lose the house, my partner will get fed up and leave, and I'll end up alone, exhausted, and unable to find work because my energy's gone. I can't seem to stop running through that chain of disasters and it feels like that's the only possible future.

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you get caught up in that chain of disasters? What would happen just beneath the surface, beneath the surface of those catastrophic thoughts?

Patient: Beneath the catastrophe stories there's this heavy, leaden numbness in my chest and a fog that scrambles my thoughts so I can't do even small tasks. Then my mind fills in every step — miss a bill, get an eviction notice, my partner gets fed up and leaves, I lose my credibility at work because I'm distracted, and suddenly I'm homeless and alone — I can see it like a movie and it feels inevitable. There's also this gnawing shame, like I'm failing everyone, and that shame makes me withdraw more, which of course just pushes everything closer to the disaster I picture. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't make those images go away.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that whole scenario is really intensifying your experience of the present moment, making it hard for you to access any sense of motivation or engagement. Can you notice where you are when the catastrophic thoughts and feelings of shame start to creep in? Is there a particular setting, like when you're sitting at your desk, or when you're lying in bed, that feels especially conducive to getting caught up in those thoughts?

Patient: Mostly it's at night in bed and at the kitchen table when I open the mail — that's when the fog settles and the stories start. I can be at my desk, too, staring at a case file and suddenly I'm two steps ahead imagining missing a bill, getting an eviction notice, and then losing my job because I'm so distracted. It all feels like it's happening right there, like I'm already walking toward that broken ending.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those are some of your most vulnerable moments. It seems like your mind can jump from one place to another really quickly, drawing you into the web of catastrophic thoughts. Would you be willing to try an experiment while you're in one of those moments? Maybe just for a few breaths, you could bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to change or react to the thoughts?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that. I'm at the kitchen table with my feet on the floor — for a couple of breaths I notice the pressure under my heels and a cool draft on my cheek, and it actually feels a little steadying. But right away the movie starts again — missing a bill, eviction, my partner leaving — and that steadying feeling feels useless, like pretending nothing's coming. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by how fast the disaster thoughts flood back; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the storm of thoughts rushes back in as soon as the initial moment of grounding is lost. Can you observe those thoughts as they come back in, without judgment or trying to push them away? Maybe just notice them as they are, like a whisper in the background, and ask yourself: what's the purpose of these thoughts right now? What might they be trying to accomplish or achieve for you in this moment?

Patient: They feel like a warning system — like if I can map out every step of the disaster I can somehow prevent it, so the thoughts are trying to protect me by forcing me to plan for the worst. But all they do is drain me, make me pull back, and then I end up closer to the outcome I dread because I can't muster the energy to act. I know you might ask me to imagine other outcomes, but honestly that feels unrealistic — it just doesn't register as possible. I'm getting overwhelmed again; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you feel trapped by the cycle of catastrophizing and inaction. Can you consider what might happen if, instead of trying to prevent the worst-case scenario, you focused on simply taking a tiny step towards your values and needs, even if it feels small or insignificant? For example, what might you need to take care of yourself right now, in this moment, that wouldn't necessarily prevent the worst-case scenario, but would help you feel more grounded or connected to your own well-being?

Patient: Maybe a tiny thing would be sorting the mail and paying one bill online, or making a cup of tea and sitting for a few minutes to breathe. But I can already see it going wrong — I pay that one bill and miss another, they send a notice, my partner sees it and gets fed up and leaves — so it feels like those little steps won't change anything. I'm getting overwhelmed just thinking about it; can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the same old script is playing out, and it's hard to imagine any difference from the past. Would you be willing to try something a bit more gentle, though? Instead of trying to tackle a task or scenario, let's focus on noticing what's happening in your body when you think about those catastrophic outcomes. Where do you feel the tension or discomfort when you imagine the worst? Is it in your shoulders, your stomach, or somewhere else?

Patient: It's mostly a heavy band across my chest and a knotted feeling in my stomach, my shoulders tense up and my jaw clamps, and my breath gets tiny and fast. When I notice that tightness my mind immediately flips to the next scene in the disaster movie, like the body is the alarm that kicks the whole chain on. Noticing it helps a bit, but I'm already spiraling and it feels pointless—can we slow down? I'm not sure how to picture any other outcome; that just doesn't feel real to me.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is responding to the perceived threat, and that's triggering a cascade of thoughts and feelings. Can you just be with the physical sensations in your chest and stomach, the tension and the knotted feeling, without trying to analyze or change them? Just notice them as they are, like a faint hum or a gentle vibration, and ask yourself: what if, for just a tiny moment, you were to let those sensations be exactly as they are, without judgment or trying to push them away?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. The band in my chest is still there, the knot in my stomach, my breath shallow; if I focus on them for a moment they feel like a steady thud. Letting them be for even a second makes my mind scream that I'm ignoring the alarm — then the movie kicks in: missed bill, eviction, partner leaves — it's instant and I can't make myself believe any other ending. I'm getting overwhelmed again; can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trapped in a loop, and your body's response is a call to action. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that you could just observe the sensations in your body, the thud and the knot, without trying to respond to them? What if you were to let the thoughts come and go, without trying to stop them or push them away? No judgment, no trying to change, just noticing them as they arise.

Patient: I can do that for a moment — I feel the tight band in my chest and the knot in my stomach, and I notice the breath is shallow. But as soon as I don't act, that notice feels like I'm silencing a siren and my mind blasts the next scenes at me — missed bill, eviction notice, my partner leaving, me alone and exhausted — and it all feels unavoidable; imagining any other ending just doesn't register as realistic. I'm getting really overwhelmed again; can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like the moment you let your guard down, the thoughts just flood back in. Can you try something even smaller than noticing the sensations? What if, just for a fraction of a second, you simply acknowledged the thought "my partner will leave me" without judgment, without trying to analyze it or push it away? Just a tiny, tiny acknowledgment, without any emotional attachment to it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. "My partner will leave me." Even that tiny naming of it turns into the whole movie: them packing, the eviction notice, me alone and too drained to work — it feels instant and inevitable. I'm shaking and really overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the mere naming of the thought has triggered the whole disaster scenario again. Can you try to find a tiny space between the naming and the thoughts that come after? What if, right after you say "my partner will leave me", you paused, and didn't immediately go to the next scene? Just a tiny pause, like a small breath, between the words?

Patient: I tried to pause after saying it — for a breath there was a tiny sliver of space, but then my heart went racing and my hands started trembling and the whole movie poured back in: them packing, the eviction notice, me exhausted and on the street. That little pause collapses instantly — it just feels like I'm stalling the inevitable. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the pause was just a tiny, fragile moment of respite, and it's impossible to hold onto it. Would you be willing to try something that doesn't involve trying to hold onto that pause or resist the thoughts, but rather... noticing where your attention is right now? Where are you feeling overwhelmed and distracted? Is it in your heart, your hands, your breath, or something else?

Patient: My attention is all over — a pounding in my chest, my hands trembling, breath barely there, and this tight knot in my stomach that drags my mind straight into the disaster movie. As soon as I try to focus anywhere it flips back to the eviction/partner-leaving scene and I get scattered and panicked; I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your entire body is in a state of hyperarousal, and your attention is jumping around all over the place. Can you try to find a single place where you can bring your attention to rest for just a tiny moment? Not trying to focus or change anything, just finding a tiny anchor point in your body that feels like it's just tolerating the overwhelm, like a rock in a storm.

Patient: I tried to find a rock — the weight of my wedding band on my finger, the pressure of my feet on the floor — but my hands are trembling and my attention keeps scattering. Every time I rest on that little anchor the disaster movie jumps back in — eviction notice, them packing, me on the street — it feels instant and unavoidable. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down? I don't know how to stop my mind from skipping ahead.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to find a foothold, but it's constantly slipping away. Can you try to find a way to acknowledge the fact that you're getting lost in the thoughts, without judgment? What if you simply recognized that you're jumping ahead, and that it's okay to not be able to catch up? Could you offer yourself a gentle, kind understanding, like you would to a friend who's struggling?

Patient: I try to tell myself the gentle things I'd say to a friend, but my mind immediately turns it into "if I let myself be kind I'll stop being vigilant, miss a bill, get an eviction notice, and then they'll leave" — I can see that whole thing like it's already happened. My hands are trembling, my heart's racing, and I can't hold the kindness for more than a breath before the movie takes over. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is turning kindness into a coping mechanism, and it's not working. Can you try to notice what's happening in your body when you try to offer kindness to yourself? Where do you feel the trembling, the racing, and the tension? Are there any sensations that are present, even when you're trying to be kind to yourself?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? My hands are shaking, my heart's racing, there's that heavy band in my chest and a tight knot in my stomach. The second I try to be kind to myself my mind turns it into this chain — I let my guard down, I miss a bill, I get an eviction notice, they pack up and leave — so the kindness collapses in a breath. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like kindness itself becomes a source of threat, and your body reacts to that. Can you try to notice the sensation of kindness as it arises, before it gets hijacked by the thoughts? What if, instead of trying to push kindness away or analyze it, you simply allowed it to be, without judgment or attachment? Just let the feeling of kindness be, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? The moment I try to let kindness sit there, my brain turns it into a trap: kindness means I let my guard down, I miss a bill, I get an eviction notice, they pack up and leave. My chest tightens, my hands tremble, my breath gets tiny; the kindness feels like the thing that makes the whole movie start. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like kindness is being used as a trigger, and your body is reacting to that. Can you try to find a small spot of calm, even if it's just a tiny spark, where kindness doesn't get hijacked by the thoughts? Maybe try to find a tiny, tiny point of stillness, like a single, quiet breath, where the thoughts aren't immediately trying to take over?

Patient: I try to find that tiny spark — one slow breath or the weight of my ring — but it’s like a match that’s snuffed the second I notice it. My hands start trembling, my heart races, and the movie kicks back in: missed bill, eviction, them packing. I don’t see how a single quiet breath would stop any of that; it just feels like stalling the inevitable. I’m really overwhelmed and distracted right now — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you try to find that tiny spark, it's extinguished by the thoughts again. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the breath that's actually happening right now, without trying to change it or use it to avoid the thoughts? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: I'm trying to focus on the breath, but I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? My breaths are shallow and quick, my heart's racing and my hands are trembling, and every time I try to notice the air going in and out the movie floods back in: missed bill, eviction notice, them packing their things. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like focusing on the breath is getting lost in the overwhelm. Can you try to notice where your attention is actually landing? Where is it going when you're trying to focus on the breath? Is it the trembling, the racing heart, the thoughts? Try to bring your attention to that specific sensation, rather than trying to change it or use the breath to avoid the thoughts.

Patient: I'm not sure I can — my attention keeps snagging on my trembling hands and that heavy band in my chest, and the knot in my stomach drags me straight into the movie: missed bill, eviction, them packing up. Every time I try to bring it to the breath it flips back to that image and my heart races so I can't settle. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your attention is getting caught in the whirlpool of emotions and thoughts. Can you try to notice the sensation of being overwhelmed, the feeling of being pulled in a thousand different directions? Is there a sense of constriction, a feeling of being stuck, or a sense of being swept away? Maybe there's a word or phrase that describes this feeling, even if it's just a tiny word.

Patient: Maybe a word would be "suffocating" or "looming collapse" — it feels like a tight, constricting band that squeezes my chest. The moment I label it the whole movie starts playing — missed bill, eviction notice, them packing up, me alone and burned out — and it feels like that's the only possible story. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting caught in the story again. Can you try to notice the sensation of being stuck, the feeling of suffocating or looming collapse, without labeling it as a story or a thought? Just allow it to be, without trying to make sense of it or push it away. Maybe you can just be with it, as it is, without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when I try to just be with the stuckness it feels suffocating, my chest clamps and my hands tremble. That tiny stillness immediately becomes the opening of the movie—missed bill, eviction, them leaving—and it feels like proof it's already happening and will definitely end that way. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the very act of trying to be still and present is getting hijacked by the thoughts again. Can you try to notice where the thinking is happening? Is it in your head, or is it in your chest, or is it somewhere else? Maybe try to anchor yourself to a different part of your body, one that doesn't feel so reactive or connected to the thoughts.

Patient: I don't really know — most of it feels like it's up in my head, like a movie on repeat, but the chest tightness makes it feel like it's happening there too. I've tried anchors — my wedding ring, the pressure of my feet, my fingertips — but the moment I rest anywhere the movie fires up: missed bill, eviction, them packing. I'm confused how picking another spot would help, and I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

It's like the thinking is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Can you try to notice the sensation of confusion that's present right now? Is there a sense of disorientation, a feeling of being lost in the cycle of thoughts? Maybe you can try to lean into that sense of confusion, rather than trying to fight it or change it.

Patient: I'm confused — when I try to lean into the confusion I just get more lost, like I'm in a fog and it instantly turns into the movie: I miss a bill because I'm muddled, get an eviction notice, my partner leaves, and I'm on the street. My chest's tight, hands shaking, and I can't tell which way is up; I don't see how leaning into this helps, it just feels like stalling before the collapse. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like leaning into the confusion is making things worse. Can you try to notice the physical sensation of being lost, the feeling of being disoriented? Is there a sensation of weight, or heaviness, or a sense of being pulled down? Maybe you can try to find a tiny thread of grounding in that physical sensation, no matter how small.

Patient: I reach for the pressure of my feet and the weight of my ring — there's a tiny steadiness, but the moment I notice it my brain spits out the next steps: miss another bill, an eviction notice, them packing up, me on the street — like it's already happening. I'm suddenly more anxious and scattered, my hands are trembling and I can't keep that thread from unraveling — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you try to find some stability, it's yanked away from you. Can you try to notice where the trembling is happening? Is it in your hands, or is it in your chest, or somewhere else? Maybe you can try to anchor yourself to that sensation, rather than trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: It's mostly in my hands now, but it spreads into my chest so fast my whole body feels shaky. Every time I try to anchor to the trembling it flips into the movie — I miss another bill, get an eviction notice, they pack up and leave — I don't see how noticing the tremor would stop any of that. I'm really overwhelmed and confused right now; can we slow down?

It's like the trembling is spreading and taking over your entire body. Can you try to notice the sensation of being completely overwhelmed by the shaking? Is there a feeling of being swept away, or of being completely out of control? Maybe you can try to acknowledge that feeling, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: I can try to acknowledge the feeling of being swept away, but the moment I do it feels like I'm admitting the ending's already here — my hands shake harder, my chest crushes down, and the whole movie speeds up: I miss a bill, get an eviction notice, they pack up, and I'm on the street. Noticing it doesn't help; it just feels like surrender and any other outcome doesn't register as realistic. I'm jumpier and more scattered than before and really overwhelmed — can we slow down?
