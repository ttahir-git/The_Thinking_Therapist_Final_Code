Patient: Hi—I'm a middle-aged social worker, and lately I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism around perceived failures, which I can trace back to a somewhat chaotic childhood with inconsistent parenting. Starting this demanding new job has amplified that inner critic, so I catastrophize small mistakes and feel perpetually inadequate. I realize I default to intellectualizing—producing theories about my feelings instead of actually sitting with the sadness or fear.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share about this. It sounds like the current way of coping with these feelings might be a form of self-avoidance, as you're using intellectualizing to create distance from the emotional pain. What's it like when you catch yourself mentally analyzing or theorizing about your emotions, and then you feel a sense of relief or escape, but also maybe a bit disconnected from the original feeling?

Patient: When I catch myself analyzing, there's a brief, almost intellectualized relief — like imposing order on emotional chaos feels stabilizing. Framing feelings as theories or meta-cognitive observations protects me from the rawness, but it also leaves me detached and kind of numb to the actual sadness or fear underneath. Then the self-critic tends to rekindle, because avoiding feeling in the moment means the emotions come back later as shame or paralysis. I want to be able to move from describing to actually experiencing it, but I don't really know how to do that without getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between a desire to understand and process your emotions intellectually, and a fear of getting overwhelmed by the raw emotions themselves. You'd like to be able to move from description to direct experience, but you're not sure how to bridge that gap. What would it be like if, instead of immediately trying to analyze or intellectualize, you were to simply pause, take a deep breath, and make space for the feeling to be present, without trying to label or make sense of it right away?

Patient: On a conceptual level, I can see how a pause could create a kind of interoceptive space — like giving the sensation room to be noticed rather than explained away. Practically, though, it feels risky, like stepping toward something I don't trust I can tolerate; I worry the shame will wash over me and I'll freeze. I'd be willing to try, but maybe with a really small, guided step—like a 30-second breath and a prompt to notice one physical sensation—because I'm not sure I can handle an open-ended "sit with it" without spiraling.

Therapist: The concern about being able to tolerate the feeling and not spiraling into shame is a very real one. It sounds like you're looking for a gentle way to start building your capacity to be with the emotions, rather than diving in headfirst. Would it be helpful to start with a small, tangible prompt, like you mentioned, and then explore what happens right after the prompt, without expecting anything specific to change or happen, but simply noticing what arises?

Patient: That actually sounds like a tolerable experiment — a contained, 30-second interoceptive check feels like something I could attempt without catastrophizing. Could you guide me step-by-step (one slow inhale/exhale for 30 seconds, then a single prompt to notice one sensation and briefly describe it)? I'm worried I'll dissociate or get flooded, so can we include a quick grounding cue I can use if it becomes too intense?

Therapist: Let's start with the 30-second breath. I'll guide you through it. 

Begin by taking a slow, deep inhale, and then exhale slowly. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

(Pause for a count of 5)

As you exhale, slowly and deeply, bring your attention to your body. Find one place where you feel a physical sensation, like a sensation in your feet, hands, or belly. Maybe it's a feeling of tension or relaxation, a pressure or a warmth.

(Pause for another 5 counts)

Notice this sensation, whatever it is, without trying to label it or change it. Just observe it as it is. If it's a neutral sensation, that's okay too. If it becomes too intense, I'll give you a quick grounding cue to help you stay with it.

Take another slow inhale, and then exhale. And when you're ready, give me a brief description of the sensation you noticed.

Patient: I noticed a low, dull tightness in my upper belly/solar plexus — like a small knot of pressure that seems to deepen on the inhale. There's a faint warmth in my chest and a little lightheadedness, and I'm already defaulting to calling it "anxiety tied to shame" instead of just naming the feeling. I think I'd like the quick grounding cue now before it shifts — what would you suggest?

Therapist: It sounds like the sensation has already started to get more defined and your mind is jumping in with a familiar narrative. The warmth in your chest is interesting - it's often related to the nervous system's response to emotional arousal.

Before you try to label the feeling further, I'd like to give you a grounding cue to stay with the sensation. Take another slow inhale, and then exhale, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am here, with this sensation, in this moment." Say it with me: "I am here, with this sensation, in this moment."

Patient: I said it—“I am here with this sensation in this moment”—and it actually helped; the tight knot in my upper belly softened into a dull, movable warmth, an interoceptive shift of sorts. My mind immediately began narrating—“that’s shame-related anxiety”—so I kept having to pull myself back to pure sensation instead of explanation. Under the warmth there’s a thin sadness I’m reluctant to let expand; can we try another small, guided step—maybe a 60-second, gently cued body scan with grounding reminders every 15 seconds—so I can practice staying with it without spiraling?

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some progress in staying with the physical sensation, and your mind is still jumping in with interpretations. The interoceptive shift is a great step forward.

For the body scan, I'll guide you through it. Take a slow inhale, and then exhale, and begin to bring your attention to different parts of your body, starting at your toes and moving up to the top of your head. As you scan, I'll give you a gentle reminder every 15 seconds to stay with the sensation and let go of any thoughts or labels.

(Pause for 15 seconds)

Notice the sensation in your toes. Is there any tension or relaxation? No labels, just the sensation as it is.

(Pause for another 15 seconds)

As you scan, remember to stay with the physical sensation and let go of any thoughts. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the body.

(Pause for another 15 seconds)

Where do you notice any areas of tension or relaxation now?

Patient: My shoulders and jaw feel pretty clenched—like a persistent, low-grade tension—and that same dull warmth/pressure in the upper belly is still there. My calves and feet feel noticeably more relaxed, which is oddly comforting and makes me aware of the split between “holding” and “letting go.” Intellectually I can map that holding to hyper-responsibility and old attachment patterns from the chaotic parenting, but if possible I'd like a brief prompt to actually stay with the jaw tension for 20–30 seconds without narrating, and a grounding cue ready if it spikes.

Therapist: It's interesting that you've noticed a contrast between the areas of tension and relaxation in your body. The split between holding and letting go can be a powerful insight.

For the next step, I'd like to help you stay with the jaw tension for a bit longer. Take a slow inhale, and then exhale, and focus your attention on the sensation in your jaw. I want you to notice it without trying to change it, label it, or intellectualize it. Just be with the sensation as it is.

(Pause for 20-30 seconds)

As you stay with the sensation in your jaw, I'll give you a gentle reminder: "I am here with this sensation, exactly as it is."

If the tension becomes overwhelming or spikes, you can use the grounding cue I gave you earlier: "I am here with this sensation, in this moment." But try to stay with the sensation as long as you can, without using the cue unless it feels like you're on the verge of getting lost.

Patient: When I stayed with my jaw, it felt like a tight clamp that eased just a bit into a dull ache radiating toward my temples. My brain immediately offered a neat explanatory narrative—old hypervigilance from inconsistent parenting—so I kept describing rather than actually sinking into the feeling, which is irritating. Underneath that ache there was a small prickling of embarrassment or shame, but I mostly observed it as an idea instead of letting it be fully felt. Can we try a very brief paired grounding—like a 10-second hold with naming three things I see and two things I can touch afterward—so I can practice staying without spiraling?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is getting faster at jumping in with explanations, and you're still practicing describing rather than sinking into the feelings. That's a common challenge.

For this brief paired grounding, I'll guide you through it. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and focus on the sensation in your jaw and the ache in your temples.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Now, name three things you see around you - just the names of the things, not any labels or thoughts about them.

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

Name two things you can touch - just the names of the sensations, without trying to analyze or interpret them.

Take a moment to pause, and when you're ready, take a deep breath in, and then exhale.

Patient: Three things I see: a chipped coffee mug, a stack of case notes, and the pale sky outside the window. Two things I can touch: the rough weave of my chair arm and the cool edge of my phone. Naming them did help—my jaw ache softened a bit and the prickling shame moved sideways into the background—but my mind immediately tried to reframe it as an attachment/conditioning pattern instead of just feeling it, and I'm not sure how to deepen this without getting overwhelmed; could we try one more very small step?

Therapist: It sounds like the naming exercise helped you access the physical sensations a bit more, but your mind is still trying to reframe and intellectualize. That's a common pattern.

For this next step, I'd like to help you focus on the sensation itself, without trying to label it or interpret it. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw and the ache in your temples. 

(Pause for a brief moment)

Notice the sensation without trying to change it, or label it, or intellectualize it. Just be with it, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay—when I actually try to stay with it, the jaw ache is a steady pressure that eases a notch on the exhale and tightens on the inhale, with a thin heat behind my sternum and a slight quickness to my breath. My brain immediately converts it into an explanatory framework—“conditioned hypervigilance from inconsistent caregiving”—and that narrative yanks me out of the felt sense, so I end up observing rather than inhabiting it. I'm feeling a little shaky and wary it'll escalate into shame if I push, so can we do a very short, 15-second anchored stay with an explicit cue to stop if it becomes too much?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to inhabiting the sensation, but your brain is still jumping in with explanations. That's a great insight.

For this next step, I'd like to help you anchor yourself in the sensation, and give you a clear signal to step back if it becomes too much. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is. Now, I'm going to give you a simple cue: "Breathe, pause, and check in." Whenever you feel the sensation escalating, or if you start to feel overwhelmed, just repeat these three words to yourself, and take a deep breath in, and then exhale.

Patient: Okay — I said "Breathe, pause, and check in" to myself a few times and it did help; the jaw pressure eased a notch on the exhales and my breath slowed a little. My mind still wants to narrate it as "conditioned hypervigilance," which yanks me out of the felt sense, so I'm a bit shaky and wary it'll tip into shame. Could we try one more very brief, 15-second anchored stay with that cue, and then a simple grounding prompt (like naming one sound and one thing I can touch) right after so I can practice coming back safely?

Therapist: It sounds like the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" helped you stabilize for a bit. 

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, repeat the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" to yourself.

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

When you're ready, name one thing you hear around you - just the name of the sound.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Name one thing you can touch - just the name of the sensation, without trying to analyze or interpret it.

Patient: One sound: distant traffic. One thing I can touch: the cool rim of my mug. 

Naming that did help—the jaw eased and my breath slowed—but my brain immediately re-labeled it as "attachment-based conditioned shame," which yanks me back into analysis. I'm a bit shaky and worried it could swell; could we do one more short step—20 seconds guided to stay with that thin shame using the "Breathe, pause, and check in" cue, then a quick grounding prompt (like naming two colors I see) right after so I can come back safely?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the shame as a feeling, rather than a narrative. 

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, repeat the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" to yourself.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

When you're ready, name two colors you see around you - just the names of the colors, without trying to analyze or interpret them.

(Note: I'll wait for your response before moving on)

Patient: Pale blue and beige — naming those pulled my attention outward for a second and the jaw eased a bit, breath slowed. My brain immediately tried to recategorize it as "attachment-based conditioned shame," which yanks me back into analysis and leaves me shaky and wary it'll swell. I want to actually feel it instead of explaining it — could we do another very brief, guided 20-second stay with the "Breathe, pause, and check in" cue, then a quick grounding prompt (like tracing one object with my finger) afterward so I can practice coming back safely?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the shame as a feeling, but your brain is still jumping in with explanations. 

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, repeat the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" to yourself.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

When you're ready, bring your attention to the rim of your mug. Place your index finger on the rim and gently trace it with your finger, focusing on the sensation of your finger touching the cool surface.

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

Stay with this sensation for a moment, without trying to analyze or interpret it.

Patient: Tracing the rim felt cool and oddly stabilizing — the texture pulled my attention out of my head and the jaw ache eased a little. But of course my brain immediately labeled it as “interoceptive grounding working on conditioned shame,” which is exactly the pattern that frustrates me — I want to feel it, not theorize it. I'm getting a bit impatient and shaky about this; can we keep going with another very small, concrete step (something like a 30-second guided breath or a brief compassionate phrase to repeat) so I can try to stay with the feeling without my commentary hijacking it?

Therapist: It sounds like tracing the rim was a helpful way to ground yourself, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it. 

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, I'd like to offer you a simple phrase to repeat to yourself: "I am present with this feeling, exactly as it is." Say it with me: "I am present with this feeling, exactly as it is."

(Pause for another 5 seconds)

Stay with this phrase, and focus on the sensation in your jaw, without trying to change it or label it.

Patient: I repeated the phrase a few times and it did soften the jaw and slow my breath a notch, which felt...not bad. Of course my mind immediately reinterpreted it as "interoceptive exposure plus cognitive labeling," which is infuriatingly predictable—I'm describing rather than inhabiting. I'm a bit shaky and would like another very small, concrete step: could we do a 30-second paced breath with you counting the inhales/exhales, or a brief compassionate prompt I can direct toward the thin shame (like "It's okay, you're here") followed by a quick grounding cue?

Therapist: It sounds like the phrase was helpful, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it. 

Let's try a simple, paced breathing exercise to help you focus on the sensation. I'll guide you through it.

Inhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Inhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4...

As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath. If your mind starts to wander or label the feeling, gently bring it back to the sensation.

When you're ready, I'll give you a grounding cue to come back to the present moment.

Patient: The paced breathing did help—counting kept me anchored and my jaw eased a bit, my breath slowed—though, predictably, my mind immediately relabeled it as "interoceptive exposure" and started narrating. I'm ready for the grounding cue now, and could we follow it with a brief compassionate phrase I can direct at the thin shame—something like "It's okay, you're here"—and then another 30 seconds of paced breath? I'm feeling a bit shaky but willing to keep going.

Therapist: It sounds like the pacing breathing helped you stay grounded, but your mind is still trying to intellectualize it. 

When you're ready, I'll give you a grounding cue. Say to yourself: "I am here, exactly as I am, in this moment."

(Pause for a brief moment)

Now, repeat the phrase: "It's okay, you're here."

(Pause for another brief moment)

Inhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Inhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4... (pause)

Stay with the sensation, and see if you can find a sense of calm and stability.

Patient: I repeated the grounding phrase and did the paced breaths—my jaw eased and that thin shame softened into something like a dull ember. Of course my brain immediately rebranded it as "procedural interoceptive work" and started narrating, which is frustrating and makes me shaky. I'm willing to try one more tiny step: can we do a 20-second stay with the guided phrase "It's okay to feel this," then immediately follow with a quick grounding prompt (name one thing I can touch) so I can come back if it tips?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the shame as a feeling, rather than a narrative. 

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, repeat the phrase: "It's okay to feel this."

(Pause for 5 seconds)

As you repeat the phrase, bring your attention to the cool rim of your mug. Place your index finger on the rim and gently touch it, focusing on the sensation of your finger making contact with the cool surface.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Stay with this sensation, and see if you can maintain the feeling of calm and stability.

Patient: Repeating "It's okay to feel this" while tracing the mug rim actually softened the jaw and turned the thin shame into more of a dull ember than a flare. Of course my brain immediately labeled it as "procedural interoceptive regulation," which yanks me out of the felt sense and annoys me — I keep describing instead of inhabiting. I'm shaky but willing to keep going; could we do a 30-second paced breath (inhale 4, exhale 6) with a short compassionate prompt I can direct at the shame, and the grounding cue ready if it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to staying with the feeling of the shame, but your brain is still jumping in with labels.

Take a deep breath in for a count of 4... and hold for a count of 6... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4... and hold for a count of 6... (pause)

Inhale for a count of 4... and hold for a count of 6... (pause)

Exhale for a count of 4... and hold for a count of 6...

As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensation in your jaw, the pressure, the heat, and the quickness in your breath.

Now, say to yourself: "May this feeling be present, exactly as it is."

Patient: Saying "May this feeling be present..." with the elongated breaths actually softened the jaw and turned the ember into a steady, less sharp heat—there was a little more space, which felt...surprising. Of course my brain immediately recategorized it as "acceptance-based practice," which yanks me back into explanation, and I'm still a bit shaky and on guard that it could swell into shame if I try to go deeper. Can we do one tiny next step—three slow hand-on-heart breaths with you counting them and a short compassionate phrase I can say to the shame ("It's okay, I'm with you"), with the quick grounding cue ready if it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing a sense of space and calm around the feeling, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it. 

Take a deep breath in, and place your hand on your heart. 

(Pause for a count of 4)

Exhale for a count of 4... (pause)

Inhale for a count of 4... and exhale for a count of 4... (pause)

Inhale for a count of 4... and exhale for a count of 4...

As you breathe, say to yourself: "It's okay, I'm with you."

Patient: I did the hand-on-heart breaths and said "It's okay, I'm with you"—the jaw loosened and that ember of shame quieted into a steady warmth, which felt both relieving and uncomfortably exposed. Of course my mind immediately tagged it as "compassion-based regulation" and started explaining, so I'm a bit shaky; could we do one very small next step—maybe you name a calm, neutral observation every 20 seconds for a minute so I can practice staying with the feeling without my commentary hijacking it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing a sense of calm and connection with the feeling, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it.

Here's a calm, neutral observation: "The sensation in my body is present."

(Pause for 20 seconds)

The sensation in my body is present.

(Pause for 20 seconds)

The sensation in my body is present.

(Pause for 20 seconds)

Remember to breathe naturally and stay with the sensation. If your mind starts to wander or label the feeling, gently bring it back to the observation.

Patient: That repetition actually helped steady the warmth in my chest and loosen the jaw a bit, but of course my inner commentator immediately rebranded it as "somatic awareness protocol" and pulled me into explanation. I can sense a thin sadness under the heat, but I'm defaulting to analysis instead of feeling it, and I'm a little shaky—can we slow down and do one more brief, guided 30-second stay with the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in," followed by a quick grounding prompt if it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like the repetition of the observation helped you stay with the physical sensations, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it.

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention back to the sensation in your body, the warmth, and the sadness.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation, just as it is.

Now, repeat the cue: "Breathe, pause, and check in."

(Pause for 5 seconds)

As you breathe, if the sensation becomes overwhelming or your mind starts to wander, bring your attention back to the present moment. If it spikes, I'll give you a grounding prompt.

Patient: During that stay the warmth steadied and the jaw loosened a bit; a thin sadness came up but my brain immediately converted it into a neat explanatory frame—“conditioned shame”—and that yanked me back into analysis. I'm feeling a bit shaky and overwhelmed right now, can we slow down? I'd like a simple grounding prompt now (maybe name three sounds you hear, then two things you can touch) before we try to go any deeper.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the sadness, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it.

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale, and bring your attention to the present moment.

Notice the sounds around you: what do you hear?

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensations in your body: what do you feel?

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensations in your body, and see if you can bring a sense of kindness and compassion to them.

Also, bring your attention to the mug in front of you, and notice the sensation of your fingers on the handle. Can you feel the weight of the mug, the texture of the ceramic?

Patient: I hear distant traffic, the low hum of the fridge, and a faint clock ticking. My fingers feel the cool ceramic and the mug's weight, and my chest still has that steady warmth with a tightness in my jaw — intellectually I call it conditioned shame/hypervigilance, but honestly I'm feeling shaky and a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and just stay with these sensations a little longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the sensations in your body, but your mind is still trying to label them.

Let's just stay with what you've noticed so far. Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, and see if you can just be with them, without trying to change them or label them.

Notice the sensation in your chest, the steady warmth and tightness. Notice the sensation in your jaw, the pressure and any tension.

(Pause for as long as you need)

Remember, there's no goal or expectation. Just being with the sensations, exactly as they are.

Patient: Okay — staying with the sensations does seem to produce a measurable attenuation of the acute spike (so, in behavioral terms, exposure with grounding works), but emotionally it still feels precarious and I’m shaky and alert to the critic. Can we slow to very small micro-steps — like 15-second checks with you repeating a neutral prompt (“the sensation is present”) every 20 seconds — so I can try to actually feel the sadness under the heat without my brain immediately theorizing it away?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the sadness under the heat, but your brain is still trying to protect you from it.

Let's try a very small, incremental step. I'll guide you through it.

Take a deep breath in, and then exhale.

(Pause for 5 seconds)

Notice the sensation in your body, and I'll remind you: "The sensation is present."

(Pause for 20 seconds)

Notice the sensation in your body, and I'll remind you: "The sensation is present."

(Pause for 20 seconds)

As you breathe, try to notice the sensation a little bit more, if you can. Notice if the sadness is still under the heat, or if it's changed in any way.

Remember, there's no need to try to do anything with it, just be with it, exactly as it is.

Patient: During those two reminders the chest-heat stayed steady and the sadness did become a bit more distinguishable from the general agitation — my jaw loosened a notch and my breath quieted — but of course my inner commentator immediately recontextualized it as "exposure with grounding," which yanks me back into analysis and leaves me shaky. I want to keep going but slower: could we do three very short rounds (15 seconds each) where you quietly say "The sensation is present" at the start of each round, with a 10-second silent pause to just stay with it, and keep the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" available if it spikes? I’m nervous it’ll swell into shame, so I need that explicit safety cue ready.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing the sadness and feeling a bit more grounded, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it.

Let's try this slow and small approach. I'll guide you through it.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

The sensation is present.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

Stay with the sensation, just as it is.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

The sensation is present.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

Notice if the sensation has changed in any way. If it becomes overwhelming, don't worry - just repeat "The sensation is present" and pause for a moment.

As you breathe, remember that I have the cue "Breathe, pause, and check in" available if you need it.

Patient: During those rounds the warmth stayed steady and the sadness actually became a bit more distinguishable — jaw loosened a notch and my breath quieted. Of course my inner commentator immediately slapped a label on it ("exposure with grounding") and yanked me back into analysis, which left me shaky and on edge. Can we do three more micro-rounds like that, but with you saying "Breathe, pause, and check in" aloud at the start of each round and then 15 seconds of silence so I can try to actually stay with it? I'm nervous it could swell, so please keep the safety cue ready.
