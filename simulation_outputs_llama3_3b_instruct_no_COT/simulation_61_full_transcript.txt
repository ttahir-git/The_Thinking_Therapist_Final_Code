Patient: I've been stuck in this heavy sadness since my partner died — I can't find the energy to do my job or even basic things, and it's bleeding into my relationship because I either shut down or get overly needy. I work as a social worker, so it feels like I should know how to handle this, but I don't. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried coping strategies before and they didn't stick, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
That must feel incredibly tough for you. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're in a moment, and the sadness starts to come up – what's the physical sensation in your body, and what thoughts tend to emerge in that moment?

Patient: Usually it starts as this tightness in my chest like a stone, my breathing gets shallow and my limbs feel heavy so I just want to disappear or stay in bed. Then the thoughts kick in — I’m useless, I don’t deserve to be happy, I’m ruining my relationship because I either shut down or become clingy and needy. I know you want me to notice that stuff, but honestly — how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried paying attention to sensations before and it just turns into more shame.

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be overwhelming. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain and self-criticism. Can you try to see those thoughts that come up as just thoughts – thoughts that don't necessarily reflect the truth about you, but rather your mind's way of trying to make sense of the pain?

Patient: I mean, I get the idea — that thoughts aren’t facts — but when I try to treat them like “just thoughts,” it doesn’t stick. I end up judging myself for having them, like “see, you’re broken,” and it just spirals into more shame. How is that supposed to help when noticing just becomes another way to beat myself up?

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to break the pattern of self-judgment. Instead of trying to "fix" those thoughts, what if we tried to create some space for them to exist, without trying to change or judge them? For example, what would it be like if you simply acknowledged those thoughts, without adding a label like "broken" or "worthless"?

Patient: I can see the idea—letting thoughts be without labeling—but in practice it feels like I'm just minimizing the pain or pretending it isn't real. When I try, my brain immediately adds judgment—“you’re weak, what’s wrong with you”—so how is this supposed to not just become another source of shame? I've tried noticing before and it just backfired.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can feel like that's exactly what's happening. What if, instead of trying to avoid judgment, we focus on what you're willing to do with those thoughts – not necessarily to change them, but to simply allow them to be present in the moment? Would it be okay if you allowed those thoughts to exist, without trying to fix or change them, but also without adding judgment?

Patient: I... I guess I can try, but it feels almost impossible — when I "allow" the thoughts they just turn into louder accusations and I spiral. How is that supposed to help me feel less stuck instead of just tolerating the pain? Maybe I can try for a minute if you tell me exactly what to do in the moment.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something small. I'd like you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "These thoughts are here." Just say that, exactly. No judgment, no addition or subtraction. Just "These thoughts are here." And then, without adding anything else, simply notice what's next.

Patient: I tried it — I took a breath out and said to myself, "These thoughts are here." Right away the chest tightness stayed and the voice in my head got louder, like "See? You're broken," and I felt guilty for even saying it, like I was admitting defeat. For a brief second it felt a little less sharp, but mostly it just turned into more shame and a faster spiral. How is that supposed to help when it just amplifies them? I need something concrete — what exactly do I do next when it starts spinning like that?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the automatic response came in, even though you tried to pause it with the simple statement. Let's try to create some space for something else to happen. When you notice the thoughts getting louder, and the shame starts to creep in, can you try to connect with your breath again, just for a tiny moment – like taking one more deep breath, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: I tried that — I took a slow breath and felt my feet, but the tightness just stayed and the thoughts kept looping. It was a tiny pause, then the voice came back louder and I felt more frustrated and kind of hopeless. How is focusing on my feet supposed to stop the spiral? If we're doing this, tell me exactly what to do next — how long, what to say when the shame gets louder, because these little tricks haven't worked for me before.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like we're still in the midst of a cycle. Instead of trying to stop the thoughts or the shame, let's try to create some space for a different sensation. When the voice gets louder, I'd like you to say to yourself, "I'm not sure what's going on right now." No judgment, no trying to fix it. Just acknowledge that you don't know what's happening, and that's okay.

Patient: Okay, I said it out loud — "I'm not sure what's going on right now" — and for a beat it felt like a tiny crack in the pressure, then the voice immediately sneered, "That's just an excuse," and the spiral came back. It gives a sliver of space, but it doesn't stay, and I end up feeling like a fraud for even trying. How long am I supposed to hold that? What do I actually do when the voice mocks me — how is any of this supposed to help me stop spiraling or stop feeling so hopeless?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that saying "I'm not sure" didn't stick. Let's try something else. When the voice gets loud, instead of trying to respond or fix it, I'd like you to bring to mind something that's connected to what's valued for you – something that feels important or meaningful. Can you think of something like that, even if it's just for a tiny instant?

Patient: I can think of wanting to be the kind of social worker who actually supports people and also wanting to honor my partner’s memory — those feel important to me. But the moment I try to focus on that, the voice just goes, “You’re failing at both,” and it turns into more shame, like another thing I can’t do. How is holding a value supposed to pull me out of the spiral when the shame just hijacks it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is strong. Let's try to ground ourselves in the physical sensations, rather than the thoughts. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground again, and as you do, notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Notice the present moment, without trying to think about the thoughts or the shame.

Patient: I tried it — I felt my feet and the air, and for a second the tightness loosened a hair, but then the chest clamped back and the voice got louder: “You’re pathetic.” How is that supposed to help when it just buys a sliver of relief before the spiral returns? Tell me exactly what to do next when the shame mocks me — how long do I stay with the sensations, and what do I say when it starts laughing?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the shame is still very present. Let's try something different. When the voice starts laughing, I'd like you to say to yourself, "I can tolerate this." Not that you have to be okay with it, but that you can tolerate it, without judgment or resistance. Say it out loud, and for just one more beat, stay with that sensation of tolerating the shame, without trying to change it or fight it.

Patient: Okay — I said it out loud, "I can tolerate this." For a beat it took the edge off a little, but then the voice immediately sneered, "Yeah, right, you can't," and the chest stayed tight so I still felt panicky and kind of like a fraud. How long am I supposed to hold that phrase? If "tolerating" just feels like pretending, what's the next concrete thing I'm supposed to do when it starts laughing? Honestly, I'm getting tired of these tiny tricks — how is any of this supposed to actually help me get unstuck?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the shame is still very strong. Instead of trying to hold onto a phrase or a feeling, let's try to create some space for movement. When the voice starts laughing, I'd like you to imagine taking a tiny step forward, even if it's just an inch. Just a small, tiny movement. Can you imagine yourself taking that step, and what it would feel like in your body?

Patient: I tried to imagine it — I felt my toes shift, like a tiny inch of space opened and the tightness eased a hair, then the voice cut in with, “What’s the point?” If I actually take a real step, what then? Do you mean I should physically stand up and move, or just imagine it? How often am I supposed to do this, and what do I do when the voice tells me it’s pointless — because I’m getting tired of these micro-techniques and I need to know how this turns into actual change.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting frustrated with the micro-techniques. Let's try to focus on the physical movement. I don't mean just imagining it, but actually taking a small step forward, even if it's just to the side or in a different direction. It doesn't have to be a big step, just a tiny one. As you take that step, I want you to notice what happens in your body – what sensations come up, what thoughts come up, how you feel. That might be the start of something bigger.

Patient: Okay — I actually stood up and took a tiny step to the side. I felt my weight shift, my toes press into the floor, and for a second the chest loosened a hair and my breathing slowed, but then the voice sneered, “Big whoop,” and the tightness came back. So… I did the step — now what? How does this tiny movement actually turn into being able to get out of bed or not collapse at work? I'm getting worn out by these micro-techniques; can we try something more concrete I can use when I'm mid-spiral at my desk or with my partner?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Taking that small step was a brave thing to do. Now, I'd like to explore what happens when you take that small step in your daily life – not just in this moment. What would it take for you to feel like taking another small step, or doing something else that feels connected to your values, when you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck?

Patient: I guess I'd need something really stupid-simple and concrete—a single tiny action tied to a value, like “step outside for two minutes at 3 pm” or “send one short text to a friend,” with a preset plan for when the voice sneers (like set a timer and breathe for one minute). Someone to check in—brief, nonjudgmental accountability—would probably help more than pep talks. But I'm exhausted just imagining it, and honestly... how is a two‑minute step supposed to fix months of heaviness?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a sense of structure and support to help you take small steps towards your values. Instead of a timer or a specific action, let's try to connect with the value of connection and community. Would you be willing to commit to checking in with someone you trust – a friend, family member, or even a therapist – once a day, no matter what, to talk about how you're feeling? It doesn't have to be a long conversation, just a small acknowledgement that someone is there for you.

Patient: Maybe — I could try a once‑a‑day check‑in, but it has to be ridiculously small, like one sentence or a thumbs‑up so I don't dread it. And the person can't give advice or moralizing stuff — just a quiet, nonjudgmental "I saw you." But honestly, how is that supposed to help when missing one day will just make me feel like more of a failure?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a sense of safety and reliability in your support system. Instead of focusing on not missing a day, let's explore what would happen if you were able to show up for that check-in every day, without exception. What would be the consequences of that? Would it be feeling a sense of relief, or something else?

Patient: Maybe if I checked in every day, it would chip away at the loneliness — like someone noticing me might keep the spirals from getting so long. But I can already feel the pressure: miss one day and it becomes more proof I'm failing, and I don't see how one tiny sentence actually moves the big stuff — the numbness at work or the fights with my partner. How is that supposed to help with the heaviness that won't quit, though?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling the weight of expectation and the pressure to perform. Instead of focusing on checking in every day, let's try to connect with the value of self-compassion. What would it mean to treat yourself with kindness and understanding, even when you're struggling? Would that be a tiny crack in the armor of self-criticism, or something bigger?

Patient: I guess treating myself kindly would look like tiny, practical stuff — letting myself rest for ten minutes without guilt, saying out loud once a day “I’m doing enough,” or giving myself permission to miss one work task without beating myself up. Maybe that’s a tiny crack, but it also feels like another thing to mess up, so how is that supposed to help when I’m mid‑meltdown or my partner accuses me of shutting down? Can you give me a concrete script or step for those moments?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those tiny, practical steps can be a good start. When you're feeling overwhelmed and your partner accuses you of shutting down, I'd like you to try saying "I'm having trouble getting out of bed right now" – just those words, no justification, no explanation. It's just a statement of fact. Can you try that?

Patient: I said it — “I’m having trouble getting out of bed right now” — and for a beat the pressure eased, then the voice called me “pathetic” and my partner snapped, “That’s just an excuse.” It didn’t stop the fight; it just left me feeling exposed and more useless. How is that supposed to help when they get angrier? Give me a concrete next line to say when that happens and one tiny thing I can do in the moment if the panic spikes, because these little anchors keep failing me.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the conversation escalated. When your partner gets angry, I'd like you to say "I see that you're upset" – just those words, without taking on their anger or trying to fix the situation. It's a neutral acknowledgment of their emotions.

Patient: I said “I see that you’re upset” and it took the edge off for a beat, then they snapped “that’s just an excuse” and my chest tightened like crazy and the voice called me pathetic. What exactly do I say next—something short, non-defensive, that won’t make them blow up more?

Patient: I tried saying “I’m feeling really overwhelmed right now” and for a beat it calmed me a hair, then my partner snapped it away and the voice in my head called me pathetic and the panic spiked. What exactly do I say next—one short, non‑defensive line that won’t make them blow up more—and give me one tiny, idiot‑proof, discreet thing I can do right then (at work or on the couch) to stop the panic without drawing attention. I'm already worn out just asking, so keep it stupid‑simple.

As for something discreet to do in the moment, can you try taking a slow, deep breath into your belly, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: I tried it — I said “I’m feeling like I’m going to lose control” and held the step for maybe 7 seconds. It eased the edge for a beat, then they snapped and my inner voice called me pathetic and the panic jumped back. How is that supposed to help when it only buys a second? Give me one ultra‑short next line to say if they keep attacking me, and one absolutely idiot‑proof, totally discreet thing I can do at my desk (exact steps and how long) that actually stops the panic instead of just delaying it — please keep it very simple, because I’m running on empty.
