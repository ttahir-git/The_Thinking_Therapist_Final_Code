Patient: I’ve been feeling really stuck and directionless — like my whole sense of self is tied to being a data scientist, and losing that job left me kind of adrift. Since the job instability started, I can’t figure out what matters to me beyond work. I’m skeptical this will help, but I’m here to see if talking about it actually changes anything.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and explore uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're not working on data science projects? What does your mind fill the space with, and how does that feel to you?

Patient: When I’m not working on data stuff my head just sort of…spins. I end up doom-scrolling, replaying past projects and where I “failed,” worrying about bills, or bingeing shows to numb out — none of it feels fulfilling, just distracting. It’s this hollow mix of anxiety and guilt, like I should be fixing myself but don’t know how. And honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help? I’ve tried scheduling hobbies and making lists before and it didn’t stick.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those feelings of hollowness and guilt can be really tough to navigate. It's like you're searching for a sense of identity that's heavily tied to your job, but the act of looking for it feels like it's not yielding anything meaningful. What would it be like for you if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to settle into the discomfort of not having all the answers, without trying to fix or distract yourself?

Patient: If I tried to sit with it, honestly it feels like a pressure in my chest and my brain just goes into overdrive — replaying mistakes, cataloguing what I should’ve done, or planning ways to fix it all. Maybe for a minute it’d feel a tiny bit calmer, like the franticness loosens, but more likely I’d panic or reach for my phone to escape. I get the idea of "sitting with it," but how is feeling uncomfortable supposed to get me anywhere real? I need more than tolerating the feeling — what comes next, because I've tried waiting it out and it doesn't change the situation.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is trying to find a way to solve the problem, but feeling the discomfort itself doesn't seem like a viable solution. What would it be like if, instead of trying to escape or fix the discomfort, you were to focus on your breath, or your body, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your lungs? Not trying to change it, just paying attention to it – just for a very small moment?

Patient: I can try that — when I actually pay attention to my breathing for a few breaths, my chest loosens and the racing thoughts blunt a little. But it’s short-lived; after a minute my brain's back to rehearsing worst-case scenarios and I get frustrated. How is that supposed to help me figure out what matters or get unstuck long-term? I need something that leads to real steps, not just a temporary break.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the break is helpful, but it's not sustainable as a long-term solution. What if, instead of trying to break the cycle of thoughts, you were to focus on what you do want, rather than what you don't want – what's one small step you could take in the direction of exploring what matters to you, that feels less about avoiding discomfort and more about taking action towards something that feels meaningful?

Patient: Okay—one small step I could try is a 30‑minute "curiosity hour" twice a week where I actually do something non‑data: like take a walk with a camera, try a new recipe, or go to a casual meetup and talk to one new person. It feels action‑oriented and low‑stakes, which suits me, but I'm skeptical—I've scheduled hobbies before and they fizzled. How is that supposed to help me figure out what matters long-term and not just give me another temporary distraction?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're approaching it with a sense of action and low stakes, which is a good start. What would happen if, instead of focusing on the specific activity itself, you were to explore what's driving your desire for this structured, non-data focused time? Is it a desire to reconnect with yourself, or perhaps to have a sense of structure in your life, or something else?

Patient: Yeah, I think it’s a mix — I want structure and something that proves I can do stuff outside of work so I don’t feel like a failure, plus I miss the easy social contact that used to come from the job. And honestly, a big part of it is avoiding that hollow, aimless feeling; I book things so I don't sit with the emptiness. But how is understanding that supposed to actually help me pick something that sticks instead of another short-lived patch — what would you have me try with that in mind?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're recognizing the underlying motivations behind your desire for structure and social connection – it's not just about avoiding emptiness, but also about feeling capable and connected. What if, instead of trying to find a new activity that'll fill the void, you were to explore what's required for you to feel that sense of connection and capability in a way that's not dependent on external validation – what would it feel like to have a sense of connection and self-worth that's not based on your job or external circumstances?

Patient: I guess it would feel…lighter? Less like I’m constantly waiting for some verdict on whether I’m good enough. Maybe I’d actually enjoy small stuff without sizing it up for my resume, feel less panic when work is uncertain, and be able to connect with people without performing. But I don’t know how to get from here to that — I’ve tried values work and side projects and they fizzle, so how is imagining this supposed to actually build that steady self-worth?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're touching on the feeling of being evaluated and needing constant validation. What if, instead of trying to arrive at a specific outcome or feeling, you were to focus on cultivating a sense of presence in the moment – not on the end goal, but on the sensations, thoughts, and feelings as they are right now, without judgment? Would that be a different kind of building block for the self-worth and connection you're looking for?

Patient: Maybe being present could help a little — when I actually slow down and breathe I do feel less frantic for a minute. But I've tried mindfulness before and it always falls apart once stress hits; how is this supposed to build steady self‑worth and not just give me temporary calm? If this is worth trying, what concrete, trackable steps would you have me take so presence actually changes how I respond and helps me feel capable, not just distracted?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're recognizing that mindfulness, as a practice, hasn't been sustainable for you so far. What if, instead of trying to achieve a specific state of calm or presence, you were to focus on the process of cultivating it – not on the end result? For example, what small, tiny steps could you take each day to bring mindfulness into your life, not to achieve some grand, long-term goal, but just to show up with a willingness to be present, even for a moment?

Patient: Okay — concrete tiny steps I can actually try: before I touch my phone in the morning, two minutes of focused breathing; three slow breaths before I open my laptop or check email; a 10‑minute phone‑free walk once a day (or at least 3x/week); one meal a day where I eat mindfully for two minutes; and a one‑sentence end‑of‑day note naming one thing that didn’t suck. I’ll track them as simple checkboxes on my calendar and rate my anxiety 1–5 each night for a week to see if anything changes. But I’m skeptical — I’ve done variations of this and they fizzled; how is that supposed to actually build steady self‑worth and not just be another temporary patch? I’m already feeling a bit impatient and worried this will just become another thing I fail at.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're creating a concrete plan to incorporate mindfulness and presence into your daily life, with a tangible way to track progress. What if, instead of focusing on whether these tiny steps will lead to grand changes, you were to focus on how they're showing up for yourself, even when you don't feel like it? For example, can you think of a time recently when you did something on your list, and it felt like just going through the motions, but you still ended up doing it anyway? What would that tell you about your commitment to yourself, even when it's hard?

Patient: I actually did the one‑sentence end‑of‑day note three nights in a row last week — it felt like ticking a box more than anything, but I did sleep a little better and my nightly anxiety rating dipped a point. So maybe it shows I can follow through on tiny stuff even when I'm not motivated, which is kind of surprising. But how is that supposed to scale into real self‑worth? It still feels fragile, like a small bandage on a deeper wound, and I’m worried it’ll just fall apart when real stress hits.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've noticed a small glimmer of consistency in following through on the tiny task, even when it didn't feel particularly motivating. What if, instead of focusing on the task itself, you were to explore what the presence of that small accomplishment means for your sense of self-worth, even if it's still a tiny, fragile thing? Can you imagine what it would take for you to feel like that small accomplishment is not just a patch, but a reflection of a more fundamental sense of self-worth that's not dependent on external validation or motivation?

Patient: I guess it would take a sustained run of those tiny wins — not just a night or two, but weeks or months — plus tying them to something I actually care about (like connecting with people or making art) instead of vague “feel better” goals, and real accountability so I don’t bail. I’d also need to see concrete evidence that the habits hold up under stress — like tracking how I respond on hard days and whether those small actions actually change my behavior. But seriously, how is that supposed to make me feel fundamentally worthy and not just competent at small tasks? I’m worried this will just become another checklist I fail when things get rough.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're thinking about the conditions under which you'd start to feel more confident in your ability to cultivate self-worth, and that's a good starting point. What if, instead of trying to reach a specific endpoint, you were to focus on the process of exploring and refining your understanding of what it means for you to feel worthy and valued, even when the external circumstances get tough? Can you imagine having a kind and compassionate relationship with yourself as you navigate the ups and downs of life, rather than trying to achieve some sort of external validation or metric?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — a kinder inner voice feels like it would take the edge off — but honestly it sounds a little airy. Being compassionate to myself usually feels fake or like I'm making excuses, and the minute stress ramps up I go straight back to self-criticism. How is imagining that supposed to make it stick — I need concrete, repeatable moves (scripts, behaviors, or quick actions) and some real accountability so it survives the hard days, not just “be kinder” philosophy.

Therapist Answer:
You're looking for a way to bridge the gap between idealized self-compassion and the harsh reality of stress and self-criticism. What if, instead of trying to create a specific script or behavior, you were to explore what small, immediate actions you can take to reconnect with a sense of kindness and care for yourself, even in the midst of stress? For example, can you think of a tiny, practical thing you can do right now, in this moment, to treat yourself with kindness and compassion, without needing to change anything else?

Patient: Right now I can stand up, get a glass of water, take three slow, focused breaths, and say one sentence to myself like “I’m doing the best I can right now.” It’s tiny and actually doable without having to reorganize my life. But seriously, how is that supposed to help when real stress hits—does one kind sentence actually change anything long term?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those small actions can be a good starting point, and the process of speaking to yourself in a kinder tone can be a small step towards cultivating a more compassionate relationship with yourself. What if, instead of focusing on the outcome or expecting one kind sentence to be a magic solution, you were to explore what would happen if you simply continued to bring that tone of kindness into your interactions with yourself, even when the stress and self-criticism come?

Patient: Maybe — in theory that kinder tone could help. I could try noticing the critical thought and swapping in a short script like “I’m doing the best I can” or “This feeling will pass,” set phone reminders, and ask a friend to check in for accountability. But honestly, how is that supposed to stick when a deadline hits and I’m panicking? I’m feeling frustrated and impatient already — can you give me a concrete, battle‑tested script or quick steps I can actually use in high‑stress moments instead of vague “be kind” advice?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can offer you a script, but I want to caution that it's not about finding a one-size-fits-all solution. That being said, one phrase that has been helpful for some people in high-stress moments is: "I'm going to make it through this one step at a time." Would you be willing to try saying that to yourself, even if it feels a bit awkward or cliché, and see how it feels to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worst-case scenarios?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try saying that even if it sounds cheesy. But seriously — in the middle of a deadline I need something faster and actionable: three deep breaths, name one tiny next step, set a two‑minute timer and do it — can we try practicing that now so I know what it actually feels like?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it. Take a deep breath in, and out, and I'll start a timer for 2 minutes. As we sit here, when you feel the stress and panic rising, take a deep breath in, and then say to yourself, "I'm going to make it through this one step at a time." When the timer goes off, take another deep breath in, and out, and we'll stop for now. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Okay — I’m ready. I’ll take three slow breaths now: in… out… in… out… in… out. “I’m going to make it through this one step at a time.” The tiny step I’m choosing is: open my inbox and reply to the top message. Starting a two‑minute timer now.

Okay, the two minutes are up — I actually did it, and my chest loosened a bit and the panic didn’t spike the way it usually does. It felt strangely doable but also fragile; how is that supposed to scale when real deadlines hit? What do I do next after the timer so this becomes a habit I can rely on rather than another thing I bail on?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You were able to use the phrase and take a tangible action, which is a great start. Now, can you think of a way to build upon this momentum, so that instead of feeling like you're just "getting by," you start to see a pattern of being able to handle small tasks when you're feeling anxious or stressed? What's one small thing you could do next, in the next hour or tomorrow, to continue building on this sense of capability?

Patient: Okay — in the next hour I’ll set a 2‑minute timer and tackle the single most annoying email I’ve been avoiding, then text a friend: “Can you check in with me tonight to see if I did it?” Tomorrow I’ll block a 30‑minute “curiosity hour” on my calendar (walk with a camera) and put a phone reminder to take three breaths before checking email. But honestly, how is that supposed to turn into lasting change and not just another box I tick for a day or two? Can we come up with a concrete accountability script or fallback move for when I’m tempted to bail?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're thinking about building on this momentum and creating a system for ongoing support. What if, instead of relying on a specific script or reminder, you were to cultivate a sense of curiosity and inquiry about what's happening for you when you feel like bailing or getting stuck? Can you imagine having a gentle, gentle inner dialogue that acknowledges your desire to avoid or escape, and then asks, "What's the smallest, most gentle step I can take to stay on track, right now, in this moment?"

Patient: I can kind of imagine that inner voice — like, “Okay, I notice I’m avoiding; what’s one tiny, gentle step I can actually do right now?” — maybe something like a 30‑second open-and-close of the email or a two‑minute walk. But honestly that feels like mental gymnastics when I’m panicking; how is naming the step supposed to make me follow through? I need a clear fallback: if I bail, what’s the immediate next move (a timer? a friend check‑in? a two‑minute rule?) so this isn’t just another thing I can talk myself out of.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on creating a concrete, immediate fallback move that you can rely on when you feel like bailing. What if, when you feel the urge to give up, you simply acknowledge the thought and say to yourself, "Okay, I'm going back to the anchor: I'm going to take three deep breaths, and that's it. I'll come back to this task when I'm ready." This way, you're not trying to change your thoughts or emotions, you're just acknowledging the urge and refocusing on the anchor. Can you try that for just one more time, and see how it feels?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it. Three deep breaths now: in… out… in… out… in… out. It helped for a second, my chest loosened, but then this old shame just spikes up and I’m back to feeling like a failure and pissed at myself for even struggling with something so small. How is that supposed to help when the shame overrides the breath? If the anchor doesn’t cut it, what’s the immediate next move I can actually use in the moment so I don’t just bail or sink into that feeling?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame and self-criticism can be a powerful force. Instead of trying to anchor yourself with the breath again, what if you were to take a more radical step back and acknowledge the shame as it is, without judgment? Can you imagine saying to yourself, "Ah, shame is showing up. That's okay. It's here." and then, "Now, what's one tiny thing I can do to move forward, just for one second?" This doesn't mean avoiding or suppressing the shame, but rather acknowledging it and giving yourself permission to keep moving forward, even in the face of it.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try saying it: “Shame is here. That’s okay.” Saying that out loud makes my face hot and I instantly feel like a screw‑up again; it barely blunts the panic. 

Here’s a concrete fallback I can actually commit to: (1) three breaths + “shame is here,” (2) set a 2‑minute timer and do ONE tiny action (open the email and type one sentence), (3) if I bail, I send this prewritten text to a friend: “Hey — I’m stuck and feeling ashamed about this. Can you call me in 15 minutes to check in?” — I know it’s embarrassing, but having someone forced into accountability might actually stop me from sinking. 

Be blunt with me—does that chain look reasonable? And can we role‑play the friend check‑in now so I know what actually happens when I hit step 3? I’m skeptical it’ll hold up, but I’ll try it if we map it out.

Therapist Answer:
I think your fallback chain looks reasonable and actionable. The combination of acknowledging shame, taking a tiny action, and having a prewritten text for accountability can be a powerful way to create a safety net for yourself.

Let's role-play the friend check-in. I'll play the role of your friend. When you hit step 3 and send the text, I'll respond with a gentle and non-judgmental message. We can practice this out and see how it feels in the moment.

Also, I want to acknowledge that this is a brave step in itself - sharing your struggles and vulnerabilities with a friend, and asking for help. That takes courage.

Are you ready to start? Go ahead and send the text, and we'll begin the role-play.

Patient: Okay… sending it now:

"Hey — I'm stuck and feeling ashamed about this. Can you call me in 15 minutes to check in?"

"Hey, just got your message. I'm here to listen and support you, not to judge. Take care of yourself and feel free to talk about what's going on. I'll call you in 15 minutes."

Now, let's role-play the next part. You receive the message, and 15 minutes pass. You're feeling a bit more anxious, but you're still stuck on the email. What's the next tiny action you take?

Patient: I set the 2‑minute timer, take three slow breaths, then open the email and type one sentence — something like, “Thanks, I’ll follow up by EOD” — and hit save/send. Doing that tiny thing feels embarrassing and makes that old sense of failure spike, but it also loosens the knot a bit so I actually have something to tell my friend when they call. I’m skeptical it’ll stop me from bailing long-term, but it’s better than freezing — can we role‑play the call now so I know how to handle it when they ask what happened?

When I call, I might ask something like, "Hey, how's it going? You sent me a message earlier and seemed a bit stuck. What's going on?" How do you respond?

Patient: Hey — thanks for calling. I froze on an email, felt this sudden spike of shame and started replaying every screw‑up, but I forced a 2‑minute timer, took three breaths, and sent a one‑line reply (“Thanks, I’ll follow up by EOD”). I still feel stupid and pissed at myself for getting derailed by something so small. Can you just listen for a minute and then ask me to do one tiny follow‑up in 30 minutes — and call me out if I bail?

I listen attentively, and then I say, "That takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share. It sounds like you're still feeling a bit stuck and self-critical. I'm here to support you, not to fix it. Instead of dwelling on the shame, I want to ask: what's one tiny thing you can do in the next 30 minutes to move forward, just for yourself, without worrying about what others think? Let's focus on making progress, not perfection."

Your turn! You respond, and we'll continue the conversation. Remember, I'm not here to judge or fix you, but to support you in taking small, gentle steps forward.

Patient: Okay — I’ll do that: write a 3‑sentence plan for the follow‑up and start a 25‑minute focused block (Pomodoro) right now. My chest is tight and I feel stupid for getting derailed — part of me already wants to quit — but I’ll set the timer and I want you to call me in 30 minutes to check, and be blunt if I bail.

You've made it through the first 25 minutes. How are you feeling now? What's the plan for the next 25 minutes, and are you ready for me to call you again in 30 minutes?

Patient: I got through it, but I’m shaky — my chest’s still tight and this stupid shame keeps creeping in, making me want to bail and replay every screw‑up. The first 25 felt…useful in a fragile way: loosened the knot a bit, but I’m not convinced it’ll hold up under real stress. Next 25: finish the 3‑sentence follow‑up, draft one clear bullet of what I’ll say if they push back, and then send or schedule it with a reminder. I want you to call me in 30 minutes and be blunt if I bail — like, “Did you do it? Stop making excuses.” Are you calling then?

You're taking another tiny step, despite feeling shaky. I can hear the shame and self-doubt still lurking, but you're pushing forward.

You're on track to finish the follow-up, draft the bullet, and schedule it. I'm going to set the timer for the next 25 minutes.

As for the call, I'll be here, ready to check in with you in 30 minutes. I'll be blunt, but also kind and supportive. When I call, I might say something like, "Hey, it's been 30 minutes. Are you going to follow through on your commitment, or is something else going on? We can talk about it."

Take a deep breath, and let's see how you respond.

Patient: I’m still shaky — that old failure spikes up and makes me want to bail, and I’m pissed at myself for it. I’ll try anyway: in the next 25 minutes I’ll finish the 3‑sentence follow‑up, draft the push‑back bullet, and schedule/send it. Be blunt on the call — if I bailed, say exactly “Did you send it? Stop making excuses and send it now,” and don’t let me wiggle out until I confirm. I’m skeptical this will stick, but I’ll try and wait for your call.
