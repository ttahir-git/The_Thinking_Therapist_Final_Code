Patient: I've been throwing myself into hobbies—painting, freelance projects, bingeing craft stuff—to numb this grief since the empty-nest stuff started, but it just feels like I'm avoiding the real pain. I keep seeing a chain where this turns into me getting totally consumed, burning out my art, pushing people away, failing at work, and ending up alone and stuck — like that's definitely how it goes. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't shake that it's the only thing that will happen.

Therapist: So, it sounds like having multiple hobbies is both a way to cope with your grief and a way to avoid the pain. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this pattern of needing to fill the space with creative pursuits?

Patient: I think it's this panic that if I stop filling the space, the grief will take over and everything will cascade—I’ll lose momentum in my art, clients will bail, friends will drift, and I'll end up completely alone, which feels like a sure thing. Staying busy feels like control, like I'm staving off that collapse, so I compulsively jump into new projects even when I'm exhausted. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't shake that this is how it has to go.

Therapist: It seems like the thought of stopping is really tied to the fear of losing control and feeling overwhelmed by the grief. What would it be like if you weren't trying to control the situation with so many projects and distractions – if you were to make room for the pain instead of trying to avoid it?

Patient: If I let myself sit with the grief, I just see everything collapsing—I'd miss deadlines because I'd be immobilized or crying, clients would bail, commissions would stop, money would get tight, and then friends would drift because they can't watch me fall apart. My studio would turn into a mess, I'd stop painting, lose my identity, and end up alone and broke—like a domino effect that absolutely happens. I know it sounds over the top, but I can't imagine making space without that chain of disasters, so I keep piling on projects to try to stop it. I'm really scared of that, and it's why I can't slow down.

Therapist: The idea of losing everything that's currently holding things together feels like a very concrete threat. Can you imagine taking one small step back, just a tiny one, from the fear of this domino effect, and instead see what it would be like to have a tiny bit of space to breathe, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: I tried to picture taking a tiny step back, but my brain immediately races to the worst—one missed minute becomes one missed deadline, then a lost client, my whole schedule collapses, I lose income, and suddenly my studio and friends drift away. I know that sounds extreme and maybe unrealistic, but it feels inevitable, so I just keep pushing even when I'm exhausted. I'm feeling really overwhelmed imagining even a small pause and don't know how to do that without everything spiraling.

Therapist: It feels like your brain is already imagining the worst-case scenario, and that's creating a sense of urgency to keep moving. Would it be possible to observe that thought, just notice it as a thought, without judgment, and then say to yourself, "I'm having this thought, and it's scary, but I'm not sure what would actually happen if I stopped and let things unfold?"

Patient: I tried that—saying to myself "I'm having this thought"—but it just keeps clicking through the disaster checklist: one missed minute, one missed deadline, a lost client, no income, friends drifting, my studio a mess. Calling it "just a thought" feels like pretending the flood won't happen; I'm really overwhelmed and it doesn't make the certainty vanish. I honestly don't know how to make that doubt feel any more real.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a sense of the thought as a process, like a narrative that keeps unfolding, rather than just a single thought. Can you try to find the physical sensations in your body, the feelings of tension or anxiety, that seem to be accompanying this thought process, and simply acknowledge them as they are, without trying to change them?

Patient: My chest tightens and my throat feels like it's closing, my heart races, and my stomach is this hard knot. My hands get jittery and I start fiddling with stuff, my jaw and shoulders clench — it's like my body's already rushing toward the disaster my mind keeps predicting. Trying to just notice it feels dangerous, like I'm letting the panic grow and that somehow makes the whole chain of bad things more certain. I'm really overwhelmed by these sensations and don't know how to sit with them without the worst-case story taking over.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already in motion, moving towards the predicted disaster, and that's making the thought feel even more real and urgent. What if, instead of trying to stop the thought or the sensations, you could try to make room for the experience of being with them, as they are, without trying to change or prevent them?

Patient: I hear you, but "making room" feels like opening the door to the whole collapse — like if I let the tightness sit for a minute, it kicks off the missed-deadline thing and then everything falls apart. I tried once and my hands started shaking and my brain immediately ran the whole disaster reel, so it doesn't feel like tolerating feelings, it feels like triggering the spiral. I'm really overwhelmed and honestly don't know how to sit with it without everything spiraling into that worst-case chain.

Therapist: It feels like you're caught in a sense of obligation to prevent the worst-case scenario, and that's making it hard to find a way to sit with your current experience. Can you try to explore with me what might happen if, for just a tiny moment, you were to let go of the need to prevent the worst-case scenario, and instead, simply allowed the present moment to be, with all its tension and discomfort?

Patient: I can't imagine letting go even for a second—my brain immediately plays out the whole collapse like a movie: one pause, one missed deadline, then everything falls apart. My chest tightens just thinking about trying, my hands get shaky, and I feel desperate to keep moving. I get that you want me to try, but that sounds unrealistic to me—if we did any practice, tell me exactly what you'd have me do for, like, 30 seconds or one minute, because otherwise I'll just spiral and I don't know how to stop it. I'm really frustrated and stuck and I don't know how to make that fear feel any less true.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling stuck and frustrated, and it's hard to imagine a way forward. I want to reassure you that we're not trying to make you do anything drastic or that we're not aiming to "win" a competition. Our goal is simply to explore a different way of being with your experience, without changing or preventing the worst-case scenario. With that in mind, I'd like to propose a tiny experiment: I'd like you to take one deep breath, just one, and then slowly, very slowly, say the phrase "I am here" to yourself, in a very gentle, matter-of-fact tone, and just stay with that phrase for one second. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Okay, I'll try it—I'm taking one deep breath now. I am here. 

My chest's still tight and my brain immediately went to the whole collapse — one second felt like the moment everything starts falling apart: missed deadlines, clients gone, friends drifting. I'm trying, but I already feel like this won't help and I'm really scared it just makes the spiral louder.

Therapist: It's like your body and mind are already moving into the predicted disaster, even as you're trying to stay with the phrase "I am here." Can you acknowledge that feeling of certainty, without judgment, and simply observe it as a part of your experience?

Patient: Yeah — I can name it: there's this absolute certainty buzzing in my head that everything will collapse, and I notice my chest tightening, my breath speeding, my hands starting to fidget. I can say I'm observing it, but it feels like watching a movie where the ending is fixed — the more I look, the louder the disaster gets, not quieter. I'm trying to hold it without judging, but it just makes me want to grab for another project to stop the reel, and I don't know how to keep from spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like observing the thought doesn't feel like it's allowing you to let go, but rather fuels the experience. I want to gently suggest that we explore a different way of being with the thought. Instead of focusing on the outcome, what if we looked at the sensation of the thought itself, without judgment, without trying to prevent it, and without trying to change it? Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, but I already feel like this will just turn the volume up on the disaster reel — noticing the thought becomes proof it's real. If you want me to do it, tell me exactly what to look for for, like, 30 seconds: where do I put my attention, what do I say to myself, because otherwise I'll just spiral into the whole domino collapse.

Therapist: I want to reassure you that we're not trying to amplify the thought, but rather explore it in a different way. I'd like you to look at the sensation of the thought, without judgment, without trying to change it, and without trying to prevent it. As you do this, I'd like you to say to yourself, "This thought is present, exactly as it is." That's it. Just "This thought is present." No judgment, no trying to change it, no trying to prevent it. Just a simple, gentle acknowledgement. Would you be willing to try this for 30 seconds?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it for 30 seconds. "This thought is present." 

My chest's already tight and the disaster reel kicked in — I can feel the shame and frustration like I'm failing at even this, which just makes the thought louder. Tell me exactly what you want me to do for the rest of the 30 seconds: keep saying the phrase out loud, repeat it silently, or just notice each time the worst-case pops up? I don't want to spiral, but I don't know how to do this without it turning into panic.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a sense of the thought's presence, and it's triggering some strong emotions. I want to offer a small adjustment. Instead of trying to repeat the phrase, I'd like you to simply notice each time the worst-case scenario pops up. Just acknowledge it, without judgment, without trying to change it, and without trying to prevent it. When it comes up, say to yourself, "The worst-case scenario is present." That's it. Just a simple, gentle acknowledgement. Would you be willing to try this for the rest of the 30 seconds?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. "The worst-case scenario is present." 

My chest's clamping and there's this hot shame and frustration — like I've already failed at this and that just makes the disaster reel louder, not quieter. If it spikes, tell me exactly what you want me to do next, because I'm really scared it'll just spiral out of control.

Therapist: It sounds like the worst-case scenario is really stirring up strong emotions. I'd like you to stay with the sensation of the shame and frustration, and not try to change it or judge it. Instead, I want you to notice when the thoughts or feelings spike, and simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling this." That's it. Just a gentle acknowledgment of the physical sensation, without judgment. No trying to change it, no trying to prevent it, just a simple observation. Would you be willing to try this?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it: "I'm feeling this." I'm saying it now, but my chest's clamping and this hot shame is burning through me, and saying it just seems to feed the disaster reel instead of quieting it. If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do next—do I keep repeating the phrase, breathe slowly, or leave the room? I'm scared that any pause will kick off the collapse and I don't know how to make that fear feel less true.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a sense of the shame and frustration, and it's really hard to let go of it. I want to offer a small adjustment. Instead of trying to control the thought or the emotions, I'd like you to try something very different. When the worst-case scenario spikes, I'd like you to focus on your breath, and bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you try to pay attention to the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or control it? Just notice the breath, exactly as it is.

Patient: I tried to follow it — my breath is shallow and fast, I can feel it up in my chest, and instead of calming me the shame flares up like I'm failing all over again and the disaster reel gets louder. Noticing the breath just feels like a pause before the collapse—my mind still jumps to missed deadlines and clients leaving—so breathing doesn't feel like it will stop anything. If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do next—counting, slowing, putting a hand on my belly, getting up, what—because otherwise I'll just obsess or dive into another project to drown it out.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the breath isn't providing the sense of safety you were hoping for. I want to try something else. When the shame and worst-case scenario spike, I'd like you to try placing your hand on your belly. Yes, just your belly. Can you place your hand on your belly, and simply notice the sensation of your hand touching your belly, without trying to change it or control it? No trying to stop the shame, no trying to prevent the worst-case scenario. Just noticing the physical sensation of your hand touching your belly, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay, I put my hand on my belly — it’s warm but my breath is still shallow and my chest’s clamping; there’s this hot shame under everything like I’ve already messed up. The moment I try to notice it, my brain slams into the disaster reel — one tiny pause means missed deadlines, clients gone, everything collapsing — and I get jittery and distracted. If it spikes, tell me exactly what you want me to do for the next 30 seconds — keep the hand there, count, breathe differently, or get up? I’m really worried this will just make it worse and I don’t want to spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is really reactive to the shame and worst-case scenario, and it's hard to stabilize. I want to offer a small adjustment. Instead of trying to control the thought or the emotions, I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your hand on your belly. I'd like you to simply stay with the sensation of your hand touching your belly, without trying to notice the shame or the worst-case scenario. Just focus on the physical sensation of your hand on your belly, and allow yourself to be with it, exactly as it is. Don't try to change it, don't try to prevent it, just be with it. Can you try to stay with that sensation for the next 30 seconds, without getting caught up in the thought or the emotions?

Patient: Okay — I kept my hand on my belly; it feels warm and steady but my breath's still shallow and my head immediately shot into the disaster reel: one tiny pause, missed deadline, clients gone. My chest tightened, shame flared like I'm failing at even trying this, and my phone buzzed so I got even more scattered. Tell me exactly what to do if it spikes—count, keep the hand, slow the breath, get up? I don't want to spiral but I can't figure out the next move on my own.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still really reactive to the shame and worst-case scenario. I want to offer a gentle suggestion. If it spikes, I'd like you to take a very small step back from the disaster reel. Literally, just take a small step back from the thought. Can you imagine taking one tiny step back from the worst-case scenario, without trying to prevent it or change it? Just take one tiny step back, and allow yourself to be with the sensation of your hand on your belly, exactly as it is.

Patient: I tried to imagine taking one tiny step back — I put my hand on my belly and pictured stepping back, but my brain immediately replayed the whole collapse: one missed minute, one missed deadline, clients gone, money tight, friends drifting, my studio a mess. I feel this hot shame like I'm failing at even trying and it's making me jittery and distracted (my phone buzzed and I got more scattered). If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do next — do I keep the hand there, take another step, count, or get up? I don't want to spiral but I don't know the next move.

Therapist: It sounds like taking a step back didn't provide the sense of safety you were hoping for. I want to try something else. I'd like you to focus on your physical body, and bring your attention to your feet. Can you imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground, and slowly, slowly growing downward, downward, downward, into the earth? Just imagine those roots growing, and allow yourself to be supported by the earth, exactly as you are.

Patient: I tried picturing roots, but my brain immediately flips into the disaster reel—if I root myself I'll be stuck, miss chances to hustle, miss deadlines, clients bail, money tight, and then everyone drifts away. I feel this hot shame like I'm failing at even trying—like an idiot—and that just makes me more jittery and unfocused. Tell me exactly what you want me to do next for, like, 30 seconds—keep the roots, put my hand on my belly, count breaths, or get up—because otherwise I’ll just spiral into the whole collapse and I don’t know how to stop it.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still really reactive to the shame and worst-case scenario. I want to try something else. I'd like you to try to let go of the thought that you'll be stuck or fail. Can you say to yourself, "I am not stuck. I am not failing." Just say it, without judgment, without trying to change it, without trying to prevent it. Just say it, and allow the truth of that statement to be true, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay — I said it: "I am not stuck. I am not failing." But the second I say that, this hot shame flares and my brain shoots into the worst-case reel — I'm stuck, clients bail, money dries up, I'm alone and my studio's empty. If that spikes, tell me exactly what to do for the next 30 seconds — keep repeating it, breathe, put my hand on my belly, or something concrete — otherwise I'll just panic and dive into another project to prove I'm not failing.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I am not stuck. I am not failing" triggered the shame and worst-case scenario again. I want to try something else. I'd like you to focus on the physical sensation of your hand on your belly, and bring your attention to the sensation of your hand touching your belly, without trying to change it or prevent it. Can you stay with that sensation, exactly as it is, and notice if it feels warmer, cooler, heavier, or lighter in any way?

Patient: My hand on my belly feels warm and a little heavy, like it's there but my breath is still shallow and tight. The moment I notice it the shame spikes and my brain instantly flips into the disaster reel—missed deadlines, clients gone, everything collapsing—so I can't really just stay with the sensation. If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do next—keep the hand, count, breathe differently, or get up—because I don't want to spiral and I can't figure it out on my own.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still really reactive to the shame and worst-case scenario. I want to try something else. I'd like you to try to bring your attention back to the sensation of the hand on your belly, and then I want you to make a tiny, tiny movement. Just one tiny movement, with your hand, without thinking about it, without trying to control it. Can you wiggle your fingers, or shift your hand slightly to the left, or just relax your hand a little bit?

Patient: Okay — I wiggled my fingers and shifted my hand a little to the left. It felt a tiny bit looser, but my chest's still tight and the shame's flaring, and my brain immediately ran the collapse reel—missed deadlines, clients gone, money tight, everyone drifting away. I'm really jittery and distracted; if it spikes, tell me exactly what to do for the next 30 seconds — keep the hand, count, breathe, or get up — because otherwise I'll just panic and dive into another project.

Therapist: It sounds like the small movement didn't provide the sense of safety you were hoping for. I want to try something else. I'd like you to try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the weight of your feet on the ground, the feeling of your feet connecting with the earth, without trying to change it or prevent it? Just notice that sensation, exactly as it is.

Patient: I tried to notice my feet on the ground but my brain instantly jumps to the collapse—rooting myself feels like being stuck, like I'll miss chances to hustle, and this hot shame spikes like I'm failing all over again, which makes me panic more (and my phone buzzed so I'm even more scattered). My feet feel heavy and kind of numb, but I can't hold the feeling without the disaster reel blasting louder. If it spikes, tell me exactly what you want me to do for the next 30 seconds—count, lift a foot, slow my breath, or get up—because otherwise I’ll just spiral into trying to work to drown it out.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is still really reactive to the shame and worst-case scenario. I want to try something else. I'd like you to try to let go of the idea that you need to control your emotions or thoughts. Can you try to imagine yourself letting go of the thought, the shame, and the worst-case scenario, not because you're trying to change it, but because it's simply not possible to hold onto it. Imagine letting go of it like you're releasing a balloon into the air, allowing it to float away, without trying to grab it back or control it.

Patient: I tried picturing the balloon drifting away, but the second I do my brain yells that I'm abandoning everything—missed deadlines, clients gone, money gone, friends gone—and I feel this hot shame like I've already failed. My chest clamps, my hands get jittery, and I'm really scattered and anxious. Tell me exactly what to do for the next 30 seconds—keep my hand on my belly, count, breathe, stand up? Because if I don't have concrete steps I know I'll just panic and dive into another project to prove I'm not failing.

Therapist: It sounds like picturing the balloon drifting away triggered the shame and worst-case scenario again. I want to try something else. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of the hand on your belly, and bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. I want you to try a small, tiny movement with your feet, just a tiny toe movement, without thinking about it, without trying to control it. Just a small, tiny movement, with your toe. Can you try that?

Patient: Alright—I nudged my toe a little, like a tiny wiggle. It loosened up for a second but then the shame shot through me and the disaster reel kicked back in—missed deadlines, clients gone—and I got jittery and distracted (my phone buzzed and I felt even more scattered). If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do for the next 30 seconds—keep the toe moving, count, breathe, stand up? I don't want to spiral and I can't figure out the next move on my own.

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny movement didn't provide the sense of safety you were hoping for. I want to try something else. I'd like you to try to focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just as it is, without trying to change it or control it. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in, and then notice the sensation of the air moving out? Just observe that sensation, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay—I’m trying. My breath is shallow and up in my chest, and the second I pay attention this hot shame flares like I’m failing at even breathing; my head immediately goes to the disaster reel—one slow breath becomes one missed minute, missed deadline, clients gone. I’m jittery and distracted (my phone keeps buzzing) and I’m really scared it’ll spiral. If it spikes, tell me exactly what to do for the next 30 seconds—count, keep my hand on my belly, slow the breath, or get up—because I don’t know how to stop it on my own.
