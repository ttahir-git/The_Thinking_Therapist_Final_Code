Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little mistake feels like proof I'm a failure. I did badly in school and that never really left me, even though I finally found my footing as a chef and people tell me I'm good at my job. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried talking about it before and it doesn't change how I feel — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those kinds of self-criticisms can be really tough to shake off. Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself thinking "I'm a failure" after a mistake, like what emotions come up for you in that moment?

Patient: It starts as shame — my chest tightens and I feel this hot wash of embarrassment, like I want to disappear. Then it turns into anxiety and numbness; I replay every mistake and either shut down or bury myself in work to prove I'm not worthless, which just makes me exhausted and snappy with people. I get stuck ruminating for hours and honestly, I don't see how talking about the feelings helps when it feels so automatic and physical — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be really overwhelming. It sounds like shame and anxiety have become deeply ingrained responses for you. Can you think of a situation where you might feel more connected to your values, like your passion for cooking and doing a good job, even when you make a mistake?

Patient: I guess sometimes when I'm training a new line cook or when a regular compliments a dish, I feel that quiet pride and remember why I do this. But the second I mess up the old "you're a failure" voice kicks in and wipes it out. I don't get how focusing on values would override that automatic shame — I've tried reminding myself of why I cook and it doesn't stick; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Those small moments of connection to your values are still there, but the self-criticism is strong enough to override them. It sounds like you're wondering how values-based practices can withstand the intensity of those automatic thoughts. What would it be like if, in the midst of that "you're a failure" voice, you simply acknowledged it, like a neutral observer watching the thoughts, without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: Honestly, when I try to "watch" the thought it just feels weird and distant, like I'm pretending — the shame still tightens my chest and everything gets loud. I've tried naming it—"that's shame"—but that only buys a couple breaths before I start replaying the mistake and berating myself for being weak. How is just observing supposed to help with that rush when the physical reaction takes over?

Therapist: It sounds like naming the emotion might have been a tiny step forward, but the shame is still overwhelming. Can you imagine trying a small experiment with that experience, where, instead of trying to change the thought or your emotional response, you simply observe the physical sensations in your body, like the tightening chest, and allow them to be there, without judgment or reaction, just for a few more breaths?

Patient: I can try to picture that, but honestly it just feels like bracing for the shame to hit. I can notice the tightness for a breath or two, but the replay and the "you're useless" voice snaps right back—especially in the middle of a shift when pausing feels impossible. How is that supposed to help when it doesn't change the heat or the panic?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to pause the cycle is hard, especially when you're in the midst of a busy shift. Can you think of a moment when, even if you couldn't completely stop the cycle, you still managed to keep going, despite the internal turmoil? What would that look like, and what would it feel like to keep showing up, even if you couldn't completely manage the shame and anxiety?

Patient: There was one dinner rush last month where a sauce broke and my chest just slammed shut, but I forced myself to finish the tickets, apologized to the server, remade it, and kept plating. After it was over I felt exhausted and shaky, but also a tiny flicker of pride that I didn't bail on the line. Still, that feeling evaporates pretty quick and the "you're a failure" voice comes back full force—how is that supposed to help if it doesn't actually stick?

Therapist: You're acknowledging the flicker of pride, and that's a start. It's clear that this small victory is not enough to overcome the shame, but it's a step. What would it be like if, instead of trying to make it last, you simply acknowledged that tiny spark of pride in the moment, and then brought it back to the present, without trying to hold onto it or use it as a reward?

Patient: I can try to notice it, but calling out that tiny pride always feels fragile — like I'm daring it to vanish. Naming it gives me a beat of relief, then the shame comes back louder and I end up feeling like I'm just fooling myself. How is that supposed to help when it doesn't actually stop the replay or the panic in the middle of a shift?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to name and acknowledge your pride feels like a fragile balancing act, and that shame is waiting to swoop in and undo it. Can you think of a way to approach this, not as a fragile balancing act, but more like a gentle, unfolding process – where you simply allow the experience to be what it is, without trying to control the outcome or prove anything to yourself?

Patient: Maybe. I can see how letting it be might be less exhausting than constantly trying to shove it away, so maybe a tiny step — one breath to feel the tightness, name it, then get back to the line — could be doable. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the shame still makes me overwork and replay everything afterward?

Therapist: You're considering a small step, which is great. Now, let's explore what might happen if, instead of trying to get rid of the shame and the replaying, you simply brought your attention to the physical sensations and your thoughts as they are, in the present moment, without trying to change or react to them. Can you try that – just notice the sensations, the thoughts, without trying to push them away or use them as fuel for your work?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to just notice the tightness and the thoughts without reacting? I tried that before and it just feels like bracing: I can do a breath or two on the line, but the shame snaps back and I replay everything or bury myself in work. How is that supposed to help when it never actually sticks and I just end up exhausted and snappy afterward?

Therapist: It sounds like the "noticing" part feels like a setup for the shame to come back, like a small wall that's waiting to be breached. Instead of focusing on what happens when you try to react or push it away, what if we looked at what happens when you're not trying to do anything at all – just being present with the sensations and thoughts as they are, without a goal or a plan?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—so you mean don't do anything, just notice the tight chest and the "you're a failure" thoughts? When I try that it feels like bracing and then the shame just gets louder, and afterward I still replay everything or throw myself into work; it doesn't change the panic in the moment. Maybe it could make me less worn-out if it actually worked, but I'm skeptical—can you give a concrete example of what "just noticing" would look like during a twenty-minute dinner rush?

Therapist: Let me try to simplify it. During a busy dinner rush, you're expediting food, taking orders, and chatting with customers. Can you imagine being at the pass, taking a deep breath, and simply being with the sensations in your body, without trying to change or react to the "you're a failure" thought that comes up for you? You might notice your hands holding the knife, the noise of the kitchen, the smell of the food – just being present with those sensations, without trying to do anything with them, for just one breath?

Patient: I can picture it — at the pass, take a breath, notice the heat, the clatter, the tightness in my chest for a second. But honestly, in a twenty-minute rush that one breath feels useless; the shame snaps back like a reflex before I can even finish the plate. How is that supposed to help when it just gives me a beat and then I go right back to replaying everything and overworking myself?

Therapist: It sounds like the brief moment of noticing is getting lost in the chaos of the kitchen. Let's try a slight adjustment. Can you imagine the breath as a tiny anchor, not just to the sensations, but also to the present moment, in a way that allows you to be with your thoughts, like the "you're a failure" thought, without trying to push them away or change them, but simply being with them as they are?

Patient: I can picture the breath as an anchor, but it still feels flimsy — like one breath won't stop the reflex. In a rush it's more like I'm just holding my breath, waiting for the shame to snap back and the replay to start. How is that actually supposed to help when the panic and overworking kick in right after?

Therapist: It sounds like the breath is more of a coping mechanism to get through the immediate moment, rather than a way to fundamentally change the experience. Let's try to shift the focus a bit. Instead of trying to stop the shame or the replay, what if we looked at what would happen if you simply allowed the shame and the replay to be present, without judgment or reaction, and what would be the experience of being with those sensations as they are?

Patient: Okay... so you mean just let the shame and the replay be there without trying to fix or shove them away? When I try that it feels like watching a train wreck—my chest tightens, the thoughts get louder, and afterward I'm still wired and wiped out. I don't really see how "being with it" breaks that automatic loop; maybe it would make me a bit less exhausted, but I'm skeptical—what would actually change in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're still trying to stop the shame and replay, but being with them as they are might not be what you're looking for. Let's explore what might happen if you simply allowed the experience to be what it is, without trying to change it. What if, instead of trying to stop the shame or the replay, you looked at what's possible for you right in this moment, when the shame and replay are present? What would it be like to be in a place where you're not trying to fix anything, but simply being with the sensations and thoughts as they are?

Patient: I guess it would feel like watching the shame pass through without me trying to shove it away — kind of flat and winded, like I'm letting it happen but still getting slammed by it afterwards. Maybe it would give a tiny breathing space, but honestly it just feels like postponing the replay and the overworking that comes after. How is that actually supposed to help me during a busy shift when I can't pause for long and the shame hijacks everything? Can you give a concrete, step-by-step example of what to do in the middle of a twenty-minute rush?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to carve out a tiny moment of space, but it's still being hijacked by the shame. I'd like to try a different approach. Can you imagine being at the pass, and instead of trying to notice the shame, you're simply observing the sensation of your body, like the feeling of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sound of the kitchen in the background?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — noticing my feet on the tile, the heat on my forearms, the clatter in the kitchen — it gives a tiny beat where I'm not spiraling. But that beat's fragile; the "you're a failure" voice still rushes back and I end up replaying everything or burying myself in work. How is paying attention to my feet or the air actually supposed to stop the replay and the guilt afterward?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is providing a small window of calm, but it's still not enough to overcome the shame. Let's try to introduce a small shift in language. Instead of trying to "stop" the shame or "get rid of" the replay, what if we looked at the "you're a failure" thought as a thought, a mere thought, without judgment or reaction? Can you try to simply acknowledge it, without trying to do anything with it, as you notice your feet on the tile and the heat on your forearms?

Patient: I can try, but when I tell myself "that's just a thought" it just sounds fake—shame's still there and the replay starts again. How is labeling it actually supposed to stop me from spiraling and overworking afterward? If you want this to work in a twenty-minute rush, tell me exactly what words or moves I should use so it doesn't just bounce back.

Therapist: It sounds like labeling the thought is not enough to break the cycle. Can I try to rephrase it in a different way? Instead of saying "that's just a thought", what if we use a more neutral phrase, like "the thought of 'I'm a failure' is here"? This way, we're not making a value judgment or trying to change the thought, we're simply acknowledging its presence. Would you be willing to try that during the rush?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try saying "the thought of 'I'm a failure' is here," but honestly that already sounds hollow — how is that supposed to help when the shame comes back louder? If you want me to actually use it on the line, give me the exact words and tell me when to say them (while plating? between tickets?), and what to do if it doesn’t work.

Therapist: I apologize for the previous suggestion. Let's try a more specific approach. During a busy service, when the "you're a failure" thought arises, I want you to say to yourself, "this thought is here". Say it to yourself, looking at the plate in front of you, and as you say it, pause for a brief moment. Then, take a small action, like putting a garnish on the plate or taking a sip of water. This tiny action creates a small pause, and allows you to create some space between the thought and your reaction. If the shame comes back, take a deep breath and say "this thought is here" again, pausing for a brief moment, and then take a small action. What do you think?

Patient: I can try that — saying "this thought is here" and doing a tiny action like a garnish or a sip. But be concrete: do I say it while I'm plating, between tickets, or only if I feel the panic spike? And if it doesn't actually slow the shame and I still replay everything after service, how is that supposed to help change the replay instead of just giving me a beat that disappears?

Therapist: Let's refine the timing. I want you to say "this thought is here" just as the shame is starting to rise, before you react or try to do anything. So, try to say it as soon as you notice the shame starting to come up, like a beat before the panic sets in. For example, as you're about to start plating a dish, or just before you take a customer's order. As for the second part, I understand your concern. If saying "this thought is here" doesn't slow down the replay, we may need to explore other approaches. Can I ask, what do you think might happen if, instead of trying to stop the replay, we explored what would happen if you simply allowed the replay to run its course, without trying to change it or stop it?

Patient: If I just let it run, I think I'd feel like I'm watching myself unravel — the shame will still flood in, I’ll replay things longer, and afterward I’ll be wired and end up overworking to prove I’m not useless. Maybe, theoretically, it could make the reactions less frantic over time, but I'm skeptical — how is that supposed to help when it just feels like being paralyzed in the middle of service?

Therapist: It sounds like letting the replay run its course might lead to more emotional overwhelm, rather than a sense of calm. Let's take a step back. What if, instead of trying to stop the replay or let it run its course, we focused on what you can do in the present moment, right now, to maintain your ability to serve and care for your customers? What are the essential things you need to do to keep moving forward, even if the shame and replay are still present?

Patient: I guess the essentials are pretty basic: keep the plates moving — finish the tickets and don’t cut corners on safety or timing, ask a line cook for help if you need it, and focus on one concrete task at a time (the next plate, the next order). Do a tiny grounding move when the shame hits — one breath, say “this thought is here,” then do a small action (garnish, sip water) to create a beat. Try to leave the replay for after service instead of trying to solve it on the line. But honestly, I’m tired of these strategies sounding neat on paper and not changing how wrecked I feel afterward — how is this actually supposed to stop me from overworking and stewing about it later?

Therapist: It sounds like we've identified some essential tasks that help you maintain a sense of control and focus during the service. Let's explore what's missing. What if, instead of trying to solve the shame and replay on the line, we looked at what would happen if you simply allowed yourself to show up as a server, without judgment or expectations, even when the shame and replay are present? What would it feel like to be present, to care for your customers, to plate the food, and to take the orders, without trying to change or fix the thoughts that are arising?

Patient: I guess it would feel weird — like I'm moving through the motions with a dull ache under everything, doing the job but not trying to fix myself in the middle of it. Maybe it would stop me from panicking right then, but afterward I still stew and overwork to prove I didn't mess up. How is that supposed to help long-term if the replay just comes back after service? Can you give me a concrete 20–30 second script or exact moves to use on the line so it doesn't just bounce back afterward?

Therapist: I think we're getting close. Instead of trying to find a magic script or moves, let's focus on the essence of what you need to feel more grounded and present. Here's a suggestion: when the shame and replay start to rise, pause for a brief moment (about 5-10 seconds), take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here." Repeat this phrase 2-3 times, allowing the words to become a gentle, steady beat. As you do this, focus on your breath, the sensation of your feet on the floor, and the task at hand. What do you think about this approach?

Patient: I mean, I can try it — saying "I'm here" a few times while breathing — but it already sounds a bit...uncertain. How is that supposed to help when the replay still rips me apart after service? Do I say it out loud or just in my head, exactly when — while plating, between tickets, or only if I feel the spike? And if it doesn't stop the rumination afterward, what then? I'm tired of neat-sounding strategies that don't change how wrecked I feel later.

Therapist: I apologize for any uncertainty. Let's try to simplify and anchor the phrase "I'm here" to a specific, concrete moment. Try saying it only when you feel the shame and replay start to spike, right as you're about to take a customer's order or hand them their food. Say it out loud, with conviction and calmness, and repeat it once or twice. As you say it, take a deep breath in and out, and focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor. For now, let's set aside the question of whether it will stop the replay afterward. Can you try this approach for a few more services and see how it goes?

Patient: Alright — I’ll give it a few services, but I’m not convinced it’ll do much. Quick question: saying “I’m here” out loud in the middle of service feels awkward — should I whisper it under my breath or is it okay if other cooks hear? Also, what exactly should I watch for afterward to tell if it’s helping, and if it doesn’t cut the post-shift rumination, what’s the next plan? I don’t want to come away feeling more exposed and still wrecked.

Therapist: Saying "I'm here" out loud might be too loud, but whispering it to yourself under your breath could work. It's more discreet and allows you to maintain a sense of normalcy on the line. As for watching for its effectiveness, pay attention to how you feel after service. Notice if you're able to step away from the replay and self-criticism, or if you're still replaying everything in your mind. If it doesn't seem to be making a difference, we can explore other options. One possibility is to examine what's driving the replay and self-criticism. What do you think is the underlying fear or need that's leading you to replay the experience so intensely?

Patient: I guess it's this underlying fear that a mistake means I'm fundamentally inadequate — school screwed that into me and my family keeps feeding it. What I actually want is to feel competent and accepted, not constantly having to prove I'm not useless, and some sense of safety/control so shame doesn't hijack me. But honestly, how is naming that supposed to stop the replay when it hits me on the line?

Therapist: It sounds like there's a deep-seated fear and need for self-validation at play. Naming that fear can be a helpful step, but it might not directly stop the replay. Let's try to connect the dots. What if, instead of trying to stop the replay, we explored ways to bring in a sense of safety and control in the moment? What would that feel like, and how might it help you stay present on the line, even when the shame and replay arise?

Patient: I guess feeling safer would be like a small steadying in my body — less of that chest-clench, my hands not trembling, and being able to focus on the next plate instead of looping the mistake. In theory that would narrow my attention to the work and give me steps to follow when things go wrong, so the mistake feels like something fixable instead of proof I'm useless. But I’m skeptical — it sounds neat on paper; I need concrete, doable moves (a pre-shift checklist, an “if I mess up” script, a quick grounding routine I can actually use during a rush) and a plan for what to do if I’m still replaying it after service. I’m already kind of drained just thinking about making all this stick, so if you want it to work, give me the exact sequence I should use on the line.

Therapist: Let's break it down into concrete, doable steps. Here's a possible approach:

Before service, take a minute to do a brief self-compassionate check-in: "I am here, I am safe, I am enough." Repeat this phrase 2-3 times, allowing the words to sink in.

As you start service, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I am in control of my next step." Repeat this phrase as you begin to plate each dish, focusing on the task at hand.

If you feel the shame and replay starting to rise, pause for a brief moment (about 5-10 seconds) and say to yourself, "I am here, I am safe, I am enough." Repeat this phrase 2-3 times, allowing the words to become a gentle, steady beat.

If the shame and replay continue, take a moment to focus on your physical body: notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the plates in your hands, or the sound of the kitchen around you. Bring your attention to one of these sensations, without trying to change or react to the shame.

As you're finishing up service, take a moment to acknowledge that you've done your best, and that it's okay to make mistakes. You can say to yourself, "I did my best, and that's enough."

After service, take a few minutes to write down one thing you're proud of accomplishing, no matter how small it seems. This can be as simple as "I plated 10 dishes without dropping one" or "I had a great conversation with a customer." Focus on the positive, and try to let go of any negative self-talk.

What do you think about this sequence? Is there anything you'd like to add, change, or modify?

Patient: Okay...this is more concrete, which I actually appreciate, but it still feels like a lot to remember when I'm already fried. I'd shrink it: pre-shift—30 seconds, say (silently or whisper) "I am here" twice while breathing; on the line—when shame spikes, one breath, whisper "this thought is here," then immediately do one tiny, practical move (put on garnish, hand the plate off, or take one sip of water); after service—no long journaling, just a 20–30 second voice memo or tell one person one small win. I'll try that for a week, but I'm skeptical it will stop the replay—if it doesn't, what's the next concrete step we switch to (and how do I handle my family kicking this up afterward)?
