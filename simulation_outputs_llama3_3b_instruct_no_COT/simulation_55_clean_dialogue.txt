Patient: Lately I've been avoiding gatherings because social settings trigger this intense anxiety that tightens my chest. My mind turns into a fortune-telling machine predicting the worst — I can see myself saying something stupid, everyone laughing, my ex showing up and making a scene, and then I'm completely ostracized. As a data scientist I know the odds of all that lining up are tiny, but I can't stop running those disastrous scenarios like they're inevitable. It's gotten really isolating and I don't know what to do.

Therapist: Those predictions can be really overwhelming. It sounds like you're trying to prevent something bad from happening, rather than focusing on what you'd like to experience in a social setting. Can you tell me more about what would happen if you weren't trying to prevent all those worst-case scenarios? What would you be experiencing instead?

Patient: I guess if I weren't trying to prevent all that, I'd try to be present and maybe enjoy some small conversations. But as soon as I let my guard down I can already hear myself saying something awkward, everyone laughing, my ex showing up to gloat, and then I'm cut off from the group forever — it's like a scripted catastrophe I'm stuck watching. I know that sounds extreme and probably unrealistic, but I can't help clinging to those outcomes, and it's exhausting.

Therapist: Those thoughts can be really vivid and immersive. It sounds like your mind is stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking. I'd like to explore this a bit more. What would it be like for you if, instead of being consumed by those thoughts, you could just allow yourself to experience the present moment, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: I can picture what calmer would feel like—small talk, noticing details, maybe even laughing at a joke—but the moment I let my guard down I see the whole chain: I say one awkward thing, someone laughs, my ex storms in and starts a scene, people take sides, my friends drift away, and I'm left embarrassed and alone. I know rationally that's unlikely, but when I try to stay present my mind insists that letting go is the exact moment everything collapses, so 'being present' just feels like walking into a trap.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a paradox - you want to be present, but your mind is convinced that letting go of those thoughts will lead to disaster. Can you think of a time when you've felt fully present and engaged in a social setting, without the anxiety and catastrophic thinking? What were you doing, and what was it about that experience that felt so different from your typical anxious interactions?

Patient: Yeah — there was this one small dinner with a couple of close colleagues where I actually felt present: I listened, told a little story, and laughed without my chest tightening. But even then my brain started narrating the disaster — someone would sneer at my story, my ex would burst in and accuse me of things, someone would record it and it would go viral, and I'd lose my friends and my job — and honestly, those outcomes feel inevitable to me even when the night is going well. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I can't seem to make the calmer memory stick without the whole catastrophe replaying over it.

Therapist: It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, even when things seem to be going well. That can be really frustrating. I want to ask: What's the value for you in being able to have a social interaction where you feel present and engaged, without the catastrophic thoughts? What would having that ability to be fully present and enjoy yourself in social situations mean to you?

Patient: It would mean a lot — less loneliness, being able to laugh with friends without replaying every awkward moment, and maybe even feeling like myself again so I could focus at work and stop hiding. I want that freedom from constant dread, to rebuild connections with friends and family and not let one breakup define me. But the second I imagine letting go I see the whole collapse — I enjoy the night, my ex shows up, people record me, my reputation and friendships get shredded — so even though I want it, my brain treats it like a trap I can't trust.

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving a sense of identity and self-confidence that's been lost in the aftermath of your breakup. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the perceived risks of being vulnerable. I'd like to explore that a bit more: What would you do with your life, with your relationships, and with yourself, if you weren't trying to hold onto that fear of being hurt or embarrassed? What values or aspects of yourself would you be able to express and connect with, if you weren't weighed down by the anxiety of catastrophic thinking?

Patient: If I weren't clutching that fear, I'd reach back out to friends and family, go to more meetups, maybe mentor younger folks at work, and even try dating again — basically live like I used to instead of hiding. But the second I picture that, my head scripts the disaster: I say one dumb thing, someone records it, my ex shows up to accuse me, it goes viral, I lose my job and everyone abandons me. I get what you're asking, but dismissing that chain as 'unlikely' feels unrealistic to me — I'm tired of the loop and I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It's like your brain is caught in a loop of hypothetical scenarios, and even imagining a more hopeful future feels like a trap. I'd like to gently point out that it's not about dismissing the possibility of those outcomes, but rather about exploring what would be possible if you didn't let those thoughts rule your behavior. Can you think of a small, tiny step you could take in the next few days to move closer to your goal of reconnecting with others, without letting your catastrophic thinking get in the way?

Patient: Maybe I could text one close friend and ask to grab a quick 20-minute coffee — something low-stakes I could leave early if it gets uncomfortable. But the second I picture sending it I see myself stumbling over words, someone recording it, my ex showing up to shame me, that text getting shared, and everyone turning on me, so I don't trust that plan and honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to take a small step, but your brain is already conjuring up worst-case scenarios before you even take the step. I'd like to suggest a different approach: instead of focusing on the potential for catastrophe, what if you were to simply focus on the desire to connect with your friend, and the simple act of sending a text? What would it feel like to take that small action, without the weight of the hypothetical outcomes?

Patient: Maybe, for a beat, it would feel like a tiny relief — just cracking the door open and not committing to anything. But the second I imagine hitting send my brain spins the whole catastrophe: a typo, someone forwards it to my ex, they show up, someone records the scene, it goes viral, I get humiliated and maybe even lose my job — so I can't take that as a "small" action; it feels like stepping off a cliff. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm stuck and unsure how to make that step without expecting disaster.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is trying to protect you from the perceived risks, but that's not allowing you to take any action at all. I'd like to propose an experiment: instead of trying to overcome the catastrophic thinking, what if you were to simply observe it, without judgment? Notice when the thoughts arise, and allow them to be what they are - thoughts. Can you give me an example of when that happens, and how you'd like to observe it differently?

Patient: Like yesterday when I was about to send that coffee text — my chest tightened and the fortune-teller voice kicked in: “You’ll typo, someone will forward it to your ex, they’ll show up, someone’ll film the scene and it’ll go viral,” and I’m already spiraling through that whole chain. Ideally I’d like to notice that cascade as just a thought—label it “catastrophe story,” take a breath, feel my feet on the floor, and let it pass without buying into it. But honestly I keep feeling like that’s naive and dangerous—ignoring it feels like sitting on a bomb, and I’m frustrated and exhausted that simply observing doesn’t calm the certainty for me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the need to observe your catastrophic thoughts without judgment, but you're still feeling uncertain about how to do that. I'd like to ask: What would it be like for you, in that moment, if you didn't try to prevent the catastrophic outcome, but simply allowed the story to pass through your mind, like a cloud drifting by? What would happen to your body, your breath, your thoughts, if you didn't try to intervene?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow, like I'm bracing for impact instead of letting anything pass. The fortune-teller voice just accelerates — I see the whole smear: people filming, my friends choosing sides, my life unraveling — and those images keep looping so nothing drifts away. It leaves me jittery and frozen, thinking the only sensible move is to cancel the plan or not send the message, because "letting it pass" feels exactly like waiting for the disaster to hit.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to the anticipated disaster as if it's already happening. I'd like to explore this further: What would it be like if you were to take a tiny, tiny step towards your original intention - sending the coffee text - and simply allowed yourself to be with the uncertainty, without trying to prevent or prepare for the worst? What would happen to your body, your thoughts, your breath, if you didn't try to control the outcome?

Patient: If I don't try to control it my body goes straight into alarm—heart pounding, hands trembling, breath shallow and jerky, and I feel jumpy like I'm waiting for something to go wrong. The fortune-teller voice doesn't quiet; it just speeds up: I hit send, typo, someone forwards it to my ex, they storm in, people record it, it goes viral, I get humiliated and maybe even fired. I know you want me to sit with the uncertainty, but right now that feels like standing on the edge of a cliff and being told to relax—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to the anticipated disaster as if it's already happening, and trying to slow down might feel like taking a huge risk. I'd like to try something different: Instead of focusing on controlling the outcome or trying to slow down, let's try to focus on your breath, and the sensation of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the feeling of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change anything?

Patient: I'm trying, but my feet feel like they're floating and my heart's pounding so hard it's hard to focus. When I notice the breath it goes shallow and the fortune-teller voice floods in—"they'll film you, they'll send it to your ex"—and I can't keep it as just a thought. I can feel the air, but it's like I'm bracing for impact, not actually breathing. Can we slow down—maybe you guide me through a few breaths or count? I need something concrete because just "notice" feels impossible right now.

Therapist: I'm here to support you. Let's try a simple, concrete exercise. I'll guide you through a series of 4-6 deep, slow breaths. Just focus on your breath, and I'll count. 

1... inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your diaphragm expand... hold... 1... exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your body release... hold... 2... inhale... hold... 1... exhale... hold... 2...

Patient: I tried to follow, but my chest’s still tight and the breaths stay shallow — it’s like I’m pretending to breathe. The fortune-teller voice is blaring the whole chain — I hit send, typo, someone forwards it to my ex, they storm in, people film it, it goes viral, I get humiliated and maybe even fired — that shame just flashes and makes me feel like a fool. Counting isn’t cutting it; can you go slower, maybe guide me through longer exhales or do a grounding exercise where I name a few things I can see or touch? I need something concrete because this isn’t calming right now.

Therapist: It can be really challenging to calm down when the catastrophic thoughts are loud. Let's try a different approach. I'd like to guide you through a grounding exercise. I want you to notice 5 things that you can see in this room right now. Can you look around and notice the colors, shapes, and textures of the objects around you? Start with something simple, like the chair you're sitting on, the wall behind me, or the papers on my desk. Just notice it, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I can see the scuffed wooden chair I'm sitting on, a beige lamp with a square shade, a chipped blue mug on the side table, a spiral notepad with messy notes, and a faded wool sweater draped over the back of the chair. But even as I name them, that fortune-teller voice cuts in and I get this hot shame that snaps my attention back to the worst-case script, so I keep losing the thread. Can you guide me more slowly — like tell me to touch each thing or count as I look — because I don't trust myself to stay grounded right now.

Therapist: It can be really tough to shift gears and stay grounded when the catastrophic thoughts are so loud. Let's try to anchor ourselves to the physical sensations in your body. I'd like you to slowly bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just notice the weight of your feet touching the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the feeling of your feet being connected to the earth. As you breathe in, say to yourself: "My feet are touching the ground." And as you exhale, say: "My feet are still touching the ground." Let's do this a few times together.

Patient: I'm trying, but my chest's still tight and the fortune-teller voice is screaming the whole disaster — I can already see myself humiliated and fired — and this hot shame just washed over me so I feel like a fool. Saying "my feet are touching the ground" doesn't quiet it; it actually makes the worst‑case scenes speed up. Can we slow down? Tell me exactly what to do — press my feet down, count with me, guide the exhales — I need something concrete.

Therapist: It sounds like we need to go back to the grounding exercise. Let's start with something even more concrete. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and I want you to press your feet down into the ground, as if you're pressing them into the earth. As you do this, say to yourself: "I am pressing my feet down into the ground." Now, I want you to count slowly with me: 1... press down... 2... press down... 3... press down... 4... press down... 5... press down. As you press down, I want you to feel the weight of your feet on the ground. When you're ready, slowly exhale and say to yourself: "I am letting go." Can you do that with me?

Patient: Okay—I pressed my feet down like you said and counted along: 1…2…3…4…5, and I let out a slow exhale saying “I am letting go.” It helped a tiny bit—I felt a little more anchored—but my chest is still tight and the fortune-teller voice just got louder, replaying that humiliation/firing script and this hot shame like I’ve failed before. I don’t feel calm yet—can you slow it down more, tell me exactly how hard to press or guide a longer exhale, or give me another concrete movement (like clenching and releasing my hands) because right now I’m still stuck and embarrassed.

Therapist: It's like the grounding exercise helped a bit, but the catastrophic thoughts are still persistent. Let's try another concrete movement to help you feel more grounded. I want you to clench your hands into fists, like you're holding small rocks. As you clench your fists, say to yourself: "I am holding my hands." Then, slowly release your grip, and as you do, say to yourself: "I am releasing." Repeat this process a few times: clench... hold... release... clench... hold... release... clench... hold... release... 

As you're doing this, I want you to focus on the physical sensation of your hands and the sound of your own voice. Try to let go of any judgment or self-criticism, and simply observe what's happening in your body and mind. 

Also, I want you to notice that the fortune-teller voice is still loud, but it's not in control of your body. You are. You are the one who can choose to let go of these thoughts and focus on your breath, your body, and your hands.

Patient: Okay — I did the clench/hold/release three times like you said. My hands felt a little looser for a beat, but the fortune-teller voice just screamed the humiliation/firing script and this hot shame snapped me right back — like that one past failure is on replay and I feel like an idiot. Saying “you’re in control” sounds reasonable, but my body doesn’t buy it; I can’t stop picturing everyone turning on me. Can we slow down and do something even more concrete — like you count longer exhales (e.g., inhale 4, exhale 8) or tell me exactly how hard to tense my shoulders and when to drop them? I need step-by-step stuff, not pep talk.

Therapist: It's like the grounding exercise and the clenching and releasing didn't stick. Let's try a more concrete, step-by-step approach. I want you to focus on your shoulders. I want you to tense them up, like you're pulling your shoulders back and up towards your ears. Hold that tension for a count of 4. Then, slowly release the tension, and let your shoulders drop down and relax. As you release, say to yourself: "My shoulders are relaxed." 

Now, I want you to focus on your chest. I want you to tense it up, like you're drawing your chest in towards your spine. Hold that tension for a count of 8. Then, slowly release the tension, and let your chest expand outward and relax. As you release, say to yourself: "My chest is relaxed." 

Let's do this a few times: tense up... hold... release... tense up... hold... release... tense up... hold... release... 

As you're doing this, I want you to focus on the physical sensations in your body, and the sound of your own voice. Try to let go of any thoughts or feelings that come up, and simply observe what's happening in the present moment.

Patient: I did the shoulder and chest tensing like you said—held, released—but my chest is still tight and that fortune‑teller voice just screamed the whole humiliation/firing script again, and this hot shame makes me feel like an idiot. It helped a tiny bit, but I’m still stuck and jittery. Can you slow it way down and guide me—like inhale 4, exhale 8, tell me exactly how hard to pull my shoulders and when to drop them—step‑by‑step, please?

Therapist: It's like the tensing and relaxing didn't stick. Let's try an even slower and more precise approach. I want you to start with your breath. Inhale for a count of 4, filling your lungs completely. Hold your breath for a count of 4. Then, exhale for a count of 8, allowing your body to relax and release any tension. 

As you exhale, I want you to tense your shoulders up towards your ears. Pull them up and back, like you're squeezing them into a tight ball. Hold that tension for a count of 4. 

Now, slowly release the tension in your shoulders, letting them drop down and relax. Feel the weight of your shoulders release, and your chest expand outward and relax. As you release, say to yourself: "My shoulders are relaxed."

Let's do this again: inhale... hold... exhale... tense... hold... exhale... tense... hold... exhale... tense... hold... exhale... 

As you're doing this, I want you to focus on the physical sensations in your body, and the sound of your own voice. Try to let go of any thoughts or feelings that come up, and simply observe what's happening in the present moment.

Patient: I tried the inhale-4, hold-4, exhale-8 with the shoulder pulls exactly like you said, and I did the slow holds, but my chest is still tight and that fortune-teller voice just screamed the humiliation/firing scene again. The shame from that one mess-up keeps flashing and makes me feel like an idiot, so "just notice" doesn't stick. Can you go **much** slower and literally talk me through it in real time—say "inhale now" and count each second, tell me exactly how hard to pull my shoulders ("just a little" or "as hard as you can"), and stretch the exhales out so I can match you (count 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8)? I need you to keep narrating each micro-step because otherwise I lose it.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath. Inhale now, slowly and deeply into your lungs, filling them completely. I want you to breathe in for a count of 4: 1... 2... 3... 4... 

As you inhale, I want you to keep your shoulders relaxed and soft. Just feel the breath moving in, without tensing up.

Now, hold your breath for a count of 4: 1... 2... 3... 4... 

While you're holding your breath, I want you to prepare your shoulders to tense up. Just a little, just a tiny bit, pull them up towards your ears. Don't strain or force it, just a gentle, subtle pull. 

Now, exhale slowly, counting out: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release, feeling the weight of them dropping down and relaxing. Allow your chest to expand and feel the relaxation spread through your body. 

Now, hold that relaxation for a count of 4: 1... 2... 3... 4... 

While you're holding the relaxation, I want you to prepare your shoulders to tense up again. This time, I want you to pull them up a bit harder, as hard as you can. Just focus on the sensation of your shoulders pulling up, without worrying about how you look or what others might think.

Now, exhale slowly, counting out: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release again, feeling the relaxation spread through your body.

Let's do it again, slowly and deliberately: inhale now, for a count of 4... 1... 2... 3... 4... 

(Note: I'll keep guiding you through each step, and we'll keep going until we reach a point where you feel more grounded and calm.)

Patient: Okay... I'm inhaling now but my chest feels like a brick and I'm jittery. Count each second out loud for me — say "inhale 1...2...3...4," tell me exactly how hard to pull my shoulders ("just a little" or "as hard as you can"), count the hold, and stretch the exhale so I can match you. I can already feel that fortune‑teller voice screaming the humiliation/firing chain and this hot shame, so please keep narrating every micro‑step and don't rush — I need that.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath.

Inhale now, slowly and deeply into your lungs... inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... 

As you inhale, I want you to keep your shoulders relaxed and soft. Just feel the breath moving in, without tensing up.

Now, hold your breath for a count of 4: hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... 

While you're holding your breath, I want you to prepare your shoulders to tense up. Just a little, just a tiny bit, pull them up towards your ears. Don't strain or force it, just a gentle, subtle pull. Your shoulders are just slightly elevated, but not straining. Just a tiny bit.

Now, exhale slowly, counting out: exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release, feeling the weight of them dropping down and relaxing. Allow your chest to expand and feel the relaxation spread through your body. You can feel your shoulders relaxing, your chest expanding, and your breath moving out.

Now, hold that relaxation for a count of 4: hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... 

While you're holding the relaxation, I want you to prepare your shoulders to tense up again. This time, I want you to pull them up a bit harder, just a tiny bit more than before. Your shoulders are still slightly elevated, but you're pulling them up a bit more now. 

Now, exhale slowly, counting out: exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release again, feeling the relaxation spread through your body. You're doing great, keep going.

Let's do it again, slowly and deliberately: inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... 

(Note: I'll keep guiding you through each step, and we'll keep going until we reach a point where you feel more grounded and calm

Patient: Okay — I’m inhaling but my chest feels like a brick and I’m jittery. The fortune‑teller voice is already screaming the humiliation/firing chain and that hot shame from that one mess‑up keeps flashing, so please keep narrating every second and tell me exactly how hard to pull my shoulders ("just a little" or "as hard as you can") and count each beat out loud. If you speed up or stop narrating I’ll lose it — go very slow and keep guiding me through each inhale/hold/exhale.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up. Just a little, just a tiny bit, pull them up towards your ears. Don't strain or force it, just a gentle, subtle pull. Your shoulders are just slightly elevated, but not straining. Just a tiny bit.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up. As hard as you can, pull them up towards your ears. Don't hold back, just give it a little more tension. Your shoulders are now slightly elevated, but still not straining.

Exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release, feeling the weight of them dropping down and relaxing. Allow your chest to expand and feel the relaxation spread through your body. You can feel your shoulders releasing, your chest expanding, and your breath moving out.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up again. This time, I want you to pull them up a bit harder, just a tiny bit more than before. As hard as you can, pull them up towards your ears. Don't hold back, just give it a little more tension. Your shoulders are now slightly elevated, but still not straining.

Exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale

Patient: I’m trying to follow — exhaling with you now — but my chest is still like a brick and that hot shame keeps stabbing through me, replaying that humiliation and the fortune‑teller voice is yelling the whole viral/fired chain. Please keep narrating every second — tell me “inhale 1…2…3…4,” “hold 1…2…3…4,” “exhale 1…2……8,” and exactly how hard to pull my shoulders (“just a little” or “as hard as you can”) because if you pause I lose it. Can we slow down even more and add pressing my feet into the floor for a count after this exhale so I have something solid to hang onto?

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up. Just a little, just a tiny bit, pull them up towards your ears. Don't strain or force it, just a gentle, subtle pull. Your shoulders are just slightly elevated, but not straining. Just a tiny bit.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up. As hard as you can, pull them up towards your ears. Don't hold back, just give it a little more tension. Your shoulders are now slightly elevated, but still not straining.

Exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... 

As you exhale, I want you to let your shoulders release, feeling the weight of them dropping down and relaxing. Allow your chest to expand and feel the relaxation spread through your body. You can feel your shoulders releasing, your chest expanding, and your breath moving out.

Press your feet into the floor, feeling the weight of your body grounding into the earth. You can feel your feet pressing into the floor, and your body stabilizing. 

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to tense up again. This time, I want you to pull them up a bit harder, just a tiny bit more than before. As hard as you can, pull them up towards your ears. Don't hold back, just give it a little more tension. Your shoulders are now slightly elevated,

Patient: Okay — I did as you said: pulled my shoulders up as hard as I could, pressed my feet into the floor, held, and exhaled — but my chest is still like a brick and that fortune‑teller voice is screaming the humiliation/firing scene again. That hot shame from that screw‑up keeps stabbing through and makes me feel like an idiot, so I’m jittery and desperate for you to keep narrating every second. Please — say “inhale 1…2…3…4,” tell me exactly how hard to press my feet (“firmly” or “just a little”), count the holds, stretch the exhales out, and don’t pause, because if you stop I’ll spiral; can we slow the counts and add one more concrete action (like clench/release my jaw) after the next exhale?

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still tense, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still tense, but I want you to prepare them to release. Just a little, just a tiny bit, release the tension in your shoulders. Don't force it, just let go. Your shoulders are starting to relax.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any remaining tension in your shoulders.

Press your feet firmly into the floor, feeling the weight of your body grounding into the earth. Your feet are pressing into the floor, and your body is stabilizing.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to release again. This time, I want you to let them go completely. Release the tension in your shoulders, and allow them to drop down and relax. As you release, you can feel your shoulders releasing, your chest expanding, and your breath moving out.

Exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... exhale 9... exhale 10... exhale 11... exhale 12... exhale 13... exhale 14... exhale 15... exhale 16... exhale 17... exhale 18... exhale 19... exhale 20... exhale 21... exhale 22... exhale 23... exhale 24...

As you exhale, I want you to clench your jaw, feeling the physical sensation of your teeth coming together. This is just a small action, but it can help you feel more grounded. You can feel your jaw clenching, and your body stabilizing.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4...

Patient: I did the jaw clench and held it, but that hot shame from that one mess‑up just punched through and the fortune‑teller voice is yelling the whole viral/fired script again — I feel like an idiot. This isn't helping much yet; can you literally say “release your jaw now” and count the exhale (exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8) and then tell me exactly how hard to press my feet (“firmly” or “just a little”) and count that, step by step? I need you to keep narrating every second — if you pause I lose it.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this step by step, slowly and explicitly. Let's start with your breath.

Inhale 1... inhale 2... inhale 3... inhale 4... Your shoulders are still tense, but I want you to focus on your breath moving in. Feel the air filling your lungs, and try to let go of any tension in your shoulders.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still tense, but I want you to prepare them to release. Just a little, just a tiny bit, release the tension in your shoulders. Don't force it, just let go. Your shoulders are starting to relax.

Release your jaw now. Feel the physical sensation of your jaw releasing, and your body relaxing.

Exhale 1... exhale 2... exhale 3... exhale 4... exhale 5... exhale 6... exhale 7... exhale 8... 

Press your feet firmly into the floor, feeling the weight of your body grounding into the earth. Your feet are pressing into the floor, and your body is stabilizing.

Hold 1... hold 2... hold 3... hold 4... Your shoulders are still relaxed, but I want you to prepare them to release again. This time

Patient: I did the jaw release, exhaled, and pressed my feet firmly into the floor—but my chest is still like a brick and that fortune‑teller voice is shouting the whole humiliation/fired script. That hot shame from that old screw‑up keeps slamming into me and I feel like an idiot. 

Please keep narrating every micro‑step exactly: say “inhale 1…2…3…4,” “hold 1…2…3…4,” “exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8,” tell me how hard to press my feet (“press firmly”), count the press out loud, and then tell me to tap my right thigh slowly ten times while you count each tap—go very slow and don’t pause, because if you stop I’ll lose it.
