--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this recurrent cycle of self-reproach—an almost ritualistic cataloguing of perceived failures that, paradoxically, stems from my early academic difficulties even though I eventually achieved professional success as an accountant. The burnout has worsened since a recent health scare, and I find myself ruminating on minutiae at work as if meticulousness might atone for past inadequacies. Honestly, I tend to intellectualize my emotions—deploying elaborate analyses about why I feel anxious—rather than actually sitting with the sadness or fear, which might be part of the problem.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're trying to make amends for past perceived shortcomings through your work, but this cycle of self-reproach is actually causing more suffering. 

What happens when you're in the midst of this rumination, and you notice yourself getting caught up in these elaborate analyses about your emotions?

Patient: When I notice I'm spiraling, I tend to instantiate a kind of metacognitive play—constructing elaborate causal narratives about my past shortcomings as if epistemic clarity could undo the affective pain. My body tightens, my attention narrows to an error-detection loop, and I compulsively re-check minutiae at work as a pseudo-reparative ritual. Emotionally, I deflect: I talk about the sadness and fear in analytical terms rather than letting them register, which functions like a kind of cognitive anesthetic that keeps the cycle going and leaves me depleted. I don't really know how to break it—small control rituals help a bit, but they're clearly just temporary fixes.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using intellectualization as a way to cope with the emotional pain, but it's not providing the relief you need.

Can you think of a time when you felt like you were able to tolerate some of that sadness or fear, even though it was uncomfortable, without immediately trying to intellectualize or distract yourself? What would happen in your body or mind if you allowed yourself to sit with that discomfort for just a small amount of time?

Patient: There was one occasion during the health scare—after the doctor left with inconclusive results—I remember sitting in my car and actually feeling the chest constriction and a hot flush behind my eyes instead of immediately running through potential explanations. If I let it be for a few minutes, the visceral intensity peaked and then, slowly, my breathing would regulate, the racing thoughts decelerated, and a sort of weary clarity followed; it wasn't pleasant, but it was tolerable. If I intentionally allowed myself to sit with that discomfort now, I suspect the same somatic downregulation would occur—my body would do the work if I stopped intervening with analytic narratives—but I also know I have a strong metacognitive impulse to reinterpret and neutralize the feeling before it properly emerges, which makes it hard. Honestly, I'm trying to picture doing that consistently, and I'm not sure how to override the reflex to intellectualize.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're recognizing a small window of opportunity for experiencing your emotions, and that allows for a temporary release from the cycle of rumination.

Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to reinterpret the feeling, you simply acknowledged it as "this physical sensation in my body, which is uncomfortable, but not necessarily judgmental or catastrophic"?

Patient: I can imagine that if I actually said to myself, "this is a physical sensation, uncomfortable but not catastrophic," the upward spiral into catastrophic narratives might attenuate rather quickly. Physically, the chest tightness would probably loosen, my shoulders would unclench and breathing would slow; emotionally, there'd be less immediate self-condemnation, though it feels risky because part of me equates tolerating it with admitting some kind of failure. I want to try it, but I'm anxious—can you help me stay with the feeling if I attempt to do that right now?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to be willing to try this.

I'm here with you, and I'm not going to offer any advice or try to fix anything. I'm just going to notice the sensation in your body and the thoughts that come up, and we'll explore them together.

Let's start with that physical sensation in your body. Can you take a deep breath and gently notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or label it as anything? Just observe it as it is.

Patient: Okay—I take a slow breath. There's a tautness across my sternum, like a pressure band, a warmth behind my eyes, and a low tremor in my hands. My immediate reflex is to narrativize it—construct causal explanations—but if I only observe it without explaining, the intensity seems to ease a little; I'm anxious about staying with it, though, so could you stay with me while I try for a bit longer?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'll support you in staying with the sensations. I'll notice them along with you.

Let's focus on the sensation in your chest. You mentioned it feels like a pressure band. Can you describe it in more detail, without trying to explain it or label it? Just notice the sensation of the pressure, the feeling of it being there.

Patient: When I try to simply feel it, the pressure is a circumscribed band across my sternum—dense, like someone’s palm pressed there—and it has this viscous quality, as if breath must force its way through it; there's a low buzzing under the skin and my breaths get shallow and mechanically small. My metacognitive reflex immediately kicks in—I start narrativizing it as an autonomic response tied to conditioned shame, cataloguing possible antecedents—so I notice the sensation but then hijack it with analysis, which is frustrating. I'm anxious about staying with it longer because part of me equates lingering with failure, but I can try to remain if you keep guiding me.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware of the tendency to get caught up in narrative explanations, and that's causing you discomfort. You're also acknowledging that part of you is worried that staying with the sensation will mean "failing" in some way.

I want to gently challenge that assumption: what if, instead of trying to "overcome" the sensation or make sense of it, you simply allowed it to be, without trying to fix it or change it? Would that be a more comfortable position for you to be in?

Patient: In theory, yes—intellectually I recognize that permitting the sensation without corrective narration is probably more adaptive; my cognitive model even frames it like a kind of extinction learning. In practice, it feels risky—like conceding to some residual incompetence—and my reflexive narrativizing returns fast, even though I notice my chest loosens a bit when I truly attend. Could we try very short intervals—just thirty seconds of focused noticing with you checking in—so I don't immediately revert to analysis?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware of the gap between your theoretical understanding and your practical experience.

Let's try a small, short-term experiment. I'll guide you through a 30-second exercise. On the count of three, take a deep breath in, and then we'll start noticing the sensation in your chest together. Ready? One... two... three.

(Pause for 30 seconds)

Patient: It loosened—the pressure band thinned and my breaths became less clipped, though a low tremor hung around and my hands stayed a bit cold. My metacognitive apparatus still kept intruding—labeling and causal-mapping—but each time I reoriented to the sensation the intensity dropped, so it felt like a small proof-of-concept rather than a solution. I'm anxious about doing longer stretches because I equate lingering with failure, but I want to try again—maybe forty-five seconds this time—with you checking in as before?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've made some progress, and it's becoming a bit more manageable.

Let's try again, this time for 45 seconds. I'll check in with you halfway through. Ready? On the count of three, take a deep breath in, and we'll start noticing the sensation together. One... two... three.

(Pause for 45 seconds, then) Okay, we're halfway through. How are you holding up? Notice the sensation in your chest and see if it's changed at all.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Physically the pressure has thinned and my breathing's less clipped, though a low tremor and cold hands remain, and my reflex is to audit the feeling and assemble causal schemas. I'm anxious and a bit bewildered by the pace; could we slow down and have you check in more frequently so I don't immediately revert to intellectualizing?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and focus on the process, rather than the outcome. Instead of a set time limit, we can try to focus on the sensations and thoughts as they arise, and I'll check in with you more frequently.

Let's start again, and I'll ask you to notice the sensation in your chest, and then I'll check in with you immediately if you start to get caught up in analysis. When you're ready, take a deep breath in, and notice the sensation. I'll wait for your cue to proceed.

Patient: I'm not sure I fully follow how prolonged noticing is supposed to disrupt the catalogue-of-failures loop—how does sustained attention actually translate into less rumination? That said, I'm willing to try if you can check in every 10 seconds and gently redirect me when I start analyzing. I'm ready—you can start now; I'll take a slow breath and notice the chest.

Let's begin. Take a slow breath in, and notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or explain it. I'll check in with you in 10 seconds.

As you breathe out, notice the sensation again, and we'll continue from there.

Patient: I take a slow breath—there’s that dense band again across my sternum, breath feels constricted and my hands tremble slightly; a flush behind my eyes. My metacognitive reflex is already kicking in, assembling causal narratives about conditioned shame and compensatory rituals, which I notice pulling me away from the sensation. Could you gently nudge me back to the bodily feeling if I start analyzing—I'm not sure I fully grasp how sustained attention will reconfigure the rumination, and that confusion makes me anxious.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your metacognitive reflex is already trying to hijack the moment.

Notice that flush behind your eyes, the trembling in your hands, and the sensation in your chest. Don't try to change or explain it yet. Instead, bring your attention back to the sensation, without judgment or analysis. It's like gently bringing your attention to a small, tender spot on your skin.

As we breathe in, can you focus on the sensation in your chest, without trying to label it or make sense of it?

Patient: I breathe in—there’s a concentrated tightness, like a weighted band across my sternum, breath clipped, a warm prickling behind my eyes and a low tremor in my hands. If I try not to name it the intensity eases a bit, but my reflex is immediately to hypothesize—conditioning, shame, compensatory perfectionism—which yanks me into analysis. I’m willing to stay with it, but I’ll need you to nudge me back every few seconds when I start verbalizing explanations; the prospect of lingering still makes me anxious.

The pressure eases a touch, but there's this sudden hot wash of shame and frustration that keeps intruding—when it comes I immediately want to explain it away or replay past mistakes instead of staying with the sensation. My hands tremble more and my breathing clips when that surge hits. Could you nudge me back every few seconds?
