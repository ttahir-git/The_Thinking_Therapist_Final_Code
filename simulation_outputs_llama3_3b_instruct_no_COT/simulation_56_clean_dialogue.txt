Patient: I'm a manager who recently moved away from my primary support system, and since then my PTSD and this relentless inner critic have been worse than usual. I get stuck in cycles where every small mistake turns into proof I'm failing—if I slip up at work I'll definitely get fired, lose everything, and end up completely alone. People tell me other things could happen, but my mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster, and I can't make myself believe any other outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of hopelessness and self-doubt right now. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those emotions. Can you tell me more about what's helpful to you in terms of staying present and coping with these thoughts when they arise? What's one thing that might give you a sense of control or stability in the midst of all these worries about the future?

Patient: Sometimes grounding—counting breaths, naming five things I see, jotting a quick to-do list—keeps me from spiraling for a few minutes. But as soon as I calm down, my mind stitches together the worst-case movie: the list proves I'm fragile, I miss one deadline, get fired, lose my apartment, and end up totally alone. People say routines or small wins help, but to me that's unrealistic—I can already see exactly how they'd collapse and drag me back into the same mess.

Therapist: It sounds like those brief moments of grounding can be a lifeline, but the worst-case scenarios that follow are still pretty intense. Can you notice what's happening when you're caught up in that "worst-case movie" – what does it feel like in your body, or what emotions come up when those thoughts start playing out in your mind?

Patient: My chest clamps up, my breath gets shallow, my stomach drops and my hands go cold — there's this buzzing in my head and everything narrows so I can't think straight. Mostly shame and panicky dread, then this surge of anger at myself for being 'stupid' and worthless. Right after that the brain buries me in the worst-case movie — miss one thing at work, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up alone and ruined — and even if people say other things could happen, I can't make myself believe it; it feels like the only thing that will happen.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a pretty intense physical and emotional response to those thoughts. The shame and anger can be particularly challenging to work with, but can you try to observe those emotions as if they were just passing visitors in your body, rather than being a permanent resident? For example, you could say to yourself, "Ah, it seems like shame is showing up again, and it's feeling really tough right now. I'll just acknowledge that it's here, and then what would happen if I were to say 'no' to that shame – not engage with it, not let it define me?"

Patient: I try to say "no" to the shame—like, "I see you, I'm not engaging"—and sometimes it eases for a breath or two, but almost immediately my brain starts the worst-case movie: miss one email, get a bad review, fired, lose my apartment, end up completely alone and ruined. Saying kinder things to myself feels like lying or denial; it doesn't change the certainty my mind produces, it just feels like I'm papering over a cliff. Honestly, I'm getting tired of trying the same thing and it feels like we're going in circles — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a bit frustrated with the pattern of being caught in the worst-case movie, and the effort of trying to calm it down feels like a temporary band-aid. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to calm the thoughts, you simply stopped trying to change them, and instead focused on what's happening right here, in this moment? What would it be like to just observe the thoughts without trying to push them away or distract yourself from them?

Patient: I try to just watch them, but the moment I look they get louder and more detailed—as if observing them proves they're real. Then my mind runs the whole catastrophe: miss an email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up alone, like I'm already watching the first domino fall. It's overwhelming and feels so convincing I can't just sit with it without it escalating—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like observing the thoughts is becoming more like fueling the fire, rather than calming it down. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to observe the thoughts, you were to imagine yourself being the director of this movie, and you got to decide what the scene unfolds? What would you choose to show, and what would you choose to focus on in that scene?

Patient: I try to be the director, but my hand always cuts to the worst shot—the missed email, the bad review, the write-up, getting fired, losing my apartment, ending up alone. If I try to film something calmer it feels fake, like a staged scene that won't stop the inevitable collapse. It just makes me more exhausted and stuck—can we slow down? I don't know how to pick a different take.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of focusing on the most dramatic, attention-grabbing moments, and it's hard to switch to a more calming scene. Can you imagine that your mind is trying to create a story, but it's also just making up a script – and you get to be the one to rewrite the ending?

Patient: I can't — my mind just won't let me rewrite it; the moment I try a calmer ending it jumps back to the worst-case movie: miss one email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up alone. Trying to pick a different take feels fake, like denial, and it only makes me more exhausted and stuck. I'm honestly not sure where to go from here — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really trapped in this cycle. Can we take a step back and focus on what's happening in your body right now, without trying to change the story or the thoughts? What's the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sounds around you?

Patient: My feet feel kind of heavy, like they're glued to the floor, and my breath's shallow and tight in my chest; the air on my skin feels thin and cold. The second I notice it, my brain takes that as proof the panic's starting and the worst-case movie starts rolling — I imagine freezing in a meeting, getting written up, fired, losing the apartment, ending up totally alone. I can try to stay with the sensations, but noticing them just makes the story louder and I get overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the cycle of physical sensations and thoughts. Can I help you focus on just one sensation, like the feeling of your feet on the floor, without trying to change it or connect it to the thoughts? I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet, without judgment, just as it is – can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — my feet feel heavy, like they're glued to the floor, cool against the soles. But the moment I focus on that, my head turns it into proof the panic's starting and the movie starts: freeze in a meeting, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm getting flooded just saying that — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to focus on the physical sensation is getting caught up in the same thought-pattern. Can we try something even simpler: I'd like you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or think about it – just observe it as it is, without judgment. Can you pay attention to the sensation of the breath, just for a few more seconds?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to notice the breath: it's shallow, quick, like it barely fills my lungs. But the more I watch it the louder the worst-case movie gets — miss a beat in a meeting, miss an email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. A memory just popped up and I'm hit with shame and frustration and it feels like proof those things will happen; I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the breath is becoming a bit of a trigger for the thoughts. Can I ask, what would happen if you were to simply acknowledge that shame and frustration, without trying to change it or use it to fuel the worst-case movie? Can you say to yourself, "I see that shame and frustration right now, and I'm feeling it"?

Patient: I can try to say that to myself—“I see the shame and frustration, and I’m feeling it”—and sometimes it eases for a breath, but almost immediately my brain starts the worst-case movie: miss an email, get a bad review, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. Saying it out loud feels hollow, like a band‑aid over a cliff, and I’m getting really tired of this loop—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to acknowledge the emotions isn't providing the lasting relief you're hoping for. Can we try something even smaller than that? What if, instead of trying to change or label the thoughts, you simply let the shame and frustration be present, without trying to do anything with them? Can you just allow them to be there, without judgment or trying to act on them?

Patient: I try to let the shame and frustration just be, but as soon as I do they swell and the worst-case movie gets louder—miss an email, bad review, write-up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. Letting them sit feels like I'm handing them a stage, and I get more convinced the disaster will happen. I'm getting really flooded and frustrated and honestly don't know what to do next—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let go of the shame and frustration isn't working. Can I suggest something a bit more subtle? What if, instead of trying to let the thoughts be, we focus on the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit? Not trying to change anything, just noticing that your muscles might be releasing a tiny bit, your breathing might be slowing down a bit, or your heartbeat might be getting a bit less racing? Can you pay attention to that tiny bit of relaxation, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Alright, I'll try — I notice maybe a tiny loosening in my shoulders, like a fraction less tightness. But as soon as that happens shame and frustration surge and my brain kicks into the worst-case movie: miss an email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. It's exhausting and feels like any small ease just proves the panic's coming back harder — I'm getting flooded and don't know what to do next, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny bit of relaxation you noticed didn't stick around for long. Can we try something even smaller than that? What if, right now, you simply acknowledge that the loosening in your shoulders is gone, and you're back to feeling tense again? Can you just notice that without judgment, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Okay—I notice the loosening is gone and my shoulders are tight again. The second I admit that, shame and frustration hit and my brain launches the worst-case movie: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm getting really flooded and it's starting to feel unbearable—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like we're getting caught in a cycle of noticing and letting go, only to have the cycle start again. Can we try something even more gentle? What if, instead of trying to acknowledge or notice your physical sensations, we simply focus on your breath, and not try to do anything with it? Just bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, without judgment, without trying to change it, without trying to do anything with it. Just be with the breath, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to be with my breath — it's shallow and feels like it's barely there. The second I notice it shame and frustration surge and my mind fires up the worst-case movie: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm getting flooded and it's getting hard to stay with the breath — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your breath is becoming a bit of a trigger for the thoughts again. Can I ask, what's the sensation like when you try to stay with the breath, but your mind starts to wander to the worst-case movie? Is it like your mind is trying to push the breath out of the way, or is it more like your breath is getting caught up in the thoughts?

Patient: It's like my mind bulldozes the breath — the breathing gets shoved to the background, shallow and pinched, like I'm holding it without meaning to. The shame and frustration from that memory flood in and as soon as my attention slips the worst-case movie kicks on — miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone — and the breath just disappears into the panic. I can't seem to separate them and it's really overwhelming; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is having a hard time letting go of the thoughts, and that's causing your breath to get disrupted. Can I suggest we try to anchor the breath to something physical, rather than mental? Instead of trying to focus on your breath directly, let's try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin – just be with that. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying — my feet feel heavy, press into the floor, like I'm anchored. But the second I notice that shame and frustration slam into me and my mind bulldozes the sensation and launches the worst‑case movie: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm getting really flooded and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught in the same cycle again. Can I ask, what's the sensation like when your mind is "bulldozing" the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Is it like it's pushing away from that sensation, or is it more like your feet feel like they're being pulled back into the thoughts?

Patient: It's like a shove—my attention gets forced away from the feeling under my feet, like the ground goes flat and distant, and then something tugs my whole body up into my head. That tug kicks the shame and frustration into overdrive and the worst-case movie blares on—miss an email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm so tired of being hijacked like this and I'm getting flooded again—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is using the sensation of being pulled up into your head as a way to get you to engage with the thoughts again. Can I suggest we try to find a different anchor to come back to? What if, instead of focusing on your breath or your feet, we try to anchor ourselves to a sense of kindness and compassion for yourself? Can you imagine that kindness is like a gentle, quiet voice that is always present, even when the thoughts are loud and overwhelming?

Patient: I get the idea, but picturing that gentle voice just feels fake — like putting a smile on before the whole thing collapses. The second I try that, shame and frustration slam into me, my chest tightens, and the worst-case movie starts up again — miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone — and I can't make myself believe any kinder outcome. I'm getting really flooded and distracted and I don't know what to do next — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the effort to imagine kindness and compassion is getting caught up in the same cycle of shame and frustration. Can I suggest we try something even more basic? What if we simply focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or attach any thoughts to it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, exactly as it is, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to notice the air moving in and out, but it feels shallow and hardly there. The second I check it, shame and that memory slam into me and the worst‑case movie starts: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. My chest tightens and I get jittery and distracted and it’s getting really hard to stay with this—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like checking the breath is getting caught up in the cycle again. Can I suggest we try something more minimal? What if we simply pay attention to the sensation of your chest, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just notice the sensation of your chest, as it is, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—my chest feels tight, like someone's squeezing it, and I get breathless. The second I notice, shame and frustration slam into me and my brain starts the worst‑case movie: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. I'm really flooded and jittery and can't focus—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the tension in your chest is getting caught up in the cycle again. Can I ask, what would happen if, instead of trying to focus on your chest, you simply allowed it to be what it is, without trying to change it? What if you just let the tightness be present, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: I try to let the tightness be, but the second I do the shame and that memory slam in and my brain launches the worst‑case movie — miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. Letting it sit feels like surrendering to proof I'm doomed, and it just makes me jittery and unfocused. I'm really flooded and don't know what to do next — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let go of the tension is getting caught up in the same pattern of shame and worst-case thinking. Can I suggest we try to focus on the sensation of your body, not the thoughts or the emotions? What if you simply noticed the sensation of your feet touching the ground, right now, without thinking about anything else? Just be with the sensation of your feet, as they are, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — my feet are pressed into the floor, a little weight and coolness under the soles. The second I notice that, shame and frustration slam in and my head fires up the worst‑case movie—miss an email, get written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up completely alone—and I get so flooded and jittery I can't hold the sensation at all. I'm really overwhelmed and distracted and honestly don't know what to do next—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught in the cycle again. Can I ask, what happens when you try to hold onto the sensation of your feet, even for just a tiny bit? What would happen if you simply allowed the sensation to come and go, without trying to grasp onto it or cling to it?

Patient: When I try to hold the sensation even for a moment my attention gets yanked away—shame and that memory slam in and the worst‑case movie roars back: miss an email, get a write‑up, fired, lose my apartment, end up completely alone. Letting the feeling come and go just feels like handing it a stage—any tiny easing convinces me the crash is inevitable and it comes back louder. I'm really flooded and pissed off and don't know what to do next—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to hold onto the sensation is getting caught up in the same pattern of shame and worst-case thinking. Can I suggest we try something even simpler? What if, instead of trying to hold onto the sensation, we simply allowed it to pass, without trying to change it or react to it? Would it be possible to observe the sensation of the feeling, not as something that's happening to you, but as something that's happening, exactly as it is, right now?

Patient: I can't seem to do that — the moment I try to just watch the feeling it hands the mic to the worst‑case movie: shame and frustration slam in, my chest tightens, and I picture one missed thing at work cascading into getting fired, losing my apartment, ending up completely alone. Letting it pass feels impossible; I'm flooded and overwhelmed and I don't know what else to try — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck. Can I ask, what if we took a step back and looked at this from a different perspective? Instead of trying to change your thoughts or emotions, what if we looked at the fact that you're getting caught in this cycle, and simply acknowledged that it's happening? Would it be possible to say to yourself, "I'm getting caught in this cycle again" – just a simple acknowledgment of the fact, without judgment or attachment?

Patient: I can say it—“I’m getting caught in this cycle again”—but the moment I say it my chest tightens with shame and my brain immediately runs the whole disaster movie: miss an email, bad review, written up, fired, lose my apartment, end up totally alone. Saying it feels hollow, like admitting it won’t stop the collapse, and I’m really flooded and distracted right now—can we slow down?
