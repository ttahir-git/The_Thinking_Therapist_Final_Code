--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this persistent worry about my performance at work as a nurse, which oddly enough has translated into a lot of procrastination. I catch myself doing a kind of meta-analysis—cataloguing hypothetical mistakes and running through contingency plans—instead of actually doing the tasks. Since the loss I experienced, everything feels higher-stakes, and I tend to intellectualize the fear rather than sit with the emotion.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling with the emotional impact of the loss and feeling overwhelmed by the stakes. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're caught in this meta-analysis, cataloging hypothetical mistakes? What's the tone like for you while you're doing that? Is it anxious, detached, or something else?

Patient: When I'm in that meta-analysis mode it feels like a ruminative loop—I'm cognitively rehearsing every possible error, ranking them by probability and consequence, which paradoxically makes me freeze. The tone on the surface is almost detached and clinical, like I'm conducting an audit, but there's a persistent undercurrent of anticipatory anxiety—tightness, a faster heartbeat—so it's not purely intellectual. I tend to lean into the analysis because it gives me the illusion of control, even though it usually just delays the task.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the analysis provides a temporary sense of control, but ultimately perpetuates a sense of overwhelm. Can you think of a way to disrupt this analysis, to break the cycle of cataloging and rehearsing, without feeling like you're abandoning your responsibilities or compromising patient care?

Patient: A practical experiment that feels tolerable might be implementation intentions with strict time-boxing—like “if I start ruminating, I’ll set a 15-minute timer and do the smallest possible piece of the task,” which interrupts the rehearsal loop by lowering the activation energy for action. Pair that with a brief safety checklist or a quick peer-check for any high-stakes nursing tasks so I don't feel like I'm abandoning patient care while I cut through the analysis. I can articulate all that pretty easily, but I also feel resistant—it's less about strategy and more about tolerating the underlying fear, and that makes me anxious about actually doing it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The resistance is understandable, given the underlying fear. What if, instead of focusing on the specific strategy of implementation intentions, you were to approach this with a sense of curiosity about what would happen if you didn't analyze every possible scenario? Could you imagine allowing yourself to feel the discomfort or uncertainty, rather than trying to control it through your analysis?

Patient: Theoretically, yes — I can frame it as a sort of interoceptive exposure: an expected initial spike in arousal that would likely down-regulate if I didn't immediately neutralize it. Practically, I default to meta-analysis because it functions like a safety protocol, so I'd be more willing to try it with a graded plan — short "sit with it" windows (2–3 minutes), then a tiny action plus a quick checklist or colleague backup so I don't feel like I'm risking patient care. But honestly, imagining actually staying with that raw uncertainty makes me jittery; it's easier to design a protocol than to tolerate the sensation itself.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're developing a plan that acknowledges the importance of immediate action while still allowing for some discomfort. Can you try to take it a step further by imagining what it would be like to simply acknowledge the uncertainty or discomfort without trying to neutralize it, without necessarily labeling it or labeling the outcome? For example, can you think of a way to simply observe the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them or make sense of them?

Patient: Yeah — I can intellectually map out a somatic noticing exercise: a brief, two-minute body scan where I silently label sensations — “tightness” in the chest, “heat” in the face, “tingling” in the hands — without trying to interpret or fix them. In theory I’d anchor to the breath and count to three observations, then return to task; in practice my reflex is to start analyzing the origin and implications of each sensation, which defeats the purpose. I’m willing to try the micro-version, but I'm already bracing for impatience and the urge to reframe everything as a problem to solve.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're close to actually trying this exercise, but the self-correcting tendency is strong. Can you try to observe the sensation of wanting to analyze the sensations, rather than getting caught up in it? For example, notice what happens when you think "I need to analyze the origin and implications" - is there a physical sensation that accompanies that thought, a feeling of tension or a certain posture?

Patient: When that thought pops up—“I need to analyze this”—I get an immediate tightness in my chest and throat, my shoulders tense, and my breathing shortens. Mentally it feels like a buzzing checklist — a compulsive urge to sit up, list causes, and assign probabilities. If I pay attention to the urge itself, it’s almost a separate sensation: a jittery pressure in my hands and a kind of inner voice saying “explain it,” which usually pulls me back into intellectualizing instead of just feeling it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those sensations are a good clue to what's happening. It seems like there's a clear physical response to the thought of analyzing, which is interesting. Would you be willing to try a small step back from that thought, and instead focus on the physical sensations when that thought arises - without trying to "explain" them or analyze them? Just observe them as they are, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. I'll do a two-minute pause, breathe, and just note three sensations (tightness in my chest, shallow breath, a jittery pressure in my hands) and deliberately not narrate why they're there; when the thought "analyze this" comes up I'll notice the urge as its own sensation instead of following it. Honestly, I'm already bracing for impatience and the reflex to reframe it as a problem to solve — can we keep it brief so I don't derail into explaining?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep it brief. Can you try the pause, breathe, and noting of sensations for the full two minutes, without adding any judgment or interpretation? No trying to fix the sensations, no labeling their cause or meaning. Just be with them as they are, for 120 seconds.

Patient: I tried the two-minute pause. My head kept trying to catalog causes, but I was able to note three sensations: a tightness in my chest, shallow quick breaths, and a jittery pressure in my hands. The urge to analyze showed up as a separate buzzing that softened a bit when I just noticed it, though impatience and the thought “this is pointless” kept intruding. I’m feeling a bit shaky and unsure—can we try another short guided round or a different anchor so I don’t slip back into explaining?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of uncertainty or shakiness in your body. Where do you feel it? Is it mainly in your body or more of a mental feeling? Can you observe it without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help me, exactly? When I try to notice the uncertainty it's pretty somatic: a hollow, queasy feeling under my ribs, a jittery pressure in my hands, and a tightness across my chest; mentally it's a buzz of metacognitive commentary. I can hold those sensations for a few moments without doing anything, and when I do the edge eases a bit, but my reflex is to start parsing and explaining them immediately. I'm already feeling a bit flustered and impatient about sitting with it—can we try another brief anchor so I don't slip back into explaining?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit of resistance to just sitting with the sensations. Let's try a different anchor. Can you bring to mind a very small, everyday action that you can do right now, without needing to think about it too much? Something as simple as noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin.

Patient: I'm still not sure I follow how this helps, but I'll try it. Focusing on my feet: I can feel the firm pressure under my soles, a slight tremor through the arches, and a weird hollow tightness in my gut that immediately brings a flush of shame and irritation—like I'm annoyed at myself for needing to do such a basic thing. On paper it makes sense—a proprioceptive anchor to break the ruminative loop—but in practice the shame spikes and the mind wants to narrate and explain rather than just stay with the feeling. Could you guide me through a very short, paced version so I don't bail into analysis?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to slow down the pace a bit. As you notice the sensation in your gut, notice it as you're breathing in, and as you're breathing out. Just allow the sensation to be with you for a second, without trying to do anything with it. As you breathe out, pause for a moment, and then breathe in again. Just notice the sensation again, without trying to add anything to it. No judgment, no interpretation, just the sensation. Stay with it for another second, and then breathe out again. Can you do that with me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just breathing supposed to help with this? Alright, breathing in I notice the hollow under my ribs and, breathing out, the tightness wraps around my chest, but then a sudden spike of shame and frustration floods in—hot in my face, jittery in my hands—and it pulls me straight back into explaining and defending myself. I can try to stay with the breath, but I keep getting hijacked by that shame; could you walk me through a slower, very guided version so I don't bail into analysis?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very slow and gentle approach. As you breathe in, I want you to say to yourself, "I am noticing the sensation." Just those three words, without any meaning or interpretation. As you breathe out, say, "The sensation is still here." Repeat that with me: "I am noticing the sensation" and "The sensation is still here." Let's start with just one breath. Notice the sensation under your ribs as you say "I am noticing the sensation."

Patient: Okay—I did that: breathed in and said to myself, "I am noticing the sensation," breathed out with "The sensation is still here." For a beat the hollow under my ribs softened, but then shame and that jittery heat slammed back in and my brain immediately pivoted to a litany of explanations and recollections of past slip-ups. I can keep trying, but I need a slower scaffold—could you count me through one more, very slow breath, because I keep getting hijacked by analysis and I don't want to bail.

Let's try it again, very slowly. Inhale... I want you to say to yourself, "I am noticing the sensation" as you inhale. Pause for a moment. Hold the breath.

Patient: Okay—I'm breathing in now. I said to myself "I am noticing the sensation" as I inhaled and there was a brief loosening under my ribs, but on the exhale when I said "The sensation is still here" the tightness snapped back and that hot flush of shame and irritation flooded in—makes my stomach clench and my thoughts start explaining. I'm not sure I follow how long to hold or pause without my brain jumping back to analysis; could you count the seconds for me or pace it verbally?

Let's try a different approach. I can guide you through a slow, one-to-five paced round with each second, and I'll cue you on when to inhale and exhale. We can start fresh.

Inhale... 1... say "I am noticing the sensation"... 2... exhale... 3... say "The sensation is still here". Now, bring your attention to the sensation under your ribs. 4... hold... 5... exhale. Can you just notice the sensation without trying to change it or analyze it?

Or, if you'd prefer a tactile anchor, we can try that too. Would you like to focus on your feet on the floor, or something else?

Patient: I'll take the tactile anchor—feet on the floor—and please cue me one-to-five for each inhale/exhale so I have that external pacing; long lists of numbers make me hide in analysis.
