Patient: I'm in my mid-fifties, a longtime manager, and lately I've been dealing with a kind of anhedonia and demotivational inertia since the job instability hit. I default to conceptualizing it—talking about identity disruption, maladaptive coping, and organizational stress—rather than actually sitting with the feeling, but it's clearly bleeding into my relationship because I don't have the energy to engage. Being action-oriented, that paralysis frustrates me, so I over-intellectualize to keep a safe distance from the sadness.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the discomfort of being stuck and not knowing how to move forward. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do try to sit with the feeling of sadness, but it feels like your mind is just spinning with thoughts and you can't quite connect with the emotional experience itself?

Patient: When I try to sit with the sadness my mind immediately converts it into a narrative—rumination, contingency-mapping, inventorying losses—so I end up analyzing the emotion instead of inhabiting it. Physically there's this hollowness and a tightness in my chest, but I distance it with jargon and hypothetical problem‑solving like "what's the plan" or "what's the identity implication," which keeps the affect at arm's length. I get annoyed at myself for that avoidance, but even admitting the annoyance turns into another layer of meta‑analysis instead of actually feeling anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really aware of the way your mind can quickly shift into analysis mode, even when you're trying to try and be present with the emotion. What would happen if, for just a brief moment, you were to pause that intellectualization and just say to yourself, "This is the hollowness in my chest" – without trying to identify it, analyze it, or even try to understand it?

Patient: If I try to just name it, my brain immediately flips into an internal audit—"is this productive, what's the root cause, what's the plan?"—so the hollowness becomes another data point instead of an experience. Physically I do feel that tight empty spot, but naming it feels like opening a valve I might not be able to close, which sparks a panicky loop about losing control or being ineffective. Honestly, I'm frustrated and a bit scared about that, and I catch myself defaulting to analysis because actually feeling it feels risky.

Therapist: It's like you're experiencing a sense of uncertainty and fear around being with the feeling, and that's making it hard to let go of your usual way of coping. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to take a very small step, just a tiny one, towards allowing yourself to be with that physical sensation in your chest, without trying to fix it or analyze it – just to see if it's possible to hold onto it for a brief moment without judgment or planning?

Patient: Okay—I can try a very small, time‑boxed experiment: set a 20–30 second timer, sit upright, and follow my breath while occasionally naming the chest sensation as "tightness" without launching into cause‑analysis. I can already hear my brain drafting contingency plans and meta‑comments about efficacy, so I want permission to call out "I'm panicking" and pause if it spikes; that feels safer than an open‑ended plunge. I'm mildly skeptical this will get me past the audit, but I'm willing to test it if we keep it brief and contained.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to take a small risk and test a different approach. Can you imagine what it would be like if, when the timer goes off, you simply acknowledge the experience without judgment, just observe it as it was – without trying to make sense of it or analyze it further? No labels, no self-judgment, just a simple acknowledgment of the experience as it is?

Patient: I can imagine that — it feels oddly foreign and a little risky; the moment I try to observe without analysis my mind starts barking out troubleshooting questions. I'm willing to try the 20–30 second thing, but I want the safety valve of saying "I'm panicking" if it spikes, and I admit I'm skeptical this will move me past the audit.

Therapist: You're aware of the potential for your mind to respond with self-criticism or analysis. What's the value in having that pause, just to acknowledge the panicking and say "I'm panicking" – without trying to calm it down or dismiss it – and then see what happens next?

Patient: I can see the value—intellectually it's a decentering tactic that externalizes the panic as an event rather than an existential verdict about me, which could interrupt the audit spiral. Practically, naming it might create a tiny gap where the physiological arousal can peak and then subside, giving me evidence that the feeling is transient instead of catastrophic. I'm still wary—acknowledging "I'm panicking" feels like admitting loss of control, so I want the explicit safety valve to stop if it escalates.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the potential benefits of naming the panicking in a decentering way, and that having a clear "safety valve" could help you build confidence. What would it mean to you if, with the timer still on, you were to simply acknowledge the panic and then pause – not to try and stop it, but just to pause – and see what happens next, without trying to use the safety valve?

Patient: If I actually did that—just named the panic and paused—it would feel like I'm granting myself permission to be fallible, which is both terrifying and strangely emancipatory; it would be evidence that I can tolerate uncertainty without immediately problem‑solving. Practically, it might create a tiny experiential gap where the arousal peaks and then dissipates, undermining my narrative that feeling = catastrophe. But I'm honest: the idea still makes me anxious—I'm worried the panic will snowball and I'll lose control, and my brain is already queuing up contingency plans—so I'm willing to try it only if we keep it very brief and I can debrief right after, because I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just imagining it.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the anxiety that comes with surrendering control. Given your concerns, it sounds like you're looking for a brief, contained experiment that allows you to test this new approach. Would it be possible to debrief with you immediately after the timer goes off, so you can process what happens and get a sense of whether this tiny experiment was successful in helping you tolerate uncertainty, even if it was just for a brief moment?

Patient: Yes—I can debrief right after the timer; having that immediate processing is actually a key part of why I’m willing to try. I’ll do 20–30 seconds, allow myself to name “I’m panicking” if it spikes, and then we can map what I noticed—chest tightness, the urge to intellectualize, any change in arousal or perspective. I’m anxious and skeptical—part of me thinks this will just become another cognitive maneuver—but I’m also a little curious to see if it creates even a tiny tolerance gap.

Therapist: It sounds like you're approaching this with a sense of curiosity and openness, despite your anxiety. Let's get started with the experiment then. I'll set the timer for 20-30 seconds, and you can follow your process. When you feel the panic start to spike, just name it to yourself and say "I'm panicking". Go ahead and start when you're ready.

Patient: I did it for about 25 seconds—when I started the chest tightness and breath shallowing came up, and my mind immediately queued up a meta‑audit. I said “I’m panicking” once and, oddly, there was a small de‑escalation rather than a snowball; I’m simultaneously irritated that I turned it into another controlled experiment and a bit curious that the arousal didn’t catastrophically escalate. Can we unpack what changed physically and cognitively in that gap and how I might build on it without defaulting to problem‑solving?

Therapist: It sounds like the experiment was a success in that you were able to tolerate the panic without it escalating, and you even noticed a small decrease in arousal. Can you tell me more about what happened when you said "I'm panicking"? Was there a sense of acknowledgement, almost like a nod to yourself, that this is what's happening, or was it more of a forced acknowledgement?

Patient: It was a little of both — I said it in this almost clinical, forced way at first, like I was ticking a box, but then there was a tiny internal nod that felt real, like the alarm had been labeled and that made it less urgent. Physically the tightness loosened a notch and my breathing eased, but my brain immediately started analyzing why it worked, turning the moment into another experiment, which irritates me. I want to explore how to lengthen that gap without my head hijacking it into problem‑solving — can we try to notice what cues marked the de‑escalation?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a key moment of internal acknowledgement, which may have helped to reduce the initial tension. Let's try to explore what happened just before and after that moment of acknowledgement. What were you doing with your body and mind right before you said "I'm panicking"? Was there a sense of tensing up or preparing for a mental response, or did you feel more relaxed? And when the tightness began to loosen, what were you doing with your attention?

Patient: Right before I said "I'm panicking" my body kind of locked up—shoulders up, chest tight, breath shallow—and my mind was already in audit mode, listing causes and contingency plans. When I named it there was a tiny, almost mechanical shift: a micro‑pause, a longer exhale, my shoulders dropped a notch, and the inner voice lost some of its urgency, like labeling bled a little charge off the alarm. But of course my brain immediately turned that into data—"see, this worked, why did it work?"—which pisses me off because it pulls me back into analysis instead of the felt moment. I want to stay in that loosened space longer, but I'm anxious that any attempt to "do" it will just become another control trick—can we brainstorm a couple of very small, non‑cognitive cues I could use to anchor attention in the sensation instead of the story?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a specific physical shift that occurred when you acknowledged the panic - the mechanical shift of your body and the drop in inner urgency. Now, let's explore some small, non-cognitive cues that might help you anchor your attention in the sensation itself, rather than getting caught up in analysis. What if, instead of thinking "why did it work?", you tried simply paying attention to the sensation of the chest tightness, the feeling of your breath, or the sensation of your body relaxing? What if you could find a way to ground yourself in the physical experience, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: Okay—my brain already wants to algorithm‑ify this, but intellectually I see how simple somatic anchors could short‑circuit the audit. A few small, noncognitive cues I can try: rest a hand on my chest to feel the rise/fall, press my feet into the floor to orient to gravity, do a slow 4‑count exhale and notice air leaving, or name three external sounds without explaining them. I’m wary I’ll turn any of these into another procedural checklist, but I’m willing to try one brief practice—hand on chest + slow exhale for 20 seconds—and debrief right after; can we do that now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to take a small step with the somatic anchors. Let's do the 20-second practice right now. Place your hand on your chest and take a slow, 4-count exhale, noticing the sensation of the air leaving your body. Just focus on the physical sensation of your hand on your chest, and the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Don't try to analyze or interpret it, just notice it. When the 20 seconds are up, we can debrief and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay—I did the 20 seconds. Physically: my hand felt warm against my chest, the 4‑count exhale lengthened the out‑breath and the tightness loosened a notch; I noticed a subtle grounding through my feet too. Cognitively, my brain still queued up an explanatory commentary—“is this efficient, how to scale this”—but it was less urgent and I could actually stay with the sensation for a beat. I'm irritated that I keep turning it into procedure, but also a bit curious and mildly relieved that the sensation didn't escalate; can we try to extend it slightly or add another noncognitive anchor to see if the gap lengthens?

Therapist: It sounds like the somatic anchors helped to reduce the initial tension and allowed you to stay with the sensation for a bit longer. Let's try to build on that. Instead of immediately starting to think about how to "scale this" or make it more efficient, can you try to focus on the sensation of the sensation itself - just notice the warmth of your hand on your chest, the sensation of the breath moving in and out, and the feeling of your feet grounding you to the floor? Try to stay with it for just a few more seconds, without adding any commentary or analysis. We can see if the gap can lengthen a bit.

Patient: I did another ~20 seconds focusing on the hand-warmth, breath, and feet. Physically the tightness eased a bit more and my breathing slowed; cognitively I still felt the meta‑audit trying to leap back in, but there was a small experiential gap where I could actually notice sensation instead of narrating it. I'm irritated — part of me wants to immediately optimize this into a protocol — but I'm also mildly surprised and curious that the arousal didn't balloon. Can we try one more brief iteration, maybe with a tiny nonverbal anchor added (like gently pressing my fingertips together) to see if that lengthens the gap without letting me turn it into a checklist?

Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress in staying with the sensation and reducing the narrative voice. Let's try one more brief iteration with the added nonverbal anchor of gently pressing your fingertips together. See if this can help you extend the experiential gap further. As you press your fingertips together, try to focus on the sensation of the touch, the pressure of your fingers, and the feeling of your hands relaxing. Stay with this for just a few more seconds, without trying to analyze or make sense of it.

Patient: I tried the fingertip press for about 20–30 seconds — the pressure gave me a small focal point and the chest tightness softened a bit. I also got hit with that familiar, shame‑tinged flare of frustration, like whatever small progress happens is immediately judged as inadequate, which yanked me back toward analysis and self‑reproach. I want to keep going because I can feel the gap lengthening, but I'm wary that I'll just turn the next step into another efficiency project; can we try one more brief, guided round (30 seconds) and if that shame spikes I'll name it so we can notice it together?

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the pattern of self-criticism and analysis that's trying to pull you back in. Let's try one more brief iteration with a gentle and guided approach. I'll support you in staying with the sensation and noticing any shame or frustration that arises, without judgment. Let's take 30 seconds to focus on the pressure of your fingertips together, and if you start to feel any shame or self-criticism, just name it to yourself without judgment. We'll notice it together and see what happens. Ready?

Patient: I did the 30 seconds. Pressing my fingertips gave a tiny grounding — breath lengthened, chest loosened a notch — but almost immediately a familiar surge of shame and self‑critique sliced through, and my attention splintered into anxious efficiency questions. Naming “I’m ashamed” and “I’m panicking” took the edge off a bit, but I’m still jittery and distracted; can we unpack what that shame hooked onto and how to steady myself before we try another round?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-criticism are showing up as a familiar and intense emotion. Can you try to explore what that shame might be about? What is it about being in this moment, with the sensation and the feeling of being stuck, that's triggering this shame? Is it the fear of not being able to manage your emotions, or something else? Notice the language you're using to describe it - is it "I'm ashamed" or "I'm panicking" - and see if you can catch any underlying thoughts or assumptions that might be contributing to it.

Patient: When I say "I'm ashamed" it lands as this narrative indictment about competence and worth—like all the managerial identity stuff and the provider role have been audited and found wanting—whereas "I'm panicking" is the acute physiological spike that follows. The underlying thought loop is basically: if I can't modulate this, then I'm ineffective, I'm letting people down, I'm not the kind of person who can handle crises, which immediately morphs into self‑reproach. Physically I get jittery, my chest tightens and my attention fragments into anxious checklisting, which then fuels more shame about not being able to just "be calm." I want to steady myself before another round—can we unpack how shame is attaching to competence/failure narratives and where I might intervene without turning it into another optimization project?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is deeply tied to your sense of identity and competence as a manager and provider. Let's explore how you might intervene in this thought loop without trying to optimize or fix it. What if, instead of trying to calm the shame or justify yourself, you simply acknowledged the narrative that's arising - the one that says "I'm not competent, I'm failing, I'm not the right person for this"? What if you gave that narrative some space to exist, without judgment or evaluation, but without getting sucked into the cycle of self-reproach?

Patient: Intellectually that resonates — giving the inner narrative some pneumatic space could uncouple it from my identity‑threat, turning "I'm failing" into an event instead of a verdict. Practically, my mind is already prepping a meta‑protocol for how to acknowledge it properly, which is both typical and maddening; I’m afraid the act of "noticing" will just become another thing I have to do well. I'm willing to try a very specific, time‑boxed approach (e.g., notice the thought, label it "there's that thought" for ten seconds, then breathe) but I'm anxious it’ll morph into performance—can we make the next step concrete and simple so I don't hijack it with optimization?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the pattern of prepping a meta-protocol to acknowledge the narrative, and you're worried that it will become another thing to do well. Let's try a very concrete and simple approach. I want you to try a "pure noticing" exercise. When you notice the thought "I'm failing", instead of labeling it, "there's that thought", just say to yourself "there's that thought" for a very short time - just 2 seconds. No judgment, no analysis, no evaluation. Just a simple acknowledgement. Then, take a deep breath and let it go. We'll see if we can simplify the process and avoid turning it into another optimization project.

Patient: I tried it — I said "there's that thought" for the two seconds and took a breath. Immediately a familiar, sharp shame rushed in, my chest tightened and my mind went into this automatic post‑mortem about competence, which yanked me straight back into analysis instead of leaving the thought as an event. I'm feeling jittery and scattered now; can we try it again with you pacing it or giving a tiny cue so I don't get hijacked by the self‑reproach?

Therapist: It sounds like the familiar shame response is still strong. Let's try a slightly different approach. I want to give you a tiny cue to help you stay with the noticing without getting hijacked by the shame. Can you try this: I'll give you a gentle, calm voice to say "relax" as soon as you notice the thought "I'm failing". Just say "relax" for a very short time, and let the thought pass. No judgment, no analysis, just a gentle invitation to relax. Then, take a deep breath and see what happens.

Patient: I tried it — as soon as the "I'm failing" thought flickered I said "relax" out loud like you suggested. For a beat my breath lengthened and my shoulders dropped, but almost immediately a sharp shame surge slammed into me — that familiar "not good enough" knot tied to my competence identity — and my attention splintered into anxious troubleshooting and replaying mistakes. I'm jittery and distracted now and honestly irritated that I keep turning this into another protocol, but I do want to try again if you can pace it more slowly (a longer, calm cue or a soft countdown), because right now I keep getting hijacked before the cue can land. Can we do another 30 seconds with you pacing it, and if the shame spikes I’ll name it so we can notice it together?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame response is still strong and the cue didn't quite land. Let's try a slightly different approach. Instead of just saying "relax", I want to give you a calm and gentle cue to help you slow down and stay with the noticing. Can you try this: I'll start counting down from 4, very slowly, "4...3...2...1..." as you notice the thought "I'm failing". As you reach "1", say "relax" out loud, and then take a deep breath. Let's take it one step at a time, and see if we can find a more stable anchor. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Okay — I'm willing to try again, but I'm pretty jittery and my attention keeps fracturing into self‑critique. Go very slowly, with longer pauses between numbers (like three seconds), and if the shame spikes I'll say "I'm ashamed" so we can notice it together. I don't want this to feel like another performance test, so let's keep it calm and low‑stakes.

Therapist: Let's take it slow and easy. I'll count down from 4, very slowly, with longer pauses between numbers: "4... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...1...". As you reach "1", say "relax" out loud, and then take a deep breath. When you notice the thought "I'm failing", just say "I'm ashamed" as soon as possible, and let's notice it together. Take your time, and try to stay with the sensation of your breath. I'm here with you, and we'll take it one moment at a time. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

Patient: I did the slow countdown — when I hit "1" and said "relax" my breath lengthened and my shoulders eased for a moment, but almost immediately a sharp shame slammed into my chest and my mind went straight into that managerial post‑mortem, replaying mistakes and asking "what did I mess up." I said "I'm ashamed" like we planned and it took a little of the edge off, but I'm jittery and distracted and my brain is already trying to turn this into another fix‑it plan, which pisses me off. Can we slow down and unpack what that shame is latching onto before we try another round, or try a nonverbal grounding so I don't just perform the exercise?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame response is still triggering a strong reaction. Let's take a step back and try to unpack what's happening. What do you think is driving the shame response? Is it the fear of not being able to manage your emotions, or is there something else at play? Try to identify the underlying thought or feeling that's connected to the shame. We can slow down and explore it together. No need to perform anything yet, just let's get curious about what's happening.

Patient: I think at the core it's this identity‑threat loop: the primitive narrative that "if I can't regulate this, I'm incompetent," which telescopes into broader worries about being a failed manager or provider. Physically it lands as that hollow chest and jittery adrenaline, and cognitively it spawns a post‑mortem of mistakes that immediately validates the shame — so the feeling gets co‑opted as evidence instead of experience. I'm frustrated and distracted right now — my attention keeps splintering into anxious checklisting — so I want to slow down rather than perform another protocol; can we map the specific beliefs (e.g., "I must always be competent," "vulnerability = weakness") that seem to be the hooks for this shame?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a clear pattern of identity-threat that's driving the shame response. Let's map out the specific beliefs that seem to be hooked into that shame. Can you think of any other beliefs that might be related to this, such as "I must always be in control", "I must be able to anticipate and prevent problems", or "I must be able to provide for others"? Are there any other values or assumptions that might be contributing to this identity-threat narrative?

Patient: Yeah — there’s a whole constellation: “I must always be competent,” “I must stay in control,” “vulnerability equals weakness,” “mistakes mean I’m a failure,” and “I have to be the provider/anchor for others.” On top of that are meta‑beliefs like “emotions are inefficient,” “asking for help signals weakness,” and “uncertainty is intolerable.” I’m feeling pretty anxious and distracted right now — a bit ashamed too — so can we slow down and pick the top two (competence/control and vulnerability=weakness) to unpack more carefully?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified some really powerful and tightly-held beliefs that are driving your shame response. Let's slow down and unpack the top two that you mentioned: "I must always be competent" and "vulnerability equals weakness". Can you think of where these beliefs might have originated from? For example, were they instilled in you by others, or did you adopt them through personal experience or cultural norms? Try to explore the story behind these beliefs, and see if we can find any clues about how they're connected to your shame response.

Patient: I can trace them pretty clearly, even if I immediately turn it into a tidy narrative instead of sitting in it: “I must always be competent” feels like an internalized performance metric—parents who rewarded achievement, early supervisors who equated visibility and control with promotion, and a career that literally reinforced competence with raises and status. “Vulnerability equals weakness” reads like cultural and corporate conditioning—masculine norms, fear of looking fragile in leadership, and a workplace that punished mistakes more than it tolerated them. The job instability and subsequent losses just amplified those scripts into a shame‑laden feedback loop, so now any emotional wobble gets converted into evidence of failure. I’m feeling anxious and a bit scattered saying this—my thoughts are racing and I keep fracturing into analysis—but I can try to pick a specific early example if you want to help me unpack one of these beliefs more slowly.

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified some strong influences that have shaped your beliefs about competence and vulnerability. I'd like to explore one of these beliefs more slowly with you. Let's take a look at the belief "I must always be competent". Can you think of a specific early experience, perhaps from your childhood or teenage years, where you felt like you weren't good enough or that you failed in some way? This could be something that was explicitly criticized or something that you felt like you had to hide. Try to recall the details of that experience, and see if we can start to unpack the emotions and thoughts that arose in the moment.

Patient: Yeah—one that keeps popping up is from high school: I had to give a big presentation and I froze mid‑sentence. The teacher's impatience and my dad's disappointed look afterward felt like a public verdict—my face went hot, my chest hollowed, and I walked away convinced I was fundamentally incompetent. Ever since I’ve overcorrected with control and performance to avoid ever feeling that exposure again, and right now even describing it makes me jittery and a little pissed at myself for still carrying it—can we slowly unpack how that single humiliation got wired into my identity without turning it into another checklist?
