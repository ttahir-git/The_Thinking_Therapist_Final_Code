--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling crushed by this sadness and a total lack of motivation since I started this new, demanding program at work, and it's leaking into my relationship at home. I'm a social worker, so being overwhelmed like this feels humiliating—I'm usually the organized one, but lately I can't seem to get anything done. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—I tried therapy before and it didn't change much—so I'm not sure what you expect me to get out of this.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this new program at work is really throwing you for a loop, and that's affecting your sense of control and competence, which is especially tough since you're a social worker. 

Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're struggling to get anything done? What does your inner experience feel like in those moments?

Patient: When I can't get anything done I kind of shut down — my chest tightens, my head goes foggy, and I start replaying past mistakes or things that scared me until I can't focus on the task. I promise myself I'll start in five minutes and then hours go by and I'm filled with guilt and shame, which makes me avoid my partner and snap at them. I've tried breathing and lists before and they feel useless in the moment—how is that supposed to help when I'm already paralyzed?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you feel stuck, you're getting caught in a cycle of self-criticism and overwhelm, which is really tough to break through. That sense of paralysis can be really debilitating.

Would you be willing to try an experiment with me, just for a moment? Can you take a small step back from your task, and notice your physical sensations in your body, like the tightness in your chest and the foggy feeling in your head, without trying to change or judge them?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My chest's tight, my breathing's shallow, and my head feels like it's full of static—thoughts just jump to every mistake I've made. My stomach's in a knot, my hands feel cold, and I get this urgent impulse to get up and leave, which makes me judge myself even more. I can do the noticing, but honestly—how is that supposed to help when it just highlights how stuck I am?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like noticing those physical sensations, although a bit uncomfortable, might actually help you feel more grounded for a moment. That's not about avoiding or changing the thoughts, but rather exploring what's happening in your body right now.

Can you imagine what might happen if, instead of trying to push away or judge these physical sensations, you allowed them to be exactly as they are, without judgment – just as the physical sensations of being stuck and overwhelmed?

Patient: I can imagine it might make the panic less loud—like if I stop fighting the tightness and the static, they might not shove me into leaving or spiraling as fast. But honestly, how is that supposed to help me actually start the work? I've tried "sit with it" before and it just turned into more ruminating. Still, maybe if I let the sensations be without fighting them I could tolerate five minutes at my desk—I'm willing to try, but I'm not feeling hopeful.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're willing to try a small step, and that's a good starting point. Sometimes, allowing ourselves to be with our physical sensations without judgment can actually create a tiny bit of space, which can be enough to take small action.

What would happen if, for just five minutes, you sat at your desk, allowing the sensations to be exactly as they are, without trying to change or push them away, and instead, you simply focused on the physical sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: Alright, I'll try the five minutes, but I'm not expecting miracles—I tend to sit with it and then ruminate until I'm more stuck. Maybe focusing on my feet could ground me enough to tolerate the fog, but if I do this, can we also agree on a tiny, specific next step after the five minutes so I don't just sit and avoid? Honestly, how is that supposed to help me actually get started on the work?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're cautious about getting stuck again. Having a tiny, specific next step can indeed help you move forward.

Let's make a tiny, specific next step that you can commit to after the five minutes. For example, "I'll just make a cup of tea" or "I'll take a short walk outside". Having something simple to focus on can help you transition from sitting with your feelings to taking action.

Can you agree to focus on your breathing and physical sensations for the next five minutes, and then take a small step, like making that cup of tea, as soon as you feel like you're ready to move?

Patient: Okay—I'll try the five minutes, focusing on my breathing and my feet on the floor, but I'm skeptical about how that's supposed to help me actually start the work. After five minutes I'll make a cup of tea, but can you set a timer and check back with me then so I don't just ruminate? If I start spiraling, I'll tell you—I don't want to sit here and avoid everything.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll set the timer for 5 minutes and we can check in then. That way, you can focus on the initial small step without worrying about getting stuck again.

Let me just set the timer... Okay, we've got 5 minutes. Take your time, focus on your breath and your feet on the floor, and when you're ready, just let me know and we'll check in.

Patient: Okay—I did the five minutes. My chest loosened a little and focusing on my feet actually cut the static down to a whisper instead of a shout, so I made the tea like we agreed. It helped me move a bit, but I'm still foggy and guilty, and honestly—making tea doesn't make the pile of work any smaller. 

So, pragmatically: can we pick one tiny, concrete work step I can commit to right now (like open one document and set a 10‑minute timer to read one paragraph), and can you stay with me while I do it so I don't just spiral? How is that supposed to help me actually get started if I still freeze—what do I do the moment the spiral starts?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like making tea was a small step that gave you some space to breathe and loosen up a bit. Now, let's focus on a tiny, concrete step to make progress on the work.

I'd be happy to stay with you and help you tackle that paragraph. Let's set that 10-minute timer and I'll support you through it. When you're ready, we'll take a closer look at the paragraph together.

As we get started, I want to remind you that it's not about doing the task perfectly or getting to the end. It's about making progress, no matter how small. What would happen if you committed to just getting to the end of that paragraph, and then we can reassess from there?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try to get to the end of that paragraph and set a 10‑minute timer, but honestly, how is that supposed to help if I freeze halfway through? I need you to stay with me while I do it, and if I start spiraling say one simple thing I can do in the moment—like “name five things you can see” or “feet on the floor”—so I don’t disappear into guilt. Can you set the timer and tell me which prompt you’ll use before I start?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concerns. Before we start, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to freeze or feel stuck. Sometimes, just acknowledging the discomfort can help.

Let's set the 10-minute timer. When you're ready, I'll stay with you, and we'll use a gentle prompt to help you stay present and focused. If you start to feel overwhelmed or get stuck, I'll say "Name five things you can see" to help bring your attention back to the present moment.

Are you ready to start?

Patient: Alright—I'm ready. Start the 10‑minute timer now, and if I start spiraling say exactly: "Name five things you can see." I'll open the document and begin the first paragraph; tell me when the timer starts.

Therapist Answer:
Timer started. Go ahead and open the document, and let's begin.

Patient: Timer's on — I’ve opened the document and I’m starting the first paragraph now. My chest's already tight and my mind wants to bail, so if I freeze say "Name five things you can see." Okay… I'm going to try to get through this.

Therapist Answer:
I'll wait for you. Take your time, and don't worry if your mind starts to wander. Remember, we're just aiming for the end of this paragraph. What's the first sentence of the paragraph you're looking at?

Patient: I... I can't really focus—my chest's tight and I'm flooded with shame, like I'm useless all over again. The first sentence reads: "The client intake form must be completed before the assessment can proceed." How is reading that supposed to help when I'm already on edge—if I freeze, please say "Name five things you can see."

Let's keep going. Remember, we're not trying to tackle the sentence, just focus on taking small steps. What's the next line?

But I'm jittery and my mind's bouncing—I'm already picturing every way I could screw it up and that old shame kicks in, so I feel useless again. If I start disappearing, please just say "Name five things you can see." Also—how much time is left on the timer? And honestly, how is reading these lines supposed to help me actually get through the form when I freeze?

Saying them quieted the panic a touch, but I'm still jittery and that old shame's buzzing in my ears so I'm restless and frustrated—how is that supposed to stop me from freezing?

Saying them softens it a touch, but I'm still shaky—that old shame's buzzing and my mind keeps darting to every screw‑up, so honestly, how is that supposed to stop me freezing? You've got about a minute forty left; I'll try to keep going but be ready to say the prompt if I go quiet.

Patient: Okay—I’m still here, but my chest’s tight, my breathing’s shallow, and that old shame’s buzzing so every sentence feels like a test I’ll fail. I’ll try the next line, but if I go quiet say exactly: "Name five things you can see."

Timer's down to 10 seconds. You've made it this far. Take one more deep breath, and try to focus on the task at hand. You're almost there.

Patient: I got through the paragraph, but it felt awful — chest racing, hands shaking, and that old shame kept telling me I barely scraped by so it's pointless. I don't feel helped, just exhausted and pissed off — how is this supposed to mean I'll actually finish the whole form later? I need you to stay with me and set another short timer (10 minutes) and, if I freeze, first say "Name five things you can see" and if that doesn't work follow with "Feet on the floor." Can you do that and stick with me while I try the next bit?

I'm so glad you made it through the paragraph. I can see you're still feeling pretty shaken.

Okay, let's take a short break and regroup. We'll set a new timer for 10 minutes, and I'll be with you every step of the way. If you start to feel overwhelmed, just remember: "Name five things you can see" first, and if that doesn't help, "Feet on the floor". Let's take a few deep breaths and get ready to move forward.

Patient: Okay—I'll try the 10 minutes, but I'm skeptical this will actually help. My chest's still tight and that old shame's buzzing, so I need you to promise you'll actually say the prompts if I go quiet: first "Name five things you can see," then "Feet on the floor" if that doesn't ground me. Start the timer when you're ready and check in at the halfway mark so I don't just drift off into guilt.

Patient: Okay—timer's started and I'm already shaky; chest tight, hands cold. I'll try to use these ten minutes to finish the client identification section, but promise you'll say "Name five things you can see" if I go quiet, then "Feet on the floor" if that doesn't work, and check in at the five‑minute mark like you said. I don't trust this will actually fix anything long‑term, so you'll need to stay with me through it—how is this supposed to help me stop freezing in the middle of harder parts?

At 5 minutes, I'll check in with you and see how you're doing. If you need a gentle reminder, I'll be there.

Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the present moment. What's the next task in the client identification section?

Patient: The next bit is to enter the client's full name, date of birth, and note two forms of ID, then their contact and emergency contact info. I'm already tight-chested thinking about typing the wrong DOB or missing an asterisk and feeling useless again—how is filling these boxes supposed to stop me from freezing? Promise you'll say the prompts exactly if I go quiet—first "Name five things you can see," then "Feet on the floor" if that doesn't work—and at the five‑minute check, will you ask me if I'm stuck and have me take a breath before I keep going? I'll start when you tell me to.

(And yes, at the 5-minute mark, I'll check in and ask if you're feeling stuck. If so, I'll ask you to take a deep breath and we'll take it from there.)

Patient: Okay — I’m starting now. I’ve typed the client’s full name and I’m about to enter the DOB but my hands are shaking and that old shame is buzzing so I keep worrying I’ll get it wrong. If I go quiet say “Name five things you can see” and then “Feet on the floor” if that doesn’t ground me, and check in at five minutes to ask if I’m stuck and to take a breath.

Patient: Alright — I hear you and I appreciate you sticking with me. I'm going to enter the DOB now; my hands are shaky and that old shame's buzzing, so please say "Name five things you can see" if I go quiet, then "Feet on the floor" if that doesn't help, and check in at five minutes to ask if I'm stuck and make me take a breath.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to type the DOB but my hands are shaking, my throat's tight, and that old shame's buzzing so I keep rereading it. If I go quiet now please say "Name five things you can see" and if that doesn't help then "Feet on the floor"—and at the five‑minute mark actually make me take a breath, don't just ask if I'm stuck. And be straight with me: how is doing these tiny steps now supposed to stop me freezing on the harder parts later? I've done this before and it didn't stick.

Your hands are shaking, and it sounds like the shame is really strong. I've got you.

You're doing the best you can, and I'm here to support you. I'll follow the plan: if you go quiet, I'll say "Name five things you can see", and if that doesn't help, I'll say "Feet on the floor". At the 5-minute mark, I'll take a deep breath with you, and then we'll see where you are.

As for how these tiny steps are supposed to stop you from freezing later, I want to be honest with you - I'm not sure it will. But what I do know is that by showing up for these tiny steps, you're building a different relationship with your thoughts and feelings. You're learning to tolerate the discomfort, even when it's hard. That can be a powerful foundation for building resilience and making progress on the harder parts later.

Patient: I appreciate you being straight, but I'm still not convinced — "building tolerance" sounds vague when the shame always eats whatever progress I make. Okay, show me a concrete if‑then script I can use the moment I freeze (like: if I freeze for 30 seconds → say out loud "Name five things you can see" → three slow breaths → set a 5‑minute timer and do one tiny field), and let's actually role‑play it now so I can see how it would work in the moment. Also promise you'll prompt me exactly if I go quiet — I need you to commit to that, because otherwise I'll just drift back into guilt.
