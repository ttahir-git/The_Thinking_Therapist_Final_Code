Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — I keep replaying failures from when I struggled academically, even though I eventually did okay as a software developer. Since I lost someone close, that voice's gotten louder and more relentless. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change any of that?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That must feel really tough for you. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how you're feeling and share that with me. It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of disconnection between your past experiences and your present self, and that the harsh self-criticism is making it hard for you to shake off those feelings. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're trying to let go of these self-critical thoughts - what's the experience like, exactly?

Patient: When I try to let them go my mind latches onto one humiliating moment and just replays it — my chest tightens, I get restless, sometimes I can't sleep. I catch myself overanalyzing every little mistake at work, turning it into proof I'm a fraud, and even remembering the person I lost seems to make that voice louder. I've tried reasoning with myself and distractions, they don't stick — so how is talking about the pattern supposed to stop it when it feels so automatic?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that voice has become a kind of automatic pilot for you, and trying to reason with it or distract yourself isn't enough to shut it off. Your body's physical sensations, like the tightness in your chest and restlessness, feel like a strong indication that this voice is having a big impact on you. Can you try to bring some curiosity to those physical sensations while we explore this further - what's the first thing that comes up for you when you notice your chest tightening, for example?

Patient: When my chest tightens the first thing I notice is I can't breathe deeply — it feels like a clamp across my ribs and my mind immediately jumps to that humiliating school moment. My hands go cold and the replay starts, every detail magnified until I'm convinced I'm still that kid who couldn't keep up. I get why you'd ask me to be curious about it, but honestly... how's noticing that supposed to stop the loop? It never seems to stick for me.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is responding to the voice with a kind of hyper-vigilance, making it hard to relax and let go. Let's try something a bit different. I'd like to invite you to imagine what it might be like if, for just a moment, you could make room for your chest to expand and your breathing to become more relaxed. Would it be possible for you to imagine, without judgment, that your chest is simply tight right now, and that this is a physical sensation that can exist without the replay of that humiliating moment?

Patient: I'll try, but when I try to notice the tightness on its own my mind immediately grabs the humiliating scene and uses the sensation as proof I'm still that kid. I can force a slightly deeper breath for a moment, but it feels like pretending — I've tried breathing exercises and they don't stick. How is imagining this supposed to stop the replay when the memory always hijacks it?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware that your mind can hijack the physical sensations, and that's making it hard to find a sense of stability. Let's try to focus on the sensation of the breath itself, rather than what the mind is doing with it. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or label what's happening - just notice the sensation of the breath as it is, in this moment?

Patient: I'll try. For a breath or two I can feel the air at my nostrils and a tiny rise in my chest, but it never lasts — the clamp comes back and the humiliating scene floods in. My hands go cold and "just noticing" starts to feel like I'm giving the memory more time to sink in. How is paying attention to the breath supposed to stop the replay when it always hijacks me, and can we try something else if this keeps failing?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like even the brief moments of noticing the breath aren't enough to stabilize your experience. I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to find ways to interrupt this pattern. Let's try to focus on what might be happening when the replay of the humiliating scene starts to take over. What's the function of that replay in your experience - is it trying to warn you, protect you, or serve some other purpose?

Patient: It feels like it's trying to protect me — like some alarm that says "don't do that again," so I over-check everything. At the same time it's clearly punitive, like it's there to prove I'm a fraud or don't deserve what I have. Maybe it's also an easier pain than the real one — focusing on mistakes keeps me from feeling the grief. I get why you want me to name its function, but how is that supposed to stop this bug? I've been debugging myself for years and the same loop keeps coming back.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the replay of the humiliating scene is serving multiple purposes, including a protective function and a punitive one. And you're right that it can be a way to avoid the pain of the grief you're carrying. Let's try to explore the connection between this inner critic and the value of self-compassion. What, in your life, would be a different kind of "protection" - one that might actually allow you to be more vulnerable and open to new experiences, rather than just reinforcing this cycle of criticism?

Patient: Maybe something more practical would help — like checklists, peer reviews, or concrete steps I can follow so a mistake doesn't immediately turn into a character judgment. Also giving myself permission to be fallible, and having a routine for actually sitting with grief instead of turning it into self-punishment, seems like a different kind of protection. But I've tried “be kinder to yourself” stuff before and it doesn't stick — how is this supposed to actually change the loop for me?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for more concrete tools and strategies to help you break the cycle. Let's try to explore what might happen if, instead of just focusing on the strategies, you actually committed to taking action on them - would that change the way you experience the inner critic and the replay of the humiliating scene? For example, what would it be like if you were to start checking in with yourself more regularly, or giving yourself permission to be fallible, and then actually followed through on that permission?

Patient: If I actually followed through — regular check-ins, the concrete checklists and permission to be fallible — maybe I'd catch the replay sooner and treat mistakes like bugs to fix instead of proof I'm useless. Maybe the chest tightness would ease faster and I wouldn't spiral into nights of ruminating. But I've tried similar things and they don't stick; the inner critic always sneaks back and tells me I'm faking it. What would make those habits unavoidable for someone like me — an old dev who gets stuck in patterns — so I'm not just setting myself up to fail again?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make these new habits unavoidable, so they don't get replaced by the familiar pattern. Let's try to explore what's holding you back from committing to these new habits - is it a sense of not wanting to feel vulnerable, or a fear that you won't be able to actually follow through? Can you imagine what would need to be true for you, in this moment, for you to feel like you couldn't not follow through on these commitments?

Patient: Mostly it's fear and inertia — I'm scared of being vulnerable and having the critic use any slip as proof I'm a fraud, and when I'm low with grief I just don't have the energy to fight the old pattern. For it to feel unavoidable for me, it would have to be concrete and external: automated checklists and tests built into my workflow, scheduled peer reviews or short standups where I report progress, tiny habit steps tied to specific times, and someone checking in regularly so it's not just me promising myself things. I get that sounds mechanical, but how's wiring it into my routine actually change that inner voice when it still finds ways to undermine me?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to automate and externalize the support system that can help you stay on track. Let's try to explore what it would mean for you, in this moment, if you were already living into those external commitments - what would be the experience of showing up to your own life, even when it's hard, and already being supported in your efforts? Can you imagine what would be the tone of your inner voice if you were already succeeding in making progress, even if it's small, and if you had a regular check-in to report on it?

Patient: If I actually got there, the inner voice might sound more like a pragmatic code reviewer—pointing out bugs without declaring me worthless, specific about fixes, and maybe even quieting down when a test passes. But I'm skeptical it'll stick; that critic is relentless and will pounce on any slip, so imagining it doesn't feel like enough. How is picturing that tone supposed to make it happen—what concrete steps actually rewrite that voice, and how do I make those external supports fail-proof when I'm exhausted?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a fundamental shift in the tone and function of the inner voice, rather than just a superficial change. Let's try to explore what would be required for that shift to be more than just a fantasy - what would need to be true for you, in this moment, for the voice to actually transform into a more pragmatic, supportive one? Can you think of a specific, concrete situation where you're already living into that tone and function, even if it's just for a small moment?

Patient: There was one concrete time last month during a code review where my inner voice actually sounded like a helpful reviewer — pointing out an edge case and saying, "add a test for this," and I fixed it without spiraling. For that half hour it was pragmatic, quiet, even a little satisfied, but it vanished after the meeting. How is that supposed to become my default instead of an occasional glitch? I keep thinking only concrete systems — rituals, enforced check-ins, automated tests — will make it stick, not just noticing or imagining the tone.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to sustain that moment of clarity and pragmatism, and not just have it disappear when the situation changes. Let's try to explore what would be required for that moment to feel like a default - what would need to be true for you, in this moment, for the tone and function of your inner voice to stay that way, even when the situation shifts? Can you think of what would be the underlying sense of self that would allow that pragmatism to be more than just a temporary phenomenon?

Patient: I guess it would mean seeing myself as someone who can be competent and still make mistakes — that my value isn't tied to every slip-up — and being able to sit with grief without turning it into self-punishment. It'd also mean trusting external scaffolding (rituals, checks, peers) enough that I don't have to police myself constantly. But honestly — how does that identity actually get built instead of being another thing I try and fail at? Can we brainstorm concrete, small steps that would make that shift feel inevitable for someone like me?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a fundamental shift in how you see yourself and your relationship with yourself and others. I'm glad we're getting to this point. Let's take a step back and look at the entire process we've explored so far. What if, instead of focusing on changing your inner voice or behaviors, we explored what would need to be true for you, in this moment, to start to feel like that identity is already present, like it's not something you're trying to achieve but rather something you're already embodying? Can you imagine what that would feel like, and what small steps you could take to start to embody that feeling, even if it's just for a tiny moment?

Patient: If I could feel that identity already, it'd be a quiet steadiness — my chest would unclench sooner, mistakes would read like bug tickets to fix, and grief would be a sad thing I sit with instead of proof I'm worthless. 

Concrete tiny steps that might make that real: tie habits to existing routines (two-minute morning check-in while my kettle boils; one-sentence end-of-day "what went okay" note), enforce external scaffolding (commit hooks/tests, a 15-min weekly peer check-in on calendar), and a tiny grief ritual (five minutes after lunch to name one memory). 

But I'm skeptical — I've tried rituals and they disappear when I'm flat-out tired. How do we make these steps truly unavoidable for someone like me, not just another thing I fail at?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make these steps feel inevitable, so they don't get pushed to the side when you're not feeling your best. Let's try to explore what would need to be true for those small steps to become a kind of automatic response, rather than something you have to remember to do. Can you think of what would need to be true for you, in this moment, for those steps to feel like a kind of default, like your body and mind are already wired to do them without needing to be reminded?

Patient: I guess a few things would need to be true: the steps have to be low-friction and automated (commit hooks, calendar nudges, tiny habit links to things I already do), there has to be regular external accountability (a peer or scheduled check-in), and immediate, concrete feedback so accomplishments register as real—not just airy self-talk. That would cut down on willpower and make the behavior the default, so my identity shifts by repetition instead of by argument. But I'm skeptical — how is any of that actually going to quiet the critic when I'm exhausted and grieving, and can we pick one tiny thing to try right now that's actually doable for me?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make those steps feel like a kind of muscle memory, so they can happen automatically even when you're not feeling your best. Let's try to focus on one tiny thing that you can do right now, in this moment, to start to feel like those steps are already happening. Can you take one tiny step right now, without thinking about it, to make one of those steps feel more automatic? For example, can you commit to checking in with yourself for just one minute, right now, to see how you're feeling?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the one-minute check-in. For the minute I noticed a shallow breath, a clamp across my ribs, my hands cooling, and that humiliating school scene sliding back in with the voice saying I'm a fraud; underneath it all was a dull, hollow ache. That was... hard to hold without the replay taking over — how is this supposed to help when it barely sticks?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like taking that one minute to check in was a tiny bit of resistance to the replay, but not enough to completely disrupt it. That's okay. It's not about eliminating the replay entirely, but about creating a small space between you and the replay, so you can start to see it as something that's happening, rather than being you. Can you hold onto that sense of the check-in, even after the minute is up, and see if you can bring it back to yourself, like a small anchor, when the replay starts again?

Patient: I can hold that check-in for a few breaths, but it feels fragile — as soon as the replay ramps up it vanishes. If anything's going to stick for me it has to be tied to something concrete, like a calendar ping or a commit hook or the kettle whistling. Can we make a one-line anchor right now I can pair with an existing routine so it's actually automated? I'm skeptical it'll work, but I'll try it.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's create a tiny anchor that you can pair with something concrete. Can you think of a small phrase, just one word or a few words, that you can say to yourself whenever the replay starts, something that's short and simple, and that might help you bring back the sense of the check-in? For example, "okay", "pause", or "acknowledge"? Let's try pairing it with an existing routine, like the kettle whistling, and see if it sticks.

Patient: Okay — I'll try "just a bug" as the anchor. When the kettle whistles I'll say "just a bug," take one breath, and try a one-line note. 

I'm jumpy right now and skeptical — how is that supposed to help when the replay slams in? Still, I'll try it next time the kettle goes.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're taking a small step, even if it's just a tiny one. Remember, it's not about the anchor itself, but about creating a small gap between you and the replay, so you can start to see it as something that's happening, rather than being you. The fact that you're willing to try, even when you're jumpy and skeptical, is already a huge step. Let's just focus on getting through the next time the kettle whistles, and see what happens. Can you commit to doing that, just for the next time?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it the next time the kettle whistles. I'll say "just a bug," take one breath, and try a one-line note, but I'm running on fumes and already worried I'll blank out when the replay hits. If it doesn't work, can we plan a concrete fallback — like a phone ping or a quick peer check-in — because honestly I don't trust this to stick on its own?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit exhausted and worried that it might not work. Having a concrete fallback plan can be helpful in case the anchor doesn't stick. Let's plan for that. What's one small thing you can do in the next hour, like sending a quick text to a peer or making a phone call, that would give you a sense of external support and help you feel less alone if the anchor doesn't work?

Patient: I can send a one-line text to a trusted colleague in the next hour: "Hey — any chance you have 10 mins today? Feeling off and could use a quick check-in." 

I'm jumpy and distracted right now and I hate bothering people, so if they don't reply, can we plan a concrete fallback — like a calendar ping to do a 2-min journaling or a quick message in our dev chat asking for someone to ping me? I don't trust this to stick on its own.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're thinking ahead and planning for a concrete backup plan. Having a clear plan in place can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more supported. For the fallback plan, let's make it even more concrete. Can you commit to sending a message to your colleague within the next 10 minutes, even if you're feeling jumpy or distracted? That way, you'll have taken a small action towards reaching out for support, and you'll have a clear plan to fall back on if the anchor doesn't stick.

Patient: Alright — I'll send that text in ten minutes: "Hey — any chance you have 10 mins today? Feeling off and could use a quick check-in." I'm running on fumes and hate bothering people, so if they don't reply let's plan a fallback now — a calendar ping in 20 minutes for 2-min journaling and a quick dev-chat post asking someone to ping me. I don't trust this to stick, but I'll try.

It sounds like you're feeling a sense of responsibility to take action and follow through on your plan. Remember that it's okay if the anchor doesn't stick immediately - the goal is to create a small gap between you and the replay, and to start to build a sense of resilience. When you send that text to your colleague, take a moment to breathe and notice how you're feeling. Can you take one more small step to make sure you follow through? Can you commit to doing the 2-minute journaling exercise when the calendar ping goes off in 20 minutes?

Patient: Alright — I'll do the 2-minute journaling when the ping goes off in 20 minutes. I'm jittery and worried I'll blank or ignore it, so can we make the prompt stupidly simple? Like: "One small thing that went okay today." 

If I still don't do it, let's have the fallback ready: I'll post a quick dev-chat message asking someone to ping me. I'm trying, but I'm skeptical this will actually stick when the replay hits.

It sounds like you're trying to simplify the prompt to reduce anxiety. That's a great approach. Remember, the goal is not to solve everything in one session, but to start small and build momentum. When the calendar ping goes off, take a deep breath and look at the prompt: "One small thing that went okay today". Can you commit to just writing that down, even if it feels silly or insignificant?

Patient: Okay — I’ll do it when the ping goes off and write “One small thing that went okay today,” even if it’s a dumb scribble. I’m running on fumes and jittery, so if I blank I’ll post in dev-chat asking someone to ping me. But seriously — how is a tiny note supposed to slow the replay when I’m this exhausted?

It sounds like you're feeling exhausted and struggling to stay focused. Remember that the tiny note isn't about stopping the replay entirely, but about creating a small gap between you and the replay. It's like taking a tiny step back from the replay, just for a moment, to see if you can catch your breath and re-center. The replay might come back, but by the time it does, you might feel more grounded and able to handle it. Can you try to focus on getting through this tiny step, rather than worrying about the replay?

Patient: I'll try to focus on the tiny step and do the two‑minute note when the ping goes off, though I'm jittery and half-expecting to freeze. If I blank, can you give me a super-simple fallback message to post in dev-chat so I won't have to think?

It sounds like you're feeling really anxious about freezing or blanking. Okay, for the fallback message, how about just a simple "stuck" - that way you can post it quickly and quietly without having to think too much. As for blunting the replay, I'm not saying it will eliminate it entirely, but sometimes these small steps can help you feel more in control and more able to handle the replay. Even if it's just for a tiny moment, you might be able to find a bit more space to breathe. Let's focus on getting you through this next tiny step, okay?

Patient: Okay. I'll try the two‑minute note when the ping goes off, and if I blank I'll post "stuck" in dev‑chat so someone might ping me. I'm jittery and not convinced it'll do much, but I'll try — if nobody replies, can we plan a next step I can do right away?

If you do get a response from your colleague, that's great, but if not, we can plan a next step you can do right away. How about taking a few deep breaths and noticing where you are in your body right now, without judgment? Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try. Took a slow breath — felt the tiniest ease in my chest and my shoulders dropped a hair, but the clamp and that school scene are still waiting at the edges.

It sounds like the breathing helped a tiny bit, but the replay is still present. That's okay. Remember that breathing is not a magic bullet, but it can help create a small gap between you and the replay. Since it didn't hold, let's move to the concrete fallback. You said you'd post "stuck" in dev-chat if you blanked. Can you do that right now, just for a moment, and see what happens? It might be a small act of self-care, and it's a tangible thing you can do to take care of yourself.
