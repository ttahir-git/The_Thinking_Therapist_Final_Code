Patient: Hey, I'm unemployed and lately I've been stuck in this loop where I'm totally consumed with worrying about how I'll perform when I finally get a job. The minute I think about applying or interviewing, my brain shoots straight to the worst-case: I freeze, get hired, mess up, get fired, end up in debt, and never recover—so I just procrastinate everything instead. I know it sounds dramatic, but those disaster-movies feel totally inevitable and I can't shake them.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a really tough and anxious place to be. Can you tell me more about what's going on when you say those disaster-movies show up for you? What specifically is it about those thoughts that feels so vivid and inevitable?

Patient: It's like a super vivid movie in my head — I see myself in an interview, my hands shaking, I say something stupid, they hire me because it's quick, I mess up a project, they fire me, my savings disappear, I can't pay rent, and everything just spirals. It feels inevitable because the scenes are so detailed and emotional, like proof, and any thought about a different outcome just doesn't feel real. When that movie starts I shut down and procrastinate on applying or prepping because I can't face the whole collapse I picture.

Therapist Answer:
Those vivid images seem to be quite distressing. It's like your mind is conjuring up a whole scenario that feels incredibly plausible. It sounds like the emotions and sensations associated with those thoughts are also quite strong. Can you tell me what happens to your body when those thoughts start playing out in your mind?

Patient: My chest tightens and my heart starts pounding, my stomach turns into this cold knot, and my hands shake so much I can't type or hold a pen. Then my brain fogs up — words disappear, I can't think straight — and I literally feel like I'm watching that disaster-movie in my body. It all feels like proof that the collapse is coming, so I just shut down and put everything off.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your whole body is responding to those thoughts as if they were already happening. That physical tension and fogginess can be really debilitating. It's like your body is on high alert, preparing for a potential disaster. What do you think would happen if you were to acknowledge that you're feeling that kind of physical response right now, instead of getting caught up in the thoughts themselves?

Patient: I’ve tried that — like saying to myself, “okay, my chest is tight, I’m trembling,” and it sort of calms me for a few seconds. But almost immediately the movie keeps playing and I use those sensations as proof the disaster is coming, so I start arguing with myself that noticing won’t change anything. Then I get frustrated and either shut down or scroll away because sitting with it feels unbearable.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like noticing the physical sensations can be a bit of a double-edged sword. It provides some temporary relief, but then the thoughts just come back. It's like the thoughts are already so entrenched that it's hard to shake them off, even when you try to focus on the physical sensations. Would it be possible to try a slightly different approach with those physical sensations, though? Instead of trying to calm them down, what if you were to say to yourself, "Okay, my chest is tight, my hands are shaking, and I'm feeling anxious" - just acknowledge them, without trying to change them?

Patient: I do try that—saying, “okay, my chest is tight,”—and it calms me for like five seconds, but then the movie jumps right back in: I freeze in the interview, they hire me to fill the seat, I ruin the project, get fired, lose my savings, and everything collapses. I get so frustrated when labeling doesn’t stop the story that I either shut down or start scrolling, and honestly I'm not sure where to go from here — it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like labeling the physical sensations is helping to temporarily disengage from the thoughts, but the thoughts are still able to come back quickly. This can feel really frustrating and helpless. It's like you're not making progress, even though you're trying. What if, instead of labeling the sensations and trying to change them, you were to explore what's happening when you try to let go of those thoughts? What's it feel like when you start to drift away from the story, but then it pulls you back in?

Patient: When I actually start to let go there's this tiny lightness, like maybe I can do it, but then one little cue — a tone in my head, a memory of a past flub, the word "what if" — and the whole disaster-movie slams back in like a tidal wave. My heart spikes, my thoughts latch onto every tiny detail as "proof," and I immediately feel stupid for even trying to relax, so I either freeze or scroll to escape. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but honestly that just feels naive — the bad ending is the only one that actually makes sense to me.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you let your guard down, even for a brief instant, the thoughts can quickly overwhelm you again. It's like the thoughts have a way of hijacking your attention and turning those tiny moments of hope into proof of the worst-case scenario. It's also interesting that you mention feeling stupid for trying to relax - it's like there's a sense of shame or inadequacy that comes up. Would you be willing to explore what that shame might be about, and what values might be driving that sense of inadequacy?

Patient: I think the shame comes from this idea that I should be competent and not be a burden — like I grew up needing to prove myself, so any slip feels like proof I'm worthless. I really value independence, reliability, and not letting people down, which is why the thought of messing up at a job feels so catastrophic. But then the movie kicks in: I stumble, they quietly keep me only to fire me later, I blow a project, my savings vanish, friends bail, landlords come after me, and I'm basically ruined — so other outcomes just feel naive and I freeze instead of applying.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those values of independence, reliability, and not letting people down are really important to you. It's like you're feeling like your worth is tied to being able to perform and maintain those values. That can create a lot of pressure. And the way you describe the catastrophic outcomes, it's like you're experiencing them in a really visceral way. Would it be possible to try to imagine what it might be like if you were to take a small step towards those values, even if it felt imperfect or uncertain - not necessarily trying to avoid the worst-case scenario, but more about exploring what might happen if you were to take a small risk?

Patient: I can imagine taking a tiny step—like applying to one job or practicing an answer—but as soon as I do my brain films the whole disaster: I get the call, choke in the interview, they hire me out of convenience, I tank the first project, get fired, lose my savings, and I'm even more screwed than before. I know that sounds extreme, but other outcomes just don't feel real to me, so picturing a small win feels like lying to myself and I end up procrastinating again. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like even imagining a small win or success feels like a form of deception to you, because the worst-case scenario is still the one that feels most plausible. That can be a really tough place to be. It's like the default is to expect the worst, and it's hard to imagine a different outcome. What if, instead of focusing on the potential worst-case scenario, you were to explore what would be required for you to feel like you've taken a step in the right direction? What would need to happen for you to start to feel like you're moving towards your values, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: Maybe if I could break it into tiny, specific steps—apply to one job this week, practice answers twice, have a friend check in afterward, and a little emergency fund so it doesn't feel life-or-death—I might feel like I’m actually moving toward those values. But the second I picture that, the disaster-movie takes over: I choke, they hire me out of pity, I ruin everything, lose savings, and everyone bails, so all those plans feel pointless and I just freeze or scroll. I'm trying to see how this would help, but honestly I'm stuck and it's really frustrating.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to break down the steps into smaller, manageable pieces, which might help make the process feel less overwhelming. But as soon as you try to imagine success, the worst-case scenario reasserts itself. It's like the more you focus on the potential steps, the more the thoughts are able to hijack your attention again. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome or imagine success, you were to focus on the sensation of taking that first step - the physical sensation of picking up your phone to apply for a job, or sitting down to practice answers? What if you were to explore what happens to your body and mind in that moment, without trying to evaluate the outcome?

Patient: When I actually try to focus on the moment my body goes loud — hands sweaty, chest tight, breath shallow, stomach in knots, and my head gets foggy like someone dimmed the lights. For a split second I can feel my fingers reach for the phone, there's this tiny flicker of "okay maybe," but then the disaster-movie bulldozes back in and those physical signs turn into proof: I freeze in the interview, they hire me out of pity, I blow the first project, lose my savings, and everything collapses. Trying to stay with the sensations just feels pointless because the scenes are so vivid, and I get angry at myself for even trying so I end up scrolling or shutting down — honestly I'm overwhelmed and not sure where to go from here.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like, even for a brief moment, you're able to access the physical sensations that come up when you're trying to take action. That's a good start. It's like you're able to get a glimpse of the experience, even if it's uncomfortable. Would you be willing to explore what's happening when you get angry at yourself for trying to stay with the sensations? What is it about that feeling of anger that's so intense, and what might happen if you were to try to approach it with kindness, rather than self-criticism?

Patient: The anger feels like a guard — it screams don't get soft because if I let kindness in I'll slack off and then the whole movie happens: they hire me, I choke, I ruin everything, I lose my savings. Being kind to myself just feels dishonest and like it will make the disaster more likely, so I snap at myself and then numb out or scroll away.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the anger serves as a protective mechanism, a way to keep you from feeling vulnerable or soft. It's like you're trying to safeguard yourself from the possibility of not being able to handle the potential consequences. What if, instead of trying to push the anger away or numb out, you were to explore what it might be like to hold the anger, but not as a guard against vulnerability, but rather as a signal that something is needed? What if you were to ask yourself, "What is it about being kind to myself that's making me so scared or uncomfortable?"

Patient: Because being kind feels like handing the keys to that movie — if I cut myself slack, I’ll get sloppy, choke in an interview, get hired out of pity, tank a project, get fired, lose my savings, and everything collapses. So I snap at myself instead; being gentle feels dishonest and I don’t know how to trust it, so I just shut down or scroll.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like kindness feels like a kind of surrender, giving in to the worst-case scenario. You're right, it can feel dishonest if you're not careful, like you're not doing enough to prepare or be responsible. What if, instead of trying to be gentle or kind, you were to explore what it would be like to take a tiny step towards kindness, even if it feels like a betrayal of your own judgment? For example, what if, in the moment you feel the anger and the fear, you simply acknowledge it, without judgment, and then say to yourself, "I'm going to take a tiny step towards kindness, just for a second, to see what happens"?

Patient: If I let myself be kind for even a second it feels like I’m handing the keys to that whole disaster-movie—I'll slack, choke in the interview, get hired out of pity, tank the project, and end up worse than before. I can try it, but I'm feeling really worn out and overwhelmed right now—can we slow down a bit?

Patient: Okay... I can try a few breaths. I breathe in, out — for a second my shoulders drop and the knot loosens, but then the disaster-movie sneaks back in and I'm picturing choking in the interview and everything collapsing.
