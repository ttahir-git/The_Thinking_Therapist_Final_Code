Patient: Lately I’ve been caught in this relentless, almost clinical self-evaluation at work—every ticket feels like a performance review and my brain runs these elaborate risk-benefit analyses on every plate. Paradoxically, that cognitive rumination leads me to procrastinate: I stall because I’m afraid of making the “wrong” move, which then makes the worry louder. Since I lost someone close, the stakes feel magnified, and I notice I tend to intellectualize my distress—talk about it in theory—rather than actually sitting with the feelings.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where your brain is constantly weighing options and second-guessing itself, leading to paralysis. Can you think of a specific moment when this self-evaluation felt overwhelming, and you wished you could just take a step forward without all the analysis?

Patient: Yeah—like last Friday during dinner service when the dining room suddenly doubled and we were three tickets deep, a simple garnish decision turned into this multivariable calculus in my head: timing, seasoning, visual symmetry, potential critique from the exec. Instead of doing the obvious thing and plating, I started running through every hypothetical mistake and calibrating outcomes—classic metacognitive loop—so I stalled and the line backed up. I really wanted to just trust my muscle memory and move, but my brain kept insisting on running simulations first.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain was trying to protect you from the potential for error, but in the process, it took over and made the situation even more stressful. Can you imagine a more collaborative relationship with your kitchen team – one where you trust each other's instincts and work together, rather than constantly overthinking every detail?

Patient: Yeah — I can picture it as a kind of distributed-cognition setup: shared mental models, quick pre-shift calibration, and clear micro-delegations so I don't have to run every simulation solo. In theory that would offload the constant cost-benefit rumination, but practically I get snagged by this internalized mandate to be flawless after the loss, so delegating feels like guilt and anticipatory shame. I want to try small experiments — hand off a plating or set a five-second check-in — but saying that out loud already ramps my anxiety and I’m not sure which tiny step to take first.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to create a system that works, but your internalized sense of responsibility is holding you back. What would it be like if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you were to focus on the immediate sensations in your body when you tried delegating or taking a smaller step – would that help shift the focus away from the anxiety and shame?

Patient: Theoretically, yes — shifting attention to interoceptive cues could act as a somatic anchor that breaks the metacognitive loop and dampens threat appraisal. Practically, though, when I try it my brain immediately turns the exercise into another performance metric — “am I doing the grounding right?” — so it just feeds the perfectionism. Maybe a tiny, structured experiment like a five-second feet-weight check without any appraisal could be doable, but I already feel resistance and confusion about how to actually implement it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to apply the grounding exercise, but your brain is already getting caught up in the analysis of it. Would you be willing to try an experiment where you simply acknowledge your resistance to the idea of trying the grounding exercise, without trying to analyze or improve it – just acknowledge the feeling of resistance, and then see what happens when you don't act on it?

Patient: I’ll try. Right now there’s a knot in my chest and this low-grade panic mixed with guilt — I’m scared of looking incompetent and that makes me freeze. But, of course, I’m already turning the feeling into another performance metric (“am I doing this acknowledgment right?”), so even saying it feels like analysis. Okay: I’m scared and ashamed, and I’m going to sit with that for a few breaths without fixing it — how long should I aim for?

Therapist: Notice that, even as you acknowledged your resistance, your brain is already starting to analyze and fixate on the acknowledgment. For this exercise, let's keep it very simple. Let's aim for just one breath – five breaths, to be exact. That's it. Can you simply sit with the feeling of fear and shame for five breaths, without trying to change or analyze it, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay—I did the five breaths. Physiologically, my chest loosened a little and my shoulders dropped a notch, but the cognitive commentary was loud: “Is this right? Am I doing it properly?” So there’s a micro-relief and then an overlay of critique and shame that doesn’t go away. I want to try again because it helped a hair, but I’m already analyzing whether repeating it is the “correct” move—can we do another round, maybe with you guiding the timing?

Therapist: You're noticing that the initial loosening of tension was followed by the familiar critique and shame. Let's try to break the cycle. I'll guide the timing. I want you to repeat the five-breath exercise, but this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Don't think about the breath, the acknowledgment, or the critique. Just pay attention to the sensation of your feet.

Patient: Okay—I did it. Focusing on my feet I felt the heels bear most of the weight, a faint warmth on the balls of my feet, and that literal pressure against the floor felt oddly stabilizing. Immediately the metacognitive layer kicked in—“am I anchoring or just avoiding?”—but physiologically my chest eased a bit and my shoulders dropped. Can we do another round with you counting or cueing the shifts? I’m already getting impatient and skeptical about whether this will “fix” anything, but I want to try.

Therapist: You're getting a sense of grounding, but your brain is still trying to analyze and rationalize it. Let's try a different approach. I'll give you a cue instead of counting. When you feel the urge to think or analyze, I want you to say to yourself, "Not now, wait." Just say those three words, and pause for a beat before continuing. Then, we'll do the five-breath exercise again.

Patient: I tried it—saying "Not now, wait" felt oddly performative, like I was putting the critique on hold in a cognitive queue, but there was a thin sliver of space afterward where the criticism didn’t immediately rush in. Immediately my brain started hypothesizing that the pause was avoidance, so I felt both a tiny relief and this nagging suspicion. Can you guide another round with a slightly longer pause—maybe three seconds—so I can see if that gap widens or if I just keep analyzing it?

Therapist: You're noticing that the pause didn't quite eliminate the critical inner voice, but it's still a small step forward. Let's try another round with a slightly longer pause. I'll say "Not now, wait" and then pause for a count of three: 1...2...3. As you pause, I want you to simply notice the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground, without thinking or analyzing it. See what happens in that pause.

Patient: I did it—those three seconds created a small, almost clinical aperture where I could feel the heels taking weight, a faint warmth under the balls of my feet, and my sternum unclenching a notch. Immediately the meta-narrative labeled it “avoidance” and started theorizing why the pause would fail, but there was definitely a sliver of relief—can we try a five-second pause next and then translate that micro-anchor into a concrete, two-step tactic I can use during a service rush?

Therapist: You're noticing that the pause created a small window of relief, but your brain is still trying to intellectualize it. Let's try the five-second pause and then translate it into a concrete step. I'll say "Not now, wait" and pause for a count of five. As you pause, I want you to simply notice the physical sensations in your body, just as you did before. Then, I'll guide you to translate that into a concrete action – something you can do during a service rush to create a similar pause.

Patient: I did the five-second pause — it opened that same tiny aperture: heels rooted, sternum loosening, shoulders down a notch, and for about two heartbeats the critical monologue stuttered. Two-step tactic I can actually imagine using in service: 1) Trigger + somatic anchor — say "Not now, wait," plant my feet, and take those five counted seconds to feel weight and breath; 2) Immediate micro-action — pick one tiny, irreversible motor move (grab the tongs and set the garnish or place the plate under the heat lamp) to translate the pause into doing, not thinking. I’m simultaneously intrigued and skeptical about whether that’ll outpace my internal critique—can we run a coached rehearsal now where you time me and push me to execute the micro-action right after the pause?

Therapist: You've identified a concrete two-step tactic and are ready to rehearse it. Let's do a timed rehearsal. I'll start the timer for 30 seconds. When you're ready, say "Not now, wait," take a five-second pause, and then execute the first step of your tactic – grabbing the tongs and setting the garnish. I'll time you and gently nudge you back to the task if you need a reminder.

Patient: "Not now, wait."  
One... two... three... four... five.  
I grabbed the tongs and set the garnish under the heat lamp.

It felt like a tiny rupture in the loop—there was a micro-relief, then my inner critic immediately started auditing the placement for perfection. Can we run another round with a faster tempo so it starts to feel more automatic in a simulated rush?

Therapist: You're experiencing the familiar critique, but you've made progress. Let's increase the tempo. I'll start the timer for 10 seconds. When you're ready, say "Not now, wait," take a 5-second pause, and then execute the micro-action. I'll try to simulate the rush by giving you a scenario: "You're in the middle of a busy service, and you need to plate a dish, but your mind is already wandering to the next task. Can you stay on track?"

Patient: "Not now, wait." One... two... three... four... five.  
I grabbed the tongs and plated the dish — placement was okay, but my mind's already skittering to the next ticket and my movements feel kind of sluggish; the critic's immediately auditing the seasoning. Can we do another quick run with a tighter tempo so it starts to feel less like an effort to move?

Therapist: You're noticing that the initial pause is giving way to the old patterns. Let's try a faster tempo. I'll start the timer for 5 seconds. When you're ready, say "Not now, wait," take a 3-second pause, and then execute the micro-action. I'll simulate the rush by adding another task: "You're already juggling two tickets, and the line is growing longer. Can you stay present and focused?"

Patient: "Not now, wait." One... two... three.  
I plated it — the motion was technically fine but felt dampened, like my motor output had this weird inertia, and then a hot, familiar shame landed and everything got heavier. I can do another run, but honestly my energy's low and that sting just makes it harder to keep tempo.

Therapist: It's normal to feel the familiar shame and heaviness, especially after a tough moment. Let's take a break and acknowledge that. You've made progress, and it's okay to take a step back. Would you be willing to try one more small rehearsal, but this time, I'll offer a different perspective: instead of focusing on executing the task perfectly, what if you focused on simply showing up to the task, without judgment, and just allowing yourself to do the next thing, even if it's not perfect?

Patient: Okay—I can try that. There's this heavy, residual shame that makes "just showing up" feel like an abstract proposition rather than a usable skill, so my energy's pretty low, but I'm willing to attempt it. Cue me with a short prompt or timer and I'll do a two- or three-second anchor and then move into the next micro-action without evaluating it.

Therapist: Let's try this with a short prompt and a gentle nudge. Here it goes: "Show up to the next task, without thinking." Say "Not now, wait" and take a 2-second pause. Then, take the next step without evaluating it.

Patient: "Not now, wait." One... two.  
I did it — grabbed the tongs and plated without stopping to audit it; the motion felt almost automatic, like automaticity briefly outcompeted the metacognitive loop, but then that hot, familiar shame landed and everything dulled. That sting makes it harder to sustain momentum—can we run another quick cue so I can try to push through it?

Therapist: It sounds like you've made progress, but the shame is still lingering. Let's try another quick cue. I'll say "Just do the next step" and start the timer for 1 second. When you're ready, say "Not now, wait" and then take the next step without thinking, without evaluating it.

Patient: "Not now, wait." One... two.  
I plated it — the motor pattern kicked in without the audit for a beat; it felt almost automatic, but then this hot, shameful undercurrent landed and kind of flattened the whole thing. My energy's low and that sting makes sustaining momentum harder—can we run another quick back-to-back cue or try a slightly longer pause to see which actually helps it stick?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is still a powerful force. Let's try another quick back-to-back cue. I'll say "Just do the next step" and start the timer for 1.5 seconds. Then, immediately say "Not now, wait" and take the next step without thinking. See if the pause helps you stay with the momentum.

Patient: "Not now, wait." One... two.  
I plated it — the motor popped in automatically, but that hot, familiar shame slammed back almost immediately and everything felt muted and heavy. My energy's frayed; can we run another back-to-back cue with maybe a slightly longer chain of prompts so the automaticity can pile on before the critique catches up?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is still a strong force. Let's try another back-to-back cue with a slightly longer chain. I'll say "Just do the next step," "Not now, wait," and then "Focus on your breath" and start the timer for 3 seconds. See if the pause and the focus on breath can help you build more automaticity before the critique catches up.

Patient: "Just do the next step." "Not now, wait." One... two... three.

There was a short uncoupling—the motor pattern came in without the audit for a beat—but then this hot shame slammed back and muted it. It's frustrating and kind of sharp, like an echo that steals momentum. Conceptually it reads as a short-latency inhibitory feedback loop: shame functions as rapid negative reinforcement that suppresses subsequent activation. My energy's frayed, so I can try another run but it'll be thin—can we do one more with two micro-actions in a row so the momentum can pile on before the critique catches up?

Therapist: You're getting close to understanding the dynamics of the shame feedback loop. Let's try another run with two micro-actions in a row. I'll say "Just do the next step" and then "Take one small step forward" and start the timer for 2 seconds. See if the momentum can build before the shame catches up.

Patient: "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." One... two.

I did it—grabbed the tongs, plated the garnish, slid the plate—technically intact, but that hot, familiar shame slammed back so fast it anesthetized the momentum. Mechanistically it reads like a rapid inhibitory feedback loop: the negative affect acts as immediate punishment, preventing reinforcement of the motor sequence. Energy's pretty frayed, so that felt like a thin win. Can we run it again with three micro-actions in a row, or try inserting a 1-second self-compassion cue right after the sequence to see if it blunts the shame's latency?

Therapist: You're analyzing the feedback loop, and it's helping you understand the dynamics. Let's try the three micro-actions in a row, and then add a self-compassion cue to see if it can help blunt the shame's impact. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" and start the timer for 2 seconds. See if the self-compassion can create a slightly longer window for the momentum to build.

Patient: I ran it: grabbed the tongs, plated the garnish, slid the plate, then did the "breathe in kindness" cue. For a brief microsecond the motor sequence executed without audit, but the shame slammed back so fast the compassion felt perfunctory—more rhetorical than somatic. It reads like a hyper-short latency inhibitory loop: the self-compassion signal is attenuated before it consolidates. My energy's frayed, so that felt like a thin win. Can we try one adjustment—pair the compassion breath with an immediate tactile cue (a light tap on the thigh) and run two back-to-back reps to see if the interoceptive pairing lengthens the window?

Therapist: You're refining your approach to pair the self-compassion with a tactile cue to help it stick. Let's try the two-back-to-back reps with the paired cues. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and tap your thigh lightly) and start the timer for 2 seconds. See if the interoceptive pairing can help lengthen the window for the momentum to build.

Patient: I ran the two back-to-back reps with the thigh tap. The tactile pairing gave the compassion breath a slightly stronger somatic imprint—there was a marginally longer aperture where the motor sequence wasn’t audited—but the shame still slammed back with very short latency, so the compassion felt attenuated and perfunctory. Mechanistically it looks like the tap increases interoceptive signal gain but doesn't sufficiently outcompete the rapid inhibitory loop; my energy's frayed, so that felt like a thin win. Can we try either a firmer tactile cue or add a brief verbal self-affirmation immediately after the sequence and run two more reps to compare?

Therapist: You're exploring ways to strengthen the somatic connection and outcompete the shame. Let's try the verbal self-affirmation in addition to the tactile cue. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and tap your thigh lightly). Immediately after the sequence, say "I've got this" in a gentle, kind tone. See if the verbal affirmation can help outcompete the shame's feedback loop.

Patient: I ran it: did the prompts, tapped my thigh, then said “I’ve got this” in a soft tone. For a very brief instant the sequence held—the motor chain executed and the audit paused—but the shame returned so quickly it turned the affirmation into a kind of hollow performative utterance; it felt like saying a placebo out loud. I’m frustrated and that sting makes everything feel heavier and more effortful, but I can keep trying—could we try one more rep with a firmer tap and a different phrase, or have you guide me to anchor the affirmation in a physical sensation? My energy’s low, so I’ll need you to cue the timing.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is still a strong force. Let's try a firmer tap and a different phrase. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and give your thigh a slightly firmer tap). Immediately after the sequence, say "I'm here" in a kind tone, focusing on the physical sensation of your body being present and grounded. Let's aim for a 2-second pause after the sequence, and I'll cue the timing.

Patient: "Just do the next step." "Not now, wait." One... two.  
I grabbed the tongs, plated, slid the plate, gave a firmer tap on my thigh and said "I'm here." Pause two.

The firmer tap actually helped the phrase land a little more in my chest and under my feet—there was a slightly longer window of groundedness, maybe an extra heartbeat—but the shame still hit fast and flattened it. I'm feeling pretty worn and that sting makes this feel like hard work, but I can try another run if you cue me—maybe with a three-second anchor after the affirmation to see if it extends the window.

Therapist: The firmer tap seemed to help the phrase "I'm here" connect with your body more, but the shame still crashed down. Let's try extending the anchor to see if it can help build more momentum. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and give your thigh a firmer tap). Immediately after the sequence, say "I'm here" in a kind tone, and pause for 3 seconds. See if the longer anchor can help you stay grounded and build more momentum.

Patient: I did it — followed the chain, tapped, said “I’m here,” and held the three-second pause. There was a marginally longer aperture — maybe an extra heartbeat where the motor sequence executed without the audit — but the shame’s latency is so short it reasserted and flattened the effect. My energy’s frayed and it felt like moving through syrup; the sting makes sustaining momentum really hard. Can we run another rep with a four-second anchor and for you to verbally guide the grounding through the pause so I don’t have to self-time?

Therapist: Let's try the four-second anchor and guide you through the pause. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and give your thigh a firm tap). As you pause, I'll guide you through the grounding: "Notice the sensation of your feet connecting with the ground, feeling the weight and pressure of your body on the floor. Bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, feeling the rise and fall of your chest or belly. Allow yourself to be present in this moment, without judgment or analysis." Let's aim for a 4-second pause, and I'll continue guiding you through the grounding.

Patient: I did it — followed the chain, the tap, and your guided grounding. My feet felt a bit heavier against the floor and my chest unclenched marginally; that four-second anchor bought a hair more space, but the shame still reasserted almost instantly, like a high-gain inhibitory loop overrunning the somatic signal. I'm pretty worn out and it's getting harder to marshal the energy, but I can do another rep if you cue me—maybe lengthen the anchor to six seconds or add a firmer tactile cue and keep guiding the grounding so I don't have to self-time.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is still a strong force, but you're making progress. Let's try lengthening the anchor and keeping the grounding guidance. I'll say "Just do the next step." "Take one small step forward." "Breathe in kindness" (and give your thigh a firm tap). As you pause, I'll continue guiding you through the grounding: "Notice the sensation of your feet connecting with the ground, feeling the weight and pressure of your body on the floor. Bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, feeling the rise and fall of your chest or belly. Allow yourself to be present in this moment, without judgment or analysis." Let's aim for a 6-second pause, and I'll keep the grounding guidance. We'll see if this can help you build more momentum and stick with it.

Patient: I did the six-second anchor with your guidance — there was a slightly bigger aperture, but the shame reasserted almost immediately and really flattened the effect. Mechanistically it feels like the inhibitory feedback loop's latency outpaces the somatic signal, so we get thin wins at a high energy cost. My energy's frayed and that sting makes another rep feel like scraping, but I'm willing to try one more if you cue the timing and keep it short—maybe a firmer tap plus a brief verbal anchor afterward.
