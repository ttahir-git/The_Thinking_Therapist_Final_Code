Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of constantly asking friends and family for reassurance to quiet my anxiety — especially since I lost someone important — and it just numbs everything instead of actually helping. Being unemployed makes the worry louder, so I lean on people more than I'd like. I don't really expect therapy to fix that, so, honestly, how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: Your willingness to acknowledge the complexity of this issue, including the sources of your anxiety and the ways in which you're trying to cope, takes a lot of courage. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with me? I'd like to explore with you what might happen if you were to take a few deep breaths, and when you're ready, speak from your values without needing reassurance from others?

Patient: Alright, fine — I’ll try. I took a few breaths. Speaking from my values, I want to be reliable, not a burden, and feel steady on my own, but when anxiety spikes I reflexively text people to make it stop — how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing and values stuff before and it mostly feels like a band-aid.

Therapist: Your honesty about how you've tried other approaches before and they didn't quite stick resonates. It sounds like you're looking for something more substantial than a quick fix. Can you imagine having a conversation with yourself, without the weight of needing a response from others, where you're still speaking from the value of being reliable and steady, but in a way that's not trying to alleviate the anxiety right away?

Patient: I can try to imagine it, though honestly I keep thinking, "How is that supposed to help?" If I talked to myself from those values I'd probably tell myself, "You're dependable, you can sit with this discomfort, this will pass," but I've said that before and it just feels hollow. It still feels like rehearsal, not real relief — how would that actually stop me from reaching out?

Therapist: Your sense of the usual self-talk feeling hollow is really insightful. It sounds like there's a bit of a disconnect between the words you're saying and the emotions behind them. Can you think of a moment when you felt truly steady and reliable, even in the face of discomfort, like when you were doing something that felt important to you? Maybe that feeling could be the anchor for something more?

Patient: Yeah — I guess the clearest time was when I had to organize the memorial after they died: I made calls, set things up, kept everyone on track, and I felt... capable. But that was adrenaline and obligation, not calm — I don't see how remembering that helps me not text people every time my chest tightens. So, seriously, how is that supposed to translate into actually stopping the reassurance-seeking?

Therapist: It's understandable that you'd be hesitant to connect with that experience. It's as if the sense of capability and reliability was tied to a specific context, and you're wondering how to access that feeling in more everyday moments. Can you think of what it would take, right now, for you to feel like you're capable of handling this anxiety, without needing to text others, like your voice, posture, or any other physical sensations that might be present?

Patient: I guess if I had to name it: slower, deeper voice, shoulders down, feet planted, breathing steady, chest less tight — like when I was firm and running things at the memorial, but calmer. Physically that does soothe the chest a little and slows the urge, but honestly — how is that supposed to stop me from texting the second the worry spikes? If I try that and the urge still comes, what then?

Therapist: Your ability to identify the physical sensations that ease your anxiety is really helpful. It sounds like you're wondering what happens when you try to hold onto that sense of calm, and the urge still arises. What if, instead of trying to suppress the urge to text, you simply acknowledged it, like you would with any other thought or sensation – without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I can try just noticing it. Right now I notice my chest tighten, a buzzing in my hands, and the thought, "Text them, they'll make it stop." But how is that supposed to help? Noticing doesn't make the urge disappear in the moment — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by that, and I'm struggling to see how this actually stops me from reaching for my phone.

Therapist: Your willingness to notice the urge, and your acknowledgment of feeling overwhelmed, takes a lot of courage. It sounds like you're wondering how this noticing can become a more practical way of dealing with the urge to text. What if, when the urge arises, you could take a tiny step back from it, without doing anything else, and simply be with the sensation of the urge, without trying to push it away or act on it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try stepping back and watching it. Right now I notice my hands buzzing, my chest tightens, and this hot itch to grab my phone — but honestly, I’ve sat with urges before and they just hover until I give in, so I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and skeptical. How is that supposed to actually stop the reflex to text when it feels immediate and automatic?

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if this noticing is just a preparatory step, and you need something more to actually break the cycle. What if, instead of trying to stop the urge, you were to focus on the sensations in your body, and gently ask yourself what's underneath them – what's the underlying feeling or need that's driving this urge to text?

Patient: Okay—when I dig into it, it's mostly loneliness and this panic about being alone or abandoned, plus a craving for certainty and immediate comfort so the ache stops. There's also guilt and this stupid pressure to be "okay" that makes me reach out for validation. But honestly, how is just naming that supposed to stop the reflex when the urge feels immediate? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and stuck thinking about it.

Therapist: Your willingness to explore the underlying emotions is really helpful. It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck, and wondering if naming these feelings is just a theoretical exercise, not a practical solution. What if, in this moment, you were to pause before reaching for your phone, and simply take a tiny step towards something else, like taking a few more breaths, or going for a short walk, or doing something completely unrelated to the situation – just to create some space between the urge and the action?

Patient: Okay, I can try pausing—maybe a few deep breaths, get a glass of water, or step outside for two minutes to break the chain. But I've used distractions before and they often fail, so how is that supposed to help when the urge hits hard and immediate? I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck thinking this won't stop me from grabbing my phone.

Therapist: Your skepticism about distractions is understandable, and it sounds like you're wondering if this is just a temporary fix. What if, instead of trying to distract yourself, you were to focus on the sensation of the urge as it arises, without judgment or trying to change it – simply observe it, like you would with a cloud passing by, without getting caught up in it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try to watch it like a cloud. Right now I notice my chest tighten, my hands buzz, and the thought "text them, they'll make it stop," but I've watched it before and it just hangs there until I give in. How is that supposed to help when it feels like a siren that won't go away? I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck.

Therapist: Your frustration and feeling stuck are palpable. It sounds like you're wondering if watching the urge is just a way to pass the time, and you need something more substantial. What if, instead of trying to change or avoid the urge, you were to make a small commitment to yourself, just for this moment, to do something that feels unrelated to the anxiety – like getting up and pouring yourself a cup of tea, or doing a few specific, tiny actions that feel manageable, but not necessarily related to the anxiety?

Patient: Okay — I can try pouring a cup of tea or stepping outside for two minutes, but I'm really jittery and distracted right now; my hands are buzzing and I can barely focus. How is getting a cup of tea supposed to stop the urge to text when it feels immediate and panicky? I'm feeling overwhelmed and not convinced I can do it without reaching for my phone.

Therapist: Your physical symptoms of jitteriness and distraction are really evident. It sounds like you're wondering if this tiny action, like pouring a cup of tea, is just too small, too far-fetched, to help in this moment. What if, instead of focusing on the outcome, you were to focus on the sensation of doing the action itself, without expecting it to change anything – just the sensation of getting up, of moving your body, of doing something physical?

Patient: Okay, I'll try focusing on the sensation. Right now my chest is tight and my hands are buzzing, and as I shift my weight I can feel my feet on the floor and the slight cool air on my skin — that actually pulls my attention away for a second. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to quiet the siren that tells me to text? I'm jittery and distracted and I don't feel sure this will stop me from reaching for my phone.

Therapist: Your focus on the physical sensations is a good start. It sounds like you're wondering how noticing this sensation is supposed to quell the underlying anxiety that's driving the urge to text. What if, instead of trying to quiet the anxiety, you were to cultivate a sense of curiosity about what's happening in this moment – not trying to change it, not trying to fix it, but simply observing it with an open and gentle curiosity?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try to be curious. I notice my chest tightening, hands buzzing, and that immediate thought, “text them,” and I’m asking, “what’s under this?” but it feels flimsy — curiosity doesn’t seem to drown out the panic. I’m jittery and distracted and honestly skeptical: how is being curious supposed to stop me from grabbing my phone when the urge is that fast?

Therapist: Your willingness to explore with curiosity is still there, but it sounds like it's still not quite sinking in. It's like there's a bigger, more fundamental question lurking beneath the surface. What if, instead of trying to understand or analyze the urge, you were to approach it from a more relational perspective – not trying to change it, not trying to fix it, but simply asking: "What's the relationship between me and this urge?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is asking about the "relationship" between me and the urge supposed to help? Right now it feels like the urge is part of me and also an attacker: it sits in my chest and screams "text them," and I panic because reaching out actually calms me, so I don't see how talking about the relationship stops the reflex. I'm jittery and distracted and honestly stuck on how this turns into anything practical.

Therapist: Your frustration and sense of being stuck are clear. It sounds like you're wondering how this relational inquiry can become a practical, actionable step. What if, instead of trying to figure out the relationship between you and the urge, you were to approach it from a more embodied perspective – not just thinking about it, but sensing it, feeling it in your body, and allowing yourself to be with it, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to do that. Right now my chest is pinching, my breath is shallow, my hands are buzzing and there's a hollow ache in my stomach with that instant thought, "text them." I'm trying to sit with those sensations but it just gets louder and panicky. How is feeling this supposed to stop the reflex to grab my phone — if it doesn't, tell me a concrete move I can actually do in the moment that might work, because I'm skeptical this will.

Therapist: Your willingness to sit with the sensations is good, but it sounds like they're becoming more intense. It's like there's a sense of overwhelm and discomfort. Can I offer a different perspective? What if, instead of trying to stop the urge or feel more calm, you were to consider a simple, tiny act of kindness towards yourself, right now, in this moment – not to the person you might text, but to you, the one experiencing this anxiety and discomfort?

Patient: Maybe a tiny kindness would be putting my hand on my chest and saying, "I'm here for you," or physically putting my phone in another room for five minutes — but I'm really jittery and distracted right now. How is that supposed to help when the urge feels immediate and screaming? I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck — give me a concrete move I can do right now that might actually change what I do, because I don't buy that this alone will stop me.

Therapist: Your focus on concrete actions is good, and it sounds like you're looking for something more tangible. Can I suggest something that's even smaller and more immediate? Instead of putting your phone away or saying a kind phrase, what if you simply allowed yourself to take one tiny, tiny step towards what's already next to you – like your feet – and simply noticed the sensation of one foot touching the ground, without doing anything else?

Patient: Okay — I can try that. I notice my right foot on the floor, the pressure on the ball of my foot, a cool spot under my toes — it pulls my attention for a beat, but my chest is still tight and my hands are buzzing and the thought "text them" is screaming. I'm feeling overwhelmed and skeptical: how is noticing my foot supposed to stop me from grabbing my phone, and if that won't, give me one concrete move I can do right now that actually changes what I do because I'm struggling here.

Therapist: Your focus on the physical sensations is good, but it sounds like they're still intense. Can I offer a tiny action that's even more immediate and tangible? What if, when the thought "text them" arises, you simply paused and said "no" to yourself, without thinking about it further, without trying to justify or explain it – just a simple, firm "no"?

Patient: Okay...I can try saying a quiet, firm "no" to myself. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? It feels like it won't stop the panic—might just make me shut down or resentful. If "no" doesn't work, give me one concrete thing I can do in the next 30 seconds, because I'm wiped and it's hard to imagine this actually changing anything.

Therapist: Your honesty about the potential consequences is good. Can I offer a tiny action that's even more concrete and immediate? What if, when the thought "text them" arises, you simply took a small step forward – just one step – without looking at your phone, without thinking about it, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: Alright...I took that one small step — felt a tiny shift, but the "text them" voice is still loud. How is that supposed to actually stop me from grabbing my phone? I'm drained and need one concrete move to try next if this doesn't work.

Therapist: Your willingness to take the small step is great. Can I offer one more tiny action that's even more immediate? What if, when the thought "text them" arises, you simply turned your attention to your breath, and brought your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body – without trying to change it, without trying to do anything else, just the sensation of the breath?

Patient: Okay...I'll try focusing on the breath. Right now it's shallow and tight in my chest — noticing it does pull my attention for a beat, but the "text them" voice is still loud and buzzing. How is that supposed to actually stop me from grabbing my phone? If this doesn't quiet it in 30 seconds, tell me one concrete thing I can do right now that will actually change what I do.

Therapist: Your focus on the breath is good, but it sounds like it's still not quite working. Can I offer one final, tiny action that's even more concrete? What if, when the thought "text them" arises, you placed your phone out of reach – just literally put it on the other side of the room, or out of your line of sight – without thinking about it, without trying to justify it, just the physical action of putting it away?

Patient: Okay...I’ll get up and put it on the other side of the room. My hands are still buzzing and that “text them” voice is loud — it feels slightly harder to grab it but I’m not convinced it’ll stop the urge. If it doesn’t work in 30 seconds, tell me one concrete thing to do next that will actually change what I do, because I’m wiped and need something that feels real.

Therapist: Your willingness to physically remove the phone is great. I think we've reached a point where it's time to take a more significant action. Can you stand up and walk away from the room, without looking back, without thinking about the phone, and just take a few steps towards something else, like a window, a book, or a different room – without checking your phone, without thinking about the urge, just moving your body towards something else?

Patient: Okay...I stood up and walked toward the window. I felt a tiny shift — cool air on my face, shoulders a bit looser — but the "text them" voice is still screaming, and I'm just kind of...wiped. How is that supposed to help, and if this doesn't stop in 30 seconds, give me one concrete thing I can do right now that will actually make me not grab the phone.

Therapist: Your willingness to move your body is great. I think we've reached a point where it's time to take a more intentional action. Can you take a seat in a chair, and as you sit down, allow yourself to take a few deep breaths, and when you're ready, bring your attention to your hands, and place them gently on your thighs, without doing anything else, just noticing the sensation of your hands on your thighs, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I sat down, put my hands on my thighs. I can feel the weight of my palms, a tiny warmth, and a faint tremor under my fingers, and my breath is a little deeper but the "text them" voice is still loud and buzzing. Honestly, that's a small shift but I'm wiped and skeptical — if this doesn't quiet it in 30 seconds, tell me one concrete thing I can do right now that will actually stop me from grabbing my phone.

Therapist: Your ability to notice the sensations in your hands is good. I think it's time for a more significant action. Can you get up and do one small, easy task that requires physical effort, like making a cup of tea, or taking a glass of water, or even just turning on the faucet – not because you think it will stop the urge, but simply because it requires your attention and action, and takes your focus away from the phone?

Patient: Okay — I stood up and made a cup of tea. The steam and the warm mug calmed me for a few breaths and my shoulders dropped a bit, but that "text them" voice is still loud and buzzing. I'm wiped and it's getting hard to hold this, so if this doesn't quiet in 30 seconds, give me one concrete thing I can do right now that will actually stop me from grabbing the phone.

Therapist: Your willingness to engage in a physical activity is great. I think it's time for a final, concrete action. Can you put the tea down and sit back down, and for the next 5 minutes, not move, not get up, not do anything except sit and be with the sensation of your body, including the buzzing, the tightness, and the urge to text – just sit with it, without judgment, without trying to change it, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: Okay...I'll try. I put the tea down and sat back — my chest is tight, my hands are still buzzing, and I'm really drained, so I don't expect this to magically fix anything, but I'll stay and try to feel it for a few minutes. If it gets too intense, promise you'll give me one concrete move to do next? I'm starting now.

Therapist: Your willingness to stay with the sensations is a big step. I'm here to support you. If you find it becomes too intense, I'll offer a concrete action you can take next. Just focus on being with the sensations, and remember, this is not about fixing anything, it's about being with what is.

Patient: Okay...I'm staying, but it's getting louder — my chest is tight, my hands are shaking, and I'm wiped. I don't see how sitting with it actually stops anything, so can you give me that concrete move now? I need something I can do in the next 30 seconds because I'm close to grabbing my phone.
