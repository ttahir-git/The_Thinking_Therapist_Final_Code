--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really down and unmotivated since a difficult breakup a few months ago, and it's starting to affect my work and how I relate to people. I'm a bit nervous talking about it—it's uncomfortable—so I guess I'm trying to see if talking helps. I don't know, it just feels like everything's a bit harder than it used to be.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and explore these feelings. It's completely understandable that you're feeling nervous about discussing this, but I'm here to listen and support you in a non-judgmental space.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "everything's a bit harder than it used to be"? What specific aspects of your life are you finding more challenging now?

Patient: I guess work's been tougher—I can't focus like I used to, I get stuck on small tasks and sometimes miss deadlines or put off meetings. Social stuff is harder too; I cancel plans a lot or just stay quiet around colleagues and friends because it feels exhausting. I don't know, even things I used to enjoy feel flat and I'm sleeping poorly, so everything feels kind of foggy.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like many areas of your life are being affected by these feelings. It's like there's a blanket of discomfort covering a lot of things.

You mentioned that you're missing your old sense of focus and energy. What would it be like for you if you could have just 10-15 minutes of clear focus right now, without any of the distractions or exhaustion that's been going on?

Patient: I guess if I had 10–15 minutes of clear focus right now I'd actually finish one nagging task—like finally cleaning up a dataset or closing out an overdue report. That would probably make me feel a little lighter, less guilty, like I could breathe for a bit. I don't know, though—I worry it wouldn't last or I'd just get distracted again.

Therapist Answer:
Having a small sense of accomplishment and relief can be really powerful.

You mentioned feeling guilty and like you're not doing enough. Can you think of a value that's important to you, something that would make you feel more like the best version of yourself? What would having to live with not taking care of this one task, and feeling stuck and unproductive, do to that value?

Patient: I guess being competent and reliable—like someone who follows through and doesn't let things pile up—is important to me. If I don't take care of the task, I'd feel like I'm failing at that, ashamed and like I'm letting people down, and maybe like I'm not the person I thought I was. I don't know, it's kind of hard to talk about.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Feeling like you're failing or letting others down can be a really tough spot to be in. It sounds like the fear of that shame and disappointment is a big motivator for you.

Would you be willing to try a small experiment with that feeling of shame? Can you take a moment to acknowledge it, without judgment, and say "Shame, I see you're showing up right now. That's okay. What would it be like if you didn't have to live with this shame? If you could simply be kind to yourself, and remember that everyone makes mistakes, even when they're trying their best?"

Patient: Okay, I'll try. "Shame, I see you're showing up right now. That's okay." I guess if I didn't have to live with it I'd feel lighter, like I could actually get one thing done instead of spiraling. I don't know, saying it out loud feels weird and kind of exposing.

Therapist Answer:
It can feel a bit vulnerable to acknowledge and name difficult emotions, especially when they're closely tied to our sense of self-worth.

You mentioned feeling lighter, being able to get one thing done. What would it be like if, in addition to that sense of relief, you also had a sense of curiosity and interest in taking care of the task? What might you learn about yourself, or what new perspective might come from actually doing it?

Patient: I guess if I felt curious about it, I might notice that I can still break problems down and actually enjoy solving little things, which could remind me I'm capable. I don't know, it's just hard to feel curious—thinking about it makes me feel exposed and a bit panicky. Maybe I'd learn that small wins add up, but I'm avoiding it because it brings up more questions about why I haven't been doing this.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like curiosity is getting tangled up with the fear of being exposed and the panic of having to face the "why" behind your lack of productivity.

Let's try to untangle that for a moment. What if, instead of trying to figure out the "why" right now, you simply focused on the experience of doing the task itself? No judgment, no questioning, just the act of taking small steps towards completion?

Patient: I guess I could try that—just do one tiny step without judging it. It sounds kind of relieving, but I don't know, it also makes me anxious like I'll freeze or start overthinking. Could we come up with really small, specific steps? Like “open the file for five minutes” or something that feels doable.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Breaking down the task into tiny, manageable steps can help make it feel less overwhelming.

Let's start with "open the file for five minutes." What would happen if, without trying to make a plan or worry about what's next, you simply opened the file and looked at it for five minutes, without judgment?

Patient: I guess I could try that—just open the file for five minutes. I don't know, it already makes me anxious like I'll freeze or start overthinking, but maybe if I set a timer for five minutes I could manage to look at it without doing anything else.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Using a timer can help create a sense of structure and containment. What would it be like to have a timer set for five minutes, and you simply open the file and look at it, without doing anything else, while the timer is running?

Patient: I guess if there was a timer I'd feel a bit safer—like it's contained and won't spiral into something huge. I don't know if I can open it without overthinking, but I can try to set the timer for five minutes and just look at the file. Can you stay with me while I do it? I'm nervous about doing it alone.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll be here with you, right next to you, if you need me. When you're ready, we can set the timer together, and I'll support you in opening the file for just five minutes. When you're done, we can take a moment to acknowledge it, and then we can explore what happened in those five minutes, without judgment. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: I guess… okay, I can try. I'm nervous—can you start the five-minute timer and stay with me while I open the file? I don't know, it feels weird doing this alone but I want to give it a shot.

Therapist Answer:
I'll start the timer now. *starts timer* 

(I'll sit with you in silence, without saying a word, and allow you to open the file for the next 5 minutes.)

*Timer starts ticking*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just sitting in silence supposed to help? I guess I thought you'd guide me or say something to keep me from spiraling; doing it with no words feels weird and actually makes me more anxious, I don't know.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're right, I didn't intend to leave you alone in silence. I was trying to create a space for you to focus on the task, but I can see how that might feel anxiety-provoking.

Let's try something different. As you open the file, I'll start speaking in a gentle, calm voice, using the phrase "You're doing that..." to help you stay focused on the present moment. For example, "You're opening the file..." or "You're looking at the screen..."

Patient: Okay… I guess you can try that. It feels weird to have a running commentary—I'm not sure how it's supposed to help—but maybe if you just say simple things like "You're opening the file" it could keep me grounded. I don't know, keep it slow and don't push me into talking about the breakup right now; that makes me shut down.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll keep the commentary very simple and gentle, focusing on the physical action of opening the file. I'll say something like "You're opening the file" or "You're looking at the screen" every 30 seconds or so, to help you stay present. I'll avoid bringing up the breakup or any other topics that might be triggering.

Let's start again. I'll begin when you're ready. *speaks softly* You're sitting comfortably...

Patient: I don't know—I'm not sure I follow "you're sitting comfortably." I guess I am sitting, but that feels weird and kind of awkward. Could you just say "You're opening the file" now? That would probably help me focus, though I'm nervous.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
*speaks softly* You're opening the file.

Patient: I guess... okay, it's open. I don't know, hearing you say that makes it a bit easier but I'm still kind of shaky and awkward. Can you just keep saying simple things every so often and not push me to talk about the breakup?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
*speaks softly* You're looking at the screen.

Patient: I don't know... I'm looking at the screen. It actually helps a little — my chest's tight but I'm trying to focus on the file. Can you keep saying simple things like that every 30 seconds? I don't want to get into the breakup right now.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure.

Therapist Answer:
*speaks softly* You're focusing on the file.

Patient: I don't know… I thought I was focusing but a wave of shame just hit and now I'm annoyed at myself and kind of tense. I guess it makes it harder to keep looking at the screen — can you just keep saying simple things like "You're still looking at the screen"? I don't want to get into why this popped up right now; it feels too exposing.

Therapist Answer:
*speaks softly* You're still looking at the screen.

Patient: I don't know—I'm still looking at the screen, but that shame keeps hitting and my chest gets tight and I get annoyed at myself, so it's harder to focus. I guess hearing you say "You're still looking" helps a little; can you keep doing that every 30 seconds? I don't want to get into why this came up right now — just keep the simple, slow reminders.
