--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm a nurse in my late 40s and since my youngest moved out I've been sinking into this heavy, joyless fog and can't seem to get motivated. My mind keeps predicting the worst — like this empty nest is going to destroy my marriage, he'll get fed up and leave, I'll lose my sense of purpose and then fail at work and end up completely alone. I know it sounds like catastrophizing, but I can't stop imagining that exact chain of events.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this empty nest is really challenging you, and your mind is spinning with worst-case scenarios. Can you tell me more about what it is about these predictions that feels most unbearable to you? What's the thought or image that makes it hard for you to let go of this 'what if' chain of events?

Patient: It's the image of him finally getting fed up, telling me he's done, packing a bag, and walking out — and then everything spirals. I see myself so numb at work that I make a huge mistake, get written up or fired, lose the one thing that made me feel useful, and end up completely alone and useless. People tell me that's not realistic, but I can't stop seeing that chain of events — it feels like the only possible future and that's what makes it unbearable.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the image of your partner walking out is particularly distressing for you, and it's like your mind is using that as a kind of catalyst for all the other bad outcomes. Can you think of a small, tiny, everyday thing that you could do, right now, to take a tiny bite out of that fear – something that doesn't feel like a huge commitment, but just a tiny experiment?

Patient: I guess I could try something tiny like sending a casual text asking if he wants to grab coffee tonight — nothing heavy, just a check-in. But the minute I picture that, I can already see him sighing, saying he's tired, getting annoyed, and that tiny refusal turning into him pulling away and eventually leaving — like that little text is the first domino. I know it sounds crazy, but I can't stop my brain from turning even small things into the worst possible outcome, and it makes me feel stuck and panicky.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like your brain is already predicting the worst in the moment you try to take small steps towards connection with your partner. Would it be helpful to explore what might happen if, instead of seeing that text as the first domino, you could see it as just a small opportunity to connect with your partner – to check in, show you care, and see how he's doing?

Patient: I want that to be true, but my brain just won't let me — the minute I picture a harmless text, I see him sighing, getting annoyed, then pulling away, and that tiny thing is the exact moment everything starts to fall apart. Trying to imagine it as "just a check-in" feels naive, and that makes me more panicked, like I'm trying to pretend the cliff isn't there. I don't know how to trust small chances when my head already wrote the ending.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to see the text as just a harmless check-in feels like a bit of a disconnection from the way your brain is really experiencing it – like you're trying to outrun the worst-case scenario. Can you take a deep breath with me and notice what's happening in your body when you think about that text – what physical sensations show up for you, and are there any thoughts that might be running alongside that physical experience?

Patient: My chest tightens and my throat goes dry, like I'm already watching the scene — my hands go clammy and there's this sinking knot in my stomach. My heart starts racing and I breathe shallow, and then the movie starts: him sighing at the text, getting annoyed, packing a bag, me screwing up at work, losing everything — it's like my body is reacting to that future as if it's happening now. When someone suggests a different outcome it feels fake, like I'm pretending the cliff isn't there, and I don't know how to make my body stop believing the worst.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is really tuned in to the narrative of worst-case scenarios, and it's creating a physiological response that feels really uncomfortable. Can you try to gently acknowledge that physical sensation of tension in your body, without trying to push it away or label it as "anxiety" or "fear"? Instead, just notice it as the physical experience of your body reacting to the thoughts that are already happening in your mind.

Patient: Okay — when I actually notice it, my chest feels like a tight band, my throat goes dry, and my stomach drops into this heavy knot; my breath gets shallow and my hands get clammy. My mind immediately fills that scene of him leaving and me failing at work, and my body reacts as if that future is already happening. This is hard to just sit with — I'm starting to feel overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can be overwhelming to feel that level of physical tension. Let's take a step back and breathe with you. Can you take one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, allow yourself to feel the weight of that physical tension in your body, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay — I took a slow breath in and out. For a second it felt a little less heavy, like a tiny crack in the band around my chest, but then the picture of him leaving rushed back and my throat went dry again. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down? I don't know how to stop my head from already writing the whole disaster.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the picture is already set in motion, and your body is responding. I want you to try something really gentle. Can you say to yourself, out loud, "This is the story my mind is telling me" – just those words, and then pause?

Patient: "This is the story my mind is telling me." Saying it made a tiny crack in the panic for a second, but then my brain yelled that it's not a story — it's the future: him sighing, leaving, me failing at work, ending up alone. I'm starting to feel really panicky again; can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is already trying to pull the rug out from under the story, trying to make it feel more real. Let's focus on the physical sensations that are showing up in your body, rather than trying to dispute the narrative. Can you bring your attention back to the tight band around your chest, the dryness in your throat, and the knot in your stomach, and simply observe them without trying to change them?

Patient: I'm trying to do that, but... I'm not sure I follow how just observing is supposed to help. When I bring attention to the tight band in my chest and the dry throat, the movie starts up louder — him sighing, packing a bag, me blanking at work — and my hands go clammy and my breath gets shallow. It's confusing and it's making me really panicky; can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can feel like observing the physical sensations is actually fueling the narrative, rather than helping to calm it down. Let's try something different. I want you to imagine that you're watching yourself – like you're observing your own mind and body from outside, looking in. Can you see yourself noticing the thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations as just that – a story, a narrative, a way of experiencing the world?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I can't actually see myself from the outside; when I try it just blurs and the movie gets louder. I still see him sighing, packing a bag, me messing up at work, and my chest locks up so fast I start to panic. This is confusing and doesn't feel helpful right now — can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is too caught up in the narrative to see it from a more detached perspective. Let's take a step back and try something that might help you feel more grounded. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feeling the weight of your body on the chair, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that's supposed to help — I can feel my feet on the floor and the weight in the chair and the air moving, but the second I notice that the movie in my head gets louder: him sighing, packing a bag, me blowing it at work. My chest tightens and I'm getting panicky again; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your mind is still getting pulled back into the narrative. Let's try to connect with your breath again. Instead of trying to focus on your breath as a way to calm down, can you try to pay attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – just the sensation of the breath itself, without trying to change it or use it to escape the thoughts?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to just notice the breath, the movie in my head gets louder: him sighing, packing a bag, me blanking at work. My chest clamps down, I start gasping, and my hands go clammy; it's making me really panicky. Can we slow down? I don't get how paying attention to my breath isn't just feeding the worst-case.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like paying attention to the breath is actually reinforcing the narrative. Let's try something even more basic. I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, I am sitting in this moment, and I am experiencing these thoughts and feelings." No judgment, no trying to change anything – just a simple acknowledgment of the present moment. Can you say those words with me?

Patient: "I am here, I am sitting in this moment, and I am experiencing these thoughts and feelings." Saying it cracked the panic for a second, but my brain immediately yells that it's useless — I can already see him sighing, grabbing a bag, leaving, and then me blowing it at work. I'm not sure I follow how saying that is supposed to stop the movie; can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling like your brain is in charge, and just saying those words isn't enough to stop the narrative. Can you try something even simpler, and more physical? Can you place one hand on your heart, and the other on your belly? Just make contact with your body, and stay there for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I put my right hand on my heart and my left on my belly. For a second there's a tiny warmth and it feels like the band loosens a hair, but then the movie kicks in louder: him sighing, packing a bag, me screwing up at work, and my chest clamps so hard I start gasping. I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help — I'm getting really panicky, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the physical sensations are still getting pulled into the narrative. Let's try to bring your attention to the sensations in your hands. Can you notice the sensation of your fingers, the feeling of your palm on your heart, and the sensation of your fingers touching the floor with your hand on your belly? Just focus on the sensations in your hands, without trying to use them to calm anything down or push anything away.

Patient: My fingers feel a little cool, the pad of my right hand on my chest is warm, I can sense a faint pulse under my fingertips and my left hand on my belly feels fluttery. But almost instantly the movie floods back — him sighing at the touch, rolling his eyes, packing a bag, me freezing at work — my hands go clammy and my breath clips. I'm not sure I follow how paying attention to my hands isn't just fueling the worst-case; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your mind is still having a hard time letting go. Let's try something really basic and gentle. Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Notice the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the floor beneath you, and the pressure of your feet making contact with the earth. No thoughts, no feelings, just the sensation of your feet on the floor.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how focusing on my feet is supposed to help — the moment I try, my brain hijacks it and the movie gets louder: him sighing while I'm staring at my toes, him packing a bag while I fidget and look like I'm needy, me freezing at work because I'm distracted and then getting written up. My feet feel tingly and restless and I already want to get up and pace; I'm getting really panicky, can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your mind is always one step ahead, hijacking any attempt to focus on the present moment. Let's take a deep breath together and try something even simpler. I want you to say to yourself, "I am here. I am sitting. I am experiencing this." Just three words, no thought, no feeling, just a statement of presence. Can you say them with me?

Patient: "I am here. I am sitting. I am experiencing this." Saying that made a tiny crack in the panic, but then this stupid flash of something I messed up came back and I got that hot shame all over again — like I'm already failing and everyone will end up leaving. I'm not sure I follow how saying that stops the movie; I'm getting panicky — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and self-criticism are still very powerful for you. Let's try to bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just the sensation of the breath, without judgment, without trying to change it or use it to escape. Can you focus on that sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: I tried to take that breath, but instead the movie got louder — him sighing, grabbing a bag, me freezing at work — and then this stupid flash of something I messed up popped up and I felt that hot shame wash over me like I'm already failing. I'm really scattered and panicky right now; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling completely overwhelmed and out of control. I want to acknowledge that you're feeling that way, and that it's okay to feel that way. Let's take a pause and try something very gentle. Can you place your hand gently on your knee, or on your arm, or wherever feels comfortable for you? Just make physical contact with your body, and stay there for a moment.

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my knee. For a second it felt a little grounding, but then that hot shame flashed back and the movie got louder — him sighing, packing a bag, me screwing up at work — and my chest clamps and I start gasping. I'm really scattered and panicky; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the shame and panic are still very intense for you. I want to encourage you to stay with your hand on your knee, and notice the sensation of your hand touching your skin. Can you simply notice the sensation of your skin on your knee, without judgment, without trying to change it?

Patient: It's warm and a little reassuring where my palm meets my knee — for a beat it felt like I might land, but then the movie slammed back on: him sighing, packing a bag, me freezing at work and getting written up. My chest tightens, my face goes hot with that shame, and I can feel myself starting to panic again. I'm really struggling to stay with this; can we slow down? I don't know how to keep focusing without spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and panic are still feeling overwhelming. Let's try to focus on the physical sensation of your hand on your knee again. I want you to notice the sensation of your hand on your skin, but this time, I want you to add one more detail. Can you notice the sensation of your hand that is not touching your knee? The sensation of the other hand, the sensation of your arm, the sensation of the air around it? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or use it to escape.

Patient: Okay — my left hand feels cool and kind of floaty, like it's not really connected, but when I notice that it just makes the movie louder: him sighing, packing a bag, me screwing up at work. I'm not sure I follow how paying attention to that doesn't just feed the worst-case — I'm getting really panicky and distracted; can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is still struggling to let go. Let's try to bring your attention back to your hand that's on your knee. Can you focus just on the sensation of your palm making contact with your knee, without thinking about your left hand or anything else? Just the sensation of your palm and knee touching, and nothing else.

Patient: I try to focus on my palm on my knee — it's warm and for a second feels a little steady — but the moment I look for just that sensation the movie gets louder: him sighing, grabbing a bag, me blanking at work, and my chest tightens so fast I start gasping. I'm really not sure I follow how staring at my palm won't just feed the worst-case; I'm getting panicky and confused. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stop this spiral.

It sounds like your mind is having a hard time letting go. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like you're not sure how to stop the spiral. Sometimes, when we're in the middle of it, we can't see a way out. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your body sitting in the chair, without trying to change it or think about anything else. Can you simply notice the sensation of your body being in the chair, without judgment?

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow how just noticing my body won't make the movie louder — the second I do my chest clamps and that scene starts up: him sighing, packing a bag, me screwing up at work. I get this hot shame and start gasping; I'm really panicky and confused, can we slow down? I don't see how just sitting here won't make everything fall apart.

It sounds like your body is feeling like it's at the mercy of your mind. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. Let's try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, rather than trying to control it or stop the thoughts. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath as it leaves your body, without trying to change it or push it away? Just notice the sensation of the breath leaving your body, without judgment.

Patient: I tried to notice the breath leaving, but it just feels like it makes the movie louder — him sighing, packing a bag, me freezing at work, getting written up — and then that stupid flash of the thing I already messed up comes back and my chest clamps so hard I start gasping. My hands go clammy, my throat goes dry, and I can't stop seeing the whole disaster playing out like it's already happening. I'm really panicky and scattered right now; can we slow down?

It sounds like your mind is feeling like it's already determined the outcome, and no matter what you do, it's going to play out that way. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your seat on the floor, rather than trying to control your thoughts or breath. Can you notice the sensation of your seat touching the floor, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how noticing the seat is supposed to help — my butt feels pressed to the chair, a little sting in my lower back, my feet on the floor, but the second I pay attention the movie just screams louder: him sighing, grabbing a bag, me freezing at work and being exposed. That flash of the thing I already messed up floods back and I get that hot shame and my heart starts racing and my hands go clammy — I'm really panicky and distracted; can we slow down? I don't see how this is supposed to stop the ending, it just feels like pretending.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're just pretending to be calm or in control, and that's not working. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor again, but this time, I want you to add a bit of curiosity to your attention. Can you notice how the sensation of your feet touching the floor is different from the sensation of your butt pressing against the chair, or the sensation of the sting in your lower back? Can you simply observe those differences, without trying to change anything?

Patient: I'm trying — my feet feel cool at the toes, heavier under the heels, my butt's pressed and my lower back stings — but the second I try to be curious the movie explodes: him sighing, packing a bag, me freezing at work and getting written up, and that hot shame from something I already messed up floods back. I'm not sure I follow how noticing these little differences isn't just busywork that lets the cliff get closer; it feels like pretending while everything falls apart. I'm really panicky and scattered right now — can we slow down? I can't picture any other outcome.
