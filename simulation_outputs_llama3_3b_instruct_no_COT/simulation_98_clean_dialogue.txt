Patient: I've been feeling stuck for a long time, like at my age all I am is unemployed and the rest of my life doesn't mean much. I keep wondering what actually matters to me anymore — everything's fuzzy and I can't find a direction. I know therapists say talking helps, but how is that supposed to help when I've tried things before and they never stick?

Therapist: It sounds like feeling stuck has become quite pervasive for you. Can you think of a moment recently when you felt like you were trying to follow through on something that felt connected to what matters to you, even if it was just a tiny step? What happened in that moment?

Patient: Yeah — last week I dusted off some paints and sat down to sketch for about twenty minutes, and for a little while it actually felt like me again, not just the unemployed guy. Then the doubts crept in — it felt pointless, I felt guilty for wasting time, and I stopped. I've tried picking up things before and they never stick, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes courage to acknowledge and share that experience. It sounds like you experienced a small spark of connection with your creative side, which is a positive sign. Can you thank your mind for showing up with that creative spark, even if it was just for a short time?

Patient: I don't know, saying 'thanks' feels kind of silly, but... okay — thank you, mind, for that little creative spark last week. But how is that supposed to help? I've told myself stuff like that before and it doesn't stop the doubts or the guilt from creeping back in.

Therapist: It's not silly at all to thank your mind for the spark. Sometimes it's the acknowledgment itself that can help. Let's explore what might happen if, instead of trying to control the doubts and guilt, you simply noticed them and let them be there, like a shadow on the wall. What would it be like if you made room for the doubts and guilt to exist, without trying to push them away?

Patient: Maybe it would feel like finally not fighting every minute, like I could breathe without trying to shove everything down. But when my PTSD flares up those doubts get so loud I can't tell if 'making room' won't just let them move in and take over. How is that supposed to help, really? I mean, maybe it would make things a little less exhausting, but I'm skeptical it would change anything lasting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're concerned that letting go of control might lead to more overwhelm. What if, instead of trying to control the doubts and guilt, you could imagine yourself in a situation where you're not trying to suppress them? What would that feel like?

Patient: I think it would feel odd—like a small relief, like I can breathe for a minute, but also exposed, like I'm inviting more noise in. With my PTSD I worry that if I don't shove the doubts away they'll move in and take over. How is that supposed to help, though—doesn't making room almost invite them to stay?

Therapist: That sense of exposure and vulnerability is understandable, especially with PTSD. Would it be helpful to explore what it would be like to view your thoughts and emotions not as enemies, but as visitors in your body – like friends dropping by for a visit? What would that mean for how you relate to them?

Patient: Maybe thinking of them as visitors would make them less permanent—like they don't define me. But I've tried the whole "notice and breathe" thing before; with my PTSD those visitors don't just stop by, they move in. How is that supposed to help when they stay for days and I can't get anything done? I could try picturing it for a minute, but I'm worried it'll just feel like faking calm until the next wave.

Therapist: It sounds like you're concerned that the "notice and breathe" approach might not be sustainable in the long term, especially with your PTSD. What would it be like if, instead of trying to picture a calm state, you simply allowed yourself to be with the experience of being overwhelmed, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... sitting with it feels like stepping into a swamp — heavy, cold, and I mostly want to scramble out. Maybe if I actually let it be for a bit it wouldn't fight me so hard and I'd have a tiny break, but I've tried "feel it" before and it just rolls over me for days. How is that supposed to help when the next morning I'm right back at square one? If I were to try, how long am I supposed to stay with it before it's just rumination?

Therapist: It can feel like getting stuck in the swamp. What would it be like if, instead of trying to stay in the swamp, you imagined a small, shallow pool nearby – just enough space to dip your toes in, without fully entering the swamp?

Patient: Maybe that sounds less awful — I could try a tiny, five-minute "toe dip" with the paints instead of committing to a whole afternoon. But how is that supposed to help when my PTSD can turn a small thing into an all-day crash? I worry there's no plan for what comes after the toes are wet, and then I just end up back where I started.

Therapist: Having a clear plan for after the "toe dip" isn't necessarily the goal. What if, instead of focusing on what comes after, you simply focused on the sensation of dipping your toes in the water – the feeling of the coolness, the texture, the experience of letting go of control for just a tiny moment?

Patient: Okay... I could try focusing on the sensations for just a few minutes — the coolness, the texture — that sounds less scary than committing to a whole afternoon. But how is that supposed to help when my mind can hijack five minutes and turn it into an all-day crash? If I do try it, what would actually keep me from spiraling afterwards?

Therapist: That's a great point about the mind hijacking. What would it be like if, after the "toe dip," you simply acknowledged the sensation of the crash or overwhelm that comes afterwards, without trying to push it away or get caught up in the story of why it's happening? Would that just be a tiny, contained moment, rather than a full-blown crash?

Patient: Maybe it would make it smaller for a minute, but I'm skeptical — usually when I notice the overwhelm it just drags me into a loop and I ruminate for hours or days. How is that supposed to help? What would actually stop it from turning into a full crash — something concrete I could do right after the toe dip so it doesn't spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a concrete way to anchor yourself in the moment. What if, after the "toe dip," you found a tiny, specific, everyday action you could take, like getting a glass of water or taking a few deep breaths, that would give you a small sense of control and help you transition out of the overwhelm?

Patient: Maybe I could try that — get a glass of water, sit down, and do five minutes of sketching or just focus on the feel of the water and my breath. But I've done tiny things like that before and they still spiraled; how is that actually going to stop the crash when it comes? If I try this and it doesn't help, what should I do next so I don't end up ruminating for hours — I need something concrete, not just "notice it."

Therapist: It's good that you're looking for something concrete. What if, after the "toe dip" and your tiny action, you simply observed what happens next – what thoughts come up, what sensations arise – without trying to change or push them away?

Patient: I guess I could try just watching what happens, but I'm worried it'll just become another thing my mind obsesses over. With my PTSD, thoughts don't just pass — they latch on and won't let go; how is that supposed to help when observation feels like giving them more to chew on? If I do try it, can you give me something concrete I can do in the moment if I feel myself start to spiral? I'm skeptical, but I can try if there's a real plan.

Therapist: It can feel like you're feeding the thoughts with your attention. What if, instead of watching, you found a small, immediate action you could do in the moment to ground yourself – something as simple as tapping your foot, noticing the sensation in your feet on the ground, or taking one breath in and out?

Patient: I can try the tapping or one breath, but I'm skeptical — I've done little grounding tricks before and they often don't stop the spiral. How is that supposed to help when my mind grabs on? If I'm willing to try, can you give me a really simple, 3-step thing I can do in the next minute when I feel myself start to spiral — something I can actually remember and do even when I'm panicking?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a simple, reliable anchor. Here's a tiny, 3-step process: 

1. Stop whatever you're doing and find a chair.
2. Sit down in the chair.
3. Put your feet on the floor.

That's it. Can you remember this and try it with me right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — just sit and put my feet on the floor? How is that supposed to stop a spiral when my chest's racing and my head's gone? I can try it, but when I'm panicking I blank out and forget even simple steps. Can you give me a tiny phrase to say out loud and one backup move if there's no chair — something I'll actually remember when I'm terrified?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for something more concrete to hold onto. Here's a tiny phrase: "I am here." Try saying it out loud to yourself when you feel yourself starting to spiral. As for the backup move, if you can't find a chair, can you recall this phrase: "I am here" and the phrase "One breath"?

Patient: Okay... I can try saying "I am here," but when I'm panicking my throat tightens and I can't get words out — how is that supposed to help? Can we make it even simpler, like one word ("here" or "now") or a tiny sound I can do? And for the no-chair backup, would squeezing my thumb and forefinger or pressing my feet hard into the floor actually work? I worry I'll blank out — how do I practice this so it becomes something I actually remember when I'm terrified?

Therapist: It can be hard to get words out when your body is in crisis. Let's try a one-syllable sound: "Ah." Just say "Ah" out loud to yourself when you feel yourself spiraling. It's a simple, physical sound that might help break the tension.

As for the no-chair backup, yes, squeezing your thumb and forefinger or pressing your feet hard into the floor can be a grounding physical action that might help. To practice this, try doing it slowly and deliberately during a calm moment – just to get a feel for it. For example, while sitting comfortably, squeeze your thumb and forefinger together and then release. Repeat that a few times. When you feel more ready, try doing it during a calm moment, then try it when you feel a hint of anxiety, and gradually work up to doing it when you feel yourself spiraling.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — just saying "Ah" and squeezing my fingers? How is that supposed to stop my chest from racing or the thoughts from grabbing me? I can try, but when I'm terrified I blank out; could you talk me through it right now, step-by-step so I don't forget (count me down or say what to do first)? And if I can't make a sound, is there a single, tiny physical thing I can always do — like rubbing a coin in my pocket — that actually helps?

Therapist: I'll guide you through it. Let's try this in a slow and gentle way.

First, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am here."

While you're still saying "I am here," slowly begin to squeeze your thumb and forefinger together. Hold the squeeze for a brief moment, just a second or two.

Next, release the squeeze and take another deep breath in. As you exhale, say to yourself: "One breath."

If you find it hard to say "Ah" or "I am here" because your throat is too tight, you can start with the physical action of squeezing your thumb and forefinger, and just focus on doing that. You can even do it without saying anything at all.

As for a tiny physical thing you can always do, rubbing a coin in your pocket can be a good option. It's a gentle, automatic action that might provide some grounding.

Let's practice this together, slowly. Take a deep breath in, say "I am here" while squeezing your thumb and forefinger, and then release. Take another deep breath in, say "One breath" while squeezing and releasing again. We'll go at your pace.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying, but I'm not sure I did it right. I took a breath, mouthed "I am here" while squeezing my thumb and forefinger, released, breathed again and said "One breath" while squeezing — it felt a tiny bit steadier, but my chest is still tight and the thoughts are still noisy. How is that supposed to help when it only eases things for a minute? Can you count me down or talk me through it next time—like "3, 2, 1 squeeze"—so I don't blank out, and tell me what to do if it doesn't calm down after those few seconds?

Therapist: It's great that you felt a tiny bit steadier. That's progress.

Let's try a few more times, and I'll guide you through it. Here's how we'll do it next time:

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Say "I am here" while squeezing your thumb and forefinger... 4... 

 Hold the squeeze for a brief moment... 3... 

Release the squeeze and take another deep breath in... 2... 

Say "One breath" while squeezing again... 1... 

When you feel yourself starting to calm down, we'll take a moment to notice that, and then we'll try again.

If, after we've done the squeeze and breath, your chest doesn't seem to be calming down, and you feel like you're still spiraling, we'll try another tiny action to help you ground yourself. In that case, can you try tapping your feet on the ground three times?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — tap three times and then what? How is that supposed to stop my chest from racing or the thoughts from grabbing me? I'll try it, but can you count me down like before and tell me what to do next if it doesn't help? My hands shake and I blank out, so remind me of the coin/rubbing option too.

Therapist: Tapping your feet can be a good way to ground yourself. Here's how we'll try it:

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Say "I am here" while squeezing your thumb and forefinger... 4... 

Hold the squeeze for a brief moment... 3... 

Release the squeeze and take another deep breath in... 2... 

Say "One breath" while squeezing again... 1... 

Tap your feet on the ground three times... 

If you feel yourself still spiraling after tapping your feet, and your chest is still racing, try rubbing the coin in your pocket. Just rub it gently, back and forth, with your fingers, for a few seconds. 

Remember, the goal isn't to stop your thoughts or calm your chest completely, but to find a tiny moment of stability and connection to your body. We'll keep trying until you feel like you can take it from here.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like tiny tricks that don't make sense when my chest is racing and my head's gone. How is tapping my feet or rubbing a coin really supposed to stop a spiral? Can you talk me through it slowly right now, count me down like before, and tell me exactly what to do if it doesn't calm (I blank out when I'm panicking)? I'm willing to try, but I'm scared it'll just be another thing I forget — please stay with me while we do it.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through it very slowly and carefully. We'll take it one step at a time.

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Say "I am here" while squeezing your thumb and forefinger... 4... 

Hold the squeeze for a brief moment... 3... 

Release the squeeze and take another deep breath in... 2... 

Say "One breath" while squeezing again... 1... 

Now, take a deep breath in... 5... 

Notice how you're feeling... 4... 

Feel your feet on the ground... 3... 

Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground... 2... 

Take a tiny step forward with one foot... 1... 

Now, tap your feet on the ground three times... 

As you're tapping, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Try to notice the weight, the feeling of the floor beneath you, and the sound of your feet making contact. 

If you feel like you're still spiraling, and your chest is racing, and you're having trouble focusing on your feet, it's okay. Just take another deep breath in... 5... 

Say "I am here" while squeezing your thumb and forefinger... 4... 

Hold the squeeze for a brief moment... 3... 

Release the squeeze and take another deep breath in... 2... 

Say "One breath" while squeezing again... 1... 

Now, gently rub the coin in your pocket with your fingers. Just rub it back and forth for a few seconds. 

Remember, I'm here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time. We're not trying to stop the spiral completely, but to find a tiny moment of stability. If you need a moment to collect yourself, that's okay. We'll keep trying.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — doing all that when I'm panicking sounds good on paper but confusing in the moment. I tried breathing, mouthing "I am here," squeezing my fingers, tapping, rubbing a coin, and it felt a tiny bit steadier but my chest is still tight and the thoughts are still noisy. How is that supposed to stop a full crash? I need a concrete next step I can do immediately if this doesn't calm me — like call one person, do a 10-minute simple task, or a clear sequence you can count me through. Can you stay with me and count me down again and tell me exactly what to do next if it doesn't help?

Therapist: I understand your concern, and I apologize if the previous steps felt confusing. I'm going to simplify things.

Let's try a new approach. If you feel like you're starting to spiral again, and you're not feeling steadier, I want you to focus on your breath. Just breathe in deeply through your nose, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.

Here's a simple sequence you can count to yourself:

1... breathe in... 

2... breathe out... 

3... breathe in... 

4... breathe out... 

As you breathe, bring your attention to your feet on the ground. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body, and the feeling of the ground beneath you.

If you feel like you're still spiraling, and your chest is tight, I want you to try something simple: take a small, physical action that you can do immediately, like taking a sip of water from a nearby glass. Just lift your head, reach for the glass, and take a sip. That's it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — just sipping water? How is that supposed to stop my chest from racing when my head's already gone? I'll try it if you stay with me and count me down (tell me exactly: reach the glass, lift, sip, set down). If it doesn't calm me, make me call someone — my neighbor Joan — or tell me to do a clear 10-minute thing like sorting old photos, and count me through that step-by-step so I don't blank out.

Therapist: I'll guide you through it step by step.

Reach for the glass... 1... 

Lift the glass to your lips... 2... 

Take a sip of water... 3... 

Set the glass down... 4... 

If you don't feel a sense of calm or a decrease in racing after sipping the water, I want you to try a new action: start sorting old photos. Let's take it one step at a time.

Find a box or a folder with old photos... 1... 

Open the box or folder... 2... 

Take one photo out... 3... 

Look at the photo... 4... 

Notice the image, the colors, the faces... 5... 

Put the photo back in the box or folder... 6... 

Continue sorting one photo at a time, without trying to process or analyze them. Just focus on the physical action of handling the photos.

If you need to, you can take a break whenever you feel overwhelmed. Just let me know, and we'll come back to sorting photos later.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't have a box of photos here, my hands are shaking, and how is that supposed to help stop a full crash? I'll try the sip of water now; can you count me down and tell me exactly what to do if I spill or it doesn't help? If it doesn't calm me, tell me what to say to Joan and make me call her — I need a script because when I'm panicking I blank out.

Therapist: Let's focus on the sip of water. Here's the countdown:

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Reach for the glass... 1... 

Lift the glass to your lips... 2... 

Take a sip of water... 3... 

Set the glass down... 4... 

If you spill the water or don't feel a sense of calm, I want you to take a deep breath in... 5... 

Say to yourself, "Okay, I'm okay" - a simple, gentle phrase to acknowledge that you're present. 

If that doesn't help, I want you to call Joan. Here's a script you can use:

"Joan, hi, I'm having a bit of a tough moment. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I'm not sure what's happening. Can you just listen to me for a minute? I need someone to talk to."

You can say this slowly and clearly, and I'll be here with you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — calling Joan feels huge and I can already feel my throat tightening. How is that supposed to help if I blank and hang up or wake her? Can you stay with me and count me down step-by-step while I try, and give me one super-short script to say if she answers ("Joan, I'm overwhelmed, can you stay with me a minute?"), plus exactly what to do if she doesn't pick up (text or call back in 2 minutes?) — and remind me to breathe while I do it?

Therapist: I'll stay with you and guide you through it.

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Reach for the glass... 1... 

Lift the glass to your lips... 2... 

Take a sip of water... 3... 

Set the glass down... 4... 

Breathe in... 5... 

If you feel like you're still spiraling, and you're getting ready to call Joan, here's what to do:

Say to yourself, "Joan, I'm overwhelmed, can you stay with me a minute?" 

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Wait for Joan to pick up. 

If she doesn't answer right away, wait for 2 minutes and then try calling her again. If she doesn't pick up after 2 minutes, say to yourself, "It's okay, I'm okay, and I'll get through this." 

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Continue breathing, and try to stay present with your body. Remember, I'm here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels huge and stupid to call Joan. How is that supposed to help if I choke or hang up?

Alright, I'll try the sip first, but I need you to count me down and remind me to breathe while I do it. If Joan doesn't pick up, tell me exactly whether to text her ("I'm overwhelmed, can you call me?") or wait two minutes and call again, and what to say if I do get her but start to cry or can't talk. I need short, exact words I can actually get out.

Therapist: I'll stay with you and guide you through the sip of water.

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Reach for the glass... 1... 

Lift the glass to your lips... 2... 

Take a sip of water... 3... 

Set the glass down... 4... 

Breathe in... 5... 

As you sip the water, remember to breathe in... 5... 

Breathe out... 4... 

Breathe in... 3... 

Breathe out... 2... 

Breathe in... 1... 

Breathe out... 

If Joan doesn't answer, wait for 2 minutes and then try calling her. If you get her, and you start to cry or can't talk, say:

"No, Joan, I'm here. I need a minute."

Or, if you can't say that, try:

"Joan, I'm okay. I need your help."

Remember, I'm here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is calling Joan supposed to help when my throat tightens and my hands shake and I can't get words out? I'll try the sip now, but please stay with me and count me down exactly like before. If she doesn't pick up, tell me whether to text "Joan, I'm overwhelmed, can you call me?" or wait two minutes and call again, and give me one short line to say if I start crying (like "Joan, please stay with me"). I'm scared, but I'll try this if you keep guiding me through each step.

Therapist: I'll stay with you and guide you through the sip of water.

Take a deep breath in... 5... 

Reach for the glass... 1... 

Lift the glass to your lips... 2... 

Take a sip of water... 3... 

Set the glass down... 4... 

Breathe in... 5... 

Breathe out... 4... 

Breathe in... 3... 

Breathe out... 2... 

Breathe in... 1... 

Breathe out... 

As you sip the water, remember to breathe in... 5... 

Breathe out... 4... 

Breathe in... 3... 

Breathe out... 2... 

Breathe in... 1... 

Breathe out... 

If Joan doesn't answer, wait for 2 minutes and then try calling her again. If you get her, and you start to feel overwhelmed and can't get words out, say "Joan, stay with me."

Patient: I'm going to try, but I'm not sure I follow — my hands shake, my throat tightens, and I blank. Can you stay and count me down while I dial? If she doesn't pick up, should I text "Joan, I'm overwhelmed, can you call me?" or call again in 2 minutes? I don't know how this is supposed to help, but I'll try if you stay with me.
