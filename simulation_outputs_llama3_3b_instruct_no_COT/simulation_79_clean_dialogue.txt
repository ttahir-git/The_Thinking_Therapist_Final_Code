Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this persistent, almost metacognitive anxiety about my performance in this demanding program—every assignment feels like a high-stakes audition, and that pressure paradoxically propels me into procrastination. I find myself articulating elaborate theories about cognitive load, age-related role transition, and imposter phenomena rather than actually sitting with how exhausted and burned out I am. On the surface I'm gregarious and optimistic, but underneath there's this avoidance loop that's sapping my energy.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in this cycle of overthinking and anxiety, and it's causing you to avoid dealing with the exhaustion and burnout you're experiencing. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're sitting with that exhaustion and burnout? What happens in your body, in your thoughts, when you try to confront it?

Patient: Physically it shows up as this low-level agitation—tightness across my shoulders and chest, jaw clenched, and breathing that gets shallow and fast—yet my first instinct is to translate that into a taxonomy: rumination, threat-detection, performance anxiety. Cognitively I immediately catalog mechanisms and assemble hypotheses about why I'm stuck, which feels safer than admitting I'm just exhausted, so the analysis becomes a kind of avoidance that then spirals into paralysis and procrastination. I try to sit with it, but I end up narrating and theorizing about the sensation instead of actually feeling it, and that gap between knowing and feeling is really frustrating.

Therapist: It feels like you're caught between trying to manage the anxiety with more thinking and avoiding the discomfort of simply being with your physical and emotional experience. What if, instead of trying to understand this phenomenon, you were to simply observe it, without trying to label it or intellectualize it? Would it be possible to allow the physical sensations, like the tightness in your shoulders, to simply be present, without adding any thoughts or story to them?

Patient: In principle, yes — I can intellectually endorse the practice of nonjudgmental observation. But practically, my go-to is immediate meta-cognition: I map the tightness onto autonomic arousal models and construct a performance-threat narrative, which functions like a safety buffer that prevents real attendance to the sensation. So while I can conceptually allow the tightness to be present, in practice that invitation tends to provoke an analytic loop that feels less scary than actually feeling it.

Therapist: It's like the very act of observing, which you intellectually support, is still being hijacked by the same analysis and narrative that keeps you stuck. This creates a kind of inner conflict between wanting to be present and wanting to analyze. What would happen if, in the midst of this physical tightness and autonomic arousal, you were to take a small step back, just enough to acknowledge the tightness without trying to label it or analyze it, but still allow it to be present?

Patient: If I actually try that tiny step back, there's this weird split: for a beat the tightness is just… there, and my breathing can ease a fraction, like pressure dissipating a millimeter. But almost immediately my mind re-enters autodidactic mode—cataloguing the sensation, proposing coping heuristics, drafting a to-do list of self-care interventions—so the respite is fleeting. I can try to stay with it now, but I'm already noticing the analytic impulse rising, and that frustrates me.

Therapist: It seems like the brief moment of relaxation is quickly overwritten by the same pattern of analysis and planning that you normally use to avoid the discomfort. It's like your mind is already racing ahead to find a way to "fix" the tightness, instead of just allowing it to be. What would happen if, this time, you could catch yourself on that verge of getting pulled into analysis, and instead say to yourself, "I've noticed the anxiety rising again, and now what?"

Patient: If I actually said, "I've noticed the anxiety rising again, and now what?" it momentarily functions like a metacognitive circuit-breaker—there's a sliver of agency where I could opt to stay with the sensation. But almost immediately I cerebralize that pause: I start theorizing why the pause happened, cataloguing antecedents, and drafting an algorithmic coping plan, which feels safer than actually feeling the tightness. Okay—I've noticed the anxiety rising again, and now what? There's a tiny loosening in my chest, but my mind's already drafting a mini-lecture on autonomic regulation, and honestly I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with how fast this happens; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the brief moment of awareness has been hijacked again by the same patterns of analysis and planning. You're able to catch the mental loop, but it's happening quickly and feeling overwhelming. Would it be possible to take another step back, even smaller this time, and just say, "I'm getting caught in this loop, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed," without adding any more thoughts or plans to the mix?

Patient: "I'm getting caught in this loop, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed." I say that, and then my brain immediately goes to inventorying triggers and drafting a twenty-step intervention because that analysis feels like a protective scaffold—so already I'm a bit flooded; can we slow down a notch?

Therapist: It seems like the words themselves have become a way to slow down the thought process, but the analysis is still happening, and you're feeling overwhelmed. Can we try to see this pause between saying "I'm getting caught in this loop" and the cataloging of thoughts as a kind of small silence? Not a silence that's filled with thoughts, but a silence that's not trying to fix or analyze anything – just a small space where you could just be with the feeling of being overwhelmed.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. When I let that tiny silence sit, there's actually a small easing, like my shoulders unclench a fraction and my breath deepens a notch. But almost immediately my mind pivots into analysis—cataloguing triggers, drafting interventions—so I end up narrating the sensation instead of inhabiting it; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by how fast that happens, can we slow down and maybe you guide me with simple sensory prompts?

Therapist: Let's try to slow it down even further. I'd like to guide you with a simple sensory prompt. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now? Just notice the sensation of your feet connecting with the floor, the weight, the feeling of the ground beneath you. No thoughts, no analysis – just the sensation of your feet being present.

Patient: Okay—bringing attention to my feet now. I can feel weight at my heels, a firmness under the arches, and a slight coolness on the tops of my toes, which is oddly stabilizing, but my mind immediately wants to theorize about somatic markers and interoceptive accuracy instead of staying with the sensation. I'm getting a bit distracted already—can you keep giving short, simple sensory prompts?

Therapist: Let's try another simple one. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils right now. Just the sensation of the breath, no thoughts, no analysis. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the breath supposed to help with my performance anxiety? Okay, I'll try: I notice a coolness at my nostrils on the inhale and a warm tug on the exhale, a slight tightness in my chest, but my mind immediately wants to theorize about respiratory rate and vagal tone instead of staying with it. I'm getting a bit flustered by how fast the analysis kicks in—can we move even slower with one-word sensory prompts, please?

Therapist: Notice the sound of your voice.

Patient: Okay — noticing my voice now. I hear a slight rasp, a bit higher on the inhale and steadier on the exhale, like there's tension up in my throat; it sounds tentative and a little tired. Of course my brain immediately recasts that as glottal tension, breath-support deficits, and performance-arousal indicators, and I can feel myself slipping into analysis — I'm getting flustered by how fast that happens, so can we keep going with one-word sensory prompts?

Therapist: Notice your jaw.

Patient: I notice a dull tightness along my jaw and a light clench around the molars, like a habitually engaged brace. Immediately my brain wants to reframe it as masseter hyperactivity, bruxism from chronic stress, and anticipatory muscle guarding—I'm already getting flustered by how fast I default to analysis, so can we keep going with more one-word sensory prompts?

Therapist: Notice your feet.

Patient: Noticing my feet again — a firm pressure at the heels, a diffuse warmth across the soles, toes slightly curled into the carpet. Naturally my brain is already translating it into proprioceptive feedback loops and balance heuristics, which is frustrating — I'm getting flustered by how fast I intellectualize; can we keep going with one-word sensory prompts?

Therapist: Your face.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my face supposed to help with the performance worry? Okay, trying anyway: I notice a mild heat across my cheeks, slight creasing at the forehead like habitual furrowing, and my lips feel a bit pursed, which makes my breathing slightly higher in the chest. Naturally my mind immediately recasts that as suppressed affect, micro-expressions of anxious arousal, and sympathetic activation—I'm getting flustered by how fast I default to analysis, so can we keep going with those one-word sensory prompts and move really slowly?

Therapist: Your breath.

Patient: The breath is shallow—slight chest rise, quicker exhales, a hint of tightness in the diaphragm; cool on the inhale, warm on the exhale. Of course my brain immediately starts rephrasing it as dysregulated breathing patterns, sympathetic predominance, and suboptimal vagal tone, which is my usual evasive script instead of actually feeling it. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by how fast that analytic reflex kicks in—can we slow down and keep going with very simple one-word sensory prompts?

Therapist: The edges.

Patient: Edges... I'm not sure I follow—edges of what? If you mean the edges of my body/perception, I notice a thin boundary: the cool air brushing the backs of my hands, a soft blur where my peripheral vision meets the wall, and a slight sense of containment around my ribcage. Naturally my mind immediately wants to reframe it as peripersonal space, proprioceptive margins, and a defensive envelope instead of just feeling it, and I'm getting flustered by how fast that happens—can we keep going with more one-word prompts, slowly?

Therapist: The floor.

Patient: The floor beneath me feels solid and cool under my soles, a steady pressure that travels up through my heels into my ankles—it's oddly grounding and steadies my breath a little. Of course my brain immediately wants to recast that as proprioceptive feedback, somatic grounding techniques, and balance strategies instead of just letting it be, and I'm already getting flustered by how fast I default to analysis; can we keep going with more one-word sensory prompts, really slowly?

Therapist: Your hands.

Patient: My hands feel a bit clammy and cool, fingers tense with a faint tremor at the tips when I try to hold still. Naturally my brain immediately reframes it as sympathetic arousal—palmar sweating, catecholaminergic activation, microtremor—so I'm already more scattered and it's getting harder to just inhabit the sensation. Can we keep going with more one-word sensory prompts, but really slowly? I'm feeling pretty anxious and jittery right now.

Therapist: Your palms.

Patient: My palms feel clammy and a bit cool, with a faint tremor at the fingertips when I try to keep them still. Of course my brain immediately recasts it as palmar sweating, sympathetic arousal, microtremor from adrenaline, which is making me feel more scattered and on edge—can we keep going with one-word sensory prompts, really slowly?

Therapist: The silence.

Patient: The silence feels oddly loud — like a thin empty space my inner commentator scrambles to fill. My chest tightens, my breath quickens, and my brain instantly reframes the silence as a performance threat, which just ramps up the anxiety. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed and jittery; can we keep going with very small, one-word sensory prompts and slow the pace?

Therapist: The space.

Patient: The space feels both empty and imminent—like an auditorium pause that my inner critic fills with imagined judgments, which makes my chest tighten and my breath hitch. Of course my first move is to relabel it as a social-evaluative void and start rehearsing defenses, which only ramps my anxiety and makes me jittery. Can we keep going with very slow one-word sensory prompts—please—and maybe you cue the next one?

Therapist: Your feet.

Patient: Okay—feeling my feet: a steady weight through the heels, a diffuse warmth across the soles, toes splayed a bit, and a faint tremor up through the ankles. Of course my brain immediately frames it as proprioceptive grounding and balance-correction data, and that recasting makes me more jittery and scattered—can we keep going with another one-word prompt, really slowly?

Therapist: The back.

Patient: Noticing my back—there’s a tight band between my shoulder blades, a dull ache in the lower back, and a sense of constriction around my ribcage that makes my breaths shallower. Immediately my mind wants to reframe it as postural hypertonicity, vagal withdrawal, and myofascial guarding, which is exactly the evasive analysis I keep doing; it’s starting to make me jittery. Can we keep going with another one-word sensory prompt, really slowly?

Therapist: Your breath.

Patient: My breath is shallow and quick—more chest than belly, a little hitch on the exhales, cool at the nostrils, pressure under the ribs. Of course my brain immediately wants to diagnose respiratory rate, vagal tone, and a hyperventilatory pattern instead of just feeling it. I'm pretty jittery and scattered right now; it's getting hard to keep attention—can we stick to very slow, one-word cues and pause longer between them?

Therapist: Pause.

Patient: The pause creates a tiny loosening in my chest for a breath, then my inner commentator floods the space with imagined evaluations and even clinical-sounding diagnostics, which tightens my throat and makes me jittery and overwhelmed. I'm struggling to sustain the silence without spiraling into analysis—can we keep going with very slow, one-word sensory prompts and longer gaps between them?

Therapist: *pause*

Patient: The pause gives me a hair of relief — my breath eases a fraction and my shoulders drop a millimeter — but almost instantly my inner commentator floods the silence with evaluative chatter and clinical reformulations, which tightens my throat and makes my hands tremble. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed and scattered by how fast that analytic reflex grabs hold; can we keep doing very slow, one-word sensory prompts with longer gaps? If you cue the next one slowly, I’ll try to stay with the sensation rather than narrate it.

Therapist: *pause*

(Note: I've kept the pause longer this time, allowing you to settle into the sensation. I'll wait for your response before giving the next prompt.)

Patient: That pause did help a hair — my chest eased a fraction and my breath slowed a notch — but predictably my inner commentator reasserted itself with a barrage of evaluative and diagnostic scripts, which tightened my throat and sent my hands trembling. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed and scattered by how fast that analytic reflex grabs hold; can you cue the next one-word sensory prompt very slowly — "feet" again would be fine — and pause long enough for me to try to actually inhabit it instead of narrating it?
