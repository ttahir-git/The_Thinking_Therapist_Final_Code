Patient: I’ve been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — I don’t know what matters to me beyond being unemployed, and the breakup just made everything worse. I’m pretty skeptical this will help; I’ve tried “finding myself” before and it didn’t work. Still, I guess I want to see if talking about it actually changes anything, even though I’m doubtful.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling quite uncertain about your life right now. That can be a really tough spot to be in. It's understandable that you've tried to find yourself before and didn't get the results you were hoping for. Can you tell me more about what it was about those experiences that led you to feel like they didn't quite work for you?

Patient: Mostly it felt like surface-level fixes—people handing me exercises or slogans without anything that actually changed how I felt day-to-day. How is “follow your passion” supposed to help when I can’t even pay rent? I’ve tried journaling and those “small step” plans and it just felt like I was faking progress, so it didn’t stick. And feeling judged when I hadn’t figured it out just made me shut down more, so yeah, I’m skeptical this will be different.

Therapist: It sounds like those previous approaches felt more like a Band-Aid solution, rather than addressing the underlying issues. And now, feeling like you're faking progress can be a really discouraging experience. Can you imagine, for a moment, that you could just let go of the need to have all the answers right now, and instead focus on taking a tiny step towards something that feels slightly more manageable – something as simple as getting out of the house, or going for a short walk? What would that feel like, and what might be different about taking that small step compared to the other approaches you've tried?

Patient: I mean, getting out of the house sounds okay — it might make the day feel less flat for a little while. But how is that supposed to help pay my bills or stop me from spiraling the next week? I’ve tried walks and tiny-step plans before; they feel good for a day and then nothing changes. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about it all, and honestly, I’m not convinced this will be any different unless it actually ties to something concrete.

Therapist: It sounds like you're not sure how a small step like getting out of the house would make a tangible difference in your life. That's a really valid concern. Can you think of a specific aspect of your life, something you value highly, that would need to be addressed in order for you to feel like things are starting to move in a positive direction – and then imagine what might happen if, for just a tiny moment, you made space for that valued aspect, even if it's just for a small part of your day?

Patient: I guess feeling creative and competent again matters to me—I miss making things that feel like mine, not just surviving. But how is making space for a 15‑minute sketch supposed to help when my rent's due? If we're going to try that, how does doing something small actually connect to getting a job or feeling less directionless?

Therapist: It seems like making space for creativity and competence feels like a fundamental need for you, but it's not immediately tangible in terms of solving the day-to-day problems. Can you think of a small, immediate action you could take today that might, for just a moment, help you tap into that sense of creativity and competence, and then see if that can help shift your focus or mood, even if it's not directly related to the bigger picture of finding a job or getting your life back on track?

Patient: Alright—maybe I could try a 15‑minute sketch or write a short post about something I made, just to feel like I accomplished something today. But how is that supposed to help pay rent or actually get me out of this stuck place? I’ve tried quick creative bursts before and they just fizzled, so I’m feeling frustrated and doubtful this will lead anywhere unless there’s a clear next step tying it to work or income.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a clear next step that ties the creative expression back to a tangible outcome, like earning a paycheck. Can you think of a specific, concrete value that would need to be met or overcome for you to feel like you're moving in the right direction, something that would give you a sense of progress or momentum, and then imagine what would need to happen in that situation for you to take a small step towards it – even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: I guess a concrete value for me would be getting some actual paid work so I stop being defined by “unemployed” — even one small paid gig would feel like progress. For that to happen I’d need to make something I can sell or find a short-term job—like posting a simple portfolio piece and offering a low-cost commission or applying for a week-long temp role. But honestly, how is posting one portfolio item supposed to fix anything long-term? I’ve done posts before and heard nothing, so I’m skeptical this will amount to momentum unless there’s follow-through.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break free from feeling defined by unemployment, and creating something that can be sold or generating a short-term income feels like a key step towards that. But you're concerned that posting a portfolio piece or applying for a temp role might not lead to anything concrete, and that's making it hard to muster motivation. Can you think of a way to make the process of creating or applying feel less daunting, so that it becomes more manageable and builds momentum, rather than just another obstacle to overcome?

Patient: Maybe if I shrank it down to something stupidly small it wouldn't feel so paralyzing—like spend 25 minutes picking one piece, photographing it, and writing one short caption, then post it. I could also use a template for applications or portfolio entries so I don't have to reinvent everything each time. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I’ve posted before and gotten nothing? I'm willing to try it, but I’d need some kind of accountability or a set time so I don't just bail.

Therapist: It seems like breaking down the task into an even smaller, more manageable chunk might help reduce the overwhelm. Having a set structure, like a template, could also make it feel less daunting. And you're right that you're looking for a way to make it more sustainable and increase the likelihood of follow-through. Can you think of a way to hold yourself accountable for this new, smaller goal, like sharing it with someone you trust or setting a specific time to post, and what might happen for you if you were to show up to that commitment?

Patient: I could tell my friend Jess I’ll post at 7pm, set a calendar alarm, and even promise to donate $10 if I bail so there’s some skin in the game. How is that supposed to help? I’m scared I’ll still ghost and nothing will come of it, but having someone check in might stop me from overthinking. If I actually post, maybe I’d get a tiny boost of competence and could use that to do another small thing, but I’m worried that boost will just fizzle and then I’ll feel worse.

Therapist: Having a friend check in and a tangible reward for showing up seems like a good way to increase motivation. Now, I'd like to explore what might happen if, despite your best efforts, you don't get any meaningful responses or results from the post – if you still feel like you've wasted your time, but you've taken a step anyway. How might that experience feel for you, and what would be a small, gentle way to acknowledge and accept that experience, rather than beating yourself up over it?

Patient: I’d probably feel deflated and stupid—like I tried and still nothing changed, which would just confirm the worst thoughts. Maybe a gentle way to handle it would be to actually name the attempt out loud—text Jess “I posted” or write in my notes “I showed up today”—and do one small comforting thing afterward, like make tea or take a shower. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the boost always fizzles? I don’t know, I want it to be enough to keep me going, but I’m scared it’ll just make me feel worse later.

Therapist: It sounds like acknowledging the attempt and the potential feelings of deflation might be a small, gentle way to care for yourself, but you're still wondering if it's enough to create lasting momentum. Can you think of a way to experiment with the idea that the small, comforting actions you mentioned – making tea, taking a shower – might not be just a Band-Aid, but actually be connected to the underlying desire for competence and validation that's driving your actions? What if, instead of just going through the motions, you explored what's beneath the surface of that desire, and what might be driving your need for competence in the first place?

Patient: Maybe those small rituals are just tiny proofs that I can keep a promise to myself — a little hit of "I did that," which scratches the competence itch. But digging into why I need that — like the fear of being worthless, craving approval, or not trusting myself — feels heavy and abstract, and honestly, how is that supposed to help me pay rent or actually get a job? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about all this, so I'm skeptical but willing to try if it actually ties to something concrete.

Therapist: It seems like the small rituals might be a way to create a sense of accomplishment and connection to your values, but you're hesitant to explore the deeper reasons behind that desire because it feels too abstract and overwhelming. Can you imagine, for just a tiny moment, that the small rituals themselves, rather than the underlying thoughts or feelings, are what's actually driving your behavior – and that the goal isn't to uncover some hidden truth, but rather to see if you can tolerate the feeling of taking a small step towards competence, regardless of what's driving it?

Patient: Maybe those rituals are just the only thing I can manage without falling apart — less digging, less risk. I can try to tolerate the tiny-step feeling for a bit, but how is that supposed to actually get me a job or help with rent? I'm wiped and it's hard to see how sitting with the feeling instead of fixing stuff makes any real difference.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that the small rituals are a way to maintain a sense of control and stability, but you're wondering how that translates to making concrete progress in your life. Can you think of a small, immediate action that you can take, not to fix everything, but just to make space for the possibility that these tiny steps might, in some small way, contribute to a larger sense of momentum or direction?

Patient: Okay — maybe I can do one tiny thing: set a 25‑minute timer tonight to photograph one piece, write a caption, post it, and text Jess when it's up. But how is that supposed to help with rent? I'm wiped and it's hard to believe this will actually lead anywhere.

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a concrete, tiny step you can take tonight. Now, I'd like to explore what would happen if, for just a moment, you let go of the expectation that this small action will magically lead to a job or solve all your problems – can you imagine a tiny, non-judgmental space to simply exist with the feeling of having made this small commitment, without trying to tie it to some grand outcome?

Patient: Okay... I can try to just post and notice that I did it, without expecting anything big to happen. But honestly, it still feels kind of pointless with rent hanging over my head — how is that supposed to actually get me work or money? I'm wiped and don't have much energy, but I'll try to hold that tiny space tonight and see if I can just be with the fact that I showed up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try to hold the tiny space of simply existing with the fact that you made the commitment, despite feeling overwhelmed by the larger context. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that the act of showing up and posting itself might be an act of kindness towards you, even if it doesn't lead to some grand outcome – what would that feel like, and how might that change your relationship with yourself and your actions?

Patient: Maybe it'd feel like a tiny mercy — proof I didn't completely fail today. But it also drags up this same shame and makes me braced for disappointment, so I'm not sure it will stick. How is that supposed to help with rent or actually getting work? I can try, but I need something more practical than feelings — can you help me turn that tiny mercy into a concrete next step?

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny act of posting might bring up feelings of shame and disappointment, which could undermine the progress. Let's try to turn that tiny mercy into a concrete next step that also addresses your practical needs. Can you think of a way to connect the act of posting with a small, specific action that could lead to concrete progress, like getting your portfolio ready for a job application, or researching job openings that match your skills – what would be the next small step in that direction?

Patient: Okay—concrete next step: after I post tonight I’ll put the photo and a one‑line description on a simple one‑page portfolio (Carrd or Google Sites), add a short “commissions/for hire” note with a PayPal/CashApp link or price, then send one targeted pitch to a potential client or apply to one temp gig.  

I know it’s tiny and it drags up that embarrassed, crappy feeling, and I’m skeptical it’ll pay rent, but at least it ties the action to something sellable.  

I’m wiped, but I’ll set the timer, post, text Jess when it’s done, and then force myself to send that one pitch—can you help me draft what that message should say?

Therapist: It sounds like you've broken down the next steps into a concrete plan that ties the action to something sellable and addresses your practical needs. Now, let's work on the pitch message. Can you think of a simple, concise phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what you're offering – something that would feel authentic and confident, and not just a rehash of what you've posted before?

Patient: I can try—these feel a little embarrassing to put out there, but here are a few short options:

- "Custom illustrations and quick‑turn commissions for small businesses—affordable, personal, ready to use."  
- "Original art and visual assets that help brands stand out—fast turnaround, fair prices."  
- "Charming, on‑budget illustrations and social visuals to make your product pop."

They all feel a bit... awkward to send, like I'm selling myself, but pick one and help me tighten it into a one‑line pitch I can actually send. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you've got some options to work with. Let's try to refine one of them into a one-line pitch that feels more confident and authentic. What if we take the second option, "Original art and visual assets that help brands stand out—fast turnaround, fair prices"? Can you think of a way to rephrase it to make it feel more conversational and less like a sales pitch – something that would be more likely to resonate with the person on the other end, rather than just trying to sell yourself?

Patient: Maybe: "I create original, on‑brand visuals to help small businesses get noticed—quick turnaround and fair rates."  

It sounds less like a canned ad, but... how is that supposed to get anyone to bite? I feel embarrassed sending it, but I guess I can try.

Therapist: It sounds like you've crafted a pitch that feels more conversational and authentic. Now, let's focus on what you can do next. What if, instead of worrying about whether it will get a response, you were to focus on the act of sending it itself – what would that feel like, and how might that tiny action, in itself, be a small act of kindness towards you?

Patient: I guess sending it would feel like a tiny mercy — proof I didn’t completely chicken out today. But it drags up that same stupid shame and I’m braced for it to mean nothing, so how is that supposed to help with rent or getting actual work? I’m wiped, so can you help me script the exact one‑line message and a quick follow‑up if they don’t reply?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to a place where you can appreciate the tiny mercy of sending the pitch, despite the shame and uncertainty. Let's focus on the follow-up message. What if, instead of trying to craft a perfect response, you just send a simple, brief message that acknowledges the delay, and doesn't take a lot of energy or effort? For example, "Hey, just wanted to follow up on the pitch I sent earlier – no rush, just curious if you had a chance to take a look. Thanks for your time!" Can you think of a way to send that message that feels more like a gentle, low-stakes check-in, rather than a desperate plea for a response?

Patient: Maybe something like: "Hi [Name], hope you're well — just checking in to see if you had a chance to look at my message about illustrations. No rush; happy to answer any questions."  

If no reply after a week: "Hi [Name], just following up — totally understand if the timing's off. If you'd like, I can check back later or keep you posted on new work."  

How is that supposed to help? I don't know — it just feels less needy than my usual messages and maybe easier to actually send. I'm embarrassed to hit send though; can you help me tighten those so they sound natural and not pathetic?

Therapist: It sounds like you've crafted messages that feel more natural and low-stakes. Now, let's focus on your embarrassment about hitting send. Can you think of a way to reframe your thinking about sending those messages, so that instead of seeing it as a vulnerable act, you see it as a small act of kindness towards yourself – taking care of your needs and making progress, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: Maybe I can try thinking of it as gathering data instead of needing it to mean I’m worthy — like, “I’m testing a thing” not “this proves I’m enough.” But how is that supposed to help when the old shame hits and I feel like I’ll just get ignored again? I can try to make “sending = keeping a tiny promise to myself” the goal tonight, but I’m braced for it to feel pointless.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to a place where you can see sending the messages as a small act of kindness towards yourself, rather than a desperate attempt to prove your worth. Let's try to focus on the present moment, and what you can do right now to take care of yourself. What if, instead of worrying about the outcome, you simply focused on the act of sending the message, and then... took a deep breath, and did something else that feels nice and satisfying to you, like making a cup of tea, or taking a few moments to stretch? Can you think of something like that to do after sending the message, to help shift your focus away from the uncertainty and shame?

Patient: Okay — I'll hit send, text Jess, then make tea and force myself into a 15‑minute sketch so I'm not just staring at my phone. I can already feel that tight knot of shame and dread, like this will just fizzle and I'll feel worse. But seriously, how is any of that supposed to help with rent?

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a plan to take care of yourself after sending the message. Now, let's try to focus on the bigger picture. What if, instead of worrying about the outcome or the rent, you simply focus on the fact that you're taking small, tangible steps towards making progress – even if it feels uncertain or unimportant right now? Can you imagine taking a tiny moment to notice, without judgment, that you're taking action, and that's enough, in and of itself?

Patient: I can try—maybe literally tell myself, out loud or in a note, “you showed up,” and hold that for a minute before moving on. But it pulls up that old, burning shame like whatever I do won’t stick, so I’m not convinced it’ll change anything long-term. Still, I’ll try the post and the sketch tonight, but honestly… how is any of this supposed to get me rent?

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try the exercise of acknowledging and accepting your small actions, despite the shame and uncertainty. Let's try to come back to the idea of what's driving your desire for tangible progress and financial stability. What if, instead of focusing on the end goal of paying rent, you simply focus on what's keeping you awake at night – what is it about your current situation that's causing you the most distress? Can you explore that without judgment?

Patient: Mostly it’s this constant knot of shame and the money stress — lying awake thinking I’m worthless, like being “unemployed” is all I am, and the breakup just magnified that. I keep trying small things and they fizzle, so I end up braced and embarrassed, like I’ll just humiliate myself again. How is talking about that supposed to actually get me rent or stop this feeling in my chest?

Therapist: It sounds like the knot of shame and money stress is a deeply painful and overwhelming experience for you. Can we take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way, without trying to fix or change it in this moment? What if, instead of trying to tackle the shame and anxiety, you simply allowed yourself to feel the discomfort of those emotions, without judgment, and simply existed with them for a moment?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try to sit with it for a minute, but it feels like this hot shame just spikes and I go rigid, like I need to fix it or run. How long should I stay with it before it becomes too much, and what do I do if I start to panic? Also — how is any of this supposed to help me actually pay rent?

Therapist: It sounds like you're familiar with the physical sensations of shame and anxiety, and it's understandable that you might feel like you need to escape or fix it. Let's try to think about the opposite - what if, instead of trying to avoid or escape those feelings, you simply allowed yourself to be with them, even if it felt uncomfortable? Can you imagine taking a tiny, tiny step - just 30 seconds, 1 minute - to sit with those feelings, without trying to change or fix them? What might happen if you did that? 

As for paying rent, I want to remind you that we're not trying to solve the big problem of financial stability in this conversation. We're just taking small steps towards building a sense of kindness, compassion, and gentle care for yourself. Can we try to focus on that, for now?

Patient: Okay… I can try the 30 seconds, but when I do that same horrible image and shame rush back and I go rigid. If it starts to feel like a panic, how long should I stay and what’s a quick grounding thing I can do so it doesn’t tip me over? And honestly — how is sitting with this for a minute supposed to help me pay rent?

Therapist: It sounds like you're familiar with the pattern of shame and anxiety, and it's understandable that you might feel like you need to escape or fix it. When you start to feel like you're on the verge of panic, try to focus on a quick grounding technique that helps you bring your attention back to the present moment. A simple one is to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you imagine taking 5-10 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

As for paying rent, I want to remind you that we're not trying to solve the big problem of financial stability in this conversation. We're taking small steps towards building a sense of kindness, compassion, and gentle care for yourself. By doing so, you might find that you're able to approach the bigger challenges with more clarity and confidence. Can we try to focus on the present moment, and see what happens when you take small steps towards kindness and compassion?

Patient: Alright—I can try the 5 deep breaths and feel my feet on the floor for 30 seconds, but saying that already makes my chest clench with that old shame and I can go rigid. If I start to panic, can we agree on a quick grounding cue to pause? And honestly… how is breathing for half a minute supposed to help me pay rent?
