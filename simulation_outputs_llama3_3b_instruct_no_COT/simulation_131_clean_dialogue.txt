Patient: I've been burying myself in studying and extra projects so I don't have to sit with the grief and the weirdness of starting over. My brain insists that if I slow down I'll collapse—I'll miss deadlines, flunk out, lose my funding, get evicted, and end up completely alone and ruined; that's how it will go, definitely. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake that certainty and other outcomes feel unrealistic.

Therapist: Those outcomes do sound intense. What is it about the prospect of slowing down that feels so closely tied to those catastrophic outcomes in your mind?

Patient: Because when I slow down the grief rushes in and my head immediately stitches that into a chain—fall behind, miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up totally alone—like one quiet minute will trigger the whole collapse. Since they died, staying busy feels like the only proof I'm still holding onto anything; stopping feels like admitting it's all gone. I know it sounds extreme, but my brain treats anything gentler as impossible—it's not a maybe, it's how it will be.

Therapist: It feels like your brain is using slowing down as a kind of external validation for the emotions of grief. Can you notice what's happening in your body when you think about stopping, like what sensations or physical reactions come up for you?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, my stomach drops and my hands tremble—like an alarm going off. The second that panic starts, my brain fires off the whole disaster movie—missed deadlines, lost funding, eviction, total ruin—and those physical sensations feel like proof it's actually going to happen. I try to tell myself other things could happen, but those ideas feel fake, so I either push through with work or get swallowed by the panic.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be overwhelming. It sounds like your body is reacting to the uncertainty of slowing down, and your brain is using that as evidence that the worst-case scenario is real. What would it be like to pay attention to those physical sensations right now, without trying to push through or dismiss them, and instead, just notice them as they are?

Patient: I try to, but the second I focus my attention my chest squeezes tighter, my breath gets shallow, and my hands go cold and shaky. Then my mind launches the whole disaster movie—if I break down now I'll miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, be left with nothing—and those sensations feel like proof that's already happening. Paying attention just feeds the certainty for me, like I'm staring at the fuel for the fire, so I either shove myself back into work or freeze. Other possibilities feel like lies, so I can't really hold the calm one even for a minute.

Therapist: It seems like your body is responding to the perceived threat of uncertainty with a fight-or-flight response. This can create a vicious cycle. What if, instead of trying to push through or freeze, you took a small step back and asked yourself, "What would it be like to not know the outcome right now, to not have this certainty that the worst is going to happen?"

Patient: I try that, but the idea of not knowing just sends my panic through the roof—my chest clamps and my thoughts race, and my brain immediately fills the blank with the whole collapse story: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone and ruined. Trying to hold uncertainty feels like handing my life over to that story, and telling myself other outcomes are possible just feels like lying, so I either dive back into work or I shut down.

Therapist: It sounds like the uncertainty itself feels like a threat, even though that's not necessarily the case. Can you notice what's happening when you say "handing my life over to that story" – what sensations or emotions arise in your body or mind when you say that?

Patient: It feels like a hollow drop in my chest and my breath gets shallow, like the floor's slipping out from under me. My hands go cold and my thoughts race straight into the disaster chain—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted—so the feeling is proof I'm already handing everything over to that story. It comes with shame and a frantic, panicked drive to keep working, because stopping feels like voluntarily surrendering to the collapse.

Therapist: That feeling of shame and panic is a strong one. It sounds like you're using that shame as a way to motivate yourself to work even more, in an attempt to regain control. What would it be like if you could approach that feeling of shame and panic with a bit more kindness and curiosity, instead of trying to push it away or fight it?

Patient: I’ve tried telling myself to be kinder, but it just reads like letting go and I can’t do that. The second I soften my chest drops, my hands shake, and my brain yells that I’ll slack off, miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted—so “being kind” feels like stepping into the collapse. Maybe I could try in theory, but right now it just spikes my panic; can we slow down? I don’t really know how to be curious without that turning into more disaster thinking.

Therapist: It sounds like being kind feels like a threat, and you're struggling to distinguish between kindness and the collapse. Can you imagine a small, tiny spark of kindness towards yourself right now, no matter how tiny it may feel, without it immediately blowing up into disaster thinking?

Patient: I try to picture a tiny, tiny kindness—like letting myself breathe for a minute—but the second I do my chest clamps, my hands shake, and my brain shoots straight to the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone and ruined. Other outcomes feel fake and impossible, so even that tiny spark feels like a trap. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this—can we slow down?

Therapist: It can feel like there's a lot to work with. I'm not trying to slow down or stop right now, but rather, can you notice what's happening when you say "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" – what sensations or emotions arise in your body, and can you stay with those sensations for just a moment?

Patient: My chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, my stomach drops like I'm falling, and my hands go cold and shake—my head feels foggy and everything speeds up. The second I try to stay with that, my brain nails it to the disaster movie—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted—and those sensations start feeling like proof it's already happening. I can try to notice them, but it just fuels the certainty and spirals me, so I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Your body is responding to the feeling of overwhelm with a strong sense of threat. Can you imagine taking one tiny, tiny breath, just one second, without trying to change or escape the sensations?

Patient: Okay—I try. I take one tiny breath and my chest loosens for a split second, then it slams shut, my breath gets shallow, my hands tremble, and my brain screams that this pause means I'll fall behind, miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted and end up ruined. Even that one second feels like I'm handing everything over to that story, so I can't really hold it—can we slow down?

Therapist: Your body is responding to the brief moment of relaxation with a strong pushback. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the perceived vulnerability of being still. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change anything else?

Patient: I try to feel my feet, but it's like they're disconnected—my chest clamps, breath shallows, and my brain instantly runs the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone and ruined. That grounding feels like a trick or a lie, like if I actually notice my body everything will prove the disaster right, so I can't hold it. Okay, I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the sense of disconnection from your body is triggering more disaster thinking. Can you try to notice what happens when you say "I'm getting overwhelmed" – is there a sense of your body tensing up further, or does it feel like something is pulling away from you?

Patient: Both, I think — my shoulders and jaw tighten like I'm bracing for impact, and at the same time there's this hollow, out-of-body feeling like I'm watching the collapse happen to someone else. That split just feeds the disaster machine harder — missed deadlines, lost funding, eviction, totally ruined — and the certainty of it ramps the tension up even more. I'm really spiraling here, I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're outside of your body, observing the thought patterns and physical sensations as if they're happening to someone else. Can you try to bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath, just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change anything else?

Patient: I try, but I can't hold it — my breath feels paper-thin and my attention keeps snapping away. The second I try to notice it my brain fires up the collapse movie—I'll miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted—and now my hands are shaking and I can't focus. I'm really scattered and overwhelmed right now; can we slow down and do one tiny guided step?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is quickly jumping back into the disaster thinking once you try to focus on the breath. Let's try something small and gentle. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here." Just say it with me: "I am here."

Patient: I try to say it—“I am here”—but the second I do my chest clamps, my hands tremble, and my brain screams that being here means I'll fall behind and everything will collapse: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone. Saying it feels like a lie, like I'm admitting I can't hold it together, so it just spikes my panic. I'm really scattered and overwhelmed right now; can we slow down and do something even smaller?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I am here" triggered more disaster thinking. Let's try something even smaller. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, just for a moment. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change anything else, without thinking about your breath, or the collapse story, or anything else?

Patient: I try to, but my attention just skitters—my feet feel kind of numb and the second I notice that my chest tightens and my brain fires up the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up ruined. My hands are shaking and I can't hold a single sensation for more than a beat. I'm really scattered—can we slow down and do something even smaller?

Therapist: It's like your attention is always a step ahead, ready to jump into the disaster thinking. Let's try something even smaller than noticing your feet. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in, and then the sensation of the air moving out, without trying to change anything else. Can you do that for just a tiny moment?

Patient: I try, but my attention just snaps—my nostrils feel paper-thin for a beat and then my chest clamps and my hands tremble. The second I notice the air my brain throws up the collapse movie—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone and ruined—so I can't hold it for even a second. I'm really jittery and scattered right now; can we slow down and do something even smaller?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is super sensitive to even the slightest hint of attention. Let's try something extremely small. I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for a fraction of a second, without focusing on it or trying to change anything. Just be with the sensation of the breath, without judgment, without trying to do anything else. Can you do that for just a teeny, tiny moment?

Patient: I try for a split second, but my attention jerks away—the chest clamps, my hands tremble, and my brain instantly plays the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up ruined. I'm so jittery and scattered I can't even hold a fraction of a breath; it feels like everything's vibrating. Can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete?

Therapist: It's like your brain is extremely reactive to even the slightest hint of attention. Let's try something even more concrete. I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation of your feet on the ground, right now, in this moment. Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change anything else, without thinking about your breath, or the collapse story, or anything else. Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, for just one second?

Patient: I try, but I can't hold it—my feet feel numb and disconnected the moment I try, my chest clamps and my hands tremble, and my brain immediately plays the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up alone and ruined. I'm more jittery and scattered than usual and I can't keep my attention there for even a beat. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always on high alert, ready to jump into the disaster thinking. Let's try something even more concrete, something you can hold onto for a very short time. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in through one nostril, and then out through the other nostril. Just notice the sensation of one nostril breathing in, and then the sensation of the other nostril breathing out. Can you just hold onto that for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: I try, but my attention rips away the second I try—my chest clamps, my hands shake, and my brain yells the whole collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up completely ruined, like that's definitely what's coming. I'm so jittery and scattered I can't even hold a fraction of a breath—can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete, because this is feeling impossible right now?

Therapist: It's like your brain is completely overwhelmed. I want to try something that's almost impossible to lose your attention. I want you to focus on the sensation of the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit, just a tiny bit. Not trying to change it, not trying to do anything, just noticing that your body is already a little bit relaxed, a little bit soft. Can you just acknowledge that, even if it's just for a nanosecond?

Patient: I think—maybe for a nanosecond—my shoulders softened a tiny bit, but the second I noticed it my chest slammed shut and my brain hurled me into the collapse movie: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up completely ruined. I can't seem to let that tiny softness stay without it turning into proof everything's already falling apart, so I'm really jittery and scattered—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny moment of relaxation was just a fleeting thought, and your brain quickly jumped back into disaster thinking. Let's try something that's almost impossible to lose your attention. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and then I want you to say to yourself, "My feet are on the floor." Just say that to yourself, without thinking about anything else, without trying to change anything, without worrying about the outcome. Can you just say it, and stay with the sensation of your feet touching the floor?

Patient: I say it—“My feet are on the floor”—but it barely lands; my chest clamps, my hands tremble, and my brain immediately jams the collapse movie—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted—so I can't stay with the feeling. I'm way too scattered and distracted to hold even that; can we slow down and try something even smaller or more concrete, like pressing my thumb to my palm and staying with that?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always ready to jump into the disaster thinking. Let's try something even more concrete and tactile. I want you to notice the sensation of your thumb touching your palm, just the sensation of the two touching, without trying to change anything else, without thinking about the outcome. Just be with the sensation of the physical contact, the pressure, the warmth. Can you stay with that for just a tiny moment?

Patient: I try—the contact is there for a split second, a little pressure and warmth, but then my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and my brain rams the collapse movie—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up completely ruined. I can't hold that tiny sensation without spiraling—can we slow down and try something even more concrete?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment of contact was too brief for you to hold onto. Let's try something even more concrete, something you can focus on without your brain jumping away. I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, but this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of just one nostril. Just notice the sensation of one nostril breathing in, without trying to change anything else, without thinking about the outcome. Can you just focus on that one nostril, for just a tiny moment?

Patient: I try to focus on one nostril, but my attention rips away the second I try—my chest clamps, my breath goes thin, my hands tremble, and my brain spits out the collapse movie: I'll miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up utterly ruined—definitely. I'm too jittery to hold even that; can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete?

Therapist: It's like your brain is extremely sensitive to even the slightest hint of focus. Let's try something so small that it's almost impossible to lose your attention. I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation of one nostril. No, not focus on it, just notice that the nostril is... closed. Just notice that it's closed, without trying to change anything else, without thinking about the outcome. Can you just be with that for a tiny moment?

Patient: Okay—I notice one nostril kind of feels closed for a split second, but the moment I notice my chest clamps, my hands shake, and the disaster movie kicks in—miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up ruined—and I can't hold it. I'm extra jumpy and scattered right now; can we slow down and try something even smaller or more concrete?

Therapist: It's like the moment of noticing the nostril was too brief for you to hold onto. Let's try something so small that it's almost imperceptible. I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation of your nostril being closed. Not the thought of it being closed, not the fact that it's closed, just the sensation of... nothing. The sensation of the absence of sensation. Can you just be with that for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: I try to notice that tiny nothing—just the absence of feeling—but the second I do my chest slams, my breath thins, my hands shake, and the disaster movie starts: miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up completely ruined. I can't hold even that tiny fraction without spiraling; I'm really jittery and overwhelmed—can we slow down and try something even more concrete?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment of noticing the absence was too brief for you to hold onto. Let's try something so small that it's almost impossible to lose your attention. I want you to notice the sensation of one single point of contact. Not the pressure, not the warmth, just the fact that your thumb is touching your palm. Not the sensation of the touch, just the fact that it's happening. Can you just acknowledge that for a tiny instant?

Patient: I can catch that single point for a split second—my thumb on my palm—but as soon as I notice it my chest clamps, my hands tremble, and my brain screams the collapse: I’ll miss deadlines, lose funding, get evicted, end up completely ruined—definitely. I’m extra jumpy and scattered right now and can’t hold even that tiny instant; can we slow down and do something even more concrete?
