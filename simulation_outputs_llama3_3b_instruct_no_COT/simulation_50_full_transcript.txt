Patient: I've been feeling crushed by sadness and a total lack of motivation since my partner died, and it's starting to mess up my relationship and my work as a nurse. My brain's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster — I keep seeing myself never getting better, screwing up at work, losing everything, and I can't shake that those things will definitely happen. I'm usually pragmatic and organized, so it frustrates me that I can't fix this and it all just feels inevitable.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds incredibly tough. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to push through the sadness and motivation, as if you're trying to 'fix' it? What do you experience in that moment?

Patient: When I try to push through, my chest tightens and my head fills with this nonstop disaster script — I picture myself making a mistake at work, getting reported, losing my job, then my bills spiral, my partner leaves because I can't hold things together, and everything I've built collapses. Physically I feel numb and exhausted but also keyed up, like I either freeze or frantically overdo things, which just feeds into the script that I'm already failing. I keep telling myself other outcomes are possible, but in that moment they just feel unrealistic and useless.

Therapist Answer:
So the thoughts of disaster are really flooding in and your physical sensations of tension and numbness are intense. It sounds like your body is trying to prepare for a worst-case scenario, even when you're trying to push through the sadness. Can you bring your attention to the part of you that's not telling yourself 'you're going to fail'? What's the voice or feeling that's saying, 'I'm trying to hold it together, I've got this'?

Patient: There's a tiny, practical voice — the one I'm used to, with checklists and schedules — that says, "Break it down, do one thing, call in if you need to, you can handle this." But it's so drowned out by the fortune-teller that as soon as I try to listen, it spawns a full catastrophe story about a missed med, a complaint, an investigation, and everything collapsing, so the helpful voice just feels pointless and naive.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The "helpful voice" seems to be a more grounded, practical part of yourself that's trying to stay in control. It's being completely overpowered by the more catastrophic thoughts, which are really fueling your anxiety and sense of overwhelm. It's as if the catastrophe thoughts are triggering a fight-or-flight response, making it hard for the helpful voice to get a foothold. Can you imagine a scenario where you could momentarily set aside the catastrophic thoughts and listen to the helpful voice without immediately spiraling into more worst-case scenarios?

Patient: I can try to imagine it — maybe I'm in a quiet corner at work, taking a few breaths and telling myself "one task at a time," and for a second the checklist voice shows up and feels steady. But almost immediately the fortune-teller kicks in: I see a missed med, a patient harmed, an investigation, losing my license, my partner leaving — so that helpful feeling lasts two seconds and my chest tightens and goes numb. I don't know how to make that tiny voice stick; it just feels naive and the disaster feels inevitable, so imagining it doesn't really calm me.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're having a hard time holding onto that brief moment of calm and connection with the helpful voice. The catastrophic thoughts seem to be always one step ahead, making you feel like you're not capable of making a difference. Can you notice what happens when you try to acknowledge the helpful voice, even if only for a brief moment? What's the sensation of those few seconds of calmness, and is there anything in that moment that feels worth saving?

Patient: When I catch that helpful voice, there's this tiny warmth in my chest and my breathing actually slows — for a beat I feel clear enough to make a list and do one thing. That felt like something worth saving: my capacity to be organized, to keep patients safe, and to show up for my partner. But the fortune-teller immediately hijacks it — that two-second calm becomes a missed med, a complaint, an investigation, my license gone, bills piling up, and my partner leaving — and honestly, those other outcomes just feel naive and impossible to believe. I’m trying to hang on to the calm, but it feels like trying to hold sand while the disaster story rips it away.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the calmness is a fleeting refuge, and the catastrophic thoughts are constantly eroding it. You're trying to hold onto the sense of control and competence that comes with being organized and taking care of yourself and others, but it's being consistently undermined. It's as if the more you cling to the calm, the more the fortune-teller's predictions seem more plausible. Can you try to imagine what would happen if you were to let go of the need to save that calmness, just for a moment?

Patient: If I let go for even a second, I get this wave of panic — my hands go cold and my head blasts with the image that I didn't double-check a med and a patient gets hurt. Then it snowballs: complaint, investigation, lose my job, can't pay the bills, my partner leaves — I can't imagine that chain NOT happening, so "letting go" feels like walking off a cliff. I do want that tiny calm because it felt like breathing, but honestly it just seems naive and dangerous and I can't make myself do it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the panic is fueled by the sense of responsibility and the fear of losing control. The calmness is perceived as a luxury you can't afford, especially when the potential consequences seem so dire. Would you be willing to experiment with a tiny, tiny part of that calmness, even just for a tiny moment, without necessarily letting go of your fear or sense of responsibility?

Patient: Okay, I can try one tiny breath, but the second I slow down my brain fires the whole disaster script — missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, bills piling, partner leaving — and my chest clamps shut. I really don't see how a pause would stop that chain; it just feels like postponing the inevitable, and honestly I'm skeptical this will help. I'm trying to do it, but I'm worn out and don't know what would actually make the fortune-teller quiet.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit desperate and skeptical about finding a way to stop the cycle of catastrophizing. You're wondering if it's even possible to break free from the fortune-teller's grip. Can you consider what would happen if, instead of trying to silence the fortune-teller, you were to acknowledge its presence, even just for a moment?

Patient: I tried that once — saying out loud, "there's the fortune-teller again" — and for a split second I felt a little distance. But almost immediately it comes back louder, filling in the whole collapse: missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license revoked, no income, bills, my partner leaves — it actually feels like acknowledging it gives it more detail, not less. Honestly, it feels dangerous to even name it; I don't trust that would help and I'm tired of these scripts.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like acknowledging the fortune-teller's presence actually seemed to amplify its language, rather than reducing its power. You're starting to wonder if naming it would even be helpful. Can you think of a different way to approach the fortune-teller, one that doesn't involve trying to silence or reason with it?

Patient: Maybe I could try treating it like an annoying coworker — give it a fixed "worry time" or make it write its predictions down so I don't have to carry them all day, or tell myself I can check the list later instead of acting on every fear in the moment. But the second I imagine that, the fortune-teller just uses the time to craft more detailed disasters — a missed med becomes a complaint with a paper trail, an investigation with evidence, my license revoked, no income, and my partner leaving — so it still feels pointless. I'm willing to test something small, but honestly I'm skeptical and worn out; it feels like any strategy just gives the fortune-teller more material and I end up more panicked.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck and skeptical about finding a way to manage the fortune-teller's predictions. You're worried that any new strategy will just fuel its language and lead to more anxiety. Can you try something even simpler: what if, instead of trying to change the fortune-teller's predictions or strategies, you were to simply observe it as it comes up, without judgment or reaction?

Patient: I tried that once — I can watch for a second and it feels like there's a tiny gap, but the fortune-teller just uses the gap as more ammo: "You're only observing because you missed a med," and then it builds the whole dossier — complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves. For a beat I feel a little separate, but it always gets louder and more detailed, and I end up reacting harder because now I'm measuring how bad it could be. I really don't see how plain observation would help when the machine just sharpens its predictions, and honestly I'm getting tired of testing stuff that just makes it more vivid.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like observing the fortune-teller didn't quite work out as you hoped. You're starting to feel like it's just fueling its predictions and making you more reactive. Can you think of a small, everyday activity that you often do when you're not catastrophizing, like eating or checking your phone? Can you try to bring that same attention to your breath, noticing it as you breathe in and out, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try one slow breath... but the moment I tune into it the fortune-teller starts yelling the whole script — missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and my chest clamps up. That tiny calm lasts a beat and then I'm left feeling hollow and like I'm just feeding the disaster, so I don't really see how this helps long-term.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the fortune-teller's predictions are still able to hijack the moment, even when you're focused on your breath. You're feeling a bit deflated and like you're not getting anywhere. Can you think of a small, simple phrase you could say to yourself right now, just for this moment, that acknowledges the fortune-teller's presence without trying to stop it or change it?

Patient: Maybe something like, "Okay — that's the fortune-teller, saying 'missed med, complaint, investigation, license gone' — I hear you." I don't really follow how saying that out loud helps, but I can try it once and see what happens.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Acknowledging the fortune-teller's presence in that way might give you a small sense of recognition, and possibly even a bit of detachment. It's a tiny, humble acknowledgment that doesn't try to stop the fortune-teller or change its predictions. What happens when you say that phrase to yourself, right now, without judgment or expectation of what comes next?

Patient: I said it out loud, kind of flat — "Okay, that's the fortune-teller..." — and for a second it felt like I noticed it, but then my head filled up instantaneously with the whole dossier: missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves. I'm not sure I follow how that helps; it just got louder and now I'm jumpy and can't focus.

It sounds like acknowledging the fortune-teller's presence didn't quite give you the calmness or clarity you were hoping for. Instead, it triggered the old pattern of catastrophizing. Would you be willing to try again, but this time, before you say the phrase, take a tiny pause, and before the fortune-teller starts predicting, notice the sensation of your body, just the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how feeling my feet would stop anything, but... okay, I tried a tiny pause and noticed my feet felt heavy and the air felt shallow, and for a second that was something. Then the fortune-teller blasted back: missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and now I'm just jittery and thinking this is pointless, but I can try again if you want.

It sounds like the pause gave you a tiny moment of noticing your physical sensations, but the fortune-teller was still able to hijack that moment. You're feeling frustrated and stuck. Would you be willing to try one more time, but this time, instead of trying to change or stop the fortune-teller, try simply allowing it to be there, without judgment, and then... just be with it, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: I can try to sit with it, and for a breath there's this hollow knot in my chest and my hands go cold, but the fortune-teller immediately goes full-tilt — missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and I start panicking. I don't see how "being with it" doesn't just feed the machine; it just makes the story louder and I'm left jittery and useless. How am I supposed to stay with that without it swallowing me whole?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to sit with the fortune-teller is not working for you. You're feeling like it's just making the situation worse. Can you think of a different way to approach this: instead of trying to change or be with the fortune-teller, what if you were to make a small, tiny commitment to yourself, something as simple as "I will take one small step forward, no matter what the fortune-teller says"?

Patient: Okay... I can try one tiny commitment: tomorrow before my shift I'll spend five minutes doing a quick meds checklist and nothing else. But the fortune-teller's already screaming that I'll miss one thing, a patient gets hurt, there's a complaint, an investigation, my license is gone, no income, and my partner leaves — so I don't exactly believe it'll change anything. I'm worn out and skeptical, but I'll try it once and see how it goes, even if I expect the machine to hijack it.

It sounds like you're feeling a bit hopeless and skeptical about the whole process. You're not sure if it'll make a difference, but you're willing to try. That's actually a small step forward. Can you take a moment to notice what happens when you make that commitment to yourself, what sensations do you experience in your body, before you even go to bed tonight?

Patient: When I commit to it, there's a tiny flicker — like a small, stupid warmth that says "okay, one thing" — but immediately my chest knots up and my hands go cold. My breathing gets shallow and the fortune-teller's script floods in: missed med, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves, and I feel jittery and worthless. I'm worn out and skeptical, but I'll try the five-minute checklist tomorrow, even though I expect the machine to start drafting the dossier as soon as I breathe.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that tiny flicker of warmth was short-lived, and the fortune-teller's predictions were able to hijack the moment again. But you're still willing to try the checklist tomorrow. That's a small step forward. Can you notice what happens when you think to yourself, "I'll just try the checklist tomorrow"? Is there any difference in your experience of that thought, any change in your body or emotions?

Patient: It gives a tiny, stupid flicker of relief — like my shoulders drop for a second — but it never sticks. The fortune-teller then rushes in with the whole dossier (missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves), my chest clamps, breath goes shallow, hands go cold, and I feel jittery and useless. I don't really believe "just try" will stop it, but I'll do the checklist tomorrow even though I expect the machine to start drafting the next catastrophe as soon as I open my eyes.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the relief was fleeting, and the fortune-teller was able to quickly swoop back in. You're starting to see that "just trying" isn't really changing the outcome. But you're still willing to do the checklist tomorrow, despite your skepticism. That's a small act of commitment. Can you notice what would happen if, instead of focusing on the checklist, you were to focus on your breath while you're doing the checklist tomorrow?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it feels like focusing on my breath while doing the checklist would just give the fortune-teller more time to draft its dossier. The second I try to slow down my breathing my head fills with the missed med → complaint → investigation → license gone chain, my chest clamps and my hands go cold. I can try it tomorrow, but I'm worn out and really skeptical this won't just make the machine louder.

No breath, no focus on the checklist, just the sensation of your feet?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how feeling my feet will stop this, but… okay, I'll try. Right now when I imagine it my feet feel heavy and numb and the fortune-teller's already rolling out the dossier — missed med, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and I get jumpy and useless.

It sounds like you're trying, but you're still skeptical that it will help. You're willing to try it, but you're not holding out much hope that it will make a difference. That's okay. Can you notice what happens when you're doing the five-minute checklist tomorrow, and you're focusing on your feet? Is there anything in that moment that feels slightly different, even if it's just a tiny difference?

Patient: When I actually notice my feet while doing the checklist, there's a couple of seconds where my chest loosens and my hands steady enough to tick a box — it feels like the fortune-teller is quieter for a tiny beat. But it never holds: almost immediately it floods back in with the whole dossier — missed med, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and I'm shallow-breathed and jittery again.

Would you be willing to focus on the sensation of that tiny moment when your chest loosens and your hands steady, without trying to analyze it or label it as progress or failure?

Patient: I can try, but I don't really know how not to judge it — my brain wants to put a label on everything. When I focus on that tiny looseness there's one beat where my hands steady and I can almost tick a box, then the fortune-teller yells the whole dossier again — missed med, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and it just feels fragile and pointless, but I'll try to hold that beat next time.

It sounds like your brain is prone to labeling and judgment, and that's making it hard for you to simply observe the moment. Can you try to approach it like a tiny, small experience, without trying to make sense of it or label it as "good" or "bad"? Instead, can you just notice the sensation of your hands steadying, and the feeling of the fortune-teller's predictions being quieter, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice the steadiness without slapping a label on it. For a beat my hands do steady and my chest loosens and it feels like something could hold, but then the fortune-teller screams the whole dossier — missed med, patient harmed, complaint, investigation, license gone, no income, partner leaves — and it eats that moment.

For example, what if you simply focused on the sensation of your breath, without trying to control it or change it, but simply noticing it as it is?

Patient: I don't really follow how noticing my breath won't just give the fortune-teller more time to draft its dossier — every time I try to notice it my head fills with missed med → complaint → investigation and my chest clamps and my hands go cold.

But as soon as I do, my brain yells I'll spill it because I'm distracted, a patient will see me, complain, there'll be an investigation, my license gone, no income, my partner leaves — so it feels pointless, but I guess I can try holding the mug for a minute and see what happens.
