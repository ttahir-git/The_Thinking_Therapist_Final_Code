Patient: Hi, I've been ruminating about my performance at work — there's this persistent meta-narrative that I'm always underperforming which then catalyzes a procrastination loop. As a software developer the stakes feel quantifiable yet nebulous, so I tend to theorize about failure modes and optimization strategies instead of actually feeling the anxiety. Also, there's this background of PTSD-related isolation that layers onto the worry and makes it harder to reach out.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really caught up in trying to figure out how to improve your performance and avoid failure, and that's creating a lot of anxiety for you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself getting caught up in that theorizing about failure modes and optimization strategies? What's the experience like for you when you're in that mental state?

Patient: When I get stuck in that theorizing, my cognition shifts into a metacognitive loop where I enumerate failure modes, assign subjective probabilities, and simulate permutations of worst-case scenarios. It's a kind of mental hypervigilance — I can map the architecture of the anxiety in detail, which paradoxically immobilizes my executive function, so instead of coding I refactor plans or micro-optimize my task list. Physically it's a low-grade tension and restlessness, but I mostly keep it at arm's length by narrativizing it; I procrastinate because the "perfect plan" never materializes and starting feels too risky.

Therapist: Your mind can get really caught up in the details of potential failure, and that can be overwhelming. It sounds like you're using your analytical skills to try to manage the anxiety, but that's actually creating more tension. It's like you're trying to hold onto the anxiety in a way that makes it feel manageable, but ultimately perpetuating the cycle. Can you imagine what would happen if you allowed that anxiety to be present in your body, without trying to intellectualize it or control it?

Patient: Intellectually, I can model it — like an interoceptive exposure where allowing afferent signals to persist should theoretically downregulate the amygdala response over time — but practically that sounds risky and ambiguous, and my predictive machinery flags it as a high-probability path to dysregulation. When I try to "sit with" the anxiety, my attention splinters, I get tunnel vision on contingencies, and I start hyperplanning to mitigate an imagined cascade of failures instead of actually feeling anything; somatically it’s a tightness in my chest and a kind of buzzy restlessness, but I tend to verbalize that as an observation rather than letting it be raw. I’m skeptical that simply permitting it won’t just amplify the PTSD-related isolation — I worry that if I stop controlling it, I’ll lose myself in it. I don't really know how to do this without spiraling; can we break down what "allowing" would look like in concrete, tolerable steps?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is using its predictive machinery to try to anticipate and control the anxiety, which is leading to a kind of cognitive avoidance. You're worried that letting go of control might make things worse, and that's a understandable concern. What if we start small? Instead of trying to "allow" the anxiety, what if we focus on just noticing the sensation in your chest, the physical tightness, without trying to label it or make sense of it right away? Would you be willing to just observe that sensation for a few deep breaths, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: I can try, though I’m already running a risk-analysis in my head about how this will go — that’s my default. Can we make it very concrete: you count slowly to three for each inhale and three for each exhale, and I’ll do three rounds? I’ll aim to keep it observational — notice the tightness in my chest and the buzzing — and if I start analyzing I’ll say “analysis” so we can bring it back.

Therapist: Let's do it. I'll start counting, and you focus on the physical sensations in your body. Inhale for three, hold for three, exhale for three, hold for three. Ready when you are.

Patient: Okay, starting. Inhale one, two, three — hold — exhale one, two, three — hold. I can feel the chest tightness and a buzzy restlessness; my attention is already splintering and there's an impulse to map contingencies instead of staying with the sensation — analysis.

Therapist: Notice that you caught yourself already, and that's okay. You said "analysis" to bring it back. Let's just acknowledge that and keep going. Inhale for three, hold for three, exhale for three, hold for three. When you're ready, try to stay with the sensation of the tightness and restlessness for just a little while longer, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I can feel the tightness as a dull pressure under my sternum and a buzzy restlessness in my hands and jaw; my breaths stay a bit shallow even while counting. My mind is already schematizing contingencies again—analysis—but I'm trying to re-anchor to the physical sensation. I can stay with it for a bit longer, though it's getting a little overwhelming; can we slow the pace down?

Therapist: Let's slow it down. Inhale for one, hold for five, exhale for one, hold for five. Notice the sensation of the tightness under your sternum, the buzzy restlessness in your hands and jaw, and the feeling of shallow breaths. Try to keep your focus on those sensations, without trying to change them or analyze them.

Patient: The tightness is still a dull pressure under my sternum and the buzzy restlessness is in my jaw and fingertips; my breaths feel shallow even though the counts are forcing a bit more air in. My mind is already enumerating task contingencies again — analysis — and I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed; can we slow the pace more or use a simple anchor (like feeling my feet on the floor) to help me stay with this?

Therapist: Let's try to anchor yourself in the physical sensation of your feet on the floor. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the weight of your body distributed on them, the feeling of the floor beneath you. No need to do anything with it, just notice it. Inhale for one, hold for ten, exhale for one, hold for ten. Try to stay with your feet on the floor, and see if that can help you stay present with the other sensations in your body.

Patient: I did that cycle — noticing my feet: pressure under the heels, a slight coolness on the soles, weight sort of distributed toward the balls of my feet; it's unexpectedly stabilizing, like a low-bandwidth focal point for attention. The chest tightness is still a dull pressure and the buzzy restlessness in my jaw and fingertips persists; even as I observe, my mind immediately starts probabilistic modeling of failure modes — analysis — which pulls me toward hyperplanning. It's a bit overwhelming but the feet anchor reduced the urge to spiral; can we keep this slower and maybe add a simple tactile anchor (like pressing fingertips together) for a few more rounds so I don't default to analysis?

Therapist: Notice how the feet anchor helped you stay present for a moment. Let's keep going with that, and add a tactile anchor to help you stay with the sensation. Press your fingertips together gently, just for a moment, and notice the sensation of your fingertips touching. Inhale for one, hold for ten, exhale for one, hold for ten. Try to keep your attention on the sensation of your fingertips touching, and the sensation of your feet on the floor, without getting caught up in analysis or other thoughts.

Patient: I did that cycle — fingertips pressed together, there’s a faint pressure and warmth at the pads and my feet feel solid against the floor. The chest tightness and the buzzy restlessness are still there but the anchors dampened the immediate urge to spiral; my mind still popped into probabilistic mapping — analysis. It’s getting a bit intense; can we shorten the holds to five seconds and keep the fingertip anchor so I don’t slip back into hyperplanning?

Therapist: Notice that the anchors are helping to regulate your experience, but the mind is still wandering. Let's keep the fingertip anchor and shorten the holds. Press your fingertips together and inhale for one, hold for five, exhale for one, hold for five. Try to stay with the sensation of your fingertips touching and the sensation of your feet on the floor, without getting caught up in analysis or other thoughts.

Patient: I did the fingertip-and-feet cycle with the shorter holds; the tactile anchors actually dampened the immediate urge to hyperplan and my breath slowed a bit. The chest tightness and buzzy restlessness are still there, and my mind keeps popping into probabilistic modeling — analysis — which pulls me toward checking tasks instead of starting them. Can we do a few more of these short rounds and then pivot to a very concrete, time-limited behavioral step I can try at work to interrupt the procrastination loop?

Therapist: Notice how the anchors are helping to regulate your experience, even if the mind is still getting caught up in analysis. Let's do a few more rounds to build on that. Press your fingertips together and inhale for one, hold for five, exhale for one, hold for five. Then, let's pivot to a concrete step. What's one small, specific action you can take at work today to start on a task you've been putting off, without overthinking or planning? Just one tiny step.

Patient: Okay — concretely: I'll do a 10-minute "micro-Pomodoro" as a hard constraint and take one tiny, discrete step: open the repo, create a branch named start/<ticket>, and either write a single failing unit test or implement one small function (something that guarantees a commit). Theoretically this minimizes choice paralysis by lowering the activation energy, but I'm wary my brain will immediately start optimizing the process — analysis — so can we set a firm stop at 10 minutes and a simple accountability check (I report back what I actually did) so I don't use it as an excuse to hyperplan?

Therapist: Let's set that firm stop time and accountability check. When the timer goes off, you'll report back on what you actually did, and that will help keep you grounded in the present moment. I'll not take notes, but I'll ask you to confirm when the timer goes off: what did you do during that 10 minutes?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? It feels like another layer of meta-monitoring that my brain will just fold into the same analytic loop and use as data for more optimization (analysis). I'll try it anyway: when the 10 minutes are up I'll report back exactly what I did (open repo, create branch, write one failing test or implement a tiny function). Can you keep the check to a single factual question like "what did you do?" rather than evaluative feedback so it doesn't turn into another performance review?

Therapist: You're right, I was worried about adding another layer of analysis. Let's keep it simple. When the 10 minutes are up, I'll just ask: "What did you do?" No judgment, no evaluation, just a straightforward question to help you stay present.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like another data point my brain will fold into optimization and turn into more analysis. That said, I'll try it: I'm going to start the 10-minute micro-Pomodoro now (open repo, create branch start/<ticket>, write one failing test or implement a tiny function) and if I catch myself drifting into meta-planning I'll say "analysis" to bring it back. When the timer goes off I'll just answer the factual question "what did you do?" — no evaluation, just the facts.

Therapist: It's your way now. Go ahead and start the 10-minute micro-Pomodoro. When the time is up, I'll ask: "What did you do?"

Patient: I'm not sure I fully follow how the check-in won't just become another optimization metric — it still feels like data my brain will weaponize for analysis — but I'll do it anyway. Starting the 10-minute micro-Pomodoro now: open the repo, create branch start/<ticket>, and either write one failing test or implement a tiny function. If I catch myself drifting into meta-planning I'll say "analysis" and refocus; when the timer goes off I'll answer only the factual question, "what did you do?"

Therapist: You're committed to trying this approach. Go ahead and take that first action. Open the repo, create the branch, and take one small step. When the timer goes off, we'll check in: "What did you do?"

Patient: I'm still kind of unclear how this won't just become another optimization metric my brain chews on, but okay—starting the 10-minute micro-Pomodoro now. Opening the repo, creating branch start/<ticket>, and I'll aim to write one failing unit test or implement a tiny function; if I catch myself drifting into meta-planning I'll say "analysis" and refocus. When the timer goes off I'll answer only the factual question: "what did you do?"

Therapist: You're starting the process. Just focus on writing that first failing unit test or implementing that tiny function. When the timer goes off, we'll see what you did.

Patient: I'm about halfway through the 10 minutes — I opened the repo and created branch start/<ticket>. I started drafting a failing unit test for the small function I want to touch, but my mind immediately went into dependency-modeling and mocking strategies — analysis — so I used the fingertip-and-feet anchors to reorient and forced myself to type a very minimal assertion that will fail. I haven't run the tests or committed yet; can I use the remaining time to run it and make one single commit (or extend by five minutes)? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the micro-decisions and could use the slower pace so I don't slip back into hyperplanning.

Therapist: You've made good progress. You've created the branch and drafted a failing test. The fingertip-and-feet anchors helped you refocus. Let's see if you can build on that momentum. Go ahead and run the test, and then make one single commit. You can extend the micro-Pomodoro by five more minutes if you need more time. Just focus on making one small step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is adding five minutes supposed to help? It feels like another metric my brain will just fold into optimization and use to justify more planning. 

That said, I'll take the 5-minute extension: I'll run the test, make one minimal commit (message: "start/<ticket>: add failing test" or similar), and stop. I'll use the fingertip-and-feet anchors if I notice "analysis" creeping back, and when the timer goes off just ask me "what did you do?" and I'll report the facts.

Therapist: You're right again, the five-minute extension might not be the best approach. Let's just focus on making one small step. Run the test, make a minimal commit, and stop. When the timer goes off, we'll check in: "What did you do?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is this single-step stop supposed to prevent my brain from folding it into another performance metric? Regardless, I'll try: I'm going to run the test now, make one minimal commit with message "start/<ticket>: add failing test", and stop. If I notice the analysis loop I'll say "analysis" and use the fingertip-and-feet anchors, and then I'll report back factually when you ask "what did you do?"

Therapist: It's not about preventing your brain from folding it into a performance metric, but about being mindful of your intentions. Just focus on taking the one small step, running the test, making the minimal commit. When you're done, we'll check in: "What did you do?"

Patient: Okay. This is… a lot of effort right now — feels heavy and slow — but I'll run the test and make the minimal commit now. If my head starts optimizing again I'll say "analysis" and press my fingertips and feel my feet to re-anchor. I'll report back factually when it's done.

Therapist: Take the test and make the commit. Just focus on the process, not the outcome. When you're done, I'll ask: "What did you do?"

Patient: I ran the test — it failed as expected — and made a minimal commit on branch start/<ticket> with message "start/<ticket>: add failing test." I had to press my fingertips and feel my feet a few times and say "analysis" to re-anchor; it took more effort than I thought and I’m kind of wiped and skeptical this won't just become another metric my brain chews on. Can we figure out one tiny follow-up I can do after a short break that won't feel like adding to the performance ledger?

Therapist: You've taken a small step. Let's take a short break first. When you're feeling refreshed, we can explore a tiny follow-up that doesn't feel like another optimization task. Maybe something as simple as checking the weather or noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor. What's something small you could do to take a break without getting caught up in analysis?

Patient: Alright — I'll take a five-minute break and make a cup of tea. I'll focus on the sensory stuff: warmth of the mug, the taste, the pressure of my feet on the floor, and set a timer so it's explicitly bounded. I know that sounds procedural and my brain will likely reframe it as another metric, but it feels tolerable because it's grounded in sensation; if "analysis" creeps in I'll say it and re-anchor.

Therapist: You're being kind to yourself and acknowledging the potential for your brain to reinterpret the break as another optimization task. That's a great sign. Take your break, enjoy your tea, and focus on the sensory experience. When you're ready, we'll come back to the task at hand.

Patient: I'm back. The tea helped a little — warmth in my palms, bitter-sweet taste, the mug's weight felt oddly anchoring — and my feet on the floor kept that low-bandwidth steadiness. Energy still low; re-engaging feels effortful and a bit like moving through molasses.

For a tiny follow-up that hopefully won't become another performance metric: I'll spend five minutes reading the failing test I just wrote and then write a single, one-sentence plan on a sticky note (e.g., "Implement function X to return Y; ensure edge case Z handled"). No repo actions, no commits, just the sentence. If I notice my head going into optimization-mode I'll say "analysis" and press my fingertips and feel my feet to re-anchor, then I’ll report back what that one sentence was.

Therapist: You're taking small steps again. Reading the failing test and writing a one-sentence plan is a gentle next step. Let's do it. Go ahead and read the test and write that sentence. Don't worry about the process, just focus on the sentence. When you're done, I'll ask: "What was the sentence?"

Patient: Implement function calculateShippingCost to return the correct cost given weight and destination; explicitly handle zero-weight and missing-address edge cases. 

I'm already mapping how this will be measured and optimized—analysis—but writing the sentence felt a bit like offloading the loop, even if I'm still weary and skeptical.

Therapist: You wrote the sentence. Notice that your mind is already starting to analyze it, even though you said you'd try not to. That's okay. Just acknowledge that thought and gently refocus on the present moment. Take a deep breath, and let's just notice the sentence, without judgment. What does it feel like to look at that sentence, right now?

Patient: It feels like I’ve turned an amorphous anxiety into a tidy object on a sticky note — that actually lightens the chest a touch, like I’ve externalized some uncertainty. At the same time my cognition immediately wants to monetize that sentence into metrics and timelines — analysis — which brings a low hum of dread under the brief calm. I don’t know, it’s just… comforting in a pragmatic way but also risky, like handing my worry a new place to live.

Therapist: You've externalized some of your anxiety, and that's a small win. The sentence does feel like a tangible representation of your uncertainty, and that can be comforting. But, as you said, it's also a risk to give your worry a new home. Let's just acknowledge that tension, and come back to it when we're ready. For now, let's take one more deep breath together.

Patient: (inhales, exhales) That did... help a little — a slight loosening under my sternum and the buzzy restlessness quieted for a moment. As soon as there's a gap my mind wants to monetize the calm into a new plan — analysis — but that pause made the sticky-note sentence feel less heavy. I'm pretty spent; can we use that small space to do one tiny grounding thing next (like 30 seconds looking out the window) before I try to re-engage with the ticket?

Therapist: The calm was fleeting, but it was enough to give you a small respite. Take the 30 seconds to look out the window, and just notice the view. No thinking, no analyzing, just observing what you see. When you're ready, we'll come back to the ticket.

Patient: I did the 30 seconds — overcast sky, a neighbor’s dog barked once, a leaf drifted across the curb; it felt oddly stabilizing and the chest pressure loosened a bit. I'm still wary — analysis — but I'm ready to come back to the ticket. Can we do a five-minute micro-step: I'll implement the minimal stub to make the failing test pass and run it once, then just report the factual result when it's done?
