Patient: I've been stuck with this anger and frustration since the breakup — little things set me off, especially when I hear her name or see something that reminds me. I work construction, so I keep busy, but I'm snapping at people and even throwing things sometimes, and I hate being that guy. Honestly, I've tried talking before, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like those reminders of her can be really tough to navigate. It's like your mind is on high alert, and even the smallest triggers can set you off. Would it be helpful to take a moment to acknowledge those feelings with your hands?

Patient: How's that supposed to help? But... fine, I'll try it. My hands feel like they're already balled up into fists, like I wanna grab something and toss it; my chest gets tight and my jaw's clenched, and there's this hot rush behind my eyes like I'm about to blow. I don't know if this'll do anything, though.

Therapist: It can be really challenging to calm down and process these feelings, especially when they feel so raw. Can you tell me more about what's happening in your body when you feel like grabbing something or your chest gets tight? Is there a specific image, sound, or sensation that sets it off?

Patient: It's like everything tightens up — my fists clench, jaw locks, my chest feels heavy and hot behind the eyes, and my vision goes narrow so all I see is red. Usually it's a sound or an image — her name, my phone buzzing with a message I think is from her, seeing her truck around town, or even that stupid song we used to play — and after a long day on the site it's worse, like I'm running on fumes and anything sets me off. I get this stupid urge to grab something and throw it, not because I wanna hurt anyone but because I gotta get the heat out, and that terrifies me 'cause I don't wanna be that guy. How is talking about my breathing or noticing this supposed to help? I've tried breathing exercises before and it just sits there like a rock.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be really intense and overwhelming. It sounds like your body is trying to release a lot of pent-up energy and emotions. What if, instead of focusing on your breathing, we took a step back and looked at what's driving those urges? What do you think would happen if you were to make space for the urge to grab something and throw it, rather than trying to fight it or push it away?

Patient: If I make space for it, I'm afraid I'd just give myself permission to snap — grab something, smash it, and then feel like a real idiot afterward. Maybe it’d let off steam for a minute, but it also feels like I'm giving myself a green light to lose control, and I can't have that on the job or around the kids. How is that supposed to be different from just giving in? I've tried letting it out before and it didn't fix anything — it just made the hangover of shame worse.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that making space for the urge might lead to a slippery slope. Would it be possible to explore what's driving that fear of losing control, and what might happen if you were to let go of that fear, just for a moment?

Patient: I guess I'm scared that if I let that fear go I won't be able to stop myself — I could hurt someone, lose my job, or just look like a fool in front of the kids. It feels tied up with this helplessness from the breakup, like all I got left is the anger. I've tried digging into this before and it didn't change what happens at the end of a long day. How is poking at the reasons for it actually gonna stop me from snapping when I'm exhausted and someone says the wrong thing?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of losing control is deeply tied to the sense of helplessness and vulnerability you're feeling after the breakup. Can you think of a time when, even when you were feeling really exhausted or upset, you were able to pause and take care of something important to you, like getting the kids to school on time or taking care of a task that needed attention? What would it be like to approach that situation now, with the same level of care and attention, even if you're feeling the same raw emotions?

Patient: Yeah—one morning last month I was a wreck, but I still got the kids fed, strapped in the car, and to school on time. I just stuck to the routine, focused on the steps I had to do, and kept my hands busy handing out lunches so I didn’t have time to spiral. If I tried that now I’d probably try to use the routine as a brake—count to ten, step outside for a minute, hold onto something so I don’t throw it—but how is that supposed to help when I’m bone-tired and someone says her name and my chest goes tight? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're seeing that your daily routines and self-care can be a lifeline for you, even when you're feeling overwhelmed. Would it be helpful to explore what's different about the way you're approaching this situation when it's just you, versus when it's the kids or the routine? What if, instead of trying to use the routine as a way to calm down, you were to approach the situation with the same sense of care and attention that you showed with the kids, even if you're feeling the same emotions?

Patient: When it's the kids, I don't have a choice — gotta get them fed, keep my hands busy, and that actually keeps me from spiraling. When it's just me there's nothing forcing me to keep it together, so I stew or grab something and it all blows up. How is trying to "care for myself the same way" supposed to help when I'm exhausted and there's no one counting on me?

Therapist: It sounds like the lack of responsibility and expectation can be what's contributing to your tendency to spiral when it's just you. Would it be possible to consider that the act of caring for yourself, even in a small way, might be a matter of acknowledging your own value and importance, rather than just doing it out of obligation?

Patient: Maybe—I get the idea, but telling myself I matter doesn't stop the heat when I'm bone-tired and I see her truck. I do see how the routine with the kids grounds me, but when it's just me, saying "be kind to yourself" feels weak. Maybe I could try a small thing—make the coffee or call a buddy—before I spiral, but how is that actually gonna stop me from snapping when someone says her name? I'm trying to see the link here, but I'm still stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a tangible solution to calm down, rather than just a feeling. Would you be willing to try making that cup of coffee, or calling a buddy, not as a way to calm down, but as a way to mark a transition, a small step between seeing her truck and getting really upset?

Patient: Okay—I'll try the transition thing, but seriously, how is making coffee or calling a buddy supposed to stop the heat when I'm dead tired and see her truck? Maybe I could pull over, make a cup, or text a buddy "need to vent," but what if they're not around or I'm stuck on the site and can't leave? I can give it a shot though—what would you actually want me to say to a buddy so it doesn't come off like whining?

Therapist: It sounds like you're still wondering what that actual conversation would look like with your buddy, rather than just the act of doing it. What would you say to a buddy when you text or call them, not to vent, but to use the connection as a temporary anchor, like a " anchoring phrase" that helps you pause and breathe?

Patient: Yeah, I’d keep it short so it don’t look like whining — something like: text: “Hey—need a quick minute, I’m on edge. Can you talk?” or “Need a 5‑min reality check, you free?” Call: “Hey man, not in a good headspace, can you help me talk it down for five?” 

But how is that supposed to help if they don’t pick up? I’m jittery right now and if they ignore it I just spiral. What do I do if I’m stuck on site and can’t talk—text something different or…?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to come up with a way to communicate with your buddy that feels brief and not like whining. What if, instead of relying on your buddy's response, you focused on the act of sending the message itself, and the pause that comes with it? What would it be like to just send that message, and see what happens in the silence that follows?

Patient: Yeah—sending it might help a little, like I did something instead of just stewing. But the silence would kill me — makes me feel ignored, and my hands are already shaking just thinking about it. If they don't pick up I guess I could have a backup text or do a quick physical anchor, but seriously, how is that supposed to stop me when I'm this wound up?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of silence is still really strong for you. Would you be willing to try something even smaller, something just to give yourself a tiny bit of physical comfort, like taking a deep breath, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or feeling the weight of your body in the chair, without waiting for a response?

Patient: I can try, but how's that supposed to help when my head's already racing and my hands are jittery? Alright—my boots on the floor, gravel under my soles, weight sinking into my legs, chest still tight though. It steadies me for a beat, but it slips quick—then all I can think about is her truck or some stupid song and the heat comes back. What do I do when that second wears off and I'm still furious?

Therapist: It sounds like that small anchor helped you pause for a moment, but the second that passed, the storm came back. Would you be willing to try something that focuses on the sensation of your body right now, even if it's still feeling tense and angry? What if you just notice, without trying to change it, where the sensation of your chest tightness is right now, in this moment?

Patient: Alright—it's like a tight band under my ribs, pressure that climbs into my throat, jaw locked, hands shaking and my vision gets narrow. I can try to notice it, but usually staring at it just makes me more furious—how is that supposed to stop me from snapping? I'll try to keep attention on it for a bit, but I'm jittery and my mind keeps bouncing to stuff I can't shake.

Therapist: It sounds like focusing on the physical sensation is becoming overwhelming. Would you be willing to try something that doesn't try to change or process the feeling, but rather acknowledges it, like simply acknowledging the sensation as "this is my body" or "my chest feels tight right now"?

Patient: Alright—I'll try it: "This is my body, my chest feels tight right now." Saying it out loud kind of makes me more aware, not less — my hands are still shaking and I can't keep my head from jumping to whatever set me off. How is that supposed to help stop me from snapping when someone says her name? I'm trying to stay with it, but it's not doing much — what else can I do right now?

Therapist: It sounds like labeling the physical sensation isn't having the desired effect. Would you be willing to try something even smaller, a tiny tiny step, like just noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of your feet touching the floor?

Patient: Okay—boots on the floor, gravel under my soles, weight into my legs. It steadies me for two breaths, then my jaw locks and my head snaps right back to her and I get jittery all over. How's that supposed to stop the heat when it comes roaring back like that? I need something that holds longer—what else can I try right now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a more sustained anchor. What if, instead of focusing on your feet or the sensation in your body, you tried to focus on your breath, not to calm down, but to simply observe it, as it is, in this moment?

Patient: How's that supposed to help? Alright, I'll try — breathing's shallow and fast, like I'm holding it, chest tight, hands still shaking. Noticing it makes me more wired, not calmer, and my head keeps snapping back to her truck or her name. If watching my breath doesn't hold me together, what else can I actually do in the moment that lasts longer than a couple breaths?

Therapist: It sounds like observing your breath isn't holding your attention. Would you be willing to try something that incorporates the anchor of your physical presence, like taking a small, brief action that involves your hands, like picking up a nearby object and examining it, or taking a small step forward, without trying to control or change anything?

Patient: Alright—I'll try. There's a wrench on the bench, so I grabbed it—it's cold, solid, heavy in my hand and that actually steadies me for like two breaths, my fingers stop shaking for a second. But I'm still jittery, my heart's racing and my head keeps snapping back to her name, and I keep reaching for my phone like it's gonna buzz. How's holding a wrench different from the other stuff I've tried—what do I do when that second wears off and the heat just comes back?

Therapist: It sounds like holding the wrench gave you a brief reprieve. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the wrench or the feeling of calmness, you simply let go of the expectation that you'll hold onto it? Would you be willing to let the wrench fall to the ground, without trying to catch it or hold onto it, and see what happens next?

Patient: Alright—I let it go. It clanged and for a beat my hands steadied, but then my heart jumped and I'm already darting to my phone like it's gonna buzz. How is dropping a wrench supposed to stop me from losing it when I'm bone-tired and someone says her name? I'm trying it, but I'm jittery and it feels like a quick trick that won't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like dropping the wrench gave you a temporary break, but the underlying pattern persists. What if, instead of focusing on the wrench or trying to control your reaction, you looked at the pattern that keeps repeating itself, the way your mind keeps jumping from her name to reaching for your phone?

Patient: Yeah — it's like a loop: I hear her name or see something, my chest clamps down, my hands start moving to my phone like it's automatic, and then I'm waiting for something that never helps and just gets me hotter. I've done the "notice the pattern" thing before and it feels useless in that split second — noticing doesn't stop my hands from moving. How is that supposed to change the reflex when I'm already jittery and my fingers are twitching toward the phone?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the pattern, but it's not translating into a change in behavior. What if, in that moment, you were to take a tiny, tiny step back from the pattern, just slightly, without trying to change it? What if you simply acknowledged that your body is moving, and that's what's happening, without trying to intervene or control it?

Patient: I can try that, but I'm really jittery right now—my hands won't stop shaking and my heart's racing, so picturing a "step back" feels impossible. How is that supposed to help when the reflex to grab my phone is automatic? If we're gonna try it, tell me exactly what that tiny step back looks like in the split second on the site—give me a line or a single move I can do that won't get me in trouble.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. If you were to take that tiny step back, it might just be as simple as unclenching your jaw, or letting your eyes drop slightly, or taking a tiny, tiny step to the side, just 1-2 inches, without trying to control it or change it. Noticing that your jaw is clenched, or your eyes are fixed on the phone, or your feet are tense, without trying to make it change. Just a small acknowledgment, without judgment or trying to fix it.

Patient: Alright—I'll try something simple I can do on the site without making a scene. When I feel my hands reach for the phone I'll unclench my jaw, drop my eyes for a beat, and quietly say to myself "Not right now," while sliding my foot a half-step to the side. How's that supposed to stop the heat? My hands are jittery already, but I'll try it.

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a concrete, specific action that you can take in the moment. Noticing when your hands start to reach for the phone, and taking a gentle, small action to pause and acknowledge it, like unclenching your jaw or sliding your foot. That's a good start. What happens if, after you say "Not right now", you simply pause, and don't do anything else, without trying to change or fix it?

Patient: If I say "Not right now" and just pause... my chest still clamps and my hands are shaking — that silence feels like a countdown and I get more wired sometimes, like I'm waiting for it to blow. Every now and then that half-second lets my head clear enough to breathe once and look away, and that little break can stop me from grabbing the phone, but it's hit-or-miss. How is sitting in the silence supposed to help when most of the time it just makes me feel ignored and hotter? Tell me a quick, foolproof little line or move I can use on the site if that pause doesn't do anything and someone notices.

Therapist: It sounds like the pause isn't providing the consistent reprieve you're hoping for. What if, in that moment, you simply look away, without trying to control it, and focus on something else in the immediate environment, like a nearby tool, a part of the machinery, or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: I tried that—looked at a bolt on the bench and felt the air on my face, and it steadied me for one breath, but then my head snapped back and I'm jittery as hell, like I'm waiting for something to explode. How is staring at a tool supposed to stop it when I'm bone-tired and someone says her name? Tell me a quick, low-key line or move I can do on the site if that pause doesn't work and someone calls me out for spacing out.

Therapist: It sounds like staring at the tool was a brief, small anchor. What if, when someone calls you out for spacing out, you simply acknowledge their concern with a brief, matter-of-fact acknowledgement, like "Sorry, I'm just dealing with something" or "Yeah, I'm good"? No apology, no explanation, just a simple acknowledgment of their concern, without trying to change the situation or regain control?

Patient: Alright—I can try a short line like that, but how is that supposed to stop follow‑up questions? I get shaky and my hands start twitching and I don't wanna explain, so give me a one‑liner I can drop fast on the site that shuts it down without sounding like I'm whining.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to deflect further questions. What if, when someone asks you about what's going on, you simply say "My kid's waiting for me at home" - a brief, practical statement that acknowledges their concern without opening up or explaining?

Patient: Yeah—"My kid's waiting" could work, I guess, but how's that supposed to stop a nosy guy from pressing? I'm jittery right now and worry I'll stammer or they’ll call me out. Give me one damn quick dead‑end line I can drop that sounds natural and shuts it down.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to quickly end the conversation. What if, when someone asks you about what's going on, you simply say "That's personal"?

Patient: How's "that's personal" supposed to help? It might shut someone down, but I'm jittery and my mouth goes dry—if they press I’ll probably stammer. Give me two quick dead‑end lines I can drop fast and how to say them so it sounds natural and actually stops the poking.
