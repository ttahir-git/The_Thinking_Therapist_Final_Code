Patient: I'm an older artist and lately I've been stuck in this loop of grief and anger since my work became so unstable. Small things set me off — missed gigs, flaky patrons, people who don't take me seriously — and I end up snapping and feeling ashamed afterward. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; how is talking supposed to fix any of that?

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight from these setbacks, and it's understandable to feel skeptical about talking about it. Can you tell me more about what it means to feel "ashamed" after these outbursts, and what you hope to get out of exploring this further?

Patient: It feels like after I snap I become smaller somehow, like I’ve proven I’m unprofessional or unstable and people will stop trusting me with work. What I want is to stop exploding so I don’t lose gigs and can sleep without replaying the moments, but honestly I’ve tried talking, breathing, journaling — how is talking about it supposed to stop me from losing opportunities? If there are concrete, practical steps to calm down in the moment or to repair my reputation, that’s what I’d be interested in, though I’m not convinced yet.

Therapist: It feels like you're worried that talking about your emotions won't actually change the way you react in the moment. That's a fair concern. Can you think of a time when you did calm down after a big reaction, and what might have helped you shift back to a calmer state?

Patient: There was one time I snapped at a gallery owner who stood me up — I stormed out, then sat on a bench until my hands stopped shaking, made myself a cup of tea, and pulled out my sketchbook to do quick, boring line studies until my head cleared a bit. The shift of scenery and a small, concrete task calmed me faster than anything else, but it only quieted things temporarily — the shame crept back when I thought about who’d seen me lose it. How is that supposed to help with keeping gigs or fixing how people see me long-term?

Therapist: It sounds like you found a temporary escape into your sketchbook and a new activity to calm down. That's a useful strategy. Now, what do you think might happen if, instead of focusing on calming down, you started to think about what's driving those reactions - what is it about being stood up or not being taken seriously that makes you feel like losing control or being small?

Patient: I guess when I think about it, it's not really the missed gig itself so much as what it says about me — that my work doesn't matter and I'm invisible. That taps into this old fear from when I lost steady work years ago, and the anger feels like the only thing that makes me look strong instead of small. How is thinking about that supposed to stop me from burning bridges or fix how people see me? If there's any real help, it needs to be something practical I can do in the moment or afterward to repair things.

Therapist: It seems like the fear of being invisible and losing control is what's really driving your reactions. That can be a really tough place to be. Instead of trying to change how others see you, what if we focused on what you want to be seen by others - what kind of artist do you want to be, and how do you want to be perceived?

Patient: I'd like to be seen as reliable, serious, and skilled — someone people can depend on, not some temperamental has‑been. Mostly I want my work judged on its merit, not my mood. How is picturing that supposed to make me less likely to explode — I need actual steps I can do in the moment, and ways to patch things afterward, not just... ideals.

Therapist: Picturing yourself as reliable, serious, and skilled is a good starting point. Can you think of a small, concrete action you could take in the moment when someone stands you up or doesn't take you seriously that might help you feel more grounded and confident - like a tiny step towards being the person you want to be seen as?

Patient: I guess a concrete thing I could try is a two‑part move: first, a one‑minute grounding routine in the moment — three slow breaths, step outside or to a bench, and do a really small, boring task (five quick thumbnail sketches or scribbling lines) so I don’t storm off visibly. Second, a calm repair script to send later — within 24 hours: “Sorry we missed each other. I’d like to reschedule — here are a few times that work for me,” and maybe offer a small gesture (discount or extra touch) to rebuild trust. I’ll be honest though — how is that supposed to help when I’m already boiling? I’ve tried breathing and sketching before; what makes you think doing it on purpose like this will actually stop the fallout?

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about how to stabilize yourself in the moment, and then make a plan to address the situation. The grounding routine and the calm repair script are both good steps. What if, instead of focusing on stopping the fallout, we focused on the experience of taking care of yourself in the moment - what would happen if, even if you didn't manage to repair the situation, you still took care of yourself and did the small, grounding task without judgment?

Patient: I guess it might stop the immediate spectacle — if I can sneak away, breathe, do a quick sketch, maybe there’s less for me to replay later. But I'm not convinced it'll change how people see me; how is taking care of myself supposed to make others think I'm reliable? If we're going to try this, give me a minute‑by‑minute plan for when I'm about to blow and a repair script that doesn't sound like I'm begging.

Therapist: I can offer you a minute-by-minute plan, but before we do, I want to ask: what's the moment just before you feel like you're about to blow up - is it when someone stands you up, when they question your work, or when you start to feel belittled? Let's get specific about the trigger, and then we can work from there.

Patient: Usually it’s when someone flakes or straight-up treats my work like it’s optional — like that gallery owner. Right before I snap I get that hollow-in-the-stomach feeling, my face heats up, jaw tightens, hands ball into fists, and my head fills with this racing thought: “They don’t respect me, they’re erasing me.” It’s all over in seconds and I start rehearsing the line that’ll make them pay — so how is just naming that going to stop it? If you’ve got a plan, it needs to cover the first 30 seconds: what exactly do I do before I blow.

Therapist: Those physical sensations and the racing thought can be intense. Let's take a closer look at the first 30 seconds before you snap. What if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts or the physical sensations, we focused on the sensation of your body - can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, or the sensation of your feet on the ground, without trying to change anything?

Patient: I can try to notice my breath or my feet, but honestly when I do that my head just keeps racing and it feels useless — sometimes it even makes me angrier because I feel like I’m losing control. I need something exact for those first 30 seconds: tell me a breath count, a tiny physical move I can do without making a scene, and a quick line I can use to buy myself time. Right now I’m skeptical this will stop me from lashing out, so if you want me to try, make it concrete.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny, concrete plan for the first 30 seconds. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4, hold it for a count of 4, and exhale through your mouth for a count of 4. At the same time, make a small, gentle touch to your lower back or shoulder blade with the heel of your hand. This can help calm your nervous system. When you feel yourself starting to heat up or get angry, you can say to yourself, "I've got a minute" - that's all, just "I've got a minute" - and take a deep breath in again. Can you try this for a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I tried it just now: counted to four, held, exhaled and pressed my hand to my back; my breath slowed a bit and the heat in my face eased, but my head was still racing and it felt more like a trick than a fix, so it didn't stop the urge to lash out. If you want me to try again, give me an even simpler one‑line script and a tiny, neutral physical move I can do in public—something that actually buys me thirty seconds and doesn't make me look weak.

Therapist: Let's simplify it further. When you feel yourself starting to heat up, look away from the person who's flaking or disrespecting you, and do a small, neutral gesture with your free hand - like touching the brim of your cup, or adjusting the zipper on your jacket. Say to yourself, "I'm not going anywhere" - just that one sentence, without thinking about what you're going to do next. Can you try that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I tried it in my head: looked away, fiddled with a cup, muttered "I'm not going anywhere" and yeah, my breath slowed but my head kept firing and it felt like a fake pause, not something that would stop me from snapping. If we're doing this, give me one exact, firm one‑liner that doesn't sound weak (something like "Hold on a second" feels soft), and one tiny, neutral move I can do in public that actually buys thirty seconds — then let's roleplay it now so I can see if it lands.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. A one-liner that's firmer is: "That's not okay." And a tiny, neutral move is: tucking your hands into your pockets. Now, let's roleplay a scenario where you're in a situation where someone's flaking on you, and you say "That's not okay" and tuck your hands into your pockets. How does that feel?

Patient: Alright — I tried it in my head. Saying "That's not okay" felt firmer than anything I’ve used, and tucking my hands in my pockets actually stopped me from making a big, embarrassing gesture. It bought maybe ten, fifteen seconds — enough to not storm out — but my head was still scribbling answers that would make them pay, and I worry that line sounds confrontational and could make someone defensive instead of apologetic. How is that supposed to help me keep gigs? If we're doing this, give me a calm follow‑up that moves toward rescheduling or setting boundaries without sounding petty — and let’s roleplay it now so I can see if it lands.

Therapist: Saying "That's not okay" can be a powerful way to establish boundaries. Now, for the follow-up, let's try a calm, assertive phrase: "I'd like to reschedule for [specific time] this week, can we discuss the details?" We can roleplay a scenario where you use this phrase, and see how it feels to express your needs without being confrontational.

Patient: Okay, I tried it in my head: “I’d like to reschedule for Thursday at 2pm — can we discuss the details?” I said it calm enough, but my voice felt thin and then this old shame came rushing back and I wanted to eat the words. It sounded...polite, maybe too polite — how is that supposed to make them respect me? Give me a firmer, non‑begging follow‑up I can actually send if they dodge, and a short repair line that doesn’t sound like I’m groveling.

Therapist: It can be tough to balance being assertive with feeling like you're not coming on too strong. Let's try a firmer follow-up that still conveys your needs: "I'm committed to my art and my schedule. Can we find a time that works for you or I'll need to reevaluate our working together." This one's a bit more direct. For the repair line, how about: "I appreciate your time, and I'm glad we can still work together" - it acknowledges their time and reestablishes a positive tone.

Patient: I tried saying the firmer line in my head — “I’m committed to my art and my schedule…” — and it landed harder than I expected; my voice felt thin and that old shame flooded in and I wanted to swallow the words. I’m worried that sounds like an ultimatum that’ll make them resent me or drop me, not respect me. Can you give me (1) a firmer-but-professional in-person line that doesn’t sound punitive, (2) a 24-hour follow-up text I can send that’s short and not groveling, and (3) a concise email I can use if they dodge again — then let’s roleplay sending the text so I can hear how it feels.

Therapist: The firmer line can be a bit more assertive than you expected. For the in-person line, how about: "I've worked hard to create a schedule that allows for quality time with clients. Can we find a time that aligns with your needs?" It still conveys your commitment to your art and schedule, but in a more collaborative way.

For the 24-hour follow-up text, how about: "Just wanted to check in and see if we can schedule something for this week. If not, no worries - I'd be happy to explore other options." It's short, polite, and doesn't beg for their time.

Let's roleplay sending the text: I'll play the part of the flaky client who's dodging your calls. Go ahead and send the text, and we'll see how it goes.

Patient: I typed and sent: "Just wanted to check in and see if we can schedule something for this week. If not, no worries — I'd be happy to explore other options." Sent.

My chest's tight and that old shame flashed up — I felt like I was asking for scraps. I'm not sure I follow how this actually makes them respect me. Can we roleplay them dodging the text now so I can practice a firmer reply without sounding like I'm begging?

Therapist: It's natural to feel like you're asking for scraps. Let's roleplay the flaky client who dodges your text. I'll play the part of someone who's busy and doesn't have time to meet this week. Go ahead and respond with a firmer but still polite message, and we'll see how it goes.

(Remember, you're not trying to "make them respect you" - you're trying to maintain your own integrity and communicate your needs clearly.)

Patient: I typed and sent: "I understand — I'm available Thursday at 2pm or Friday at 10am. Please let me know which works for you by end of day Friday; if I don't hear back, I'll assume we need to find a different arrangement." 

My hands were shaking sending that and my chest's tight — I keep thinking this will just make me look petty. How is that supposed to help if they just say they're too busy? Go ahead and be the client who says they're tied up this week so I can practice the next, firmer reply.

Therapist: It's natural to feel anxious about coming across as petty. Let's try a response from the flaky client: "Hey, I'm really sorry, but I'm actually on vacation this week and won't be back until next week. I'll get in touch when I get back." 

Now, respond with a firmer but still professional message that still conveys your needs and boundaries. Remember, you're not trying to win them over, you're just stating your availability.

Patient: I sent: "Understood. I'm available Tuesday at 10:00 AM or Thursday at 2:00 PM next week. Please confirm which time works by Monday EOD; if I don't hear back, I'll assume we need to pursue other arrangements."

Sent. My hands were shaking and that old shame surged — saying "pursue other arrangements" felt harsher than I wanted and I keep picturing them writing me off. How is that supposed to help if they just say they'll get in touch when they return? Roleplay them now saying they're too busy and want to be put on a waitlist so I can practice my next reply.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto control, but the words still feel harsh. Let's try a response from the flaky client: "Hey, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm actually swamped with projects right now and I don't think I can take on new commitments until next quarter. Can I put you on a waitlist and we'll touch base when things clear up?"

Now, respond with a message that acknowledges their time constraints while still asserting your needs and boundaries. Remember, you're not trying to guilt-trip them, you're just stating your availability.

Patient: Message I would send:
"Thanks for the update. I'm fine with a waitlist, but I need a clear timeframe — if I don't hear from you within two weeks, I'll assume you're unavailable and will pursue other arrangements. Please let me know if that works."

I sent that and my hands were shaking — that old shame rolled through me and I keep thinking this will make them drop me. I'm not sure I follow how being put on a waitlist actually protects my work or reputation; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to assert your needs, but the words still feel uncertain. Let's try a response from the flaky client: "Hey, no worries at all. I'll keep you on the waitlist and will get in touch as soon as things clear up. I'm looking forward to working with you when the time is right."

Now, respond with a message that acknowledges their willingness to waitlist you, while also reiterating your commitment to your art and your schedule. We can explore how to reframe your waitlist in a way that feels more empowering to you.

Patient: Message I'd send:
"Thanks — I appreciate you keeping me on the waitlist. I’m committed to my work and my schedule; if you have a tentative timeframe, please let me know so I can plan. If I don't hear from you within two weeks, I'll assume you're unavailable and will pursue other arrangements. Looking forward to working together when things clear up."

I sent that and my hands were shaking — I'm not sure I follow how a waitlist actually protects my reputation or income. How is that supposed to help? Can we reframe the waitlist into practical steps I can take so it feels empowering (status updates, ways to show I'm still active, or scripts I can use with other clients) instead of just waiting and hoping?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to protect your reputation and income, but the waitlist still feels uncertain. Let's explore some ways to reframe the waitlist into empowering steps. Instead of just waiting, what if you create a schedule for yourself that includes other clients, projects, and activities that bring you joy and fulfillment? This way, you're not just waiting for the flaky client, you're actively building your business and protecting your reputation by staying busy and visible.

We can also talk about sending regular updates to the flaky client, like a quick check-in or a "working on new projects" message, to show you're still active and engaged. This can help you feel more in control and prepared for when they do get back. What do you think about sending a monthly or quarterly update to the client, just to let them know you're still there and ready to work when they are?

Patient: Maybe — maybe it could help, but honestly I'm skeptical. How is sending updates supposed to protect my reputation instead of just sounding desperate? My hands are actually shaking just thinking about hitting send, so if we're going to try this, give me exactly what I asked for: (1) a 1‑line monthly/DM check‑in I can send to a waitlist client, (2) a crisp 2–3 sentence quarterly email template that shows I'm active without begging, and (3) a short public post line I can use to show I'm booked and producing work. Then let's roleplay me sending the quarterly email so I can see if it lands or if it just makes me look needy.

Therapist: I get your skepticism. Let's focus on creating some concrete tools to help you feel more in control.

1. Monthly/DM check-in: "Just a quick hello to keep you updated on my current projects - thanks for holding the spot!"
2. Quarterly email template: "Hi [Client], I wanted to follow up on our discussion from [X months ago] and share an update on my recent work. I've been working on [briefly mention 1-2 projects] and am excited to explore more opportunities when you're ready. Looking forward to reconnecting when things clear up."
3. Public post line: "Currently booked through [insert date]. New work pieces coming soon - stay tuned for updates!"

Let's roleplay sending the quarterly email. I'll respond as the flaky client, and you can see how it goes.

Patient: I sent:

"Hi [Name], following up on our conversation from a few months ago — I wanted to share a quick update on my recent work (a new series of linocuts and a small installation coming up) and let you know I'm available to schedule when things clear for you. Happy to reconnect when the timing works. Best, [My Name]"

My hands were shaking when I hit send and that old shame bubbled up — I keep thinking this just sounds like begging. Can you be the client now and reply like they're noncommittal so I can practice a firmer, professional follow‑up? How is this supposed to actually help if they just blow me off?

Therapist: Let's try a noncommittal response from the flaky client:

"Hi [Your Name], thanks for the update! It's great to hear about your new work - I'll definitely keep that in mind when I get back from my vacation. We'll touch base when I return, okay?"

Now, respond with a firmer, professional follow-up that still conveys your value and availability.

Patient: Draft I sent:

"Hi [Name], thanks — glad you enjoyed the update. I have openings the week of [DATE]: Tuesday 10:00–13:00 or Thursday 14:00–17:00. If one of those works, please confirm by Monday [DATE] and I’ll reserve the slot for you; if not, I can follow up in two weeks to check availability. Best, [Your Name]"

I sent it and my hands were shaking — chest tight, that old shame flaring. I'm not sure I follow how this actually makes them respect me, but it feels clear and professional. Can you roleplay them saying they still can't commit so I can practice my next firmer reply?

Therapist: Let's try a response from the flaky client:

"Hi [Your Name], thanks for reaching out. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm not sure if I can make it work that week. I'll keep you in mind for next quarter, though."

Now, respond with a firmer, yet still professional message that reiterates your value and availability.

Patient: Message I'd send:

"Hi [Name], thanks for the update. I understand you're unsure right now — I have openings the first two weeks of next quarter: Tuesday 10:00–13:00 or Thursday 14:00–17:00. If you can confirm a time by [date], I’ll hold the slot; if not, I’ll offer it to other clients and will follow up in six weeks. I value the chance to work together and am happy to tailor a project that fits your timeline. — [My Name]"

I sent that and my hands were shaking — the old shame surged and I kept thinking this will just push them away. How is that supposed to help if they just say “maybe” again and ghost me? Can you roleplay them giving a noncommittal reply so I can practice a firmer follow‑up?

Therapist: Let's try a response from the flaky client:

"Hi [Your Name], thanks for holding the spot. I'm still deciding on my schedule for next quarter and I'll let you know if it works out. I appreciate your flexibility and will be in touch soon."

Now, respond with a firmer, yet still professional message that clearly communicates your boundaries and expectations. Remember, you're not trying to force them to commit, you're just stating your needs and value.

Patient: Message I'd send:

"Hi [Name], thanks for the update. I can hold a spot the first two weeks of next quarter (Tuesday 10:00–13:00 or Thursday 14:00–17:00), but I need confirmation by [DATE]. If I don't hear from you by then I'll release the slot and pursue other arrangements. — [My Name]"

Sent. My hands were shaking and that old shame washed over me — I keep worrying this will just push them away. How is that supposed to help if they still say 'maybe'? Can you roleplay them giving a noncommittal reply so I can practice the next firmer step?

Therapist: Let's try a response from the flaky client:

"Hi [Your Name], thanks for the reminder. I'm still not sure if I can make it work. I'll keep it in mind, but I'm not committing to anything at this point."

Now, respond with a message that clearly communicates that you're not willing to play games anymore. You've held the spot for them, and now it's time to take care of yourself.

Patient: Message I'd send:

"Hi [Name], I’ve held a spot for you, but I can’t keep waiting indefinitely. Please confirm by [DATE] if you’d like me to reserve that time; otherwise I’ll release the slot and accept other bookings. If your plans change, feel free to reach out and we can discuss future availability. — [My Name]"

I sent it and my hands were shaking — I keep feeling guilty and worried this will make them drop me. How is standing my ground supposed to stop people from ghosting me?

Therapist: It can be tough to let go of the fear of rejection.

At this point, it's not about standing your ground to stop people from ghosting you, but about taking care of yourself and your business. You've done your part by holding the spot and communicating clearly. Now, you're giving them a clear opportunity to respond and commit, and you're also making it clear that you have other options.

Let's focus on the next step: what if, instead of waiting for their response, you assume they're not going to show up? What if you treat this slot as if it's already taken, and start working on other projects or clients that you're more confident about? This can help you build momentum and confidence, and also make you less dependent on this one client. Can you imagine doing that for a moment?

Patient: I can imagine it, but it feels like admitting defeat and that old shame spikes in my chest. How is that supposed to help? If we're going to try it, give me a tiny, exact plan for the day I release the slot — three concrete actions I can do to replace that time and a one‑sentence line to use if they suddenly come back — then let’s roleplay me doing the first action so I can see if I actually can move on.
