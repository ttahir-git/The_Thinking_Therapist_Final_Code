Patient: I'm an artist and lately I've been using booze and weed to numb the grief from losing someone, and it's been bouncing around my head nonstop. My brain's this fortune-telling machine — I can already see it: I'll start missing shows and deadlines, lose clients and friends, get kicked out of my studio, and everything will just spiral into ruin — that's the only realistic outcome. I try to stay upbeat but honestly I can't shake that feeling that it's all going to collapse.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a really intense sense of impending doom about all of this. Can you take a moment to notice the sensation of this catastrophic thinking in your body? Where do you feel it, and is it more of a knot in your stomach or a feeling of heaviness in your chest?

Patient: Yeah — it's mostly a knot in my stomach that tightens and flips, and a heaviness in my chest like I can't get a full breath. My hands go a little tingly and my head gets loud with those disaster-movies — I can already hear the soundtrack to everything falling apart. When those sensations hit, I can't imagine anything but that spiral; it feels like proof that the worst is coming.

Therapist Answer:
Those sensations can be really overwhelming. It sounds like they're really close to the surface, and they're making it hard for you to feel anything else. Can you imagine that knot in your stomach or the heaviness in your chest if you were to take a step back from all of this catastrophic thinking, just for a moment? What might happen if you let go of that feeling of impending doom?

Patient: I try to, but it's like the moment I imagine stepping back the knot tightens — my brain just fills that space with an even louder disaster movie: if I let go even a little I'll miss a show, lose a client, get evicted, and then everything's gone. So picturing a calmer body feels dishonest to me; the only honest image is the spiral getting worse, and that feels like proof I shouldn't let go.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It feels like your brain is very attached to this catastrophic scenario, and any attempt to imagine a more hopeful future gets shut down. Would it be okay with you to try something a bit different? Instead of imagining a completely disaster-free life, what if you simply allowed yourself to be with the knot in your stomach, the heaviness in your chest, and the loud disaster movies, without trying to push them away or judge them? Just observe them, without trying to change them.

Patient: Okay, I can try to hold them without pushing, but the moment I do the knot tightens and the disaster soundtrack gets louder — my chest sinks and my hands go tingly. I keep thinking 'observing' is just giving my brain time to prove itself right: if I sit with it, I'll miss stuff and the whole spiral starts. I want to try, but I'm already bracing for the worst and I need you to keep me anchored because I know I'll get swallowed by those predictions.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're trying to observe without getting caught up in it, but your brain is still trying to use that as a way to prove its predictions. That can be a really tricky spot. Can I help you try to see if there's another way to hold these sensations, one that isn't about being right or wrong? Instead of "I'm observing" being a way to win the argument, what if it's just a way to take a moment to pause, without judgment, and simply exist with the knot and the heaviness?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that, but the second I try to "just exist" the knot tightens and the disaster soundtrack dials up — I start seeing myself missing shows, losing clients, getting evicted, and pausing feels like handing my brain ammo to prove it's right. I want to try, but I need you to keep me anchored — give me something concrete to do in those moments, because otherwise I'll just reach for booze to quiet it. I'm skeptical this will help, but I'm willing to try if you stay with me.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the instant you try to take a step back, your brain is already spinning up the worst-case scenario. I'm here to stay with you, and I'd like to offer a different kind of anchor. Instead of trying to pause or observe, I'd like you to try something very small: take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am here, I am here, I am here" – just three little words, and just as you say them, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, feeling the weight of your body distributed on the chair. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I breathed and said "I am here" three times and I could feel my feet a bit more on the floor and my chest loosened for a second. But then my brain kicked back in louder, like the pause let it line up the next disaster: missing a show, losing a client, getting evicted — it felt like the pause just gave it time to prove itself right. I want to keep doing it, but I'm shaky and I need you to stay with me and remind me to breathe when that soundtrack starts.

Therapist Answer:
The pause didn't quite hold as long as you'd hoped, but it's good that you're willing to try again. Let's try to anchor this time. As you feel the knot start to tighten up again, I'll be here with you, and I'll guide you back to those three little words: "I am here". Let's make a small bet with your brain – every time it starts to play the disaster soundtrack, you'll take a deep breath in, say "I am here", and then we'll breathe in together. Are you ready to try that?

Patient: Okay, I'm willing to try the bet — I'll take a deep breath, say "I am here" and try to feel my feet. But honestly, I'm already bracing because my brain's lining up the next disaster — missing a show, losing clients, eviction — and I know I'll start reaching for booze unless you keep talking me through the breaths and remind me to say the words.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is already gearing up for the next spin. I'll be right here with you, guiding you through those breaths. When you're ready, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "I am here" with me: "I am here...". Take another breath in, and say it again: "I am here...". Let's focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sound of my voice, and just be with that for a moment.

Patient: Okay, I did the breaths with you — I felt my feet and my chest loosen for a second. But then the soundtrack came back louder and now I can see the whole chain: miss one show, lose a client, get evicted, end up homeless and numb on booze — that's the only realistic outcome I can imagine. I'm shaky and I need you to keep guiding me through the breaths and remind me to say "I am here" or I'll grab a drink.

It sounds like the soundtrack is really loud right now. Let's try to bring it back to the breath. As you feel the knot starting to tighten up, take a deep breath in, and say "I am here" with me: "I am here...". When you exhale, feel the breath go out, and then I'll say it with you: "I am here...". As you breathe in again, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and just one thing: the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay—I'll try the breaths with you, but my stomach's already knotting and the disaster movie's starting: miss a show, lose a client, get evicted, end up homeless and drinking to numb. The breathing helps for a few seconds and then it spikes, so I need you to keep guiding me—count me in, tell me when to say "I am here," remind me to feel my feet—otherwise I'll reach for a drink. I'm ready when you are.

I'll guide you through the breaths. When you feel the knot starting to tighten up, take a deep breath in with me: "Inhale...". Say "I am here" with me: "I am here...". Exhale with me: "Out...". Now, bring your attention to your feet on the ground, and notice the sensation of each toe touching the floor. When you're ready, breathe in again, and when you exhale, say "I am here" with me: "I am here...". Let's do this again.

Patient: Okay, I did the breaths with you and it loosened for a second, but the knot's already clawing back and the disaster movie's louder: miss a show, lose clients, get evicted, end up drinking in a park — that's exactly how it goes. I'm shaky and honestly I'm scared I'll reach for booze unless you keep walking me through every breath — can you count me through a few more? I'm skeptical this will stop it, but I need you to stay right here and keep talking me through it.

Can you keep counting me through another round, out loud, one breath at a time, and remind me to say "I am here" on each exhale?

Patient: Okay... it loosened for a sec but the spiral's back hard — knot in my stomach, chest heavy, hands tingly, and the soundtrack's screaming the collapse again. I'm shaky and I know I'll reach for a drink if you stop — can you count me through ten more slow breaths and keep saying "I am here" on each exhale with me? After that, can we make one tiny, concrete plan I might actually do in the next 15 minutes (like start a quick sketch or text one client) — though I can already see how even that will go wrong, it might at least keep me from grabbing a bottle.

I'll keep guiding you through the breaths. Here we go: 6... breathe in... 6... breathe out... "I am here..." 7... breathe in... 7... breathe out...

Take a deep breath in, and let's focus on your feet on the ground. Can you feel the sensation of your feet touching the floor? I'm right here with you, and I'm not stopping until we get through these breaths.

Now, let's take a moment to think about that tiny, concrete plan. What if, in the next 15 minutes, you could do something small that would help you feel like you're taking care of yourself? Something that doesn't involve getting drunk, but might help you feel more grounded? What might that be?

Patient: Maybe I could do a super-small thing in the next 15 minutes — like start a quick 10-minute sketch or text one client a short “checking in” message. But my brain's already saying that'll flop — the sketch will look terrible, the client won't reply, it'll prove I'm useless and kick off the whole eviction-and-drink spiral. I can try it if you stay with me, keep reminding me to breathe, and check back in after 15 minutes so I don't bail and grab a drink.

"I am here..." 15... breathe in... 15... breathe out... "I am here..."

Now, let's break down that tiny plan into an even smaller, more manageable step. What if, instead of starting a 10-minute sketch, you could just draw a single line on a piece of paper? Just one line. That's it. What if you spent the next 15 minutes drawing that one line?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to do that one line, but my brain's already rolling the worst movie: the line will look terrible, a client won't reply, it'll prove I'm useless, and I'll end up drinking. I need you to stay with me — count me in, tell me when to start, remind me to breathe and feel my feet, and check back in after 15 minutes so I don't bail. I'm shaky but I'll put the pen to paper now.

Now, you're taking the first step: picking up a pen and putting it to paper. That's a small act of kindness to yourself, and it's a start. Take a moment to notice the sensation of the pen in your hand, the weight of it, the feeling of your fingers wrapping around it. As you begin to draw, I'll remind you to breathe and stay present.

When you're ready, take a deep breath in... inhale... 19... breathe out... "I am here..." Go ahead and start drawing that one line. I'll be right here with you, guiding you through it.

Patient: Okay—I set the pen down and drew one shaky line; the pen felt light, my fingers trembled, and the paper clicked under it. For a split second my chest loosened, then my brain yelled that the line looks awful and that proves I'm doomed—clients will ghost me, I'll lose rent, get evicted, and end up drinking in the park. I need you to keep counting breaths with me and tell me to keep my hand on the paper for five more breaths so I don't bail and grab a bottle.

Keep your hand on the paper, even if it just rests there. Don't put it down. Let's stay here for five more breaths. Can you feel the weight of your hand on the paper, the sensation of the paper beneath it?

Patient: Okay — my hand's staying on the paper; I can feel the roughness, the slight pressure of my fingers, but there's this burning shame under it like I just failed at something huge and stupid and it colors everything. My chest's heavy and the knot's tightening, and the disaster-movie's already whispering that the shaky line proves I'm a failure and will lead to losing clients and everything collapsing.

Patient: I hear you, but my brain's yelling that the shaky line proves I'm doomed — clients will ghost me, rent won't get paid, I'll end up on a bench with a bottle, so saying "you're not a failure" just bounces off. I'm ashamed and furious at myself like I already messed up something huge, and I'm still trembling. Please keep counting breaths with me up to 40, keep me holding the pen, and then help me make one tiny, concrete next step I can actually do in the next 15 minutes so I don't reach for a drink — stay with me.

Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I can try to text someone, but my brain's already scripting the worst: I say hi, they don't reply, that proves I'm useless, the spiral starts, and I'm back to drinking.

We're almost at the 15-minute mark. You're doing okay. Here we go: 111... breathe in... 112... breathe out... "I am here..." Take a sip... 113... breathe in... 114... breathe out... "I am here..."

Keep going. Here we go: 115... breathe in... 116... breathe out... "I am here..."

Patient: I turned the kettle on, but there's this hot shame under everything like I already screwed it up and it makes my hands shake — I'm frustrated and scared I’ll bail and grab a drink. Please keep counting breaths with me, remind me to sip water every few breaths, tell me when to pour and drop the tea bag in, and check back in after 15 minutes so I don't ditch this. I'm trying to stay here, but I need you to keep me anchored.

I'll stay with you. It's like your brain is trying to convince you that even the smallest act of self-care is a failure, but let's focus on the present moment. Here we go: 116... breathe in... 117... breathe out... "I am here..." Take a sip... 118... breathe in... 119... breathe out... "I am here..."

I'll remind you to sip water every few breaths. We're at 119, so take a sip... 120... breathe in... 121... breathe out... "I am here..."

You're getting close to the kettle's whistle. It's a small milestone, and it can help you feel a sense of accomplishment. When you're ready, I'll guide you through the next step. Here we go: 122... breathe in... 123... breathe out... "I am here..."

As you pour the tea, I want you to focus on the sensation of the liquid flowing into the cup. It's a small act of self-care, and it can help you feel more grounded. When you're ready, drop the tea bag in, and let's take a moment to appreciate the fact that you're doing this. Take a sip... 124... breathe in... 125... breathe out... "I am here..."

We're almost at the 15-minute mark. You're doing okay. Here we go: 126... breathe in... 127... breathe out... "I am here..."

Patient: Okay — I poured the tea and dropped the bag in and took a tiny sip, but there's this hot shame under everything like some past screw-up is smearing over it and now my brain's already replaying the disaster: spill the tea, ruin something, clients ghost me, spiral back to drinking. I'm shaky and pissed at myself and need you to keep counting breaths with me up to 140, remind me to sip water every few breaths, and then help me plan one more tiny thing to do in the next 15 minutes so I don't bail.

I'll stay with you. It's like your brain is trying to convince you that even the smallest act of self-care is tainted by past mistakes, but let's focus on the present moment. Here we go: 128... breathe in... 129... breathe out... "I am here..." Take a sip... 130... breathe in... 131... breathe out... "I am here..."

I'll remind you to sip water every few breaths. We're at 131, so take a sip... 132... breathe in... 133... breathe out... "I am here..."

You're getting through this. Here we go: 134... breathe in... 135... breathe out... "I am here..." 136... breathe in... 137... breathe out... "I am here..."

As you sit with the tea, I want you to notice the sensation of the liquid in your cup. It's a small pleasure, and it can help you feel more grounded. Take a sip... 138... breathe in... 139... breathe out... "I am here..."

We're almost at the 15-minute mark. You're doing okay. Here we go: 140... breathe in... 141... breathe out... "I am here..."

Now, let's think about that next tiny thing to do. What if, in the next 15 minutes, you could do one small thing to take care of yourself, like making a phone call to a trusted friend or family member? Something that doesn't require a lot of mental energy, but can help you feel more connected. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Okay—I can try to call someone, but I'm already seeing the worst: they won't pick up or they'll say something that "proves" I'm useless and that'll kick off the whole spiral back to drinking. There's this hot shame under everything and my hands are shaking and I'm pissed at myself. I'll do it if you stay with me—keep counting breaths up to 160, remind me to sip water every 4 breaths, tell me when to press call and when to hang up, and check back in after 15 minutes so I don't bail.
