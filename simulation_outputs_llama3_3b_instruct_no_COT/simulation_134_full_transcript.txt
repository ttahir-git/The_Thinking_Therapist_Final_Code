--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in these cycles of pretty harsh self-criticism — any small slip feels like proof I'm failing, which links back to struggling in school even though I found success later as an artist. The recent move's made it worse; everything's unfamiliar and the doubts just get louder. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help, but I guess I wanted to see if talking about it changes anything.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings. It sounds like these self-critical thoughts are really showing up for you right now, and they're tied to your past struggles and the uncertainty of this new situation. Can you tell me more about what it's like when these thoughts start to come up, and what happens in your body when you feel like you're "failing"?

Patient: When those thoughts start, it's like a voice in my head that immediately says I'm incompetent — my chest tightens, my stomach knots, and my breathing gets shallow, like I'm bracing for some verdict. I either clam up and stare at the wall or busy myself with something small in the studio to avoid feeling it, but the inner critic just keeps talking. How is that supposed to help, though? I mean, I've described all that before and it still feels like being that kid who couldn't keep up in class.

Therapist Answer:
That must feel really uncomfortable. It sounds like you're experiencing a strong physiological response to those thoughts. It's interesting that you mention feeling like that kid who couldn't keep up in class - can you connect with that feeling of being overwhelmed, like you're not measuring up?

Patient: Yeah — it definitely feels like that kid again, small and embarrassed in front of everyone, like I'm waiting for someone to point out I don't belong. My chest tightens and I either freeze or throw myself into fiddly studio work to prove I'm not useless. But honestly, how is sitting with that memory supposed to help? I've tried revisiting it before and it just leaves me more frustrated.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like revisiting that memory doesn't bring much resolution. What happens if, instead of trying to revisit or process that memory, you simply acknowledge it as a memory - without judgment or trying to do anything with it - and then turn your attention to the present moment, like your current experience of being in this new environment?

Patient: I mean, I get the idea — label it as just a memory and come back to now — but how is that supposed to help? When I try that, my chest's still tight and the critic's still there, like labeling it doesn't make it kinder. I've done some of that mindfulness stuff before and it mostly just leaves me more aware and still annoyed. If I actually try to notice the room—light, paint smell, the hum of the heater—it does quiet me a bit, but then the voice jumps back in saying that's not enough. Can we slow down? I'm not sure what you want me to do differently right now.

Therapist Answer:
It's like labeling the memory doesn't necessarily quiet the critic, and your mindfulness practice doesn't seem to be providing the relief you were hoping for. Let's slow down and try something different. Instead of focusing on your thoughts or trying to quiet them, what would it be like if you were to lean into the physical sensations in your body - the tightness in your chest, the shallow breathing - without judgment or trying to change them?

Patient: I can try, but honestly it usually backfires — when I lean into the tightness it feels sharper, like a rubber band pulling tighter; my breathing gets shallower and my hands go a bit numb. How is that supposed to help? Right now I notice a dull ache under my sternum and my jaw's clenched, and being aware of it just makes me more irritated. Can we slow down? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that feeling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like leaning into the physical sensations is actually making them more intense. What if, instead of trying to change or manage those sensations, you were to simply observe them as they are, without trying to do anything with them? For example, you could say to yourself, "This tightness in my chest is exactly as it is, right now, without trying to do anything about it" - no judgment, no attempt to change, just a simple observation. Would that be something you could try?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. "This tightness in my chest is exactly as it is, right now." Saying that doesn't make it go away; the tightness is still there and the critic immediately calls me soft for not fixing it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly not sure what I'm supposed to do with that.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The critic is still present, and it's not letting go. Can you say to yourself, "The critic's presence is exactly as it is, right now - it's just a thought, a voice in my head" - again, no judgment, just a simple observation?

Patient: Alright—"The critic's presence is exactly as it is, right now — it's just a thought, a voice in my head." Saying that makes the voice a bit less like a judge and more like background noise for a second, but then it gets louder again and calls me soft for even saying it. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm not sure what to do when it slips back so fast.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the critic's presence is becoming a habitual response, making it hard to catch your breath between moments. What would it be like if you didn't have a reaction to the critic's presence, if you simply allowed it to exist in the background, without judgment or trying to change it - would that be possible for even just a brief moment?

Patient: I can do it for a breath or two — it almost becomes background noise — but then my chest clamps down and the critic snaps back, accusing me of faking it. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm not sure what to do when it slips back so fast.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the critic's presence is too ingrained, making it hard to catch a break. Let's try something a bit more concrete. Can you simply acknowledge the critic's presence with a small, one-sentence phrase, without judgment or trying to change it - just a simple acknowledgement, like "Here's the critic again"?

Patient: "Here’s the critic again." Saying that makes it a little less like a judge for a breath, but then it sneers and I'm clenching my jaw again. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down — I'm not sure what I'm meant to do next.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the acknowledgement didn't quite have the desired effect. Let's try something else. What would it be like if you were to let go of the need to "fix" or "change" the critic's presence - not trying to quiet it, not trying to make it go away, but simply letting it be present, like a constant hum in the background?

Patient: When I try to let it be, it doesn't settle — it just sits there nagging and that familiar shame swells up, my face goes hot and I feel useless all over again. I've tried letting it hum like background noise before and it always slides into the same loop where I end up feeling worse. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm not sure what I'm meant to do when it spikes like this.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the critic's presence is very persistent. Can you allow yourself to feel the physical sensations of this spike - the heat in your face, the sense of uselessness - without judgment or trying to change them?

Patient: Alright — I'm trying to let it be: my face is hot, my jaw's clenched, my stomach drops, and when I really notice it the shame just swells and I feel useless all over again. I want to sit with it, but the urge to clamp down and fix it is almost reflexive, like a panic to prove I'm not failing. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down — I can do a breath or two of this, but then it spikes and I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a cycle of reacting to the spike. What would it be like if, instead of trying to calm down or fix the feelings, you were to simply observe the sensation of the urge to react - the urge to clamp down and fix it - as it arises, without judgment or trying to act on it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try. When I pay attention to the urge to clamp down, it feels like a rising tightness in my chest, my jaw locks, my face heats up and shame floods in, and I almost have to prove I'm not useless. How is just watching that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I don't know what to do when it gets that loud.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're getting a bit closer to noticing the urge to react. What would it be like if, instead of trying to react to the urge, you were to ask yourself a simple question - one that doesn't try to change or fix anything, but rather invites curiosity - like "What would happen if I didn't react to this urge?"

Patient: If I imagine not reacting, it feels exposed and awful—like I'm admitting I'm that kid who couldn't keep up, and the shame spikes. Sometimes it softens for a breath, but more often it slips away only to come back louder and meaner—I've tried not reacting before and it usually doesn't work. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I don't know what I'm meant to do with this.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like imagining not reacting is still triggering the shame response. Let's take a step back and look at the situation as it is - you're trying to notice the urge to react, and it's leading to shame. Can you find a small moment of stillness, just a tiny pause, between the urge to react and the shame response - a tiny gap where you're not acting on the urge, but not judging yourself either?

Patient: Sometimes, yeah — I can catch a tiny pause, like half a breath, where I'm not acting on the urge. But it barely holds before the shame rushes in, my face goes hot and I feel like an impostor, and I'm left wondering how noticing that gap actually helps — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the pause is fragile and short-lived. What would it be like if, instead of focusing on the shame that comes after the pause, you simply acknowledged the fact that there was a pause - a tiny break in the cycle of reacting to the urge?

Patient: I can notice the pause—sometimes it's like half a breath where I'm not immediately collapsing into shame. For that moment it feels a bit like air, but then my face heats up, the old useless feeling floods back and I want to prove I'm not failing by doing something. I can say there was a pause, but... how is that supposed to help beyond a tiny break? Can we slow down — what am I actually meant to do with that pause when it disappears?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the pause is a small breath of fresh air, but it's fleeting. Let's take another tiny step back. What would it be like if, instead of trying to analyze or make sense of the pause, you simply allowed it to be, without judgment or expectation - just a small moment of stillness in the midst of the cycle?

Patient: I can let that tiny stillness be for a breath or two and, for that sliver, it actually feels a bit lighter — like I can breathe. But almost right away the shame rushes back, my face goes hot and I start feeling like a fraud all over again. How is just letting it be supposed to help when it just makes the next hit of shame feel sharper? Can we slow down — I don't know what I'm meant to do with that moment once it vanishes.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the stillness is temporary relief, but it doesn't last. Let's look at what happens right after the stillness vanishes - the shame comes back. What would it be like if, instead of trying to make sense of the stillness or the shame, you simply noticed the fact that the stillness is gone, and the shame is back?

Patient: I notice the stillness's gone and the shame's back — my face heats up, my chest tightens, and I feel useless all over again, like whatever small calm I had was just temporary. Noticing it doesn't seem to change how sharp or humiliating it feels; it almost makes me feel more exposed, like I'm failing at not failing. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I don't know what I'm meant to do when it comes back so fast.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like noticing the stillness and shame isn't enough to make a difference in how you're feeling. Let's take a step back further. Can you pay attention to the sensation of your body as you notice the shame coming back - the tightness in your chest, the heat in your face, the feeling of uselessness - without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. My chest's tight under my sternum, my jaw's clenched, my hands feel a bit numb, my face heats up and my breathing gets shallow; noticing it just makes that old humiliation swell and I get furious at myself. How is that supposed to help when awareness just makes the shame louder? Can we slow down — I need something practical I can do in the moment, not just name the feeling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like awareness is actually making the shame more intense. Let's try something a bit more concrete. Can you bring your attention to your breathing - focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try focusing on the breath. It's shallow and tight, the inhale barely fills, and when I pay attention my chest clamps and my face goes hot with that old shame, like I'm failing all over again. For a beat it softens a little, but the critic calls it fake and the shame rushes right back. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down — I need something practical I can do in the moment, not just name it.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like focusing on the breath isn't helping. Let's try something a bit more grounded. Can you place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest, and notice the sensation of your hands touching each other - the feeling of your palm on your belly, the sensation of your chest beneath it?

Patient: Alright — hand on my belly, other on my chest. I can feel the warmth of my palms touching but my chest barely moves and my belly stays tight, like the breath's stuck up high; it feels thin and forced. The critic's already sneering that I'm faking it and the shame floods up — my face goes hot and my jaw clenches. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I don't know what to do with this when it spikes.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like your physical sensations are not changing much. Can you make room for a small, tiny bit of gentleness in your body, even if it's just a tiny fraction of a second - a tiny relaxation in the belly, a tiny softening of the breath?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. For a beat my belly softens a little and the breath doesn't feel so pinched, like a tiny thread of relief, but almost immediately the critic sneers and the shame floods back — my face goes hot and I feel useless all over again. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I need something practical I can do in the moment that actually holds longer than a breath.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the small relaxation is short-lived. Let's try something that might hold a bit longer. Can you make a small, small gesture of kindness towards yourself, just a tiny act of gentle care - like taking a tiny breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and as you exhale, say the words "I am here" to yourself, just one word?

Patient: Alright — I'll try. Tiny breath in, out, saying "here" as I exhale — for a beat it loosens a little, then that familiar sting of shame surges up, my face goes hot and the critic sneers that I'm faking it. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I need something practical that actually holds longer than one breath.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the gesture of kindness didn't last long. Let's try something that's even more concrete. Can you place a small hand on the heart area - just a light, gentle touch - and hold it there for a moment, without trying to do anything with it, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: Okay — hand on my heart. It's warm and my pulse is faint but as soon as I notice it that familiar shame wells up, my face goes hot and my jaw locks like I'm that kid again. For a beat it almost feels softer, then the critic calls it pathetic and the shame surges back. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down — I need something practical that actually lasts longer than a breath; what do you want me to do next?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the physical touch didn't last long. Let's try something a bit more substantial. Can you take a small break from noticing the shame, and instead, focus on your physical body's sensations - the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your hand on your heart - and simply allow yourself to be in that presence, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try that. My feet feel planted on the rough studio floor, a little heavier through the heels; the air on my skin is cool, and my hand on my heart is warm with a faint pulse. For a beat it steadies me, like there's a tiny bit less noise, but then my face flushes and that familiar shame surges and the critic sneers that it’s all for show. How is focusing on this supposed to help when it only lasts a few seconds? Can we slow down — I need something practical that holds longer than one breath; can you guide me through something more sustained, step by step?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like focusing on your physical body didn't last long. Let's try something more sustained. I want you to do something very small, very gentle, and very ordinary. Can you take a sip of water from the glass on the table in front of you, and as you do, pay attention to the sensation of the glass in your hand, the feeling of the liquid touching your tongue, and the sensation of swallowing? Let's focus on this simple, everyday action for a bit longer than just a breath.

Patient: Okay — I take a sip. The glass is cool in my hand, the water feels flat on my tongue and slides down; for a beat my throat loosens and my breath isn't so tight. But almost immediately that hot shame rushes back and the critic sneers that I'm doing it for show. How is sipping water supposed to help? I can do this, but I need something more sustained that actually holds — can you guide me step-by-step? Can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It seems like sipping water didn't last long. Let's try something even more straightforward. I want you to do something very small, very slow, and very deliberate. Can you slowly and deliberately blink one eye, just one eye, and then the other, and then blink again? Let's focus on this simple, mechanical action for a bit longer than just a breath. As you blink, can you allow yourself to be with the sensations in your body, without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: Okay — I did it: slow blink left, then right, then again. For a beat it loosens a little and my eyes water, but then that familiar shame flashes up, my jaw tightens and the critic sneers that I'm faking it. How is blinking supposed to help when the shame spikes back so fast? Can we slow down and do something more sustained, step‑by‑step?
