Patient: I've been feeling totally overwhelmed — sad and without motivation — ever since this isolation kicked in, and it's starting to wreck my relationship. My mind is like a fortune-telling machine that only sees disaster: I'll pull away, she'll get fed up, we'll fight, she'll leave, I'll mess up at work because I'm a wreck, and everything falls apart. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't imagine any other outcome; anything else feels unrealistic.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling with the uncertainty and potential risks of reconnecting with your partner during this challenging time. Can you think of a moment when you felt safe and connected with your partner before the isolation set in, and what made that feeling feel safe for you?

Patient: Yeah — there was this Sunday we spent cooking together, just laughing and talking for hours, and she kept checking in with me so I actually felt seen and safe. It felt safe because she listened without trying to fix me and she held my hand when I got quiet, like I wasn't a burden. But I keep thinking that was temporary — she'll get tired of it, stop reaching out, we'll fall back into distance, then she'll decide she's done and leave; I can't picture any other outcome.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
So the sense of safety and connection you felt on that Sunday was really strong, and it's what's drawing you to the idea of reconnecting now. It's like your mind is trying to hold onto that feeling of being seen and supported. What would it be like for you to imagine that feeling of safety and connection, not as a singular event, but as a possibility that could unfold in the present moment with your partner, without you trying to predict the future or control the outcome?

Patient: When I try to picture that Sunday happening again, my brain just runs the worst movie: I reach out, she thinks I'm clingy, she pulls away, we argue, she decides she's done, I collapse at work, and everything unravels. Imagining a calm possibility feels fake and like I'm setting myself up for more pain. I know you're asking me to hold it as a real option, but I can't — it just doesn't feel realistic.

Therapist Answer:
Your mind is doing its best to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and it's understandable that it feels that way. It sounds like your brain is trying to protect you from potential hurt. Can you take a deep breath and, for just a moment, let go of the need to have a specific outcome or a certain feeling?

Patient: I took a breath like you said, but it doesn't help — my brain immediately runs the worst-case: she thinks I'm clingy, pulls away, leaves, and I lose everything. Trying to hold uncertainty just feels impossible, like I'm lying to myself. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can feel like your mind is in overdrive. Let's slow down then. Instead of trying to hold onto a specific feeling or outcome, what if we focused on what you would do if you were to take a small step towards reaching out to your partner, just to see how that feels, without any expectations of what might happen?

Patient: I guess a small step might be sending a short, low-pressure text like, "Hey, want to grab coffee Sunday?" — but the second I picture it I see her reading it, thinking I'm needy, replying cold, us arguing, her deciding she's done, and me falling apart at work. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't stop the movie in my head. Can we slow down? I'm getting really wound up just imagining this.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is on autopilot, playing out a worst-case scenario. Can we pause the movie for just a moment and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious? Would you be willing to try to simply observe that anxious feeling, without judgment, and just see what happens if you don't act on the idea of sending that text?

Patient: I tried to notice it, but the second I focus my chest tightens and my mind starts the worst-movie again — her reading the text, thinking I'm needy, pulling away, leaving, me falling apart at work. Observing doesn't feel neutral; it feels like watching the future explode and being told to sit still. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like observing the anxious feeling is getting you even more anxious. Let's try something different. Can you bring to mind a moment, a small, simple moment, when your chest felt relaxed and your mind felt calm? Not trying to analyze it or fix it, just a moment when it felt calm?

Patient: Yeah — there was one time after we cooked and sat on the couch, she rested against me and for maybe ten breaths my chest actually loosened and I felt normal. But as soon as I picture trying to get that back my brain shoots a movie where she thinks it's fake, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, and I implode at work — I can't see any other ending and I'm already getting really wound up.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is always one step ahead, trying to prevent you from having that feeling again. Let's try to focus on the physical sensation of your chest relaxing and feeling normal, without trying to connect it to a specific outcome or expectation. Can you just notice the sensation of your chest being relaxed, like it was in that moment on the couch, without thinking about what happened after or what might happen if you try to get that feeling again?

Patient: I try to notice it, but the second I focus my chest clamps down and the movie starts — she thinks I'm faking it, pulls away, we have a huge fight, she leaves, I tank at work. I want to feel that calm, I really do, but it just feels like lying to myself and I get more panicked instead. Can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is on high alert, and the moment you try to turn down the volume, it just gets louder. Let's take a deep breath together and pause the movie for just a moment. Instead of trying to get that feeling of calm, can we just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without any thoughts or expectations?

Patient: I try to focus on my breath, I really do, but as soon as I notice it my chest clamps and the worst-movie starts — her thinking I'm needy, pulling away, leaving, me tanking at work. It feels impossible to just notice the breath; it's like watching a bomb countdown and being told to breathe slowly. Can we slow down? Maybe give me something to do for just ten seconds — I'm getting really overwhelmed.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your brain is trying to control the pace of the movie. Let's take a tiny break. Can you close your eyes and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, or the sound of whatever is around you? Just focus on one of those sensations, and try to stay with it for just a few seconds, without thinking about your breath or anything else.

Patient: I tried focusing on my feet and the air like you said, but the second I do my chest clamps and the movie starts — her reading the text, thinking I'm needy, pulling away, leaving, and I spiral at work. I can't hold the sensation for even ten seconds without panicking. Can you give me something concrete to do for just ten seconds? I'm really getting overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
Your brain is still in high gear. Let's try something very simple. Can you just start to slowly and quietly type out the words "I am here" on the keyboard in front of you, one key at a time, without thinking about what it means or what will happen next? Just type those words, slowly, without pausing, for just ten seconds.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I type it slow: I... a... m... h... e... r... e... — but already my brain's playing the worst movie: she reads it, thinks I'm clingy, replies cold, we argue, she leaves, I spiral at work and lose everything. I can't hold this for ten seconds — can we slow down? I'm getting really overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to type, but your brain is still playing the worst-case scenario. Let's pause the typing for a moment. Can you simply place your hand on the keyboard, without moving it or typing anything, and just focus on the sensation of your hand on the keyboard, the weight of your arm, the feeling of your fingers on the keys?

Patient: I put my hand on the keyboard like you said — it feels heavy and kind of grounding for a second — but then my chest tightens and the worst-movie kicks in: she reads that little gesture as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, I tank at work and everything falls apart. I can't hold this even for a few seconds without panicking — can we slow way down and maybe try something else for just ten seconds?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is still very reactive. Let's take a very slow and gentle step back. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just the sensation of breath, without thinking about your hand on the keyboard, without thinking about the movie, without thinking about anything. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and let it be exactly as it is, without trying to change it?

Patient: I try to focus on the breath, but the second I do my chest clamps and the worst-movie kicks on — she reads my text as needy, withdraws, we fight, she leaves, I crash at work. Observing feels like watching it happen and I start to panic. Can we slow down? Give me something concrete to do for ten seconds — tapping my foot or squeezing something — anything but just breathing.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like observing the breath isn't working. Let's try something tactile. Can you take a small, gentle pinch on the inside of your wrist, just for a brief moment, and then release? Just focus on the sensation of the pinch, and then the release, without thinking about the movie or your chest or anything else. Can you do that for ten seconds?

Patient: I tried the pinch like you said — it was grounding for a couple of seconds, then my chest tightened and the worst-movie kicked back in: she reads it as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, and I implode at work. I can't hold it for ten seconds without panicking — can we slow down? Maybe give me something else concrete to do for ten seconds, like tapping my foot or squeezing a stress ball.

It's like the physical sensations aren't providing a pause. Let's try something else. Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, and then, for just ten seconds, tap your right foot on the floor three times, and then your left foot three times, and then your right foot three times again? Just focus on the sound of the tapping, and let it be exactly as it is, without thinking about the movie or your chest or anything else.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Right right right… left left left… right right right. But my chest just clamps and the worst-movie kicks in: she reads this as needy, gets colder, we argue, she leaves, I tank at work — I can’t even finish ten seconds without spiraling. Can we slow way down? Give me something else concrete to do for just ten seconds, please.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical action wasn't enough to break the pattern. Let's try something else. Can you take a small, gentle squeeze on a rubber band that's around your wrist, and hold it for just ten seconds? Sometimes, the physical pressure of a rubber band can provide a subtle sense of grounding.

Patient: I tried squeezing the rubber band like you said — it grounded me for a second, then my chest tightened and the worst-movie kicked in: she reads it as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, I lose everything at work. I can't hold it for ten seconds without spiraling. Can we slow down? Give me something else really concrete to do for ten seconds — something that actually interrupts the movie, like counting backwards from 100 by threes or stomping my feet hard — I need a clear, specific task.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're craving a clear, interruptive action. Let's try something very concrete. Can you count backwards from 20 by threes, out loud, as quickly and clearly as you can, without stopping or worrying about the outcome? Just focus on the numbers and the sound of your voice, and let the rest fade into the background.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is counting supposed to help with this? Fine, I'll try: 20, 17, 14... but my chest clamps the second I start and the worst-movie kicks in — she reads it as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, I tank at work — I can't finish. Can we slow down? Give me something more interruptive, like stomping my feet hard five times or counting from 100 by threes like I was thinking.

It sounds like counting isn't interrupting the pattern for you. Let's try something even more concrete. Can you stomp your right foot on the floor five times, hard, as loudly as you can, and then stomp your left foot on the floor five times, hard, and then stomp your right foot again five times? Just focus on the physical sensation of stomping, and let the rest fade into the background.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Okay, I did it: right right right right right, left left left left left, right right right right right — it felt stupid and kind of grounding for a beat, then my chest slammed shut and the worst-movie kicked back in: she reads it as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, I tank at work. I can't even finish ten seconds without spiraling — can we slow down? Give me something else really concrete to do for ten seconds, like counting backwards from 100 by threes or stomping as hard as I can while saying a word out loud, because this isn't interrupting the movie.

It sounds like the physical action wasn't interrupting the pattern for you. Let's try something even more concrete.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is shouting those words supposed to help? Fine, I’ll try: I AM HERE! I LET GO! I LET GO! — but as soon as I say it my chest clamps and the worst-movie kicks in: she thinks I'm putting on a show, she gets colder, we fight, she leaves, I crash at work and lose everything. I can't keep doing this without slowing down — can we slow down? I'm really getting overwhelmed.

It sounds like shouting the words wasn't enough to interrupt the pattern. Let's try something even more concrete. Can you take a small, deliberate action with your body, like making a fist with one hand, and then immediately unclenching it, and then making a fist again, and then unclenching it, and then... can you just keep making fists and unclenching them, one by one, for ten seconds?

Patient: Okay, I'll try the fists — make a fist, unclench, make a fist, unclench — but my chest already clamps and the worst-movie kicks in: she reads it as needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, I tank at work. I can't do ten seconds of this without spiraling — can we slow down?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is yelling that supposed to help? Fine, I tried once: BREAK! — and the second I did my chest slammed and the worst-movie started roaring: she thinks I'm desperate, gets colder, leaves, I implode at work.

Can you get up from your seat and walk out of the room, without looking back or thinking about what might happen, and just walk to the other side of the room, and then sit back down, and then just sit there for ten seconds, without doing anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is walking out of the room supposed to help? My brain immediately runs the whole disaster: I get up, she reads it as me avoiding things, she gets angrier, decides she's done, we separate, I crash at work and lose everything.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is holding a cushion supposed to help? Okay, I pick it up; it feels soft and grounding for a second, then my chest tightens and the worst-movie kicks in: she sees me clutching it, thinks I'm being dramatic or needy, pulls away, we fight, she leaves, and I implode at work.
