Patient: I'm an artist in my early fifties, and lately what's been on my mind is this overwhelming anxiety in social settings that makes me avoid gatherings with friends. Since I lost steady work, my PTSD's gotten worse and I mostly rely on myself, which feels exhausting. I guess I don't know what to do about it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed by your anxiety in social situations, and that's causing you to withdraw from activities that bring you joy, like spending time with friends. Can you tell me more about what happens in those social situations that makes you feel anxious?

Patient: I don't know... when I'm at a gathering my heart starts racing and my chest gets tight, and then my head just goes blank so I can't think of what to say. I guess I feel like everyone's watching or judging me, and sometimes a loud voice or crowd noise pulls me back into something from before. I end up making excuses to leave or avoiding the whole thing, but I don't really know how to change that.

Therapist: It sounds like you feel like your anxiety is hijacking your experience in social situations, making you feel like you're on high alert and unable to relax. You're using those feelings as an excuse to avoid being around others, which can be both understandable and unfulfilling. What would it be like if, for just a moment, you could observe those thoughts and feelings without judgment – just notice them without trying to change them?

Patient: I don't know... I try to notice, but when I do everything just seems louder and my chest tightens and then I start criticizing myself. I guess observing quickly turns into judging, and that makes me want to escape. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It can be really tough to catch yourself when you're in the midst of those feelings. Criticizing yourself can actually make things worse, isn't it? Can you think of a moment when you did notice that thought pattern – that "I'm not doing it right" feeling – and you didn't immediately judge yourself, but just observed it?

Patient: I don't know... maybe once at a small gallery opening I went to by myself. I remember my chest tightening and the thought "they're all judging me" came up, but I just watched it for a minute instead of trying to fix it. Then I started judging myself for not talking and made excuses to leave, so I guess I don't stay with the noticing for long and it gets messy.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that moment of noticing without immediately jumping into judgment. That's a good starting point. Now, what's it like to think about the value of being present and fully engaged with others, even when you're feeling anxious? Can you imagine what it might be like to be willing to stay with those feelings and simply be with others, even if it feels uncomfortable?

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of see the value—maybe being present would let me actually enjoy a conversation instead of spiraling—but the idea of just staying with the feelings feels terrifying. I guess when I try to imagine it my chest tightens and I want to run, and I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: The tension and anxiety can make it hard to imagine being present. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you've been able to stay with those feelings – even if it was just for a tiny bit – without trying to change or escape? Maybe it's something as simple as noticing your breath while brushing your teeth, or being with a trusted friend in a quiet moment.

Patient: I don't know... maybe when I'm in my studio painting I can notice my breath and the tightness for a minute without running. I guess it's easier there because I'm focused on the canvas and alone, but if I start thinking about someone watching it all falls apart. Can we talk about how to bring that into a small get-together?

Therapist: It sounds like your studio space is a small bubble of calm for you. Now, let's imagine that you're still in that same space, but instead of being alone, you're with a small group of trusted friends who are there to support you, not judge you. What would it be like to stay with the physical sensations of anxiety, like the tightness in your chest, while you're still engaged with others?

Patient: I don't know... if I tried, maybe I'd notice the tightness and take a breath and could stay with people for a minute or two without panicking. But then I start judging myself—thinking I'm boring or awkward—and it feels like there's a timer on me, so I end up leaving. Can we talk about small, practical steps to bring that studio calm into a tiny get-together? I guess I'm not sure how to actually do that.

Therapist: Let's focus on taking that one tiny step. What if, right now, you could invite one friend over for a short, quiet coffee, just the two of you? No need for fancy plans or a big group – just a small, low-key get-together. Would you be willing to try that, and just see what happens?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try, but it feels really scary. Maybe just one friend for like half an hour, and I’d need a simple excuse to step outside if it gets bad—can you help me figure out what that plan would look like?

Therapist: Let's break it down. How about this: you tell your friend that you have a sudden "artistic emergency" that you need to take care of, like a deadline for a project or something that requires your immediate attention. That way, if you start feeling overwhelmed, you can step outside for a few minutes to collect yourself without feeling like you're abandoning your friend.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that could work, but it feels weird lying to a friend. Maybe I could say I have a sudden deadline or need to check something in the studio—something vague and quick. Can you help me with a very short line to say, and what to do if they ask to stay longer? I'm getting a bit anxious just thinking about this.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about lying, but sometimes small white lies can help us get out of a difficult situation. How about this: you could say, "Hey, I need to just quickly check on something in the studio – I'll be right back." That's vague enough to be honest, but not too revealing. If they ask to stay longer, you could say, "I appreciate the company, but I'm just trying to meet a tight deadline – can we catch up again soon?" That way, you're not committing to staying longer than you need to, and you're still being friendly.

Patient: I don't know... that could work, but it feels awkward—I'm not great at lying. Could you give me two very short scripts: one to say when I need to step out, and one if they ask me to stay longer? Also, I guess I'm worried if they press and ask why I'm anxious—I don't know what to say then.

Therapist: I can provide you with some scripts. Here are two short ones:

**Script 1: Stepping out**
"Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, I need to take a minute to recharge. I'll be right back."

**Script 2: Staying longer**
"That's really great to catch up with you, but I'm running a bit short on time. Let's make plans to do something else soon?"

As for what to say if they press about why you're anxious, you could simply say:

"That's okay, I just need a minute to collect myself. I'm sorry if I seem a bit short with you."

This acknowledges their concern without getting into details.

Patient: I don't know... I guess those scripts might work, the first one sounds okay but the second still feels kind of vague and awkward. If they press me with "why?" I get really flustered and don't know what to say without feeling exposed — can we practice a very short, honest line I can use if they ask, something I won't get stuck on?

Therapist: It can be hard to find the right words. How about this: "I'm just really struggling with anxiety in big groups, I need to take care of myself right now." That's short, honest, and doesn't go into details. It also doesn't leave them with more questions, so you can move on.

Patient: I don't know... that sounds honest but also really exposing, and I guess that scares me. Maybe something even shorter would feel safer—like, "I need a minute, I'm feeling overwhelmed." If they press "Why?" I just freeze and can't think of anything to say. Can we try practicing that one-liner a couple times? I'm already getting a bit anxious just thinking about it.

Therapist: It's okay to feel scared, and that one-liner might feel too exposing. Let's try to break it down even further. Can you practice saying just the phrase "I need a minute, I'm feeling overwhelmed" a few times, without thinking about what the other person might say? Just focus on getting the words out. I'll be here to support you.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try saying it out loud a few times. 

"I need a minute, I'm feeling overwhelmed." — first time my voice shook and my chest got tight, I almost couldn't finish the sentence.  
"I need a minute, I'm feeling overwhelmed." — second time it came out a little steadier but I felt dizzy and wanted to escape.  
"I need a minute, I'm feeling overwhelmed." — third time, I managed it, but it felt forced and then I started criticizing myself.

I guess that felt... doable-ish but still scary. Can we try the even shorter one, "I need a minute," next? I'm already getting anxious, so can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting more comfortable with the phrase, but it's still causing some physical tension. Let's slow down even further. Can you just focus on saying the phrase "I need a minute" without thinking about what it means or what the other person might think? Just say it, without adding anything else. No need to worry about the words that come after it for now.

Patient: I don't know... okay. I need a minute. The first time my voice shook and my chest tightened, the second time it came out a bit steadier, the third time felt forced but I said it. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed now—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's stop right there. It sounds like you're getting a bit too much with everything. Can we just be with the pause between "I need a minute" and the second part of the sentence? Just focus on the space between those two words. Can you just rest with that silence for a moment?

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to sit with the silence, but my thoughts just start racing and my chest tightens. I guess it feels a tiny bit like a space to breathe, but it's scary. Can we keep it slow? Maybe stay with it a little longer?

Therapist: Let's stay with the silence for just a tiny bit longer. Can you just notice the sensation of the pause, the feeling of your chest, the thoughts that are floating in? Let's just be with it, without trying to change it or push it away. I'm here with you, and we can stay here together for a moment.

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to sit with the pause but my chest tightens and my mind keeps yanking me toward 'get out.' I guess the silence makes me feel even more watched, and it's starting to make me panicky. Can we slow down more? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like the silence is actually making things feel more intense for you. Let's take another tiny step back. Can you just focus on the sensation of your breath, right now, without thinking about the pause or the words or anything else? Just bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to focus on my breath but it's shallow and my chest just tightens more. When I notice it my mind immediately goes to 'get out' and I start beating myself up—can we slow down? Maybe give me one tiny breathing trick I could actually use if I start feeling like this at a small get-together.

Therapist: It can be hard to shift gears back to the breath when you're feeling overwhelmed. Here's a tiny breathing trick you can try: just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Bring your attention to the weight of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the floor beneath you. See if you can just stay with that sensation, without thinking about anything else. It's a small, gentle anchor to bring you back to the present moment.

Patient: I don't know... I tried the feet thing for a bit. It landed me a little—my chest eased a touch—but my breathing's still shallow and my head feels foggy. Can we do one tiny, practical step for the coffee plan, like set a 30‑minute limit or a discreet signal I can use if I need to step out? I guess that feels like something I might manage, but it's getting heavy and my energy's low, so can we keep it really slow?

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. What if, when you're at the coffee date, you just say to yourself, "5 minutes"? That's it, just 5 minutes. You can say it quietly, without looking at your watch or anything else, just to yourself. If you need to step out after 5 minutes, you can do that. No need to explain or make a big deal out of it. Just 5 minutes.

Patient: I don't know... five minutes sounds like something I could maybe manage, I guess. But I'm worried I'll freeze and not even notice the five minutes—could we also pick a discreet signal, like leaving my cup by the door or a quick text I can send, so I have an easy out? I'm kind of wiped just talking about this, so can we keep any next step really small and simple?

Therapist: Let's keep it tiny. How about this: you could just leave your purse or bag by the door, where it's easy to grab and go? That way, if you need to step out after the 5 minutes, you can just quickly pick up your bag and say "I'm so sorry, I need to run". That's a simple, easy-out signal. No need to think too much, just a simple action.

Patient: I don't know... leaving my bag by the door sounds doable, I guess. It feels a bit embarrassing, but maybe that simple cue would help me slip out without a scene. My head's kind of heavy right now, so can we just stick with that one tiny plan for now?

Therapist: It's understandable that the thought of leaving your bag by the door might feel a bit embarrassing. Let's just acknowledge that it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your needs. We can revisit other ideas later. For now, just agree to try leaving your bag by the door as a discreet signal. Would you be willing to commit to that small step for now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try leaving my bag by the door. It feels awkward and my energy's really low, so can we just stick with that one tiny step for now—and maybe come up with one super-simple backup in case I freeze?

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. If you do end up freezing, what if you just stand up and say "Excuse me" or "Sorry, I need some fresh air"? That's a tiny, non-committal phrase that gives you a way out without having to do anything more. Just a small, easy escape route if needed.

Patient: I don't know... okay, that actually sounds easier than the other stuff—"Excuse me" or "Sorry, I need some fresh air" feels like something I could manage. I guess I'll try the bag-by-the-door plus that little phrase as my plan, but I'm pretty worn out talking through it—can we just stick with that for now and not add anything else?

Therapist: Let's stop here for now. You've got a plan, and it's not too overwhelming. Remember, we can always come back to this conversation later when you're feeling more rested. For now, just take a break and rest. I'll be here when you're ready to continue.

Patient: I don't know... I guess having the bag-and-excuse plan helps a little, but my energy's really low and my head feels fuzzy. Can we just do one tiny thing more—help me write a super-short text I can copy-paste to invite one friend for a quick 30‑minute coffee? Something simple so I won't freeze.

Therapist: Let's keep it super simple. Here's a text you can copy-paste: "Hey, want to grab a quick coffee at my place? Just 30 minutes?"

Patient: I don't know... that line might work, but "at my place" feels like too much for me. Maybe something like, "Hey, want to grab a quick coffee? 30 minutes this week?" I guess can you give me two super-short options—one for a close friend and one for someone I'm not very close to? I'm wiped, so keep them really short.

Therapist: Here are two super-short options:

**For a close friend:**
"Hey, want to grab coffee this week?"

**For someone you're not very close to:**
"Hey, coffee? 30 minutes?"

Keep them simple and brief.

Patient: I don't know... those might work. I guess I'll use "Hey, want to grab coffee this week?" for a close friend and "Hey, coffee? 30 minutes?" for someone else. Can you make one tiny tweak so the close friend version includes 30 min—like "Hey, want to grab coffee this week? 30 min?" I'm kinda wiped, so keep it short.

Therapist: Here are the two options with the tweak you requested:

**For a close friend:**
"Hey, want to grab coffee this week? 30 min?"

**For someone you're not very close to:**
"Hey, coffee? 30 minutes?"

Take a break and rest. You've got your plan.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I guess I can try sending the text later. My head's pretty fuzzy and I'm feeling kind of drained, so keep it really small. Can you give me one tiny grounding phrase—one short sentence I can repeat if I start to panic? I'd like to stay with that a minute.
