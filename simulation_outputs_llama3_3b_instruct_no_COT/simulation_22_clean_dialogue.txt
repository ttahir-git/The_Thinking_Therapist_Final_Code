Patient: Hi, I'm middle-aged and recently unemployed, and since the kids moved out I've been feeling really on edge — I keep getting angry and frustrated, especially when people bring up the empty‑nest stuff. I guess I get snappy with my partner and then feel guilty and try to avoid everyone. I don't know how to calm down when it happens. It's awkward to talk about, so I'm not sure where to begin.

Therapist: It sounds like the empty nest is stirring up strong emotions for you, and it's impacting your relationships. Can you tell me more about what happens in those moments when you feel angry and frustrated? What's the first thing that usually comes up for you when someone mentions the kids leaving the house?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the first thing is this tightness in my chest and a sudden rush, like my heart's beating faster and I get hot. Then my head goes to stuff like I'm useless now or that I'm being abandoned, and I get resentful — even about small comments — and I snap at whoever's there. After that I feel awful and guilty, so I clam up or try to change the subject because it's just... awkward to dig into.

Therapist: It sounds like your body's physiological response is quite intense. Can you explore what might be different if, instead of getting caught up in those thoughts and feelings, you simply acknowledged them without judgment, like "Ah, my chest is getting tight and I'm feeling anxious right now"? Would that be a more helpful way to experience these emotions?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that would make sense, but it feels easier said than done. If I try to name the tightness I immediately start thinking I'm pathetic or useless, and that just feeds the anger. Maybe noticing it would help a bit, but in the moment I usually just clam up or try to steer the conversation away because it's too awkward.

Therapist: It can be tough to step back from those thoughts and emotions in the heat of the moment. What would be a small, tiny step you could take in this moment, just to give yourself a tiny bit of space, that wouldn't feel like you're abandoning or avoiding? For example, could you take a deep breath and say something like "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now" without judgment, just to acknowledge your experience?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try to take a deep breath, but saying "I'm feeling overwhelmed" out loud feels embarrassing. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: You're already taking a small step by slowing down the conversation. That takes a lot of courage. What would it mean for you to take a brief pause, even just for a moment, and focus on your breath, without adding any labels or judgments about your feelings?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I'm not reacting automatically, giving myself a second so the tightness might loosen. It sounds like it could help, but it also feels awkward — like I'm admitting I'm falling apart — so I worry I'd still snap or just end up avoiding the feeling. I can try taking a few breaths now, but I'm not sure it'll do much.

Therapist: You're already acknowledging the potential benefits, but also the fear of not being in control. Can you try to separate those two things for a moment? What if, instead of worrying about what might happen if you take a few breaths, you simply focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out, without judgment or expectations?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. Right now my breath feels shallow and fast, and when I slow it down my mind immediately pops up with stuff like "you're useless" and I get annoyed at myself — it helps a tiny bit but I still feel on edge and awkward, so can we go a bit slower?

Therapist: It's like your mind is jumping ahead and anticipating what might happen. Can you try to bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath, without labeling it or trying to change it? Instead, simply notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out, and allow it to be exactly as it is, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I actually pay attention to my breath the tightness eases a bit, like my shoulders drop for a few seconds. But then my brain slams into "you're useless" and I get defensive again, so it doesn't stick — can we slow down? Maybe talk about what I could say when my partner makes those empty‑nest comments, because I either freeze or snap and then feel awful.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is jumping from relaxation to defensiveness quickly. What would you say to yourself, or to your partner, if you could say something that would acknowledge your feelings and break the cycle of defensiveness? Not trying to solve the problem, but just acknowledging the experience?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd want to tell my partner, "When you talk about the kids leaving it makes me feel abandoned and useless, and I get defensive because I'm scared," but saying that out loud feels awkward and embarrassing. So I'd probably end up saying something weak like, "I'm having a hard time," and then clam up — can we slow down? I don't really know how to start.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about how your partner might react. What if, instead of trying to predict how they'll respond, you simply expressed your feelings as you have, without worrying about their reaction? Would saying "When you talk about the kids leaving it makes me feel abandoned and useless, and I get defensive because I'm scared" feel like a more authentic expression of your experience?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that would be honest, but saying it out loud feels terrifying, like I'm admitting I'm fragile or pathetic. So I'd probably hedge with "I'm having a hard time" and then clam up — can we slow down? Could you help me with a simple way to start that doesn't make me feel so exposed?

Therapist: You're feeling like being honest might be too vulnerable. Can you try to start with something very small, even just a tiny bit, like "I feel a little anxious when you mention the kids leaving"? That's a very gentle way to express your feeling, and it doesn't require you to expose yourself too much.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying that. Even that feels embarrassing though, and I get kind of pissed at myself for needing to make it so small — like I should've handled this better. Can we slow down and maybe practice a really simple version I could actually say without feeling exposed?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in self-judgment. Can you try to observe that feeling without judgment, just as you would watch a cloud pass by? What if you simply acknowledge it to yourself, without adding any judgment, like "I'm feeling a bit frustrated right now"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. I'm feeling a bit frustrated right now and also anxious — my chest is tight and my thoughts are jumping all over, and I feel really stupid for getting so worked up like I should've handled this better. It makes me snap at myself, which just adds to the frustration. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions and self-criticism. What if, instead of trying to calm your thoughts or emotions, you simply focused on your breath, and allowed yourself to feel whatever sensations arise, without trying to change them or judge them?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice my breath, but my chest is still tight and my head keeps jumping to that time I messed up, which makes me feel stupid. Can we just do a couple of really slow breaths together? Go slower — I need it.

Therapist: Let's focus on the breath together. Take a deep breath in... and out... (pause) ...and take another one... (pause) Can you just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out, without trying to change it or add anything to it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can feel it — shallow, tight in my chest, and for a second my shoulders loosened but then my thoughts jumped and I got tense again. Can we do one more really slow breath together? Go slower — I need it.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. In... (pause) ...and out... (pause) Take your time, feel the breath moving in and out... notice the sensation of your chest and shoulders...

Patient: I don't know... I guess that helped for a second — my shoulders eased, but then some stupid image popped into my head and I felt ashamed and tense again. My thoughts keep flitting around so it's hard to stay with the breath; can we go even slower? I really need that.

Therapist: It's like your breath is becoming a refuge, but your thoughts are still jumping in. Let's try to bring the focus even more to the breath. Take a deep breath in... (pause) ...and hold... (pause) ...and exhale... (pause) Feel the breath move out, slowly...

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can hold it, but as soon as I try that stupid memory of when I messed up pops in and I feel ashamed and tense and then yank the breath out. It helps for a second, then I'm back to shallow breathing. Can we go slower? And could you give me one really simple thing I could actually say to my partner that won't make me feel exposed?

Therapist: It's like your body is reacting quickly to the thoughts that come up. Let's try to focus on the breath again. Take a deep breath in... (pause) ...and hold... (pause) ...and exhale... (pause) Feel the breath move out, slowly.

As for what to say to your partner, can you try saying "I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable right now"? It's very simple and doesn't require you to reveal too much about your thoughts or feelings.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could say that, but it just feels pathetic — like I'm admitting I'm fragile and I hate that. Maybe something even less exposed, like "Can we pause for a minute?" or "I can't talk about this right now" — those feel more... doable.

Can we try one quick slow practice? You play my partner and I'll try the line, but go really slow.

Therapist: I'll play the role of your partner, and we'll take it very slow. I'll start: "Hey, I was just saying how great it's going to be when the kids are all grown up and moving out."

Now it's your turn. Remember, we're taking it very slow. Just take a deep breath in... and out... and respond when you're ready.

Patient: I don't know... I guess—can we pause for a minute? I get this tightness when you say that, and I need a second. Can we keep going really slowly?

Therapist: It's like the pause gives you a bit of space. Let's keep going. I'll try again: "I know you loved having the kids around, but it's nice to have some space too."

Take a deep breath in... and out... and respond when you're ready.

Patient: I don't know... I guess when you say that I feel resentful, like you're happy about the space and I'm left behind. My chest tightens and I want to snap, so could we pause for a minute? I'm kind of embarrassed I need that and my mind's all over the place.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. That's okay. You're taking a good step by acknowledging your feelings and asking for a pause. Let's take a deep breath in... and out... and pause for just a moment.

When we come back, I'll try again. I'll start: "I'm going to get some coffee, do you want some?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess no, I'm fine without coffee. When you say stuff like that my chest tightens and I get this stupid shame, like I should've done better, so can we just pause? Maybe sit quietly for a minute and go really slow — I'm kind of scattered and I need that.

Therapist: It's like your body is reacting strongly to certain topics. Let's take a break and sit quietly for a minute. No pressure, no expectations. Just being present together. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's just sit.

Patient: I don't know... I guess sitting helps a little — my chest eased for a second but then stupid thoughts popped up and I tensed again. I'm kind of wiped, so can we keep going slowly? Could we practice me saying "Can we pause for a minute?" to you one more time?

Therapist: It's like sitting helped to calm your body, but your thoughts are still jumping in. Let's practice saying "Can we pause for a minute?" again. I'll respond in a slow and gentle way. Take a deep breath in... and out... and go ahead and say it. I'm here to support you.

Patient: I don't know... I guess—"Can we pause for a minute?" Saying that already makes me feel kind of pathetic and ashamed, like I'm failing, but my chest is tight and my head's all over the place. Can we just sit quietly for a bit and go really, really slow?

Therapist: It's like the thought of saying "Can we pause for a minute?" triggered more feelings for you. That's okay. Let's just be with your body and breath for a moment. No thinking, no trying to change anything. Just be with what is. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's just sit together in silence for a moment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess sitting helps a little — my chest loosened for a moment, but then some stupid image popped in and I felt ashamed and pissed at myself. Can we keep sitting quiet for a while and go really, really slow?

Therapist: It's like sitting has become a refuge for you, but your thoughts are still trying to pull you back in. Let's keep sitting quietly together, and I'll sit with you in silence. Take your time, and when you're ready, we can try to explore this further. No pressure, no expectations. Just being present with each other.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but I'm feeling wiped and my chest's tight and I keep getting pissed at myself for needing help — it's embarrassing and makes me want to shut down. Can we just stay really slow and practice one simple line I could actually say to my partner, something that won't make me feel exposed?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling overwhelmed and ashamed about needing help, which is understandable. Let's take a deep breath together and focus on just one simple line. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's try this: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Just say it to me, slowly, and without judgment. I'm here to support you.

Patient: I don't know... I guess — "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Saying that already makes me feel pathetic and ashamed, like I should've handled this better. Can we go slower and maybe practice it one more time?

Therapist: It's like the words "I'm feeling really overwhelmed" are triggering shame for you. Let's slow down and focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out. Take a deep breath in... and out... and just notice the physical sensation of your body. When you're ready, we can try that phrase again. Maybe it will feel a little different this time.

Patient: I don't know... I guess — "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Saying it already makes me feel pathetic and this stupid image keeps popping in so I get ashamed and tense. Can we go even slower? Maybe one more really slow breath before we try it again.

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. In... and out... and let's pause for a moment. When you're ready, we'll try that phrase again. Take your time, and just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out.

Patient: I don't know... I guess — "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Saying it already makes this stupid image pop into my head and I get ashamed and tight, like I messed up or failed. Can we go even slower? Maybe one more really slow breath before we try it again?
