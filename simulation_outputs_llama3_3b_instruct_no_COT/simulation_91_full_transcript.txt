--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an older student and lately I keep getting furious, especially in any interaction tied to that health scare — talking to doctors or getting test results just sets me off. My mind immediately runs the whole disaster: a bad result, losing my studies, money falling apart, ending up isolated and unable to handle anything. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop picturing each step like it's already happening.

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge them. Can you tell me more about what happens right before your mind starts spiraling into that 'disaster' scenario?

Patient: It usually starts with a tiny thing — a pause from the doctor, a delayed email, or even a look that feels unreadable — and my chest tightens like a fuse being lit. In a flash I'm running the whole chain: the result is terrible, I lose my place in school, money collapses, I'm too sick to keep up, and I get furious at whoever's around because it all feels inevitable. People telling me to calm down or consider other endings just makes me angrier; those other endings don't seem real to me.

Therapist Answer:
Those small things can escalate quickly. It sounds like you feel like you're running out of control in those moments. Can you notice what's happening in your body when your mind starts racing with worst-case scenarios – is it just your chest tightening, or are other physical sensations present?

Patient: It starts with a tightness in my chest, then my heart races and my breathing gets shallow; my hands go cold and clammy and my jaw clenches. My face heats up and my vision narrows, and there's this pressure behind my eyes with a rising urge to snap or slam something — like I'm about to explode. Once those sensations kick in my mind locks onto the worst-case story and other outcomes feel like lies, which just makes the physical stuff worse.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be intense. It sounds like they're really connected to the feelings of overwhelm and helplessness. Can you explore what it might be like to lean into the physical sensations, rather than trying to push them away or label them as "bad" – just notice them, as they are, without judgment?

Patient: I tried that once—trying to just feel the tightness and my breath—but as soon as I focus on the chest the fortune-telling machine kicks in: rotten test, dropping out, bills collapsing, ending up alone. Instead of calming, leaning in makes my jaw clamp, my hands go colder and the images get louder, like the sensations are proof the disaster's already happening. Honestly, it feels pointless—why would noticing help when everything I feel already proves the worst is inevitable?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to shift out of that mode once it's engaged. It sounds like the catastrophic thinking is really tied to a sense of helplessness – like noticing the sensations or feelings isn't going to change the outcome. What if, instead of trying to change the outcome, you were to focus on what you could do in this moment, even if it's just taking a small step – would that feel like a more manageable task?

Patient: I get what you're suggesting, but it doesn't feel manageable — the minute I try to focus on a small step my fortune-telling brain just rewinds the whole disaster and uses the step as evidence it's already happening. Maybe I could force myself to do one tiny thing, like set a five-minute timer to open that email slowly, but it feels like a Band‑Aid and I'm honestly frustrated and overwhelmed that we keep circling the same quick fixes when the worst-case feels definite.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you feel like you're stuck in a cycle of trying to find quick fixes to avoid the catastrophic thinking. Can you explore what might happen if, instead of trying to manage the symptoms, you were to take a step back and ask yourself what it would be like to take the email open, not because you want to avoid the worst-case, but because it feels important to you – what if it's a matter of taking care of something that's important to you?

Patient: I wish it felt that simple, but as soon as I try to open an email because "it's important," my mind fast-forwards: it's the bad test, then I fail out, my savings vanish paying for care, I can't work, I end up alone and furious at everyone. Saying it could be neutral or good just feels like denial to me — my brain treats those possibilities as lies and gets angrier. Honestly, I'm tired of circling quick fixes; can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you feel like you're stuck in a cycle of avoidance, where no matter what you do, the worst-case thinking shows up. Can we take a break from trying to "fix" the situation, and instead, explore what's driving the need to control the outcome so much? What is it about being able to handle the situation with confidence that feels so important to you?

Patient: Because I’m older and scraping together school and health care, not being able to handle it feels like a literal end — my savings, my place in school, my independence all vanish. The health scare made me feel like there’s no second chance, so control feels like survival; when someone suggests calmer possibilities it just sounds like denial and makes me angrier. I don’t know, it’s just… I’m frustrated and overwhelmed that the only thing that seems real is the disaster my brain insists on.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Your fear of losing control is really tied to a sense of identity and security. It sounds like the health scare has heightened your awareness of the vulnerabilities you've been trying to keep hidden. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that your worth and identity aren't solely defined by your ability to handle this situation?

Patient: I can't imagine that — if I don't handle this, my brain already plays the tape: bad result, kicked out of school, bills eat my savings, I can't live on my own, and I'm just a burden. Saying my worth isn't tied to managing it feels like a lie and just makes me angrier and more exhausted. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but I'm really struggling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the sense of identity is deeply entangled with the worst-case scenario. Let's try to slow down a bit more. Can you simply acknowledge that it's hard to imagine your worth and identity being separate from your ability to handle this situation, without judgment – just notice that feeling of heaviness, and see if there's any sense of something else present, even if it's just a tiny whisper?

Patient: I can say it's hard to imagine my worth separate from handling this — I feel this heavy pressure in my chest and a tiny whisper that maybe I'm okay even if things go sideways. But the whisper barely exists before my mind yells it's a trap: if I believe that, I'll let my guard down and then the bad result comes, I lose school, my savings, my independence — everything collapses. I'm frustrated and exhausted and honestly struggling; can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that tiny whisper is getting lost in the noise of your worst-case thinking. Can you gently bring your attention back to that whisper – not to try and amplify it, but just to see it more clearly – and what does it feel like, exactly? Is it a sense of calm, a glimmer of hope, or something else?

Patient: It's like a tiny, brittle warmth in my chest — a faint, almost embarrassed thought that maybe I could still be okay or handle this. No sooner does it appear than the fortune-telling machine screams the tape: bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone paying for care, forced to rely on others, everyone leaves me to deal with the mess — so the whisper feels like a trap. I'm getting overwhelmed and frustrated trying to hold onto it; can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That warmth in your chest is fragile. It's like it's trying to show up, but gets quickly overwhelmed by the certainty of the worst-case thinking. Can you try to give that warmth a bit more space to exist, without trying to grasp it or hold onto it – just observe it, as it is, in this moment?

Patient: I can barely notice it — a tiny ember under my ribs, a faint warmth that feels almost shy. But no sooner does it appear than my fortune-telling brain screams it's a trap: if I let that warmth grow I'll let my guard down, miss signs, get the bad result, lose school and savings, and end up dependent — it makes me furious and exhausted; can we slow down? I'm really struggling to hold onto it.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The warmth is so fragile. It's like it's trying to stay hidden, but the worst-case thinking keeps pushing it away. Can you try to look at the fact that your brain is trying to protect you from getting hurt – is that a good thing, or is it just a way of trying to control something that's already outside of your control?

Patient: I guess it's trying to protect me — like armor so I'm not blindsided. But it's a smothering protection: it forces me to pre-play the worst so I can "prepare," and that just locks me into panic. If I let up my brain instantly yells the tape — bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone, forced to rely on others — so saying it's just maladaptive feels like denial. I'm getting angry and exhausted; can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The armor feels like it's suffocating you. It's like you're trying to prepare for a battle that's already been lost. Can you explore the idea that maybe this armor, this need for control, is coming from a place of fear – what if it's not about preparing for a specific outcome, but about not feeling vulnerable at all?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If I even think about letting the armor down my fortune-telling brain screams that I'll get the bad result, lose my spot in school, my savings will vanish paying for care, and I'll end up dependent and alone. Saying it's about being "okay with vulnerability" feels like a trap my mind uses to get me to let my guard down, which just makes me furious and exhausted. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how that idea connects to what's actually happening.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting frustrated with the idea. Can we take a step back and explore what it means for you to feel "okay with vulnerability" in this moment – not as a goal or a destination, but as a way of describing your current experience? What would it be like, simply, to feel like you're not trying to control every outcome, and that's okay?

Patient: I can't imagine it — as an older student scraping by after that health scare, the minute I think about not controlling everything my chest tightens and the fortune-telling machine kicks in: bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone paying for care, stuck dependent and alone. The idea of being "okay with vulnerability" feels like a trap my brain uses to get me to drop my guard, and that makes me furious and exhausted. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the idea of vulnerability feels like a threat to the sense of control you're already holding onto. Can you explore what's happening in your body when you think about not being able to control everything – is there a sense of anxiety, fear, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? When I even imagine not being in control my chest clamps, my heart hammers, breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold and my jaw locks; my vision narrows and my stomach knots until I feel ready to snap. That physical surge fuels the fortune-telling tape—bad test, lose school, savings gone, forced to rely on others—so the sensations feel like proof and just make me angrier and more exhausted. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The physical sensations are really intense. Can you try to notice the sensations as they are, without trying to change them or push them away – just observe the physical experience of your body, without judgment?

Patient: When I try to just notice it, my body floods — chest clamps, heart racing, breath shallow, hands cold, jaw locked. At the same time this ugly, ashamed feeling from before sneaks in and feels like proof I've already failed, and the fortune‑telling machine instantly plays the tape: bad result, lose school, savings gone, stuck alone. Trying to observe without judgment just makes the shame louder and the images more certain; I'm frustrated and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I'm really struggling to keep with this.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the effort to observe without judgment is actually making things worse. Can we take a break from trying to observe or change anything, and instead, gently bring your attention to the sensation of shame that's present – not as something to be condemned or gotten rid of, but simply as a sensation that is there, in this moment?

Patient: I can try, but it feels like I'm poking at something raw. The shame is a heavy, sinking pressure in my chest and a hot flush in my face, like I'm already exposed and failing. The instant I notice it the fortune‑telling machine screams the tape — bad result, lose school, savings gone, forced to rely on others — and that just makes the shame louder. I'm really struggling to stay with this; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame is a very intense and uncomfortable feeling. Can you try to acknowledge it, not as a thing that's "wrong" or "bad", but simply as a sensation that is present, like the weight of a heavy stone in your chest? Can you breathe into that feeling, just for a moment, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I try to breathe into it but my chest clamps harder, that old failure slips in and the fortune‑telling machine screams the tape—bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone paying for care, stuck dependent and alone—so it just leaves me more exhausted and furious; can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to breathe into the shame is making things worse. Can we try a different approach? Can you imagine that your chest is a container, and the shame is just a small object inside it? Can you gently imagine that the object is not moving or changing, and that the container is holding it, without trying to open or get rid of it?

Patient: I can try, but picturing it like a little object in a container just feels like putting a grenade in a jar — it doesn't make it safe, it just delays the blast. The moment I imagine the jar holding the shame my fortune‑telling brain plays the tape louder: bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone, stuck dependent and alone, and I get furious and exhausted; can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like trying to contain the shame is just making it more intense. Can we try to focus on the sensation of your breath, rather than the shame or the worst-case scenario? Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or get rid of it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is paying attention to my breath supposed to help? Every time I try my breathing just gets shallow and the fortune‑telling machine screams the tape—bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone, stuck dependent and alone—and that just makes me angrier and drained. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the focus on the breath is just getting caught up in the same cycle of catastrophic thinking. Can we try something different? Can you notice what happens when you pause for just a moment, right now, before you start thinking about breathing or trying to control anything? What's there, in that pause, before anything else happens?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I even try to pause there's this hollow, like a timer running out, and it doesn't feel calming at all. My chest clamps, that shame from before slides in like proof I've failed, and the fortune‑telling machine immediately screams the tape: bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone paying for care, stuck dependent and alone. The pause just becomes the setup for the disaster story and leaves me more furious and drained; can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pause itself is becoming a source of anxiety, rather than a place of calm. Can we try to look at the pause not as a time for thinking or control, but as a moment of stillness – just a moment of being present with what is, without judgment or planning? Can you simply be with the sensation of the pause, without trying to use it for anything?

Patient: I try to be with the pause, but the moment I notice it my chest clamps and my mind immediately screams the tape — bad result, kicked out of school, savings wiped out paying for care, forced to rely on others and end up alone. The pause just becomes the setup for that story, my hands go cold and my jaw locks, and I get more furious and drained; can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Patient: I try to notice what's here, but the moment I try my chest clamps, breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold and that fortune‑telling machine fires off the tape—bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone, stuck dependent and alone—and the pause just feels like the first beat of the disaster.

Patient: I can say it out loud—that it's okay to feel frustrated and overwhelmed. But my fortune‑telling brain immediately screams the tape—bad result, kicked out of school, savings gone, stuck dependent and alone—so saying it's okay feels like a lie and just makes me angrier and more exhausted; can we slow down?

It sounds like saying it's okay to feel frustrated is getting caught up in the same cycle of catastrophic thinking. Can we try to see what would happen if we didn't say anything at all – no judgment, no trying to change or control anything – what would be the experience of simply being with this feeling of frustration and overwhelm, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I can do that — the silence feels like a countdown and as soon as I stop talking my chest tightens and that old shame slides in.
