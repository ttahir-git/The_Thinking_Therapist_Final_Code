Patient: Honestly, what's been on my mind is this growing anxiety in social situations—when friends invite us over I just clam up and make excuses, even though my partner is really supportive. I'm an older student dealing with an empty nest, and it's pushed me into avoiding gatherings I used to enjoy. I don't see why talking about this will help, but here we are—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It takes courage to acknowledge this feeling and the impact it's having on your life. It's understandable that you might feel like talking about it won't make a difference. Can you tell me what happens for you in those social situations when you start to feel anxious?

Patient: When it starts, my chest tightens and my stomach flips, and I get this urge to just disappear—small talk feels impossible and my mind goes blank. I start replaying every thing I said, convinced people are judging me, so I either leave early or make up an excuse to avoid it altogether. I've tried deep breathing and telling myself it's irrational, and it hardly helps. How is going over this stuff supposed to make that urge go away?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body and mind are quite reactive in those situations. The thought of all the things you replay and the sense of being judged seems to be intensifying the physical symptoms. Can you imagine what would happen if, in the midst of that anxiety, you allowed yourself to notice your body's tension and the racing thoughts without trying to fight them or change them?

Patient: I can sort of imagine it, but when I try to do that it feels like I'm inviting the panic to sit there and get louder instead of letting it pass. My mind doesn't just notice— it grabs onto every thought and the tension spikes, so I still end up wanting to bolt. I've tried mindfulness apps and noting exercises before and they barely changed anything. How is that actually supposed to stop the urge to leave or the replaying in my head?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is quite resistant to the idea of simply observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment or trying to change them. That's not uncommon. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with me right here, just for a moment? I want to help you explore what might happen if, instead of trying to control your thoughts or avoid them, you simply acknowledge them as passing thoughts, like the sensation of your feet touching the ground or the sound of my voice?

Patient: Alright, I can try, but I'm really skeptical—every time I tried noticing before the panic seemed to get louder, not quieter. How is that supposed to help stop the urge to bolt? Tell me exactly what you'd have me focus on and I'll do it for a minute.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the thoughts without judgment, especially when you've found it doesn't lead to a decrease in anxiety, can be really tough. I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your breath, specifically the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it. Just notice the sensation of the breath, feeling its texture, temperature, and movement. No thought about stopping the panic or making it go away, just the sensation of the breath. Can you do that for a minute, just observing the breath?

Patient: Okay, I tried it for about a minute. My breath felt shallow and tight—every time I focused the 'they're judging me' loop got louder, and the urge to get up and leave just returned stronger. How is that supposed to reduce the urge to bolt when noticing it seems to make it worse?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the breath without changing it can be a bit paradoxical, I know. It sounds like your mind is very good at hijacking the experience, even when you're trying to focus on something else. Can I try to help you see what's happening here? When you focus on your breath and the judgmental thoughts come up, what would happen if, instead of trying to push them away, you simply acknowledged them as "these thoughts"? Would that be enough to create some space for the breath to be felt more fully?

Patient: It helps a tiny bit for a second—calling something "just a thought" can buy a sliver of distance—but that sliver disappears fast and the conviction comes roaring back, my chest tightening the same as before. I've tried labeling and noticing in the past and it didn't stop the urge to bolt, so I'm not convinced this will make a real difference in the moment. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is very good at re-wiring the experience, and the distance you created is short-lived. I want to explore with you what might be driving the urge to bolt in the first place. What's the value, for you, in getting out of those social situations? Is it having some kind of sense of safety or relief?

Patient: Mostly it's about relief and control—getting out stops the immediate panic and spares me from whatever embarrassment I’m sure I’ll cause. It feels safer to retreat than to risk being judged or exposed, especially now that I'm out of my parenting role and still figuring out who I am. But sure, knowing that sounds obvious—how is that supposed to help me actually not bolt when it happens?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've identified a strong motivation behind your behavior, and that's a great place to start. It sounds like having a sense of control and safety is really important to you, especially now that your role as a parent is changing. Can you imagine what it would be like if, instead of retreating from social situations, you were able to take small steps towards engaging with others, even if it felt uncomfortable or vulnerable? What would that feel like for you, and would that be more in line with your value of control?

Patient: I can kind of picture it—like forcing myself to stay fifteen minutes or to make one comment—and maybe afterward I'd feel a tiny bit proud, like I reclaimed something after the empty-nest slump. But imagining it and actually doing it feel worlds apart; my brain still screams at me to leave and I end up choosing the relief, not the growth. How is deliberately doing small steps supposed to stop that impulse right when it hits?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting a sense of what's driving your behavior, and that's helpful. Now, I'd like to explore what might happen if, instead of trying to change your brain's reaction, you focused on what you value about taking those small steps. What would you need to feel like you're growing or moving forward in some way, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: I guess I'd need something concrete and measurable—like a clear, small goal (stay fifteen minutes, say one thing), plus a safety plan so I don't feel trapped, and some way to track progress so it doesn't just feel like vague advice. I'd also need my partner nearby or a signal so I feel supported, and for you to understand that when the panic hits, all the plans fly out the window. But honestly, I've done goals and safety plans before and still bolted—how is this actually going to stop the panic when it starts?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more structured approach to support you in taking those small steps. That's completely reasonable. Let's take a step back and consider what's driving the panic when you bolt. It's not just the action itself, but the feeling of being trapped and losing control. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to control the situation, you allowed yourself to feel the feeling of being overwhelmed, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can imagine it in theory—like letting a wave pass—but in practice when I try it the wave just gets bigger and I end up panicking more. How is that supposed to help stop the urge to bolt when the feeling becomes unbearable? If we're going to try that, I need something concrete to anchor me in the moment—a short grounding cue or a plan with my partner—because vague "sit with it" hasn't worked.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're looking for a way to connect the idea of tolerating the feeling to a more tangible experience. Let's explore an idea: what if, instead of trying to control the feeling of overwhelm, you used a physical anchor to bring yourself back to the present moment? For example, a simple phrase, a gesture, or a sensation in your body. Would having a clear and concrete anchor help you feel more connected to what's happening in the moment, even when the panic sets in?

Patient: Maybe—if it's really concrete. Something like squeezing my partner's hand, silently pressing my thumb to my forefinger, or saying to myself "I'm okay" could work as an anchor, but only if it's practiced and my partner knows the cue and there's a quick exit plan if it doesn't hold. I've tried anchors and mantras before and they fell apart when panic hit, so how exactly would you have me practice this so it actually sticks in the moment? I'm getting frustrated because it all sounds a bit theoretical—can we do a specific, step-by-step rehearsal now?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're looking for a practical approach. Let's do a rehearsal right now. I'll guide you through a step-by-step exercise to help you practice using your chosen anchor in a low-stakes situation. We'll start with a simple scenario: we're in a quiet room, and you're feeling anxious about an upcoming social gathering. You've decided to bring your partner and use the anchor you've chosen (e.g., squeezing their hand or saying "I'm okay"). Can you take a deep breath and let's begin with the setup: "What's one thing you can see around you in this room that's familiar and safe?"

Patient: Okay, I took a breath. One thing I can see that's familiar is the chipped mug my partner gave me on the shelf — it feels ordinary and safe. I'll use squeezing my partner's hand as the anchor, but be direct: what's the exact first thing you want me to do now, and how long should I hold it before deciding it isn't working?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Now that we have a familiar anchor in mind, I want you to hold your partner's hand and immediately start squeezing it. Not tightly, just a gentle squeeze. Say "I'm okay" to yourself, silently or out loud, whatever feels most comfortable for you. Hold the squeeze and the phrase for exactly 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, let go of the squeeze and take a deep breath. Then, slowly let go of the phrase. What happens?

Patient: I did it — held my partner's hand, gentle squeeze, and repeated "I'm okay" for the full 30 seconds. At first it felt a bit silly and my chest stayed tight, my mind kept chattering, but around 15–20 seconds the squeeze gave me a slight steadiness and my breath eased a notch. When I let go the urge to leave came back, but it felt maybe 20–30% less intense than usual — small, but noticeable. I'm frustrated because it's not a fix and the relief fades; if it only helps for a bit, how is that supposed to keep me in a room for an hour? What would you have me do next in the moment when the relief drops — keep squeezing longer, change the cue, or something else?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the exercise was a small success, and you were able to tolerate the anxiety for a bit longer. That's a great step forward. Since the relief didn't last, I'm not looking for a permanent fix, but rather a way to maintain the sense of steadiness and calm. What if, instead of trying to maintain the squeeze or change the cue, you simply acknowledge the return of the anxiety and say to yourself, "I've let go of the squeeze, and the anxiety is back. What's one thing I can do now to move forward?" This is more about developing a process for coping with the anxiety, rather than relying on the anchor to keep it away. Would you be willing to try that next?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, but I'm skeptical it'll be enough. If the anxiety comes back I need something concrete — like a three-option list (stay five more minutes, move to a quieter corner, step outside for two minutes) and a partner signal so I'm not making it up on the fly. How do you want me to pick which option in the moment so I don't just grab the exit — what's a quick rule I can actually follow?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're looking for a more concrete approach. Developing a process for coping with the anxiety is a good step. Let's work on a simple decision-making rule. What if, when the anxiety comes back, you ask yourself: "What's the smallest, most immediate action I can take to stay present and engaged?" This might be as simple as taking one deep breath, noticing your body, or making eye contact with your partner. The idea is to focus on the smallest, most concrete action you can take in the moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts or making a bigger decision. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I can try that, but I'm really doubtful—my brain goes on autopilot and grabs the exit before I can even think. I'll agree to try the "smallest action" rule and make the action concrete: one slow, full breath and a quick glance at my partner. How is that supposed to stop the automatic bolt if I can't even get the breath in? Also, we need a partner signal and a fallback plan if I literally can't do the breath—can we pick a simple signal and rehearse it now?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is very skilled at triggering an automatic response. One slow, full breath and a glance at your partner is a great starting point. As for stopping the automatic bolt, it's not about stopping it entirely, but rather about creating a small gap between the trigger and the reaction. Think of it as a tiny crack in the door that might allow you to re-enter the room and make a different choice.

Regarding the partner signal and fallback plan, let's keep it simple. What if your partner could give you a subtle nod, like a slight tilt of the head or a gentle squeeze of the hand, when you're feeling anxious? We can also have a pre-agreed-upon phrase, like "Go for it" or "You've got this," to help you feel more confident in your ability to make a different choice. Let's rehearse the nod and the phrase now, just to make sure we're on the same page.

Patient: Okay, I’m willing to rehearse, but I’m already feeling more on edge than I was a minute ago and it’s harder to focus. Be specific: what exactly should the nod look like (a slight tilt, a quick dip?), how long does it last, and the instant I notice it what exactly am I supposed to do—squeeze, take one full breath, lock eyes with my partner, or something else? Pick one phrase now (“Go for it” or “You’ve got this”) and have your voice say it so I can practice responding—walk me through the partner’s exact moves and my exact moves step by step, and we’ll try it right now. Honestly, I doubt it’ll stop me when I’m already halfway to the door, but I’ll try if you give me crystal-clear instructions.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the anxiety is building again. Let's take it one step at a time. The nod should be a subtle, quick movement of the head, about 1-2 centimeters, lasting for about 1-2 seconds. When you notice the nod, your goal is to take one slow, full breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. The idea is to create a small gap between the anxiety and your reaction.

As for the phrase, let's go with "You've got this." Now, let's rehearse the sequence. I'll start by nodding my head slightly. As soon as you see the nod, take one slow breath in and out. Say "You've got this" to yourself, and then take another slow breath in and out. I'll give you a nod now. As soon as you see it, take a slow breath in and say "You've got this." Go ahead and breathe and say it, just like that.

Patient: Okay—I saw your nod and as soon as I caught it I forced one slow, full breath and said "You've got this" to myself. It steadied me a tiny bit—my chest eased a notch—but I'm still jittery and my attention keeps darting away, like I can’t fully focus. If I miss the nod or can't even get the breath in, what exactly do you want me to do in that split second? Honestly, how is that supposed to help when the relief disappears so fast?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the anchor is helping, but you're still feeling the effects of the anxiety. If you miss the nod or can't get the breath in, I want you to do exactly what you did: take one slow, full breath in and out, and say "You've got this" to yourself. The idea is not to let the anxiety win, but to acknowledge it and create a small gap between the anxiety and your reaction.

Think of it like this: even if you miss the nod, the brief moment of taking a breath and saying "You've got this" can still help you come back to the present moment and make a different choice. It's not about the duration of the anchor, but about the consistency of your response.

Now, let's try something new. What if, instead of trying to focus on the anchor or the phrase, we focus on the physical sensation of your body in the present moment? I'll ask you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I can try, but I'm more on edge right now and my attention keeps darting—it's harder to focus than a minute ago. I've tried noticing sensations before and it doesn't stop the bolt—how is focusing on my feet supposed to help in that split second? Fine, pick one sensation and tell me exactly what to do and for how long, and I'll try it for 30 seconds.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed right now. Let's try focusing on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Here's what I want you to do: I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, noticing the weight, the pressure, the feeling of your feet being rooted to the floor. I want you to focus on this sensation without trying to change it, without trying to relax or get rid of it. Just notice it as it is, without judgment.

I want you to hold this attention for 30 seconds, starting now. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your feet without judgment. Let's start.

Patient: I did it, but only for about 10–12 seconds — I felt the pressure under my feet and a little steadiness, then my attention ripped away and my chest tightened. I'm more jumpy and distracted than I was a minute ago and it's really hard to hold focus. How is this supposed to help when I'm already walking toward the door? If it’s about creating a gap, give me one single, fail‑safe 3‑second script I can actually follow in the moment: exactly what my partner does and exactly what I do, step by step. And if I literally can't get a breath, what's the instant fallback so I don't just bolt? Walk me through it now and we'll try it.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like focusing on your feet didn't quite have the desired effect this time. Let's try a simpler approach. Here's a 3-second script:

Your partner: Nod slightly (about 1-2 centimeters) and say "Go for it" in a calm, gentle voice.

Your response: Take one slow, full breath in and out, and say "You've got this" to yourself.

This script is designed to be simple and easy to follow, even in the midst of a panic response. The goal is to create a brief moment of consistency and clarity, even if it's just for 3 seconds.

If you can't get a breath, your partner will give you the nod and say "Go for it". Your job is to respond with a slow, full breath and the phrase "You've got this". Let's practice it now:

Partner: *nods slightly and says "Go for it"*

Your response: Take one slow, full breath in and out, and say "You've got this" to yourself.

Patient: I saw the nod, forced one slow breath and said "You've got this"—it steadied me a little but I'm still jittery and my focus keeps snapping away. If I literally can't get a breath in at all, what's the single, instant fallback you want me to do—pinch my arm, press thumb to forefinger, something? Pick one exact move, and let's rehearse that now, because I'm doubtful the breath will be possible when I'm already halfway to the door.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling a bit off-balance. Let's try a single, instant fallback move. I want you to pinch the corner of your tongue between your teeth, just for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds). This small physical sensation can help create a tiny gap in the panic response, giving you a brief moment to re-regulate.

Partner: Nod slightly and say "Go for it" in a calm voice.

You: Pinch the corner of your tongue between your teeth for 1-2 seconds, and then focus on your breath or any other anchor that feels helpful.

Let's practice this now: *nods slightly and says "Go for it"* Pinch the corner of your tongue between your teeth, and take a deep breath (or focus on an anchor).

Patient: I did it — I pinched the corner of my tongue for about two seconds when you nodded and said "Go for it." It gave a sharp little shock that forced a breath, but honestly I'm still jittery, my heart's racing more than before, and my attention keeps ripping away. This feels like another tiny trick that buys me a second or two, not something that'll stop me from making a beeline for the door — how is this supposed to hold up when the urge to bolt is already in motion? And what do you want me to do if I'm alone or moving toward the exit and can't time the pinch — give me one single, idiot-proof step I can do in that split second.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like pinching the corner of your tongue is helping, but it's not a long-term solution. Let's try a more permanent anchor that you can rely on in any situation. I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. As soon as you feel the anxiety spike, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here." That's it. Just say those three words, "I am here." It's a simple, concrete anchor that can help you ground yourself in the present moment. If you're alone or moving towards the exit, just focus on your feet and say "I am here". No thinking, no trying to control the anxiety, just a simple acknowledgment of your presence in this moment.

Patient: I tried it—I said "I am here" and focused on my feet for a few seconds, and yeah, it gave a tiny anchor but my chest still tightened and my attention ripped away. How is that supposed to stop me when I'm already halfway to the door? Be direct: give me one single, idiot‑proof thing I can do in that split second when the panic hits and I'm moving—no extras, exact motion or phrase, and tell me how long to do it. I'm jittery and it's getting harder to follow, so keep it simple.

If you're alone or moving towards the exit, lock eyes with an imaginary partner or a statue. This can help create a sense of connection and calm in the moment. Just lock eyes for 3 seconds.

Patient: I tried it — held my partner’s gaze for three seconds and it calmed me a tiny bit, but my chest's still tight and I wanted to look away the whole time. If I'm alone or already halfway to the door, how exactly is imagining a partner supposed to help — what’s the one instant thing I should do if I can’t hold the gaze or can’t even get a breath?

Just pinch your thumb to your index finger for 1 second.

It gave a tiny jolt but I'm more wired now, my hands are shaking and my attention keeps darting; it feels like another trick that only buys a split second.

Let's practice it now: *nods* Tap your feet on the ground, three times.

Patient: I tapped my feet three times like you said — it gave a tiny hiccup of steadiness for maybe a second, then my chest started racing and I kept walking toward the door. I'm more scattered now and can barely focus, so give me one single, idiot‑proof thing I can do mid‑stride (exact motion or phrase, exactly how long) that I can actually pull off when I'm already moving.

It sounds like the physical anchors are not holding up. Let's try something very basic and automatic. I want you to look down and notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just look down and notice the sensation of your feet, no thinking, no trying to calm down, just noticing. As soon as you feel your mind start to wander, look down and notice the sensation again. That's it. No thinking, no doing, just noticing. As for the phrase, say "step" to yourself, just one word, "step". Repeat it as you walk.

Patient: I tried that—looked down, noticed my feet, and said "step" once, but my attention ripped away and my heart's racing faster; I'm actually more on edge and can barely focus. How is looking down supposed to stop me when I'm already halfway to the door? Give me one single, idiot‑proof thing I can do mid‑stride—exact motion, exactly how long—and we'll try it right now, but I'm not confident it'll work.
