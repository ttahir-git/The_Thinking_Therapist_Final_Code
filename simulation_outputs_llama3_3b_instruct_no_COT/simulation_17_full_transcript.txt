--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been obsessing about my performance as a business owner since the move — my head just automatically jumps to disaster. If I miss one thing, my brain says clients will pull out, employees will quit, revenue will tank, and I'll lose everything. So I end up avoiding the work and procrastinating because the doom feels inevitable.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
So the "doom scenario" feels really close to the surface right now. What would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to imagine yourself succeeding despite your worries about what could go wrong?

Patient: I try, but when I let myself imagine success my mind immediately says it's a setup — like we'll do well for a month, someone will spot a flaw, clients will pull out, competitors will swoop in, staff will quit, and I'll lose everything faster than before. Imagining steady, lasting success just feels completely unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is creating a worst-case narrative even when you're trying to imagine a better one. What if, instead of trying to imagine a specific, far-off goal of success, you focused on just taking the next small step towards your business, without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I try, but even a tiny next step gets hijacked by the disaster story — like if I start that task, someone will find a flaw, a client will leave, others will follow, and everything collapses faster than if I’d done nothing. So I freeze and put it off, even though part of me knows that's not logical. It feels stuck, and I keep thinking maybe I'm just delaying the inevitable.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is caught in a loop of worst-case thinking. Would you be willing to try something different, just for a moment, to see what happens when you break the pattern of catastrophic thinking?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try—though I’m really skeptical. The minute I do something different my brain says it’s a setup: I’ll make a tiny mistake, a client will notice, and then everything spirals faster than if I’d stayed frozen. But fine — let’s try it for a minute and see what happens, even if I’m sure it won’t stick.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step, just a small action, and see what shows up for you. Before you start, can you take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay if your mind starts spinning the worst-case story again – that's just your brain doing its thing?

Patient: I took a deep breath. I can say it's okay if my mind starts spinning—though already my brain's rattling off the chain: one mistake, a client leaves, employees quit, we're sunk. I'm noticing the panic and the urge to freeze, but I can at least name that it's the brain doing its thing.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're getting some space between yourself and the thoughts. Can you observe the panic and the urge to freeze, and notice what happens to your body and emotions when you allow yourself to acknowledge it, without trying to stop or change it?

Patient: When I notice the panic and the urge to freeze, my chest tightens, my stomach knots, and my hands get clammy — it's like my body's primed to run. Emotionally I feel this hot, embarrassing dread, like I'm already failing and everyone will see it, which just funnels me straight into procrastination. I know it's my brain spinning the worst-case movie, but knowing that doesn't stop me from getting totally hooked, so I end up scrolling or busying myself instead of starting the work — what do you want me to try next?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is getting caught up in the emotional experience of the panic. What would happen if, instead of trying to stop or escape the physical sensations, you simply allowed them to be present, without judgment – just as they are?

Patient: When I try that—just let the sensations be—they're still there, my chest tight and stomach knotted, but somehow a little less urgent; it takes a bit of the panic's edge off. The problem is the moment I notice any easing, my brain screams that it's a setup: relax now and you'll miss something, a client will leave, and everything will fall apart. So I can sit with the feelings, but that doom-voice keeps hijacking me and I end up scrolling or fiddling instead of starting the work. What do you want me to do when that voice barges in? I'm honestly feeling stuck.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to catch the calm in the middle of the storm. What if, instead of trying to stop the doom-voice, you simply met it with a sense of curiosity – what if you explored what's driving that voice, without trying to change or fight it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to be curious even though my mind's a fortune-telling machine. When I ask it why it's yelling, it says it's protecting me from humiliation and financial ruin — like if I don't expect the worst I’ll be blindsided and everyone will blame me — and that feels tied to past mistakes, the move, and the responsibility to employees and clients. But the moment I lean in, it launches the whole collapse story (clients leave, revenue tanks, people quit) and I get completely hooked — how do I stay curious without feeding that thing?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a deep-seated fear driving the doom-voice. What if, instead of trying to chase after the thoughts or the curiosity itself, you noticed where it feels like the fear is anchored – the past mistakes, the responsibility – and gently asked yourself if there's a way to bring some understanding or kindness towards that part of yourself that's feeling vulnerable?

Patient: I try to tell that scared part it's okay—that we're human and can survive a mistake—but the fortune-teller voice instantly calls it naïve and screams that being kind will make us careless and everyone will leave, so I get angrier and more distracted. Kindness starts to feel like weakness, and then I wind up scrolling or busying myself instead of doing anything useful. I want to hold that part gently, but I don't know how to do it without feeding the catastrophe movie—what should I try right now?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like kindness is getting tangled up with the fear and the sense of being a control freak. What if, instead of trying to approach that part of yourself with kindness, you simply acknowledged the desire to hold it gently – would that be enough to give you a sense of safety, or is there something else at play here?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is simply acknowledging the desire to be gentle supposed to help? The minute I say "I want to hold this gently," my fortune-teller brain screams that's a cover-up and it predicts someone will spot the slack, clients will bail, staff will quit, and everything collapses faster. Can you give me something concrete—like exact words to say or a small action to do—so I'm not just fumbling while the doom-voice runs the show?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something simple: "I'm willing to stay with this difficult feeling, even if it's uncomfortable, without trying to fix it or push it away." Would you be willing to just say those words out loud, and then pause for a moment, without trying to change or control the thoughts that come next?

Patient: "I'm willing to stay with this difficult feeling, even if it's uncomfortable, without trying to fix it or push it away."

The second I say that, my brain screams it's a setup — relax now and you'll miss something, a client will notice the slack, they'll leave, the team will follow, and we're finished. My chest tightens, my hands tingle, and I can't keep the pause because the catastrophe movie just floods in and I'm grabbed by it. I don't know how to actually hold the pause when that happens — can you give me a concrete sentence to say to the doom-voice or a tiny physical thing I can do right now so I'm not just blown away by the worst-case story?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pause itself is getting hijacked. What if, when the thoughts start flooding in, you simply said to yourself, "Notice the pause. Notice that I'm pausing." Would that small acknowledgment be enough to give you a tiny bit of space?

Patient: I can try that line, but honestly the minute I say anything like that my brain screams it's a setup — relax now and you’ll miss something, a client will notice, they’ll leave, the team will bail, and we're finished. Maybe it would shave a hair off the panic for a second—my chest might unclench a bit—but I still get yanked into the collapse movie. I'm having trouble focusing right now and my hands feel clammy; can you give me a specific short phrase to say to the doom-voice itself, or a tiny physical thing I can do the instant the flood hits so I actually have something to hold onto?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something very small: as soon as the worst-case thoughts start, take a deep breath in and say, "Stop." Can you do that? Just say "Stop" with your voice, without thinking about what comes next, just the word "Stop"?

Patient: Okay—I take a deep breath and say, "Stop."

It loosens for a sliver of a second, then the fortune-teller screams it's a trick—relax now and you'll miss something, clients will notice the slack, they'll leave, the team will bail, and we're finished—my hands are clammy and I can't hold the pause. Can you give me one very short phrase to say directly to that voice, or a tiny physical anchor (like pinch my thumb and forefinger) I can do the instant the flood hits so I actually have something to grab onto?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very small anchor: as soon as the worst-case thoughts start, pinching the tip of your thumb and index finger together – just a light pinch – can that give you a tiny sense of grounding, even if the thoughts are spinning out of control?

Patient: I pinched the tip of my thumb and finger — it actually steadied my hands for a beat, my chest eased a hair. Then the fortune-teller immediately howled it's a setup—relax now and you'll miss something, clients will bail, everything collapses—and I'm back to clammy hands and a racing head. Give me one very short, blunt sentence I can say to that voice while I pinch—something I won't have to invent in the moment—because I can't come up with it when the flood hits.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's use a very short, blunt sentence: "Is this true?"

Patient: I tried saying "Is this true?" while pinching my thumb — it eased for a breath, then the fortune-teller immediately snapped back, "Of course it's true," and replayed the whole collapse movie louder than before. My chest tightened and my head flooded with details of clients leaving and everything falling apart, and I couldn't hold onto the pause. I need a different, very short line to say to that voice (and maybe a stronger physical anchor) because this one just gets drowned out.


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very short, direct line: "No".

Patient: I tried saying "No" while pinching my thumb — there was a tiny, blink-of-relief, then the fortune-teller flipped it into an attack and shame rushed in so hard I froze. I can't shake that shame — it makes me feel naive and worthless and the collapse movie just roars back louder. I need a different, super-short line I can't argue with and a stronger physical anchor I can do instantly — can you give me one blunt word to say and a quick, firm anchor (like stomping or squeezing something cold)?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very short, firm line: "Done".

And for the physical anchor, let's try something more substantial: when the thoughts start flooding in, quickly squeeze a cold drink or a stress ball in your hand, or even give your arm a quick, firm slap (not too hard). The physical sensation can help ground you in the present moment.

Patient: I said "Done," slapped my arm quick and squeezed a cold bottle—there was a tiny snap of relief, my hands steadied for a beat. Then the fortune-teller howled it's a trick, shame hit so hard I froze and the collapse movie came roaring back. I'm really rattled and can't hold it—give me another super-short line and a different grounding action I can do the instant that shame slams me.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try another short, firm line: "End". 

And for the grounding action, let's try a quick, firm touch: when the shame hits, place your hand on your heart or chest, and press down gently, just a small, firm touch.

Patient: I tried "End" and pressed my hand to my chest — there was a hair of relief, then the fortune-teller howled it was a trick and shame slammed me so hard I went rigid and couldn’t move. My head replayed the failure and the collapse movie took over, so the grounding didn’t stick. Can you give me one single, unarguable word I can say when shame hits and a quick, stronger anchor I can do instantly (like three hard stomps, plunging hands in cold water, or squeezing ice) so I actually have something to grab onto in the freeze?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very simple, unarguable word: "Okay".

And for the grounding action, let's try something more dramatic: when the shame hits, drop to the floor or sit down hard, and stay there for a moment. This can help you feel more grounded and connected to your body, even when the thoughts are overwhelming.

Patient: I tried "Okay" and sat down hard—there was a blip of relief, then my fortune-teller brain screamed it's a trick: relax now and you'll miss something, clients will notice, they'll bail, and everything falls apart. Shame hit so hard I froze and a past failure flooded back; my hands are clammy and I can't focus—I'm honestly confused how sitting helps, it just made me feel more embarrassed. I need one single, unarguable word I can't argue with and a stronger, instant anchor—tell me exactly what to do (like "Three stomps, then plunge hands in cold water" step by step) because I'm desperate for something that actually works the second shame slams me.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very simple, unarguable word: "Breathe".

And for the grounding action, I want you to do this exactly: As soon as you feel shame hitting, take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a count of 4, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, saying the word "Breathe" out loud. As you exhale, slap your right hand against your left thigh, three firm slaps. This can help you focus on the physical sensation of the slap and the sound of your own voice, which can help calm the storm.

Patient: I did it—deep breath in, held four, breathed out saying "Breathe," and slapped my right hand against my left thigh three times. For a split second my chest loosened and my hands steadied, but then the fortune-teller howled it was a trick and shame slammed me so hard the collapse movie came roaring back. I'm still rattled, clammy, and fuzzy-headed—I'm struggling to trust any of this works—so tell me one exact, step-by-step thing I can do the instant shame hits, with the exact words to say, because I won't be able to make it up in the moment.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly: As soon as you feel shame hitting, look straight ahead and say to yourself, "Shame, I see you. You are present." Then, quickly, place your right hand on your heart, and slap your left thigh three times.

Patient: I did it — looked ahead, said "Shame, I see you. You are present," put my right hand on my heart and slapped my left thigh three times. For a split second my chest loosened, then the fortune-teller screamed it was a trick and shame slammed me so hard I went rigid; my hands are clammy and my head's fuzzy. I can't make something up in that moment — give me one single word and one exact physical move, step-by-step, that I can do the instant shame hits so I actually have something to grab onto.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly: As soon as you feel shame hitting, say to yourself, "Safe." Then, quickly, grasp your right wrist with your left hand, and pull it down hard for a count of 3.

Patient: I did it — I said "Safe" and pulled my wrist down for three. It loosens for a breath, my hands steady a hair, then my fortune-teller screams it's a trick: relax now and you'll miss something, clients will notice, they'll leave, the team will bail, and we're finished. Shame hit so hard I went rigid and that old failure memory flooded in; I feel embarrassed, frantic, and furious that nothing seems to stick. I need one single word I literally can't argue with and an exact, step-by-step physical move I can do automatically when shame slams me — spell it out like "1) X, 2) Y, 3) Z" because in the moment I can't think.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly:

1) Say to yourself, "Safe".
2) Look down at your feet.
3) Take a small, slow step back.

This can help you focus on your physical body and create some space between yourself and the shame.

Patient: I did it — said “Safe,” looked at my feet, and took a small step back. For a split second my chest loosened, then the fortune-teller screamed it was a trick, shame slammed me so hard I froze, and that old failure memory flooded everything — my hands are clammy and I can't focus. I'm confused and frustrated — I don't get why nothing really sticks — so please give me one single, unarguable word and a precise 3-step physical routine written like: "1) say 'X', 2) do Y (how many times/for how long), 3) hold Z seconds," because in the moment I won't be able to make it up.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly:

1) Say "Enough".
2) Make a fist with your hand and hold it for 5 seconds.
3) Release the fist and let your hand fall to your side.

This can help you acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm and release some tension.

Patient: I did it — said "Enough," made a fist for five seconds, and let it drop. It eased for a hair, then the fortune-teller screamed it was a trick and shame slammed me so hard I froze; my chest tightened, hands went clammy, and that old failure replayed loud. I'm frustrated and rattled — in the moment I blank, so please give me one single, unarguable word and an exact 3-step routine like "1) say 'X', 2) do Y (how many times/for how long), 3) hold Z seconds" because I need something I can do automatically when the shame hits.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly:

1) Say "Breathe".
2) Pinch the bridge of your nose shut for 2 seconds.
3) Release your pinch and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

This can help calm your nervous system and create a sense of stability.

Patient: I did it — said "Breathe," pinched the bridge for two seconds, then breathed slowly. It took the edge off for a heartbeat, then the fortune-teller howled it was a trick and shame slammed me so hard I froze; my chest tightened, hands went clammy, and my head filled with that old failure. I'm really rattled and blank in the moment—please give me one single, unarguable word and an exact 3-step routine written like: "1) say 'X', 2) do Y (how many times/for how long), 3) hold Z seconds" because I won't be able to invent anything when the shame hits.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try this exactly:

1) Say "Now".
2) Tap your right hand on the floor three times.
3) Look up and say "Now".

This can help bring you back to the present moment and create a sense of clarity.

Patient: I did it — said "Now," tapped my right hand on the floor three times, looked up and said "Now." For a sliver of a second the fuzz cleared and my chest eased, then the fortune-teller howled it was a trick, shame slammed me, and my hands went clammy and my head filled with that collapse movie. I'm frustrated and stuck — please give me one single, unarguable word and an exact 3-step routine like "1) say 'X', 2) do Y (how many times/for how long), 3) hold Z seconds" because when shame hits I blank and need something I can do automatically.
