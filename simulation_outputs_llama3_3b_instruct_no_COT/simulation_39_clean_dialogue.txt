Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this cognitive loop where my identity feels calcified around being a business owner, and I can't really see what matters beyond that role. Since starting this demanding new program my OCD's gotten louder, and instead of feeling the unease I find myself pontificating about attachment and meaning to keep some distance. So yeah, I'm directionless and tend to intellectualize everything rather than actually sit with how uncomfortable that feels.

Therapist: It sounds like being stuck in this cognitive loop about your identity as a business owner has created a bit of a Catch-22. You're trying to cope with the discomfort by analyzing and intellectualizing, but that's only made things worse. 

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in this state, where you're feeling directionless, and you're trying to sit with the discomfort of that feeling? What would you say is the most uncomfortable part of not being able to see what matters beyond your business ownership?

Patient: When I'm in that state my brain goes into overdrive—cataloguing contingencies, running hypothetical cost–benefit analyses, riffing on existential frameworks—so I stay in abstraction rather than noticing the physical stuff like my chest tightening or that hollow quiet. The most uncomfortable part is this erosion of a coherent narrative about who I am; there's this diffuse fear that if I'm not the business owner I become negligible or unmoored, and that ambiguity feels intolerable. I guess it's sort of humiliating to say I can't sit with that not-knowing, so I pile on theories about meaning to avoid the actual fear and sadness beneath it.

Therapist: The discomfort of ambiguity and the fear of being unmoored feels like a very real and pressing concern for you right now. It's interesting that you mention the erosion of a coherent narrative about who you are – it's as if the uncertainty about your identity is itself a source of anxiety.

Can you explore what would happen if you were to let go of the need to pile on theories and just notice the physical sensations in your body, like the chest tightening, without trying to intellectualize or analyze them? What would that feel like, and what might you experience if you allowed yourself to simply be with that sensation?

Patient: If I actually tried to drop the scaffolding of theory and sit with the chest tightness, at first it feels like a dull, oscillating pressure under the sternum and a sort of hollowing out that creeps into my throat and shoulders. Letting it be is destabilizing—my breath shortens and my mind reflexively starts drafting contingency plans or philosophical frameworks instead of naming the feeling, which is when I default to talking about attachment styles rather than saying "I'm scared." Honestly, there's this low-grade shame underneath, like being exposed as less competent, and that shame seems to recruit the intellect as a defensive perimeter. I'm trying to stay with it now, but it's getting a bit much—can we slow down so you can guide me through noticing the breath without me turning it into another lecture?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of discomfort and even shame, which is making it even harder to simply acknowledge and name the physical sensations. The reflexive tendency to draft contingency plans or intellectual frameworks is a strong one – it's as if your mind is trying to protect you from the vulnerability of not knowing what's coming next.

Let's try something small. Can you bring your attention to your breath, just for one more inhale and exhale, without trying to do anything with it? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without labeling it or trying to change it in any way. We can stay with this simple, observational tone, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. I took one slow inhale and exhale; my breath felt shallow and there's a tightening across my chest and a little catch in my throat. My reflex is already to narrativize it—'that's sympathetic activation, interesting baseline shift'—instead of just saying I'm scared, so can you guide me through another breath or two with a pause so I don't intellectualize it away?

Therapist: Let's pause for another inhale and exhale, just the two of us sitting with the breath. When you take the next breath in, I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in, without trying to label it or analyze it. Just observe the sensation, and see if we can slow down the narrative voice that's already starting to creep in.

Patient: Okay—I breathed in and out; the air felt cool at my nostrils, my ribs lifted a bit, and the chest tightness softened just a notch. My reflex is already to categorize it as 'sympathetic activation shifting' and start weaving theories, but there's also this blunt, hot pinch in the mid-chest that I'm tempted to call fear of being insignificant. Can we do another breath or two together so I don't slip back into commentary?

Therapist: Let's focus on the breath again. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, just the sensation of the hot pinch. Don't try to label it, don't try to analyze it – just notice it as it is. And when you exhale, try to maintain that simple, observational tone. We can stay with this for just two more breaths, and see what happens.

Patient: I did the two breaths — the pinch in my mid-chest softened a touch and there was this strange warmth behind my eyes, like something wanted to leak out. My brain instantly wants to reframe it as "autonomic down-regulation" and a pretty clear example of experiential avoidance, but underneath that analysis there's a small, humiliating sense of being insignificant. Can we keep doing this a bit longer? I keep worrying I'll slide back into commentary unless you keep guiding me.

Therapist: Let's keep going. Take another inhale, and as you do, bring your attention to the warmth behind your eyes, just the sensation of it. Don't try to analyze it or push it away – just notice it. And when you exhale, try to stay with that sensation, without trying to label it or intellectualize it. See what happens.

Patient: I took that inhale— the warmth behind my eyes pooled into a kind of dampness and there’s this vague pressure in my throat, like something wants to come out. My reflex is to pathologize it—label it a parasympathetic rebound after chronic sympathetic arousal—but underneath that is this raw, embarrassing ache that feels like smallness. It's getting a bit overwhelming; can we slow down and do one more breath together, and maybe you can help me name it without me turning it into another lecture?

Therapist: Let's slow down. Take one more breath with me. As you inhale, notice the sensation in your throat, just the pressure, without trying to analyze it or label it. And when you exhale, try to maintain that simple attention. I want to make sure you know that I'm not looking for you to "get" or "fix" anything. I'm just here to witness this moment with you, and help you find a way to stay with it. Can you just breathe with me for one more inhale and exhale?

Patient: I breathed with you—the throat pressure eased a little and the warmth behind my eyes felt like it might spill. My reflex is already to reframe it as "existential smallness" or some autonomic rebound, but underneath that is a raw, humiliating shame I'm actually noticing. I'm getting a bit flooded; can we keep going but slower—maybe two more breaths where you cue me so I don't slide back into commentary?

Therapist: Let's take another breath together. When you're ready, inhale, and I'll say "Notice". When you exhale, I'll say "Notice". Let's just focus on the sensation, no labels, no analysis. Just notice. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Yes—I'm ready. I inhaled and felt cool air at my nostrils and my ribs lift; on the exhale the throat pressure eased a little but the warmth behind my eyes stayed. My reflex is already to call this an "autonomic adjustment," and I'm trying not to—could we do two more slow breaths with your cues so I don't slip back into analysis?

Therapist: Take another inhale, and I'll say "Notice". When you exhale, I'll say "Notice".

Patient: I inhaled when you said "Notice"—cool air at the nostrils, ribs lifting—but my chest tightened and my mind immediately leapt into a flurry of obligations and hypothetical scenarios. On the exhale with your "Notice" the throat eased a bit but my heart's a little louder and I'm jittery, more distracted than before; it's harder to stay with the sensation without my head hijacking it. Can we do another slow one with your cue? I need the anchor—I'm worried I'll slip back into analysis if I try alone.

Therapist: Take another inhale, and I'll say "Notice". When you exhale, I'll say "Notice".

Patient: I inhaled when you said "Notice"—cool at the nostrils, ribs lifting, chest pinching. On the exhale the throat eased but my mind immediately jumped to a frantic to-do list and worst-case threads, my heart feels louder and my hands are a bit tingly, so it's really hard to stay with just the sensation. Can we slow it even more—one more slow inhale and a long exhale with a longer pause so I don't slip back into analysis?

Therapist: Let's take a deep, slow breath in, and I'll say "Notice". As you exhale, I'll say nothing. Just pause, and stay with the sensation. Let the breath be the only thing you notice.

Patient: I inhaled—cool at the nostrils, ribs lifting—and on the exhale I tried to hold the pause, but my mind immediately catapulted into an inventory of obligations and worst-case scenarios; my heart's louder and my hands are tingly. It's getting really hard to keep the breath as the only thing without narrating it—could you give me a longer silent pause after the exhale or a gentle prompt so I don't immediately slip back into planning and analysis?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in... just breathe in...

Patient: I took that deep breath in—cool at the nostrils, ribs lifting—and on the exhale I tried to hold the pause but my mind immediately splintered into obligations and worst-case scenarios; my heart's louder and my hands are a bit tingly. My reflex is to label it as sympathetic arousal and start theorizing, but underneath that is just plain, prickly anxiety. Can you give a longer silent pause after the exhale—or count slowly to four—so I have a steady anchor and don't slip straight back into analysis?

Therapist: ...1... 2... 3... 4...

Patient: That counting actually helped a hair—the pause gave the chest pinch room to unclench a bit—but my mind immediately ricocheted into a frantic inventory of obligations, cashflow forecasts, and worst-case threads; my heart's louder and my fingers are tingly. I can already frame it as acute sympathetic arousal fused to catastrophic narrative construction (which is true), but underneath that analysis is just plain, prickly alarm and a jittery, distracted feeling I'm struggling to tolerate. Could we slow even further and do one breath at a time with a longer pause, or try a simple grounding cue like naming one thing I can see and one thing I can feel, so I have a tangible anchor instead of my head hijacking it?

Therapist: Let's take a breath in, and when you're ready, I'll say "Here is something you can see..." and then pause. When you're ready, I'll say "Here is something you can feel..." and pause again. We'll take it one breath at a time.

Patient: Okay—here’s something I can see: the strip of sunlight on the corner of my desk and that chipped coffee mug I never seem to throw out. Here’s something I can feel: the tingling in my fingertips and that persistent pinch in my chest. I'm already itching to reframe it as sympathetic arousal and OCD-driven catastrophic looping, but underneath that jargon it's just plain, prickly anxiety and a jittery restlessness. Can we do another slow inhale-exhale with a longer pause and your cue so I don't immediately slide back into analysis?

Therapist: Take another breath in... 

( pause )

And when you're ready, take another breath out, and I'll say "Here is something you can see..."

Patient: I exhaled—here’s something I can see: the strip of sunlight on my desk and that chipped coffee mug I keep meaning to toss. Here’s something I can feel: tingling in my fingertips and that hollow, pinching pressure in my chest, while my brain immediately pivots to contingency plans and catastrophic narratives, which makes it hard to stay present. Can we do another slow breath with a longer pause and your cue? I need the anchor—I'm jittery and keep slipping back into analysis.

Therapist: Take another breath in... 

( pause )

And when you're ready, I'll say "Here is something you can touch."

Patient: My hand's on that chipped mug—it's cool and a little gritty under my fingertips, the rim uneven where the glaze's worn off. My hands are jittery and, instead of calming, the touch seems to amplify a hot spike of shame and frustration I can't quite name—I catch myself already dressing it up as "self-referential evaluative activation" to keep distance. It's pulling me into planning and blame instead of grounding; can we stay with one slow touch-breath cycle at a time, with longer pauses, so I don't immediately spiral into analysis?

Therapist: Take another breath in... 

( pause )

Just rest your hand on the mug, and focus on the sensation of it under your fingertips, the coolness, the grittiness.

Patient: The mug feels cool and a little gritty under my fingertips, the rim uneven where the glaze's worn off. Touching it seems to amplify a hot spike of shame and irritation—my face warms, my breath quickens, and my mind immediately starts drafting a narrative about past failures (I'm tempted to reframe it as "self-referential evaluative activation," which is ridiculous and also exactly what I do). It's raw and humiliating and it makes me want to fix it by planning or explaining away. Can we slow to one slow inhale and a long exhale with a five‑second pause, and you cue me through it so I don't immediately slide into analysis?

Therapist: Take a slow, deep inhale... 

( pause, 5 seconds )

Now, exhale slowly...

Patient: I exhaled slowly—the chest pinch loosened a little and there’s a warm sting behind my eyes, my throat still tight and my heart a bit louder. My brain reflexively wants to translate it into "autonomic rebound" and cognitive avoidance, but under that jargon is a hot, humiliating shame and frustration that spikes hard and makes me jittery and distracted. I'm getting a bit flooded—can we keep going with one slow breath at a time, with a longer pause and a simple tether (like naming one neutral object and one sensation) so I don't immediately slip back into analysis?

Therapist: Take another slow, deep breath in... 

( pause, 5 seconds )

When you're ready, I'll say "Here is something neutral to look at" and "Here is the sensation in your chest".

Patient: Here’s something neutral to look at: the chipped coffee mug and that thin strip of sunlight on the corner of my desk.  
Here’s the sensation in my chest: a tight, pinching pressure that sometimes flares into a hot, humiliating sting while my heart kicks up and my hands go tingly—my mind immediately ricochets into obligations and worst‑case scenarios and wants to reframe it away. Can we do one slow breath at a time with your cue and a longer pause? I need the tether so I don’t slide straight back into analysis.

Therapist: Take another slow, deep breath in... 

( pause, 7 seconds )

Now, exhale slowly...

Patient: I exhaled slowly—the chest pinch eased a touch but there's still this hot sting behind my eyes, my heart's louder and my hands are tingly. My brain reflexively wants to annotate everything—"autonomic downshift, sympathetic spikes, OCD-driven safety behaviors"—which is my usual intellectual armor, but under that language is a raw, red shame about past screw‑ups that's flaring and making me jittery and defensive. I really need you to keep pacing this with me; can we do two more very slow breaths with long pauses—maybe ten seconds—and could you cue me with "Notice" on the inhale and "Name" on the exhale so I actually say "shame" instead of immediately re-describing or analyzing it? I'm worried I'll default to commentary unless you keep guiding me.

Therapist: Take another slow, deep breath in... 

(NOTICE)

Now, exhale slowly... 

(NAME)

(Pause, 10 seconds)

When you're ready, we can continue.

Patient: Notice—the inhale felt cool, ribs lifted. Name—shame. There, saying "shame" made it a hot, humiliating knot in my chest and now I'm jittery, my thoughts scattering into obligations and explanations like a reflex. I can already hear the tiny voice wanting to recast it as "self‑evaluative affect" to dodge it, so could we do another very slow one with a long pause and you prompt me to actually say "shame" aloud on the exhale? I'm worried I'll intellectualize unless you keep pacing me.

Therapist: Notice—the cool air at your nostrils.

Name—shame.

(Pause, 12 seconds)

When you're ready, I'll say "Notice" again on the inhale, and we'll continue.

Patient: I'm ready. Notice—the cool air at my nostrils, ribs lifting. Name—shame. Saying it out loud turns it into a hot, humiliating knot and my mind instantly ricochets into blame, reparative plans, and explanations; my heart's louder and my hands are tingly, so I'm jittery and distracted. Can we do another very slow breath with a longer pause and you prompt me to actually say "shame" again on the exhale so I don't immediately intellectualize it away?

Therapist: Notice—the cool air at your nostrils, ribs lifting.

(Pause, 15 seconds)

Now, exhale... 

(I'll say "Shame" instead of waiting for you to) Shame.

Patient: Okay—when you said "shame" it folded into a hot, humiliating knot in my sternum; my face warmed, my throat tightened, my heart sped and my hands went tingly. My reflex is to re-label it as "self‑referential evaluative activation" to keep distance, but right now it just feels raw and embarrassing and I'm jittery. Can we do one more very slow inhale with you cueing "Notice" and then a long exhale where I actually say "shame" out loud—please give a long pause afterward so I don't immediately recast it into analysis?

Therapist: Notice—the sensation in your chest.

(Pause, 20 seconds)

Now, exhale... 

Say "shame" out loud.

Patient: Shame.

Saying it out loud folds into a hot, humiliating knot in my sternum—face flushes, throat tightens, heart pounds, hands tingle—and my brain reflexively wants to recast it as "self‑referential evaluative activation" to keep distance. It's getting a bit overwhelming and my head's already drafting justifications and to‑do lists to fix it. Can we do another very slow inhale with a long pause and your cue so I can stay with the sensation, and maybe after that you can ask me what this shame might be wanting (instead of letting me intellectualize it away)?

Therapist: Notice—the sensation in your chest.

(Pause, 25 seconds)

Now, as you're with this sensation of shame, what do you think it might be wanting, beneath all the thoughts and justifications that are already starting to emerge?

Patient: I think underneath it the shame wants containment and recalibration—like some concrete reassurance that I'm still enough beyond the business-owner role, permission to be fallible, and to be seen without being judged. Saying that out loud makes me flush and jittery and my brain reflexively varnishes it into theory to avoid feeling the rawness. Can we slow down—maybe you ask me how I'd try to comfort that part of me, because I'm already starting to draft fixes instead of actually doing it?
