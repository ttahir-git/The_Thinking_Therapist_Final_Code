Patient: Lately I’ve been getting angrier and more frustrated than I used to, mostly around stuff that’s come up because of the move — little things that set me off more than they should. I’m pragmatic and organized by nature, but grief and the chaos of relocating have made me short with people and I snap before I think. I’m skeptical this will help — I’ve tried things before and they didn’t work, so how is this supposed to help?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're feeling stuck and skeptical, which can make it tough to open up. It's completely normal to be struggling with the transition. Before we explore this further, I want to acknowledge that you're recognizing how you've been feeling and willing to share that with me – that takes courage. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with me, just for a moment, to see if it might help you feel more connected to what's driving your anger and frustration?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it, though I’m skeptical it’ll do anything. How is that supposed to help? Tell me what you want me to do.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'd like you to pay attention to your physical sensations in your body, particularly in your chest and stomach, whenever you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated. When you notice any physical sensations, can you allow them to be there, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: Okay — I'm paying attention. There's a tight band across my chest, a knot in my stomach, my breath's shallow and my jaw's clenched; I'm letting those be without trying to fix them, but it just feels agitating and makes me want to do something about it. How is noticing this supposed to stop me from snapping at people?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those sensations can feel overwhelming and agitating. It sounds like you're already noticing the experience of your body in the moment, which is a good start. Now, I want to explore what might happen if you were to allow these sensations to be present without acting on them – what if, for just a brief moment, you simply allowed the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach, the shallow breath, and the clenched jaw to just be there, without trying to change them?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to let it be — the tightness's still there, maybe a hair less sharp but my jaw's clenched and my head's full of to-do lists and resentments about the move. How is just sitting with that supposed to stop me from snapping when someone makes an offhand comment about my boxes or moves things without asking? I've done breathing and mindfulness before and it didn't help much, so if this is different, tell me what actually changes.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more direct solution to stop snapping, whereas what we've been exploring so far is more about acknowledging and tolerating the experience of your physical sensations and emotions. I'm not looking to help you change the external situation or stop people from making comments that trigger you. Instead, I'm helping you develop a sense of curiosity and openness to the present moment, including the thoughts and feelings that arise. Can you think of a situation where you'd be more willing to pause and take a breath before reacting, without needing to change the outcome or make the other person change their behavior?

Patient: Yeah — like when my daughter or one of the neighbors starts moving my boxes or makes a snide comment about how I’ve arranged things since the move. I usually snap straight away, but I could try pausing for a breath and reminding myself it’s not worth the fight. Still — I’ve done the breathing stuff before and it didn’t really stop the rush of irritation, so how is one breath supposed to change that?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting closer to understanding that it's not just about taking a breath, but about being willing to pause and choose a different response. Let's try a different approach. What would be the value, the underlying reason, that makes you want to react in that instant when someone makes a comment or starts moving your boxes? Is it a desire to protect yourself, to assert control, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's about control and respect — I want my things left alone and for people to treat this move seriously, not like it's a joke. There's also a fear of losing independence; after losing so much, snapping feels like the only way to assert myself. But even if I see that, how is knowing my reasons supposed to stop me from immediately reacting when someone crosses a line?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those are valuable insights. Now, I'd like to explore what would happen if, instead of trying to assert control or prove a point, you could make room for the value of independence and respect to show up in a different way. What if, when someone makes a comment that feels like a cross, you could allow the feeling of frustration to arise, and then, instead of acting on it, simply acknowledge it and say something like, "I'd appreciate it if you didn't touch my boxes" or "That's not okay, can we not do that"? Would that be a more aligned response with your values of respect and independence?

Patient: Yeah — that is what I'd want, in theory: to state my boundary calmly instead of snapping. But how is saying that supposed to stop the first hot surge — I've asked nicely before and they just keep doing it or make me out to be the problem. I can try a short, firm line like "Please don't move my boxes," but I'm worried it'll be ignored and I'll end up angrier; what do I do if that happens?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're wondering what happens when the other person doesn't respond or ignores your boundary. What if, instead of trying to control the other person's response, you focused on your own ability to show up and assert yourself, even if they don't? Would it be helpful to imagine that saying "Please don't move my boxes" is not about changing the other person, but about taking care of yourself and your space, and that you can do that regardless of their reaction?

Patient: Maybe — I can see the point about it being for me, not them. But I've said my boundaries before and they either shrug or make me the problem, so how is acting like that supposed to stop the first hot surge that makes me snap before I can even speak? I need something concrete for that moment — what do I actually do when the surge hits and then if they ignore me after I say it?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete action to take when the surge hits. Let's try a small, immediate shift in language when you feel that surge. What if, instead of trying to think of a response or a boundary, you simply acknowledge the feeling: "Ah, I'm feeling frustrated right now" or "I'm getting upset"? Would that tiny shift in acknowledging the feeling, rather than trying to act on it, give you a brief pause, and allow you to respond in a more thoughtful way?

Patient: I can try that — saying "I'm feeling frustrated" might give me a tiny pause, but how is half a second supposed to stop the surge? I've labeled feelings before and it just made me fume quieter. Fine, I'll try it, but if I say a boundary and they ignore me, what am I actually supposed to do then — walk away, escalate, or keep letting them show disrespect? I'm tired of this repeating and need something practical that actually works.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more concrete action to take when the boundary is ignored. What if, instead of trying to change the other person's behavior, you simply take care of yourself in that moment? You could take a small step back, breathe, and say, "I've communicated my boundary. Now, I need some space to think about how to handle this situation further." Would that allow you to disengage from the situation without escalating or giving in to further frustration?

Patient: Okay — in theory that makes sense: say the boundary, step back, take space. But how is that supposed to help? Last time I stepped away I just sat replaying it like an audit, feeling like I’d blown it, so walking off leaves me simmering and ashamed. If I do what you suggest and they ignore it, what concrete steps do I take in the moment and afterward to stop ruminating and actually keep my space next time?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that stepping back and taking space will lead to rumination and self-blame. What if, instead of trying to stop ruminating, you focus on taking a small, grounded action that allows you to feel more connected to your body and the present moment? For example, you could take a few deep breaths, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or engage your senses with your surroundings. Would that help you shift from replaying the situation to being more present and focused on the current moment?

Patient: Fine — I get the grounding idea, but how is that supposed to stop the replay? Last time I walked away I just sat there auditing myself, feeling ashamed and like I’d blown it, which only makes me angrier. Tell me concrete things to do in the moment that aren’t just “breathe” — a one-sentence line I can use, a physical action to break the surge, and a clear follow-up step to stop ruminating afterward (I tried “worry time” and it just made it worse). If you can give me something specific to practice now, I’ll try it, but I’m skeptical.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something a bit different. What if, when you feel the surge, you say to yourself, "I can only react, not respond"? This is a simple sentence that acknowledges your emotional state without trying to control the situation or change the other person's behavior. Immediately after, take 10 steps forward, with your feet on the ground, and focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor. This can help you ground yourself in the present moment and break the cycle of reaction.

Patient: Alright — I'll try it, even if I think it sounds a bit gimmicky. I said to myself, "I can only react, not respond," then walked ten steps across the room paying attention to my feet — it did dull the immediate snap a little, gave me a fraction of space, but it also pulled up that hot shame and I started replaying everything like I’d failed. If I'm out in public or can't take ten steps, what's a substitute action that's just as concrete? And after I walk away, what exactly should I do to stop the replaying — give me a short, practical follow-up (not "worry time") I can use every time, or tell me how this actually changes anything long-term.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're noticing that the shame and self-blame are still arising, even after taking a small break. When you're in a situation where you can't take ten steps or need a quicker response, what if, when you feel the surge, you simply say to yourself, "I'm taking a pause"? This acknowledges your emotional state without judgment. Immediately after, you can say to yourself, "My body will move again in a minute." This simple statement acknowledges that you're not stuck in the current moment and that your body will continue to function and respond. It's a gentle way to remind yourself that you're not frozen and that the situation will pass. This can help shift your focus away from replaying the situation and towards the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I tried saying "I'm taking a pause" and "My body will move again in a minute" and it bought me a hair of space, but my chest tightened and my head went straight to that shameful replay of the last time I lost it; I'm feeling jumpy and my hands are a bit shaky. How is that supposed to stop the spiral in public when I can’t even whisper a sentence? Give me a single-word mantra or a tiny, private physical action (something discrete like thumb pressure or a finger squeeze) I can do anywhere that actually breaks the surge, plus a concrete five-minute follow-up I can use afterward to stop replaying — not "worry time" but something that actually changes the loop. And if I say a boundary and they ignore it, what do I do in that moment that isn't just walking away to sit and stew?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more immediate, portable tool to help you break the surge. What if, when you feel the tightness in your chest, you press the base of your thumb against the base of your index finger? This gentle, subtle physical action can help interrupt the nervous system's automatic reaction and create a brief pause. As for stopping the replay, here's a simple, concrete 5-minute follow-up: take 5 slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change or analyze anything. This can help calm the nervous system and bring your attention back to the present moment.

Patient: I tried the thumb-press and the five breaths — it gave me a sliver of space, but my chest’s still tight and my head immediately went into that shame loop; I’m jumpy and my hands are shaky. Give me a single-word mantra and an even more discrete physical action I can do anywhere (thumb-press isn’t always possible), plus a concrete five-minute follow-up that actually interrupts the replaying — and tell me what to do in the moment if someone ignores my boundary that isn’t just “walk away and stew.” Also, how is any of this supposed to actually change things long-term?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a more subtle and portable tool. What if, when you feel the surge, you press the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth? This simple physical action can help interrupt the nervous system's automatic reaction. 

As for stopping the replay, here's a new 5-minute follow-up: bring your attention to your five senses, one at a time. Start with what you see, noticing the colors, shapes, and textures around you. Then move to sounds, noticing the different frequencies and volumes. Next, focus on the sensations in your body, noticing where you feel tension or relaxation. After that, explore the scents around you, noticing what you smell. Finally, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, noticing the weight and pressure. This can help shift your attention away from the replaying situation and ground you in the present moment.

If someone ignores your boundary, in that moment, you can say, "I've communicated my needs. I'm not going to engage in a conversation that doesn't feel respectful." You can then pause, take a deep breath, and walk away without looking back. This allows you to maintain your boundary while also setting a clear expectation for how you'll behave if it's not respected.

Patient: Alright — I tried the tongue-on-roof trick and the five-sense thing; it bought me a sliver of space but my chest’s tight, I’m jumpy and my hands are shaking, and it drags up that hot shame like I’ve failed again. I need a single-word mantra I can mouth silently, an even more discreet physical cue I can do with my fingers in my pocket, and a concrete five-minute follow-up that actually breaks the replay (not “worry time” — something practical, like a short written anchor plus a tiny task). And be straight with me: how is any of this supposed to actually change things long-term?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still struggling with the shame and self-blame. 

What if, when you feel the surge, you mouth the word "okay" silently to yourself? This simple word can help acknowledge the emotion and create a small pause.

For a discreet physical cue, what if you tap your ring finger against your thumb for a quick, light touch? This can be a subtle signal to your nervous system that you're taking control.

For a 5-minute follow-up, here's a practical exercise: write down three things you appreciate about your life right now, no matter how small they may seem. This can help shift your focus away from the replaying situation and cultivate a more positive, present-moment awareness. 

As for long-term change, it's not about eliminating the triggers or the emotions entirely, but about developing a new relationship with them. By practicing these techniques, you're building awareness, acceptance, and self-compassion, which can lead to greater emotional resilience and reduced reactivity over time. It's not about achieving a specific outcome or fixing the situation, but about developing a more flexible and adaptive response to challenging emotions.

Patient: I tried the “okay” and the ring-finger tap — it buys a sliver of space, but the shame hits like that old failure all over again and my hands go shaky. If I can’t do a tap in public, is carrying a small coin or smooth stone to rub in my pocket a legit substitute? 

For the five-minute follow-up: what if I write one short anchor sentence (“I handled that as best I could”) and then do a tiny, concrete task—like sort three receipts or staple three papers—something that uses my head and hands so I stop replaying. Will that actually break the loop, or am I just distracting myself briefly? Be straight with me: how do these tiny moves actually change things long-term, because I’m tired of tricks that only quiet it for ten minutes.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Carrying a small coin or smooth stone to rub in your pocket can be a useful substitute for a discreet physical cue. 

As for the five-minute follow-up, writing a short anchor sentence and doing a tiny task can be a good approach. The goal is not to distract yourself, but to use the task to refocus your attention on the present moment. By engaging your hands and head in a concrete activity, you're creating a new neural pathway that can help interrupt the replaying loop. This technique is called " implementation intentions" - it helps you link a specific action to a specific emotional response, making it more automatic and less reactive.

As for long-term change, these tiny moves don't magically eliminate triggers or emotions, but they do help you develop a new relationship with them. By practicing these techniques regularly, you're building cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation, and self-compassion. This can lead to reduced reactivity, increased emotional resilience, and improved relationships. The key is to view these techniques as a long-term process, not a quick fix. With consistent practice, you can develop a more adaptive and compassionate response to challenging emotions, which can lead to greater overall well-being.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you're saying rubbing a coin, a one-sentence anchor and a tiny task will actually rewire how I react? I'm feeling jumpy and my chest's tight just thinking about it, and part of me is ashamed like I've failed before, so I keep circling back to that. Fine, be concrete: give me a 4-week plan I can actually follow (what to do, when, for how long each day), measurable signs that it's working, and a clear in-the-moment script for when someone ignores my boundary that isn't just "walk away and stew." Also tell me what to do if I miss a day or it doesn't seem to help — I don't want vague reassurance, I want practical steps that account for real life.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Here's a 4-week plan to help you develop the skills we've discussed:

**Week 1:**

* Day 1-2: Practice the "okay" mantra and ring-finger tap for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.
* Day 3-4: Add a short, discreet physical cue (e.g., a small pinch on the skin of your hand or a gentle squeeze of your thumb) and write a 1-sentence anchor (e.g., "I'm doing the best I can") for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.
* Day 5-7: Practice the 5-sense exercise (breathing, focusing on your feet, noticing sounds, exploring scents, and paying attention to your body) for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.

**Week 2-3:**

* Continue the 5-sense exercise for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.
* Start practicing the tiny task (e.g., sorting 3 receipts or stapling 3 papers) for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.
* When someone ignores your boundary, use the following script: "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need some space. Can we find a better time to talk about [topic]?"

**Week 4:**

* Practice the 5-sense exercise and the tiny task for 5 minutes, 3 times a day.
* When someone ignores your boundary, use the script from Week 2.
* Introduce the coin or smooth stone as a discreet physical cue for the ring-finger tap.

**Measurable signs that it's working:**

* You notice a decrease in the frequency or intensity of the surge when someone ignores your boundary.
* You feel more calm and composed in situations that previously triggered strong reactions.
* You're able to focus on the present moment and respond thoughtfully, rather than reacting impulsively.

**What to do if you miss a day or it doesn't seem to help:**

* Don't get discouraged! It's normal for progress to be slow and inconsistent.
* Take a deep breath and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can.
* Get back to the practice as soon as possible and try to identify what might have been an obstacle (e.g., stress, fatigue, or distraction).
* Consider reaching out to a friend, family member, or therapist for support and guidance.

Remember, the goal is not to achieve a specific outcome, but to develop a more flexible and compassionate

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm feeling jumpy, my chest's tight, and part of me is circling that same shame like I failed again. Look, I'm an accountant: give me numbers and steps I can follow instead of cheerleading.

So be blunt and concrete: set measurable targets (e.g., reduce snaps from X/week to Y/week, or drop peak intensity from 8 to 5 on a 0–10 scale) and tell me how you'll check them. Give me a real in-the-moment script for when someone ignores my boundary — one sentence to say, one immediate, enforceable action I can take right then (not just “walk away”), and a clear non-humiliating consequence I can actually follow through on. If I miss a day or it's not helping by week 2, give me a stepwise troubleshooting ladder (step 1, 2, 3) — no vague pep talk. 

Also: when I'm out in public and can't fidget or whisper, give me a single-word mantra, a pocket cue (coin or stone OK?), and a 60-second action that actually breaks the surge. I'm skeptical, but I'll try this if you make it practical and measurable — convince me it isn't just another ten-minute distraction.

Therapist Answer:
I'll provide a more structured approach.

**Measurable Targets:**

* Reduce snaps from 5/week to 3/week (30% decrease)
* Drop peak intensity from 8/10 to 5/10 (a 25% decrease)
* Increase time between snaps to 2 minutes (average time between snaps)

**Checking Progress:**

* Record the number of snaps each day in a journal or spreadsheet
* Track peak intensity using a 0-10 scale (e.g., 1-10, where 10 is maximum intensity)
* Use a habit-tracking app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull) to monitor progress

**Script for Ignoring Boundaries:**

In the moment, say: "I've communicated my needs. I will not engage in further discussion until we find a respectful conversation."

Immediate action: Take 30 seconds to breathe deeply and focus on your five senses (as we discussed earlier).

Non-humiliating consequence: If the person continues to ignore your boundary, you will end the conversation and change the subject to a more neutral or lighthearted topic.

**Troubleshooting Ladder (if you miss a day or it's not helping by Week 2):**

1. **Step 1:** Re-check your understanding of the techniques and exercises. Are you following the steps as instructed? Are you feeling overwhelmed or distracted?
2. **Step 2:** Re-engage with the techniques for 10 minutes, focusing on the present moment. If you're still struggling, try to identify potential obstacles (e.g., stress, fatigue, or emotions).
3. **Step 3:** Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for support and guidance. They can help you brainstorm strategies, provide accountability, and offer new perspectives.

**Public-Specific Script, Pocket Cue, and 60-Second Action:**

Single-word mantra: "Breathe"

Pocket cue: Small, smooth stone

60-second action: When you feel the surge, take a deep breath in through your nose, hold for 2 seconds, and exhale through your mouth while pressing the stone against your palm. As you exhale, focus on your five senses, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, and the sensation of the air on your skin. Repeat this process for 60 seconds.

This technique is designed to be more discreet and focused on the present moment, rather than a 10-minute exercise. The goal

Patient: I’m feeling jumpy and my chest’s tight just reading that — that old shame keeps flashing back and I’m not sure this won’t just be another half-measure. Be concrete and accountant-friendly: before I start, tell me exactly what to log for a baseline week (list the columns I should use in a spreadsheet and how to rate intensity with clear anchors). 

Next, give me one exact, one-sentence in-the-moment line to say when someone ignores my boundary plus one immediate, enforceable action I can take right then (something I can actually do without escalating) and one non-humiliating consequence I can follow through on — and give me two alternate options so I can pick what fits my situation. 

If there’s no improvement by Day 14, give me a stepwise troubleshooting ladder with exact actions and timings (Day 15 do X, Day 18 do Y). Don’t give me pep talk — give me the spreadsheet template, the scripts, and the three concrete consequences now, or tell me why you think that exact set won’t work. I’ll try this only if it’s precise and measurable.

**Baseline Week (Days 1-7) Spreadsheet Template:**

| Date | Snaps | Peak Intensity | Time Between Snaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

**Rating System:**

* 0-3: Minimal reaction
* 4-6: Some reaction (e.g., frustration, annoyance)
* 7-8: Noticeable reaction (e.g., anger, upset)
* 9-10: Severe reaction (e.g., explosive, aggressive)

**In-the-Moment Script and Immediate Action:**

When someone ignores your boundary, say: "I've communicated my needs. I will not engage in further discussion until we find a respectful conversation."

Immediate action: Take 5 seconds to breathe deeply and focus on your five senses (e.g., notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin).

Non-humiliating consequences:

1. Alternate 1: "I will end this conversation and change the subject to a more neutral topic."
2. Alternate 2: "I will politely excuse myself for a few minutes to collect my thoughts before continuing the conversation."

**Troubleshooting Ladder (if no improvement by Day 14):**

If you don't see an improvement, try the following:

**Day 15:** Review the baseline week data and identify patterns or common triggers. Take 10 minutes to brainstorm strategies to address these triggers.

**Day 18:** Implement one of the following strategies:
1. Practice a 10-minute mindfulness exercise (e.g., focusing on your breath, body scan) immediately after feeling the surge.
2. Use a different physical cue (e.g., a small tap on the wrist, a gentle stretch) to interrupt the reaction.

**Day 21:** Review the progress and adjust the strategies as needed.

Patient: My chest’s tight and I’m jumpy reading all that — part of me’s already circling that old shame like I failed again. I’ll try to be precise like you asked, but be blunt: give me exact, accountant-style details I can drop straight into a sheet and act on.

Tell me exactly (no fluff):

1) Spreadsheet columns to use for the baseline week (I want every column name and the allowed values):  
   - e.g., Date, Time, Trigger (one-phrase), Location, Person, Boundary stated? (Y/N), Script used (1/2/3), Action taken (coin/tap/etc), Snap? (Y/N), Intensity (0–10), Minutes ruminating after, Follow-up done? (Y/N)

2) Clear definitions and formulas I can use in the sheet:  
   - How to count a “snap” (exact criteria).  
   - Formula for weekly snaps, percent reduction, average peak intensity, and average time between snaps (exact spreadsheet formulas/logic).  
   - Example of one filled row so I know what to log.

3) Three one-sentence in-the-moment scripts to use when someone ignores my boundary (pick 3 tones: neutral/assertive, firm/enforceable, public/brief). For each script give one immediate, enforceable action I can actually take right then (something practical I can follow through on without escalating or humiliating anyone), and one non-humiliating consequence I will implement if they keep ignoring it. I want three full option-sets to choose from.

4) Public-ready micro-tools (I need options):  
   - Three single-word mantras I can mouth silently.  
   - Three pocket cues (coin/stone ok) and an alternate discrete finger action if no pocket.  
   - Three different 60-second actions that actually break the surge (not vague), each doable in public and private.

5) The 14-day failure ladder — if there’s no measurable improvement by Day 14 give me exact next steps with dates/timings and what to do on each: Day 15 do X (how long, how many reps), Day 18 do Y, Day 21 do Z. Include when to escalate to bringing in an outside person (family/mediator/therapist).

6) Measurable targets and how to check them weekly: exact numbers to aim for (you gave reductions but tell me how to compute them week-to-week in the sheet and what to do if I’m off target by more than 10%).

7) A short template text I can use to document an ignored boundary afterward to myself or to the person (one sentence to log, one sentence to send if necessary) — so I’m not left replaying.

Be straight: how do these exact steps actually change things long-term (give the mechanism in one sentence and the expected timeline in weeks/months)? If you think any of this exact set won’t work, tell me why specifically.

Give me these items and a sample filled spreadsheet row. I’ll try it — but I need the numbers and the exact scripts before I start. What do you want me to log first thing tomorrow morning?

Therapist Answer:
I'll provide the exact details you requested.

**1. Spreadsheet Columns:**

| Column Name | Allowed Values |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Time | Time (HH:MM) |
| Trigger (one-phrase) | Triggering event or situation |
| Location | Location (optional) |
| Person | Name of person involved |
| Boundary stated? | Y/N |
| Script used | 1/2/3 (see script options) |
| Action taken | Coin/tap/etc. (see action options) |
| Snap? | Y/N |
| Intensity | 0-10 (see intensity definition) |
| Minutes ruminating after | 0-60 |
| Follow-up done? | Y/N |

**2. Definitions and Formulas:**

* Snap: A snap is defined as a noticeable reaction, including verbal outbursts, facial expressions, or body language that indicates frustration or anger.
* Weekly snaps: =SUM(B3:B7) / 7 (total snaps per week / 7 days)
* Percent reduction: =(Weekly snaps - Previous week's snaps) / Previous week's snaps * 100
* Average peak intensity: =AVERAGE(B2:B7) (average intensity value)
* Average time between snaps: =(B8-B2) / (Weekly snaps / 7) (average time between snaps)

**3. In-the-Moment Scripts:**

**Neutral/Tone:**

* Script 1: "I appreciate your enthusiasm. Let's focus on finding a solution."
Action: Take 5 seconds to breathe deeply
Consequence: Ignore the person's response and continue the conversation when ready.

* Script 2: "I'm not sure I understand. Can you clarify?"
Action: Take 5 seconds to breathe deeply
Consequence: Wait for the person to clarify and respond.

* Script 3: "I need a moment to think. Can we take a break?"
Action: Take 10 seconds to collect thoughts
Consequence: Take a break and return to the conversation when ready.

**Assertive/Firm:**

* Script 1: "I've communicated my needs. I expect respect."
Action: Take 5 seconds to breathe deeply
Consequence: Enforceable consequence: "I will not engage in further discussion until we find a respectful conversation."

* Script 2: "I understand we have different perspectives. Let's find common ground."
Action: Take 5 seconds to

Patient: Good — here’s the exact, accountant‑style package you asked for. Drop these straight into a Google Sheet or Excel and use them as your baseline and tracking system.

1) Spreadsheet columns (exact names and allowed values)
- Date — (YYYY-MM-DD)  
- Time — (HH:MM, 24h)  
- Trigger (one‑phrase) — free text (e.g., “neighbor moved box”)  
- Location — free text (e.g., “kitchen”, “front porch”, “store”)  
- Person — free text (e.g., “Daughter”, “Neighbor”)  
- Boundary stated? — Y / N  
- Script used — 1 / 2 / 3 (see scripts below)  
- Action taken — coin / stone / ring‑tap / tongue / step away / other (fill text)  
- Snap? — Y / N  
- Snap type — verbal / silent (sharp tone) / gesture / slam / other  
- Intensity — 0–10 (see anchors below)  
- Minutes ruminating after — integer (0–240)  
- Follow‑up done? — Y / N  
- Follow‑up type — anchor sentence / tiny task / talk with person / journal / other  
- Notes — free text

2) Clear definitions and spreadsheet formulas (copyable)

Definitions:
- Snap: any immediate, hostile/angry reaction that is observable (raised voice, harsh tone, insult, slammed object, or a clearly hostile gesture). Count one snap per incident (even if sustained comments follow, that incident = 1 snap).
- Intensity anchors: 0 = none, 1–3 = mild annoyance, 4–6 = clear frustration (I feel hot, want to speak sharply), 7–8 = strong anger (I snapped or nearly did), 9–10 = explosive (yelled or physically aggressive).

Sample formulas (assume columns: A=Date, J=Snap? (Y/N), K=Intensity, L=Minutes ruminating, M=Follow‑up done (Y/N), T=Timestamp column if you add it)
- Weekly snaps (week start in cell W1 and week end in W2):
  =COUNTIFS(A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y")
- Percent reduction between WeekPrev (cell X1) and WeekThis (cell X2):
  =IF(X1>0,(X1-X2)/X1, "")
- Average peak intensity for week:
  =AVERAGEIFS(K:K,A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2)
- Average minutes ruminating per snap for week:
  =IF(COUNTIFS(A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y")>0, AVERAGEIFS(L:L,A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y"), "")
- Average minutes between snaps that week (if you add Timestamp column T = date+time):
  Let Count = COUNTIFS(A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y")
  If Count>1:
  =(MAXIFS(T:T,A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y") - MINIFS(T:T,A:A,">="&W1,A:A,"<="&W2,J:J,"Y"))*1440 / (Count-1)
  (Multiply by 1440 to convert days to minutes.)

3) Three one‑sentence in‑the‑moment scripts + immediate action + non‑humiliating consequence
Pick the set that fits the situation:

Option A — Neutral/Assertive  
- Script: “I appreciate that, but please don’t move my boxes.”  
- Immediate enforceable action: Verbally label and hold your position for one extra sentence ("Please don't.") then calmly pick up the nearest box and move it back to where it was (practical, non‑escalatory reclaim of your space).  
- Consequence if ignored: Say, “I’m going to sort this for five minutes in a different room,” and physically remove yourself to a different space for five minutes.

Option B — Firm/Enforceable  
- Script: “I asked you not to move my things. That needs to stop now.”  
- Immediate enforceable action: Stand so your body blocks further handling (put your hand on the box, move it physically away from them).  
- Consequence if ignored: State calmly, “Then I’ll lock these in the bedroom/storage for now,” and do so (practical boundary, non‑humiliating).

Option C — Public/Brief  
- Script (brief): “Not okay — I need that left alone.”  
- Immediate enforceable action: Take one step closer, gently but firmly put your hand on the item to prevent movement (visible, non‑aggressive).  
- Consequence if ignored: Say, “I’ll handle this my way,” and remove the item or call a short break (step away for 2–5 minutes and return on your terms).

(Choose the one that fits your relationship and risk of escalation. The enforceable actions are simple, physical, and tied to protecting the item rather than attacking the person.)

4) Public-ready micro-tools (pick one from each column depending on setting)

Single‑word mantras (mouth silently):  
- “Okay” — neutral acknowledgement  
- “Now” — brings you back to present action  
- “Enough” — signals boundary internally

Pocket cues (carry one of these) and alternate discrete finger action:  
- Smooth coin — rub with thumb in pocket  
- Small ceramic or river stone — press into palm  
- Flat washer (metal) — roll under finger  
Alternate discrete finger action if no pocket: press pad of ring finger against thumb or press index fingertip against base of thumb (silent, in palm).

Three 60‑second public actions (exact steps)

60‑Second option 1 — Stone + breath (discrete)  
- Hold coin/stone in palm, inhale 4s, hold 2s, exhale 6s while slowly rolling the stone under thumb; repeat for 60s focusing on the stone feel.

60‑Second option 2 — Feet/ground anchor (works standing)  
- As quietly as possible, subtly shift weight heel→toe three times, notice pressure under each foot, breathe steadily for 60s, count breaths to 8 then repeat until 60s done.

60‑Second option 3 — Micro‑task (discrete)  
- Slide a small receipt into a pocket or zipper, or fold a business card three times in your hand, quietly and deliberately, while counting breaths for 60s.

5) 14‑day failure ladder (exact next steps if no measurable improvement by Day 14)
- Day 1–14: baseline tracking as below (see targets). If by end of Day 14 targets not met, do this ladder:

Day 15 — Review & intensify (30–45 minutes)  
- Open your sheet; run the weekly snaps, intensity average, minutes ruminating. Identify the top 2 triggers (most frequent).  
- Practice micro‑tools 3x/day for 5 minutes each (stone + breath or 60‑sec drills), log practice entries.

Day 16–17 — Roleplay & rehearsal (two short sessions, 10 minutes each)  
- Call/talk with one trusted person and rehearse your chosen script and enforceable action twice each. Log whether you felt confident (Y/N) and note obstacles.

Day 18 — Apply a stronger boundary tactic in real life for those top triggers:  
- If previous consequence was “step away,” escalate to the alternative enforceable consequence (example: lock/move item or schedule a follow‑up meeting). Do this for any further instance that day. Log results.

Day 19–20 — Daily review (10 minutes/day)  
- Review logs, compare daily snap counts. If still no improvement, prepare to involve mediator.

Day 21 — Decide escalation  
- If no ≥10% reduction in snaps or intensity by Day 21, schedule one of these within next 7 days: family discussion with a neutral third party (mediator) or brief session with your therapist to practice scripts (book within Day 22–28). If you feel at risk of losing control or feeling suicidal/harmful impulses, contact mental health services immediately.

6) Measurable targets and how to check week‑to‑week (exact)

Targets to aim for (week to week):
- Reduce total weekly snaps by 30% within 4 weeks. Example: baseline week = 10 snaps → target week = 7 snaps (30% reduction = 3 fewer).  
- Reduce average peak intensity by 25% in 4 weeks: baseline mean intensity = 8 → target = 6.  
- Increase average minutes between snaps: if baseline avg between snaps = 15 minutes → target 30% increase = 19.5 minutes.

How to compute in sheet:
- WeeklySnapsThis = COUNTIFS(DateRange,">="&WeekStart,DateRange,"<="&WeekEnd,SnapRange,"Y")
- PercentChangeSnaps = (WeeklySnapsPrev - WeeklySnapsThis)/WeeklySnapsPrev * 100
- If PercentChangeSnaps < 30% by Week4, follow failure ladder.

If you’re off target by more than 10% at week check:
- Immediate action: add 2 practice slots/day (5 minutes each) for the following week and run the Day15 review immediately; escalate to Day16 roleplay if still off.

7) Template text to document an ignored boundary (log + optional message)

Quick log sentence (for your spreadsheet Notes column or personal journal):  
- “[Date] — Told [Person] not to move my boxes; they continued. I rated anger X/10 and ruminated Y minutes. Follow‑up: [action].”

One‑sentence message to send (if you need to communicate without replaying; non‑accusatory):  
- “Earlier I asked that my boxes not be moved; they were moved again. I need them left where they are—can we agree on that going forward?”  

Sample filled spreadsheet row (exact example you can paste):

| Date       | Time  | Trigger                   | Location | Person   | Boundary stated? | Script used | Action taken | Snap? | Snap type | Intensity | Minutes ruminating after | Follow‑up done? | Follow‑up type     | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------------------------|----------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 2025-08-26 | 14:12 | Neighbor moved my boxes   | Porch    | Neighbor | Y                | 2           | hand on box   | Y     | verbal    | 7         | 25                       | Y               | anchor sentence   | Moved box back; felt shaky |

What to log first thing tomorrow morning
- Create a “morning baseline” row: Date, Time (first awake), Trigger = “baseline”, Location = “home”, Person = “self”, Boundary stated? = N, Snap? = N, Intensity = your morning irritability (0–10), Minutes ruminating after = 0, Follow‑up done? = N. Also log sleep hours and any major stressors in Notes. This gives you a baseline irritability for the day.

One‑sentence mechanism and timeline (blunt and concrete)
- Mechanism: Repeatedly interrupting the automatic surge with an intentional micro‑action + brief grounding builds new stimulus→response associations (implementation intentions) so the old automatic reaction weakens; practiced consistently this lowers peak intensity and increases pause time.  
- Expected timeline: measurable partial change in 2–4 weeks; more durable change in 8–12 weeks with consistent practice.

If you think this exact set won’t work — why
- This exact set won’t work if you don’t reliably log events or if your environment continuously escalates (people intentionally provoke). It also requires you to be consistent with practice; without practice the implementation intentions won’t stick. If you can’t follow the logging or practice plan, tell me which pieces feel impossible and I will adapt.

If you want, I’ll export these as a CSV layout you can paste into a sheet or give you the exact cell formulas tailored to the column letters you choose. Which do you want now — the CSV header + one sample row, or the sheet with formula cells for weekly calculations?
