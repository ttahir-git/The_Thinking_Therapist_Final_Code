Patient: I've been dodging gatherings with my few close friends because social situations trigger this overwhelming anxiety. My mind immediately runs a worst-case script — I'll fumble a comment, everyone will think I'm odd, they'll stop inviting me, I'll end up cut off and spiral into total loneliness. Losing my partner made it worse; now my brain's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disasters and I can't seem to quiet it.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really spinning with worst-case scenarios. Can you tell me more about what happens right after these thoughts arise – do you ever get stuck in that 'disaster' script, or do you try to do something to change the course of the situation?

Patient: I mostly get stuck — the thought arrives and my brain instantly runs the whole disastrous script and won't stop. I try little fixes, like rehearsing lines, mapping exits, or planning a polite excuse to leave early, but it's just damage control for something I feel will definitely collapse: I'll fumble, they'll stare, they'll stop asking, and I'll end up alone. When someone suggests it could turn out fine, I just think that's unrealistic — I don't know how to make my head believe otherwise.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to cope with the anxiety by doing some problem-solving, but it's not really addressing the underlying experience. Can you say more about what happens when you're actually in the situation and those worst-case thoughts arise – do you feel a physical sense of tension, or is it more of an emotional, mental experience?

Patient: Both — it hits my body first and then my head. My chest tightens, my hands tremble, my stomach flips and my voice goes thin, and then my brain instantly reels out the whole disaster movie where I flub a line, everyone judges me, and I'm cut off for good. When that starts I feel trapped in the story and even when someone suggests a different ending I just think that's unrealistic and can't make myself believe it.

Therapist: It sounds like your entire body gets caught up in that worst-case scenario. I'm noticing that you're really caught in this story and can't seem to make room for a different experience. Would it be okay if we took a small experiment right here, right now – just for a moment – to see if we can start to make room for something else to show up? Can you take a deep breath with me and imagine that your mind is just a thought – just a thought, not the truth – and see what happens?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I take a breath with you, but my chest stays tight and the disaster script just keeps playing on repeat — it feels like pretending to call it "just a thought" when my whole body insists it's the truth. I don't know how to make my head accept that it could be anything else; it all still feels inevitable.

Therapist: It can feel like your body and mind are hard to shake. I'm not trying to make your thoughts go away, but rather see what might happen if you start to notice them as just thoughts – not the truth, but just thoughts. Can you say what it feels like when you think "this disaster is inevitable" – is it a sense of powerlessness, or more of a sense of resignation?

Patient: It's more like powerlessness that turns into resignation. First there's that sharp panic — chest tight, mind racing — and then I just settle into the script, telling myself there's nothing I can do so I might as well withdraw. People suggest other endings and I immediately dismiss them as unrealistic; my brain just keeps replaying the crash scenario.

Therapist: It's like you're getting stuck in that loop. I want to try something a bit different. Instead of trying to stop the thoughts or dismiss them, what if we try to cultivate a sense of curiosity about what would happen if you did take a step towards that social gathering – what if you did go, and it wasn't as bad as you think? Would you be willing to just experiment with that possibility, without any expectations of what might happen?

Patient: I wish I could, but I just can't buy it — the minute I think about going my head runs the whole collapse: I fumble a comment, someone laughs, they whisper about me afterward, the invites stop, and I'm left completely isolated again. My chest tightens just picturing it and curiosity feels like denial — when you suggest other outcomes I just think that's unrealistic. Maybe I could imagine only peeking in or staying by the door, but even that turns into someone pointing me out and me having to leave in shame.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really trying to protect yourself from potential discomfort, even the small step of showing up. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to consider exploring this further. Can you take another deep breath with me, and imagine that you're standing at the door of that social gathering – just standing there, not necessarily going in – and notice what happens when you imagine being there, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I take the breath, but the moment I picture myself at the door my brain launches the whole worst-case movie—I freeze, fumble a greeting, someone laughs, they whisper, and next thing I know I'm not being invited back. My chest tightens so much I feel like running, and trying to "just stand there" seems impossible because I can't stop expecting that fallout. When you offer other endings I immediately dismiss them as unrealistic; I can't make my head accept anything but the disaster, and that leaves me stuck and hopeless.

Therapist: It's like you're getting stuck in this vicious cycle. I'm not trying to offer you a specific outcome or a way to avoid the anxiety, but rather to help you notice what's happening in the moment. Can you explore with me what happens when you try to "stop" the worst-case thoughts – is there a sensation of pressure, like trying to hold your breath, or a sense of resistance, like pushing against something?

Patient: When I try to stop them it's like trying to hold back a flood — my chest clamps down, I feel faint, and the thoughts just surge louder, replaying an even worse version: I stammer, someone laughs, they start whispering, and before I know it I'm cut off for good. It feels like a losing tug-of-war where resistance only makes the script more vivid and violent. Suggestions of different outcomes just sound naive and unrealistic to me, and that leaves me feeling exhausted and stuck.

Therapist: It's like the more you try to control the thoughts, the more they seem to take over. I want to try something else. Can you imagine that there's a small, tiny thread that you could pull, just a tiny thread, to start to loosen the grip of that worst-case scenario? Not trying to pull it out, but just to start to feel the thread, like a gentle tug, and see what happens?

Patient: I try to reach for the thread, but the moment I picture tugging it my brain spits out the whole collapse: I pull it and everything unravels — I flub a line, someone laughs, whispers spread, they stop inviting me, and I'm left completely cut off, definitely. My chest tightens and my hands go numb just thinking about it; even a tiny tug feels like a guarantee of ruin. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the moment you try to reach for the thread, the whole scenario unwinds. I'm not asking you to try to reach for the thread or change anything right now – can you just notice, for a moment, where you are – physically, emotionally, right now – in this space?

Patient: Physically I'm hunched, chest tight, hands trembling and my voice goes thin; emotionally I feel trapped and resigned like the disaster script is already playing on loop. Even when I try to just notice the present, my mind insists it's the start of the collapse—I'll fumble, somebody will laugh, the invites will stop, and I'll be cut off for good. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the worst-case scenario is already unfolding in your mind, even when you're trying to focus on the present. I want to try something gentle. Can you take a deep breath in, and with that breath, allow your body to relax just a tiny bit – from the top down – not trying to control it, just allowing it to relax?

Patient: Okay — I take a slow breath, and I can feel my shoulders drop a tiny bit, but the chest tightness won't let go and the disaster movie is still playing: I fumble, someone laughs, the invites stop. It feels almost performative to try to relax when my brain insists those outcomes are inevitable and any other ending just seems unrealistic. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the tension in your body is still strong, even with the slight relaxation. I'm not asking you to change or control anything – can you just observe the sensation of your chest tightness, the feeling of inevitability in your mind, without judgment? Notice it as you would a physical sensation in your body, like a tight band around your chest.

Patient: It's a tight band under my ribs, pressing down so my breaths get shallow and my hands feel a little numb when I notice it. My head immediately fills with the disaster movie — I fumble a comment, someone laughs, they whisper, the invites stop — and trying to "just notice" only seems to make those images louder. I'm suddenly more jittery and distracted than a moment ago; can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with this without spiraling.

Therapist: It's like the moment you try to focus on the physical sensation, the worst-case scenario just gets louder. I want to try something else. Can you gently bring your attention back to your breath – not trying to control it, just gently bring it to your attention – and see if that can be a small anchor for you, a tiny thread to hold onto in the midst of all this?

Patient: I try to bring my attention to my breath, but it's shallow and that tight band in my chest stays there — the moment I focus my head shoots off into the worst-case: I fumble a comment, someone laughs, they whisper, and the invites stop for good. Using the breath as an anchor feels like pushing against a current and I'm suddenly more jittery and distracted than before — my hands are trembling and my voice goes thin. I can't seem to settle into it and it feels pointless to imagine any other outcome, so… can we slow down a bit? I don't know what else to do right now.

Therapist: It's like the breath becomes a source of agitation rather than calm. I'm not trying to give you a way out or a solution – can you just acknowledge the fact that you're feeling overwhelmed, right now, in this moment – without judgment or expectation? Can you simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now"?

Patient: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." I'm not sure I follow how saying that helps — my chest is tight, my hands are trembling, and my head's already running the whole worst-case: I fumble a comment, someone laughs, they whisper, and the invites stop. Saying the words feels true but it doesn't make the inevitable-feeling any less, and suggesting it might be different just sounds unrealistic to me.

Therapist: It's like acknowledging the feeling doesn't necessarily change it. I'm not trying to offer a way out or a solution, but rather to acknowledge the experience in a very simple and direct way. Can you allow yourself to simply be with that feeling, without trying to change it or push against it? Notice what happens to your body and mind when you don't try to push or change anything.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to just be with it, but the moment I stop fighting the feeling the tight band under my ribs gets worse, my breaths stay shallow, my hands tremble and my voice goes thin. My head immediately kicks into that disaster script — I’ll fumble a line, someone will laugh, they’ll whisper, the invites will stop — and that old shame about screwing up floods in and makes me feel small and exposed. I’m not sure I follow how sitting with this helps — it just feels like letting the inevitable happen — so… can we slow down? I don’t know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like the feeling intensifies when you try to sit with it. I'm not asking you to sit with the disaster script or the shame – can you just sit with the physical sensations in your body, like the tight band under your ribs, the trembling, the shallow breaths? Notice them as they are, without trying to change them or push against them. Just observe, without judgment or expectation. Can you do that for a moment?

Patient: I try, but the moment I focus on the tight band it actually feels worse — my breaths stay shallow, my hands tremble, and my head immediately flips into the worst-case: I’ll fumble a line, someone will laugh, they’ll whisper, and the invites will stop. That old shame about messing up floods in and makes me feel small and exposed, and honestly I’m not sure I follow how just noticing helps — it feels like letting the inevitable happen. Can we slow down? I don’t know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like focusing on the sensation makes it worse. I want to try something different. Can you notice the fact that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that you're trying to notice your thoughts and feelings, right now? Can you acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, in this moment, with what you have?

Patient: I can tell myself I'm doing the best I can, but it feels hollow — my mind instantly runs the disaster script: I'll trip over my words, someone will laugh, they'll stop inviting me, and that old shame of freezing in front of people comes rushing back and makes me feel small and exposed. I'm trying, but I'm really overwhelmed and I don't see how that helps right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the thought that you're doing the best you can doesn't provide much comfort. I'm not asking you to stop trying or give up – can you just be with the feeling of being overwhelmed, and the sense of uncertainty that comes with it? Notice that you're not in control of what's happening, and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. Can you allow yourself to be in that uncertainty, without judgment?

Patient: I can try to sit with the uncertainty, but I don't see how that helps — the moment I try my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and my mind shoots straight to the worst-case: I stammer, someone laughs, they whisper, and the invites stop forever. That old shame about screwing up floods back and makes me feel small and exposed, so "being okay not knowing" just feels like letting the inevitable happen. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like the uncertainty is overwhelming. I want to try something very small. Can you take one tiny breath with me, and just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or think about anything else? Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I take one tiny breath, but it's shallow; the tight band under my ribs doesn't let go and my hands tremble. The moment I focus on it the disaster-loop fires up — I'll stammer, someone laughs, they'll whisper, the invites stop — it's like a stuck bug in my head that keeps returning. I'm not sure I follow how this helps and I'm getting jitterier; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the breath doesn't provide much relief. I'm not asking you to focus on the breath to get rid of the thoughts or feelings – can you just notice where your body is in this moment? Where are your hands? What's happening in your body? Can you bring your attention to that?

Patient: My hands are in my lap, fingers bunched and trembling, like they're too heavy to hold still; my shoulders are tight and my chest feels like a band so my breaths are shallow. The minute I notice it my head spins the whole collapse—people will see me shaking, someone will laugh, they'll whisper, and the invites will stop. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing helps; I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like noticing your physical sensations doesn't provide much respite. I want to try something very gentle. Can you gently notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, wherever you're sitting? Just notice the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor, without trying to think about anything else. Can you stay with that sensation for just a tiny bit?

Patient: My feet are flat on the floor, but the moment I try to notice them my chest tightens and my hands start trembling — and my head immediately fires up the same disaster movie: I’ll fumble, someone laughs, they whisper, and the invites stop. I’m not sure I follow how focusing on my feet helps — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like focusing on your feet doesn't bring much comfort. I'm not trying to help you "stop" the thoughts or feelings, but rather to notice what's happening in the present moment, without judgment. Can you try to notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit, even if it's just a tiny release of tension in your toes or fingers?

Patient: I try, but all I can notice is a tiny loosening in my toes for a second and then my chest clamps down and my hands start shaking — I'm suddenly jitterier and kind of distracted. I'm not sure I follow how that tiny release helps; my head immediately launches the disaster again — I’ll fumble, someone laughs, they’ll whisper, and the invites stop — and that old shame about screwing up rushes back and makes me feel small. Can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like the tiny release is quickly replaced by the old discomfort. I want to try something very gentle and small. Can you take a tiny step back from the thoughts and feelings, and just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to think about anything else? Just focus on the sensation of the air, and allow yourself to be where you are, without judgment.

Patient: I try to take a tiny step back and feel the air, but the moment I do my chest clamps down and the disaster movie kicks in — I'll stammer, someone laughs, they'll whisper, and the invites stop. It just makes me jittery and distracted and I don't see how this helps; I'm getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like trying to step back doesn't provide much relief. I'm not asking you to change or control anything, but rather to be with what's happening in the moment, without judgment. Can you simply be with the sensation of your body being overwhelmed, without trying to do anything about it? Just allow yourself to be with the experience, without expectation or resistance.

Patient: I’ll try, but whenever I sit with it the tight band gets worse — my hands shake more and that old shame about freezing in front of people floods back. The disaster movie goes full blast: I fumble, someone laughs, they whisper, the invites stop and I’m left completely cut off. I’m really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don’t know what to do next.

Therapist: It's like sitting with the experience only makes it more intense. I want to try something very, very gentle. Can you allow yourself to be in this moment, without trying to change anything, and simply acknowledge that you're having a very difficult time right now? Can you say to yourself, "I'm having a really tough moment" – just those simple words, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: "I'm having a really tough moment." My chest is tight, my hands are trembling, and my head won't stop the disaster movie — I'll fumble a line, someone will laugh, they'll whisper, and the invites will stop for good. Saying it out loud feels true but doesn't make the inevitability any less; I don't know what to do next — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like acknowledging the difficulty doesn't provide much comfort. I'm not trying to offer a solution or a way out, but rather to help you notice that you're already doing something – acknowledging the difficulty of the moment. Can you allow yourself to be in this acknowledgment, without trying to do anything else? Just be with the feeling of having a tough moment, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to just be with that: "I'm having a really tough moment." My chest is tight, my hands tremble, and the second I let that be true the disaster movie kicks back in — I'll fumble a line, someone laughs, they'll whisper, and the invites stop for good. I don't see how sitting with it helps; I'm getting more overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.
