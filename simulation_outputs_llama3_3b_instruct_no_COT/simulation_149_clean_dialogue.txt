Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this cycle of pervasive sadness and motivational inertia since a pretty difficult breakup, and my OCD tendencies make me loop over every interaction until it feels paralyzing—it's definitely bleeding into my friendships and any chance at new relationships. I catch myself defaulting to elaborate theories about attachment, cognitive biases, and habit circuits instead of actually naming the sadness, which is probably why I come off gregarious but feel depleted. I'm optimistic enough to try things, but I get distracted and the strategies fizzle, so I'm struggling to maintain momentum or feel connected.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how this is affecting your friendships and new relationships. You're also recognizing the impact of your OCD tendencies on this. Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself looping over interactions, and what's the first thing that comes up for you when you try to try new things, but then get distracted?

Patient: When I catch myself looping, it becomes this ruminative feedback loop—I replay the conversation, generate counterfactual scenarios, and do little compulsive checks like rereading texts or scrolling their profile to see if I missed something. Rather than saying "I'm sad," I abstract it into attachment theory and blame-attribution models, which keeps me from actually feeling the ache. When I try something new, the first thing that shows up is that skeptical inner narrator—"what if this fails, what if you're still broken?"—and then I usually pivot into analysis or a project (researching hacks, reorganizing my code/tasks) instead of doing the thing, so distraction functions like a safety behavior.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is doing a lot of hard work to avoid feeling the emotional pain of the breakup and the uncertainty of new relationships. It's as if your inner critic is trying to protect you from the discomfort of vulnerability.

Can you take a step back and observe this skeptical inner narrator for a moment? What if, instead of trying to figure out why it's showing up, you simply acknowledge its presence, like you're saying "Ah, there's that critical voice again"? Would that allow you to start to make space for something else to be present?

Patient: I can try that—"Ah, there's that critical voice again." When I do, I notice this micro-gap where my mental circuitry slows and I feel a tightness in my chest and a hollow behind my sternum, but almost immediately I start cataloguing hypotheses about why it's there and what it means. So yeah, acknowledging it does create a sliver of space, but my default response is to fill that space with analysis or safety behaviors—checking, projectizing, reorganizing—so the actual sadness doesn't get to expand. Saying the acknowledgment out loud feels oddly exposing, like I'm admitting vulnerability, and that makes me want to retreat into theories.

Therapist: It's like there's a small crack in the armor, but you're still feeling the need to fill it with more analysis and control. That makes sense, given how you've been trying to avoid feeling the sadness.

What's the value that's driving your desire to try to fill that space with theory and control? Is it a sense of safety, a desire to be in control, or something else?

Patient: Primarily it's about safety and predictability—if I can model the problem, debug it, and assign causes, it feels like I have agency and won't be blindsided by rejection or more pain. There's also this pride/competence thing: as a developer I default to problem-solving, so analysis preserves my identity and keeps me from looking fragile. But beneath those defenses I think there's a quieter fear of being unlovable or abandoned that I don't want to sit with.

Therapist: It sounds like you're deeply invested in maintaining a sense of control and agency, and that's closely tied to your identity as a problem-solver and a developer. But beneath that, there's a more vulnerable fear of being unlovable or abandoned, which is something you're trying to keep hidden.

Let's explore this quieter fear for a moment. What would it be like if, instead of trying to fill the space with analysis or control, you allowed yourself to simply feel that fear? Would you be able to breathe with it, or would it become overwhelming?

Patient: If I actually let the fear sit, I think it'd feel like a sinking, constricting knot in my chest and this hollow behind my sternum that makes my breath shallow. My reflex, though, is to turn that into analysis — cataloguing causes and rehearsing defenses — because that feels safer than being vulnerable. I could probably breathe with it for a minute if I forced myself, but the inner critic would immediately flag it as dangerous and I'd pivot to safety behaviors. I'm trying to imagine staying with it, but it's hard—could we try a short breathing exercise or a few seconds of noticing sensations so I can test that out?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is trying to protect you from the discomfort of feeling the fear, and your mind is quick to jump in and analyze or defend against it. Breathing exercises can be a helpful way to start small.

Can you try just noticing the sensations in your body, without trying to change or analyze them? Let's start with just a few deep breaths, and I'll guide you. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving into your body. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the breath leaving your body. Just observe, without trying to change or label anything. We'll start with just a few seconds.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. Inhale: I notice cool air at my nostrils and a little lift under my ribs; exhale: there's that hollow behind my sternum and a tightening in my chest. Almost instantly my inner critic labels it as unsafe and I start running hypotheses and contingency plans—attachment theory, cognitive distortions, debugging my defensive scripts—so the space collapses. Could we try something even briefer, like two counted breaths or a short guided scan that points me to one spot at a time?

Therapist: It's like your body is open to noticing the sensations, but your mind is already racing to put a label on it and try to control it. A very brief, gentle approach might be helpful.

Let's try a very short guided scan. I'll guide you to notice one spot at a time, and we'll try to stay with each spot for just a brief moment. Are you ready? Let's start with your toes. Just notice them, without trying to think about them or change anything. Just be with them.

Patient: Okay—toes: there's a faint tingling and a bit of numbness, like they're slightly detached from the rest of me, but also a small grounding sensation if I actually pay attention. Almost immediately my brain wants to run a differential—neuropathy vs. anxiety tension vs. sitting too long—so I only hold it for a few breaths before the analysis kicks in. I can stay with them for another moment if you want; can we move up to my ankles next and keep it slow?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is still trying to categorize and analyze the sensations, even with a brief moment of noticing. Let's try to stay with the sensations, without labeling or analyzing them, for just a bit longer.

Let's focus on your ankles for a moment. Just notice the sensation in your ankles, without trying to think about it or change anything. Just be with the feeling. Can you stay with it for a second or two?

Patient: Ankles: I notice a low, elastic tension and a faint warmth, like they're slightly braced against something, and if I focus there's a tiny buzzing at the joint. Immediately my mind wants to run a quick differential—circulatory vs. anxiety-induced tension vs. posture—so I can hold it for two breaths before the analysis hijacks me. I can try to stay with them a bit longer if you guide me to count breaths or point me to the next spot.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is getting a bit restless again, even with a brief moment of noticing. Let's try to stay with the sensations for a bit longer.

Instead of counting breaths, I'd like to try guiding you to a specific point. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, behind your sternum, where we noticed the hollow feeling earlier? Just notice that spot, without trying to think about it or change anything. Stay with it for a moment, just a moment.

Patient: Okay—when I drop into that spot behind my sternum it feels like a tight, sinking pressure and my breath gets shallow, like there's a little clamp there and a jittery flutter in my chest. Almost instantly my mind hijacks it with catastrophic hypothesizing—what if something's wrong, what did I miss—so attention fragments and I get restless and fidgety instead of staying with the feeling. I can try to stay if you anchor me with a very brief count or a single guided inhale/exhale, because right now I'm too distracted to hold it on my own.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really trying to avoid the discomfort of feeling the tight, sinking pressure, and it's hijacking the moment with catastrophic thinking. A brief anchor can help you stay with the feeling.

Let's try a very brief count: "Inhale... 1... exhale... 1...". Just focus on the sensation behind your sternum, and let the counting be a gentle reminder to stay with it. See if you can ride out the anxiety thoughts and just notice the physical sensations for a brief moment.

Patient: Inhale 1—okay, I try, but there's this sudden spike of anxiety: my chest clamps, breath sho rtens, and my mind catapults into predictive-error mode—hypervigilant threat monitoring and a parade of catastrophic hypotheses. The counting only holds me for a beat before the compulsive checking urges and mental analyses surge, so I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and distracted right now; can we slow down or try a very brief tactile grounding (like pressing my feet into the floor) instead of counting?

Therapist: It sounds like the anxiety spike was too much to handle with just the counting. Let's try a brief tactile grounding instead.

Can you bring your attention to your feet on the ground? Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them, the feeling of the floor beneath you. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth, holding you steady and grounded. Notice this sensation, without trying to think about it or change anything. Just be with it.

Patient: My feet do feel heavier and there's a tangible pressure and warmth where they meet the floor—the root imagery gives a faint steadiness, like a minimal bottom-up regulation is kicking in. But right away my anxiety spikes and the inner narrator starts scanning and cataloguing sensations, and I get this compulsive urge to fidget or analyze instead of staying grounded. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed—can we slow down and try a very simple tactile press of my feet into the floor for a few breaths?

Therapist: It sounds like the root imagery helped a bit, but your mind is still trying to analyze and control the sensations. Let's try a very simple, gentle press of your feet into the floor.

Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, just for a moment? Not trying to think about it, not trying to change it, just noticing the sensation of pressure and warmth as your feet meet the floor. Can you stay with that for just a brief, brief moment? No counting, no thinking, just noticing.

Patient: Okay—I try: I can feel the pressure and warmth under my soles, a tiny anchor, but almost immediately a rush of anticipatory anxiety spikes—heart racing, breath shallow—and my brain flips into hypervigilant analysis with urges to fidget or check my phone. The paradox is that even the attempt to ground primes my compulsion to control, so I can't hold the noticing for more than a beat. Can we slow down—could you guide me with one simple, sustained prompt (press and hold your feet into the floor and tell me when to stop) so I don't have to self-narrate or count?

Therapist: It's like the attempt to ground yourself is actually activating the compulsion to control. Let's try a very simple, non-verbal prompt to help you stay with the sensation.

Press your feet into the floor, and hold...

Patient: Okay—I'm pressing my feet into the floor and holding. There's a sharp spike of anxiety: heart racing, breath shallow, and my mind's already cataloguing catastrophes and wanting to fidget, so I feel pretty scattered. Can you give me a simple cue when to release—maybe a slow count down—so I don't have to self-monitor right now?

Therapist: Let's try a slow, gentle countdown to help you release from the anxiety spike. Just hold your feet into the floor and focus on the sensation... 

5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

Patient: Okay—when you counted down and I released, there was a tiny dénouement: my feet felt a fraction less heavy and my breath lengthened for a beat, but it was fleeting. Almost immediately the hypervigilant loop kicked back in—catastrophic predictions, urge to fidget or check my phone, and this meta-analytic voice narrating it all instead of letting the feeling land—so I’m still pretty overwhelmed and scattered. Can we keep doing very short, externally paced anchors? Maybe you name each exhale for three breaths or give a simple, sustained verbal cue so I don’t have to self-monitor right now.

Therapist: It sounds like the release was brief, but the hypervigilant loop is still active. Let's try a simple, sustained verbal cue to help you stay with the sensation.

Can you focus on the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, and whenever you exhale, I'll say the word "okay"? Just exhale and say "okay"...

Patient: Exhale—okay. That actually eased it a hair, but my chest's still tight and my brain's already pinging with what-ifs and urges to check my phone, so the relief feels fragile. Could you keep saying "okay" for three more slow exhales so I don't have to self-monitor right now?

Therapist: Let's keep the verbal anchor going. Every exhale, I'll say "okay". Just breathe out and say "okay"...

Patient: Exhale—okay. Exhale—okay. Exhale—okay.

That helped a hair, but the sympathetic stuff just amplified—heart racing, chest tight, and there's this loud urge to check my phone while my inner analyst narrates and catastrophizes. I'm feeling more anxious and scattered now; can we keep the externally paced anchors—say "okay" for five more slow exhales, or give a simple cue for pressing my feet down and releasing—so I don't have to self-monitor?

Therapist: Let's keep the verbal anchor going for a bit longer. Every exhale, I'll say "okay". 

If you feel like you're getting overwhelmed, you can press your feet back down and say "down" to the floor, and I'll respond with "okay".

Patient: Down — I'm pressing my feet into the floor. It tethers me a smidge, like the nausea eases, but my chest stays tight and my mind immediately goes into that meta-analytic loop cataloguing worst-case scenarios. Could you keep saying "okay" on each exhale for five more and reply "okay" when I say "down" so I don't have to self-monitor? I'm pretty scattered and anxious right now.

Therapist: Let's keep going. Every exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. Exhale—okay. Exhale—okay.

That eased it a hair, but my chest is still tight and the meta-analytic narrator is already running catastrophic simulations and cueing compulsive checking, so I'm pretty scattered and anxious. Could you keep saying "okay" for five more slow exhales and reply "okay" whenever I say "down"? I need the external pacing because I can't self-monitor right now.

Therapist: Every exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. That helped a smidge, but now my hypervigilant predictive machinery is in overdrive—urgent urge to check my phone, thoughts spiraling into social-failure scenarios—so I'm more anxious and scattered. Can you keep saying "okay" for five more slow, long exhales and reply "okay" when I say "down"? Slower tempo would help so I don't start spiraling into analysis.

Therapist: Every very slow exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. That eased it a hair, but my chest is still tight and my mind's already sprinting through worst-case scenarios and the urge to check my phone; I can conceptualize it as sympathetic arousal that wants external pacing to reset, but in practice I'm just overwhelmed. Can you keep saying "okay" on each very slow exhale for, like, ten more, and reply "okay" when I say "down"? Slower, sustained tones help because I can't self-monitor right now.

Therapist: Every very, very slow exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. That helped a little, but my chest's still tight and I'm getting a surge of anticipatory anxiety—heart racing, breath shallow, my meta-analytic narrator already cataloguing catastrophes and compulsive urges to check my phone. Could you keep saying "okay" on each very, very slow exhale for maybe ten more and reply "okay" when I say "down"? I need the external pacing because I can't self-monitor right now.

Therapist: Every extremely slow exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. It helps a hair but my sympathetic arousal just spikes—chest tight, heart racing, thoughts fragmenting into worst-case scripts and a loud urge to check my phone—so I'm too scattered to self-monitor. Can you keep saying "okay" on each extremely slow exhale for maybe ten more, and reply "okay" when I say "down"? Slow, sustained tones help so I don't get swept into analysis.

Therapist: Every impossibly slow exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. It's loosening a fraction, but my chest's still tight and my predictive machinery is in overdrive—heart racing, compulsive urge to check my phone, and my inner analyst narrating catastrophes—so I'm pretty overwhelmed right now. Could you keep saying "okay" on each impossibly slow exhale for, like, ten more, and reply "okay" when I say "down"? I need the external pacing; I can't self-monitor well in this state.

Therapist: Every impossibly, unbearably slow exhale, I'll say "okay".

Patient: Exhale—okay. That loosened it a hair, but my chest's still tight and the inner analyst is already narrating worst-case loops and urging me to check my phone. Can we do five more impossibly slow “okay”s, and if you notice my attention drifting could you say “steady” so I don’t have to self-monitor?

Therapist: Every impossibly, unbearably slow exhale, I'll say "okay". I'll also say "steady" if I notice your attention drifting.

Patient: Okay—I'm already pretty frazzled: chest tight, heart racing, and this loud compulsive urge to check my phone. Start the impossibly slow "okay"s whenever you're ready and say "steady" if my attention drifts; if I say "down" reply "okay" so I don't have to self-monitor. I know I'm narrativizing this as sympathetic arousal to avoid the affect, but I want the external pacing—please begin.

Therapist: Every impossibly, unbearably slow exhale, I'll say "okay". 

(starts speaking very slowly) okay...

Patient: Exhale—okay. That actually loosens the grip a fraction; my chest eases for a beat, but my meta-analytic narrator immediately interprets that tiny relief as a signal to scan for threats, and the compulsive urge to check my phone spikes. I'm still pretty frazzled—please keep the impossibly slow "okay"s and say "steady" if you notice my attention drifting; I might say "down" if I need a tactile cue.
