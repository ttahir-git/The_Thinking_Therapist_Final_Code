Patient: Hi. Lately, ever since a recent health scare, I've been stuck in this cycle of asking colleagues, friends, even my partner for reassurance to quiet the dread before social situations. It helps for a minute but then I feel more anxious and dependent, and honestly I've tried talking about this before—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in. You're looking for a way to break free from relying on others for reassurance, but at the same time, the thought of not having it creates more anxiety. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do have reassurance from others - how does it feel, what's the sensation in your body, and what's going through your mind?

Patient: When someone tells me it's okay, my shoulders drop and my chest doesn't feel so tight — there's this short, kind of warm relief like I can breathe for a minute. But it's always temporary; soon after I start replaying the same worries and feeling guilty that I needed them to tell me I was alright. Then my mind shifts to "What if they think I'm weak?" or "What if I don't check again and something goes wrong?" I'm willing to describe this, but honestly — how is noticing that supposed to actually stop me from doing it? I've heard the "observe your feelings" stuff before and it didn't change much.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a kind of comfort in having reassurance, but it's not really alleviating your underlying anxiety. That guilt and worry about being perceived as weak can be a pretty powerful pull. What if, instead of trying to avoid those thoughts, we explored what would happen if you didn't have that reassurance, but you still had the freedom to take care of yourself and move forward in social situations?

Patient: I get the idea, but how is imagining not getting reassurance supposed to make me actually do it differently? If I don't get reassurance my chest tightens, I start replaying worst-case scenarios, and a lot of times I end up cancelling or nagging someone later because the doubt just hangs around. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about this—can we slow down and try something concrete I could actually use in a real situation?

Therapist: I can see that trying to just imagine it isn't quite meeting your needs. Let's try something a bit more tangible. What would happen if, right now, in this moment, you simply took a few deep breaths and said to yourself, "I've got this," without checking in with anyone else? No expectations, no reassurance needed, just a simple acknowledgment of your own ability to handle the situation?

Patient: Okay, fine — I tried the breathing and saying "I've got this" just now; I did feel my shoulders drop for a moment. But it feels hollow pretty quickly and the doubts come back, and then I want to check with someone — how is that supposed to help me stop doing that before a staff meeting or parent-teacher night? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down and work out a concrete, step-by-step thing I can actually use in those moments?

Therapist: The moment of calm is fleeting, and it's easy to get pulled back into the cycle. Let's try something smaller. What if, right before you walk into that staff meeting or parent-teacher night, you simply noticed the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin? Just observe that, without trying to change it or use it as reassurance. No thinking, no judgment, just a simple noticing of what's present. Would that be a tiny, small thing you could try?

Patient: How is noticing my feet supposed to stop me from checking—how is that supposed to help? It does give a tiny drop in tension—my shoulders eased when I tried it—but the doubt comes right back and I want to message someone. I'm willing to try it before a meeting, but can we slow down and actually map out a concrete 30‑second script and a step‑by‑step plan for when the urge to check hits? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, so please make it really simple.

Therapist: Noticing your feet isn't meant to be a standalone solution, but more of a pause button. Let's create a tiny ritual to help bridge the gap between noticing and taking action. Here's a simple script: "I notice my feet touching the ground. I take a deep breath in, and as I exhale, I say to myself, 'I've got this.' Then, I pause for a second, and then I take one small step forward into the situation." What do you think? Would you be willing to try that in a low-stakes situation first, like ordering coffee, and see how it goes?

Patient: Alright, I'll try it with something low-stakes like ordering coffee, though I'm not convinced it'll stick—how is that supposed to help? I need a foolproof 30‑second backup for when the urge to check hits: exact words I can say to myself, how long to wait before I even think about messaging someone, and one quick distraction I can do standing in line. I'm feeling overwhelmed picturing it all going wrong, so please make that tiny script really simple and concrete.

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. What if, when you feel the urge to check, you say to yourself exactly three words: "I've got this now." And then you pause for a full five seconds before checking? And while you're waiting, you focus on the sounds around you, like the hissing of the espresso machine or the murmur of the other people in line? Would that be a small, tangible anchor to help you stay on track?

Patient: Okay... I'll try it, but I'm still skeptical — how is a few breaths supposed to stop the urge? I need that 30‑second backup spelled out exactly so I can actually use it in the moment. 

Give me one precise thing to say (exact words), exactly how long to wait before I let myself message someone, and one quick distraction I can do while standing in line that won't look weird. I'm feeling overwhelmed picturing it all going wrong, so please make it really simple and concrete.

Therapist: I'll try to provide a more concrete solution. Here's a specific plan: 

1. When you feel the urge to check, say to yourself: "I'm choosing to trust myself."
2. Wait for exactly 30 seconds before checking.
3. While you're waiting, focus on tapping your left foot twice, then take a sip of the coffee in front of you.

This small, concrete action is designed to create a brief pause and distraction, giving you a chance to connect with your values and stay present.

Patient: Alright — I can try saying "I'm choosing to trust myself" and waiting 30 seconds while tapping my left foot twice and taking a sip, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the tightness from turning into a message when the doubt gets loud? I'm feeling overwhelmed picturing it failing — what if there's no coffee or I'm not in a line? Give me a fallback: one exact, very short script for if the urge is still strong after 30 seconds, and one distraction that looks normal anywhere. Also, what do I do about the guilt afterward if I still checked?

Therapist: Those are good questions. If the urge is still strong after 30 seconds, you can try saying to yourself: "I've done this before, and I've survived." This is a very short, straightforward statement that acknowledges your ability to handle uncertainty.

For a distraction, you can look around you and notice the color of the person's shirt or the pattern on the table. That's a simple, normal action that won't draw attention to yourself.

As for the guilt, acknowledge it: "That's okay, I made a choice. I took a few seconds to pause and choose to trust myself."

Patient: Okay... I can try the phrases, but "I've done this before, and I've survived" feels hollow — how is that supposed to help when my heart's pounding and my hands are itching to type? I'm feeling overwhelmed picturing it all going wrong, can we slow down and actually rehearse this now? Give me two very short lines I can believe: one to say right when the urge hits, and one to say afterward if I still checked, plus one discreet, normal-looking action I can do anywhere to buy myself those 30 seconds.

Therapist: Those are fair concerns. Let's try to make it more concrete. Here are two short lines:

1. When the urge hits, say to yourself: "I can handle this moment."
2. If you still check, say to yourself: "It's okay, I took a chance to pause."

For a discreet action to buy yourself 30 seconds, try looking at the reflection in a window or a mirror. It's a normal, everyday action that doesn't require much attention or explanation.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the lines, but I’m skeptical: how is “I can handle this moment” actually supposed to stop my hands from reaching for my phone? I’m feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down and rehearse them now — say the first line, wait five seconds, then give me the fallback line to say if I still checked, and one more discreet action that works when I can’t look into a window or I’m holding papers?

Therapist: Let's rehearse it. I'll say the first line: "I can handle this moment."

 Wait for five seconds... 

If you still reach for your phone, say the fallback line: "Okay, I paused again."

As for the third action, if you can't look into a window, try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. It's a simple, everyday action that can help you stay present.

Patient: Okay — I said "I can handle this moment" out loud and it eased the tightness for maybe two seconds, but my hands still went for the phone. How is that supposed to help when my heart's pounding and the doubt feels louder than a sentence? Can we slow down and actually rehearse it again right now — say the line with me, wait five seconds, then give me the fallback to use if the urge's still there? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's try again. I'll say the line with you: "I can handle this moment."

(Pause for 5 seconds)

If your hands still reach for your phone, say the fallback line with me: "Okay, I paused again."

Try to stay with me for the 5 seconds, even if your body wants to move. We can do this again if you need to.

Patient: Okay — I said "I can handle this moment" with you; it eased the tightness for maybe two seconds, but my hands still went for the phone. How is that supposed to help when my heart's pounding and the doubt's louder than a sentence? Can we slow down and rehearse again, but this time give me one tactile, silent anchor I can do with my hands full (like pressing thumb and forefinger together), and walk me through saying the line silently, waiting five seconds, then the fallback? I'm feeling overwhelmed, so please be very concrete.

Therapist: Let's try again. I'll guide you through it. Place your hands in your pockets or cross your arms to keep them occupied. Now, take a deep breath and say the line silently to yourself: "I can handle this moment."

 Wait for 5 seconds... 

As you wait, press your thumb and index finger together with your other three fingers. This is a small, tactile action that can help anchor you in the present moment.

If you still reach for your phone, say the fallback line silently: "Okay, I paused again."

Patient: Okay... I did it — hands in pockets, said "I can handle this moment" silently, pressed my thumb and finger together like you said. It loosened the chest for maybe two seconds; the finger press helped a bit, but my hands still went for the phone and the doubt felt louder — how is that supposed to stop it? Can we slow down and rehearse one more simple anchor that works when my hands are full of papers? I'm feeling really drained, so please keep it short and concrete.

Therapist: Let's try again. Since your hands are full of papers, we'll use a different anchor. Hold one paper flat on the surface in front of you, like a book or a table. Now, place your index finger on the paper, and say the line silently: "I can handle this moment."

 Wait for 5 seconds...

If you still reach for your phone, say the fallback line silently: "Okay, I paused again."

Notice how your finger is resting on the paper?

Patient: Yeah — I noticed it. The fingertip on the paper calmed things for a second, then the tension crept back and my hand still moved toward the phone. How is that supposed to stop it when the doubt gets loud? I'm really drained, so keep it short: give me one last, super-simple anchor that works when both hands are full, the exact one-line I should say silently, and exactly how many seconds to wait before I can check.

Therapist: Let's try again. Since your hands are full, we'll use the paper anchor. Place your hands on your thighs, palms down, and wrap your fingers around each other. Now, gently squeeze them together for 1 second... 

Say silently to yourself: "I've got this now."

 Wait for 1 second... 

If you still reach for your phone, you can take a deep breath and try again.

Patient: That one‑second squeeze and "I've got this now" loosened things for a beat, but my hand still went for the phone — it barely touched the panic. How is one second supposed to stop the rest of the noise? I'm almost out of steam—give me one last ultra‑simple thing: one exact silent line to say, exactly how many seconds to hold the squeeze, and one discreet anchor that works when I'm holding papers and a coffee.

Therapist: Let's try one last thing. Since you're holding papers and a coffee, we'll use that as our anchor. Hold your coffee with one hand and the papers with the other.

Hold the squeeze for 4 seconds...

Say silently to yourself: "I can breathe."

This is a very short and simple line that acknowledges your ability to take a deep breath and pause.

Patient: I tried the 4‑second squeeze and "I can breathe" — it calmed me for a beat but my hand still went for the phone. How is that supposed to drown out the rest of the noise? I'm running on empty—give me one tiny fallback line to use silently if I still check, exactly how many more seconds to wait before I can message someone, and one sentence to say to myself about the guilt afterward.

Therapist: Let's try one last fallback. If you still reach for your phone, say silently: "It's okay, I'll try again."

 Wait for 2 more seconds...

Say to yourself: "I'll learn from this and do better next time." This acknowledges the mistake, but also focuses on learning and growth, rather than beating yourself up over it.

Patient: I tried that — I said "It's okay, I'll try again" and waited the extra two seconds, but my hand still went for the phone. How is two seconds supposed to help when the doubt's so loud? I'm running on empty here — give me one clear rule I can stick to: if I check, wait 5 minutes before messaging, and afterward I'll tell myself, "I gave myself a chance; I'll try again next time." I'm skeptical, but I can try that—what if it still doesn't work?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit drained. Sometimes, having a clear rule can help. 

Remember, if you check, wait 5 minutes before messaging, and afterward, say to yourself: "I gave myself a chance; I'll try again next time." This acknowledges that you had the courage to pause and try again, even if it didn't work out.

As for what if it still doesn't work, that's a good sign that we might need to explore more strategies. But for now, let's just agree to try this new rule and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay... I'll try the 5‑minute rule, but I'm skeptical—how is waiting five minutes actually supposed to quiet the doubt? Give me one very short sentence I can say to myself during those five minutes to hold the urge, and one single line to use right after I slip that won't shred me. Keep it really short—I feel wiped.

Therapist: During the 5 minutes, say to yourself: "Breathe, I'm here."

As soon as you slip up and check, say to yourself: "Let's start again."

Patient: Okay — I'll try "Breathe, I'm here" and "Let's start again." Saying them now eased the chest for a beat, but it didn't stop the urge. How is that supposed to hold me for five minutes when the doubt's pounding? Give me one tiny, normal action I can do during those five minutes (something like tracing the rim of a cup or counting backwards) and one short, non-shaming line to say afterward. I'm wiped, so keep it really short.

Therapist: During the 5 minutes, do some subtle toe wiggling. It's a normal, everyday action that doesn't require much attention.

When you feel the urge to check, say to yourself: "I'm still here."

Patient: Okay… I'll try the toe‑wiggle and "I'm still here," but how is that supposed to hold the pounding for five minutes when everything's screaming to check? I'm pretty drained just thinking about it — can we rehearse it now, with you counting the time, and give me one very short fallback line if it still fails?

Therapist: Let's rehearse it. I'll count down from 5 minutes.

5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

As we reach zero, say to yourself: "I'm still here."

If you still reach for your phone, say to yourself: "Not now."

Patient: Okay... I did the countdown with you and the toe‑wiggle, but my hand still slid toward the phone. How is "Not now" supposed to drown out that voice when it's so loud? I'm really wiped — can we try the countdown again but for 30 seconds this time, and give me one extra, very short non‑shaming line if "Not now" doesn't hold? Also, if I'm standing in front of a class and can't wiggle toes, what's one discreet anchor I can use then?

Therapist: Let's try again, this time with a 30-second countdown.

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

As we reach zero, say to yourself: "I'm still here."

If "Not now" doesn't hold, say to yourself: "It's okay, I'll try again."

If you're standing in front of a class and can't wiggle toes, try tapping your right knee three times with your right hand. It's a subtle, everyday action that can help you stay present.

Patient: Okay... I tried the 30‑second countdown and the knee tap and my hand still slid to the phone. I don't have much left in me right now, so keep it really short — give me one more discreet anchor that works when I'm at a podium with my hands visible, the exact one‑line to say silently about the guilt afterward, and can we rehearse the 30‑second countdown one more time? Also — how is that supposed to help when the doubt is shouting louder than any sentence?

Therapist: Let's try again, one last time.

As a discreet anchor when at a podium with your hands visible, try touching the edge of the podium with your left index finger.

After checking, say to yourself: "I did my best."

Let's rehearse the 30-second countdown one more time:

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

Remember, the goal isn't to silence the doubt completely, but to create a small window of time to pause and make a different choice.

Patient: I did the countdown with you again; it loosens things for a second, then my hand still goes to the phone. How is a 30‑second window supposed to undo months of habit when the doubt is shouting so loud? I'm running on fumes—can we rehearse the 30‑second one more time, and give me one exact, non‑shaming line to say immediately after I check that actually helps me move on?

Therapist: It's clear that the 30-second window isn't enough to break the habit.

Let's rehearse the countdown one more time:

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

As soon as you check, say to yourself: "I've checked. I'll be kind to myself."

This line acknowledges what happened, and adds a sense of compassion, which can help you move forward.

Patient: Okay — I said "I've checked. I'll be kind to myself" and it softened the knot for a breath, but the urge still yanked my hand toward the phone. How is a compassion line supposed to undo months of habit when the doubt's shouting louder than any sentence? I'm pretty drained — can we rehearse the 30‑second countdown again, but this time add one immediate, concrete prevention step (like putting the phone in my bag or handing it to my coat) and practice saying the line while doing it?

Therapist: I'm so glad you're willing to keep rehearsing.

Let's try again, this time with an added concrete step. As soon as you feel the urge to check, put your phone in your bag or hand it to your coat.

During the countdown, say to yourself: "I've checked. I'll put it away."

As you put the phone away, say to yourself: "I've checked. I'll put it away."

Let's rehearse it together:

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

We'll keep going until you feel more comfortable with the process.

Patient: Okay... I did the countdown and actually shoved the phone in my bag like you said. It blunted the impulse a bit, but my hand still went for the zipper—how is tucking it away for thirty seconds supposed to stop me from unzipping it? I'm pretty wiped—can we try one more rehearsal where I put the phone completely out of reach before a meeting (like in my car or another room) and practice one short, non-shaming line I can say to myself the second after I slip that actually helps me move on?

Therapist: I'm glad you're making progress.

Let's rehearse this new scenario. We'll put the phone in a location where you can't reach it, like your car or another room.

As soon as you slip up and try to unzip, say to yourself: "I'm strong enough to wait."

This line acknowledges that you're capable of waiting and not giving in to the urge.

Let's rehearse it together. We'll put the phone in the car, and you can pretend to go to the meeting without it. When you feel the urge to unzip, say to yourself: "I'm strong enough to wait."

Patient: I did the car thing—pretended it was out of reach and said "I'm strong enough to wait" when the urge hit; it eased for a second but my hand still went for the zipper. How is putting it away supposed to stop months of habit when the doubt's louder than any line? 

Give me one exact prevention step for the zipper impulse (something I can actually do in the moment), one ultra‑short line to say silently while I move the zipper away, and let’s rehearse the 30‑second countdown one more time—keep it very short, I'm running on empty.
