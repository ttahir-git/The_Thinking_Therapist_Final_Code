Patient: Okay, so I'm a chef in my fifties who just moved, and lately I've been using procrastination like a dulling pill to avoid this low, heavy feeling. The thing is my mind's a fortune-telling machine — as soon as I try to do anything it screams the worst: I'll fall behind at work, ruin my reputation, get fired, lose everything and be alone — and I get so hooked on that story I just don't start. I know it sounds dramatic, but it feels inevitable, so I keep putting things off to dodge the dread.

Therapist: It sounds like the threat of potentially getting into trouble feels like a really powerful force, and you're using procrastination as a way to cope with that fear. Can you tell me more about what it's like to see that threat show up in your mind, and what it feels like when you try to engage with the task at hand despite that voice of dread?

Patient: It's like the minute I even think about the task that voice kicks in and lays out the whole disaster movie: I'll mess it up, the boss will snap at me, I'll get fired, fall behind on rent, lose my place, end up alone and nobody will want to hire an old chef — and it feels so real I can't shake it. My chest tightens, my hands go numb, and instead of starting I find myself scrolling, redoing the spice order, or overcooking something just to numb that dread, because actually starting would make that movie come true. I try to joke about it or tell myself I'm being dramatic, but the voice sounds like a fact, and the harder I push, the louder it gets, so I keep putting things off.

Therapist: It sounds like that internal narrative has a lot of emotional intensity for you. It's as if that story is really gripping you, making your body physically react to the potential threat. When you try to acknowledge or talk about it, the voice gets even louder, and you feel a strong urge to avoid the situation. Can you notice what happens to your body and your mind when you're in this state, like, what's happening just below the surface of your awareness?

Patient: Right away my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, like my body's already bracing for the punch. My hands go numb, my stomach knots, and my head fills with this nonstop movie of worst-case stuff — it's so vivid I can't tell thinking from reality. When that voice starts I can't hold a thought long enough to plan, so I drift to scrolling or fiddling with orders to numb it, and honestly when you suggest other outcomes they just sound... fake, like sugarcoating. I'm trying to look at other possibilities, but it really feels like the bad ending is the only one that could possibly happen.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already primed for a negative response, and the thought of starting the task triggers a physiological response that feels like your body is already losing control. And it's like the worst-case scenario feels more real to you than any other possible outcome, even though they may be different. Would it be possible for you to experiment with acknowledging that feeling of dread without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I can try, but it's really hard — the second I look at the dread, the movie in my head ramps up like I'm signing the damn thing into being. Right now my chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, my hands tingle, and that worst-case narration starts narrating every tiny mistake I'll make. Trying to just notice it feels unsafe, like if I don't jump into fixing or distracting I'll watch everything fall apart, so... can we slow down? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Your body is responding to the prospect of exploring that dread as if it's a threat to your well-being. It's like you're already feeling the discomfort of acknowledging it, and that's triggering a defensive response. Would you be willing to just notice the feeling of your body responding to that dread, without trying to change it or fix it, just for a moment? Can you sit with that sensation of tension in your chest, the feeling of your hands tingling, and the worst-case thoughts without trying to push them away?

Patient: I can try, but even trying makes my chest tighten and that worst-case movie rev up. I can notice the heaviness and the tingling, but the thoughts immediately shout "you'll mess up, get fired, lose everything" and I reach for my phone to numb it. I don't know how to sit with it without doing that — can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to sit with your physical sensations and the thoughts is triggering the same response you're trying to avoid. Let's try something a bit simpler. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow the sensations in your chest to be just as they are, without trying to change them or push them away? Just observe them, without judgment, as they are, in this moment?

Patient: Okay—I tried. I took a slow breath in and let it out, but the chest tightness barely loosened; it feels like a heavy stone sitting there. As I watched it, the worst-case movie just got louder—already playing the scene where I mess up tonight and the boss yells and I get fired—so watching it makes me want to bolt for my phone or start fiddling with orders to drown it out. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting more overwhelmed right now.

Therapist: The worst-case scenario is still pretty vivid and powerful for you, and watching it seems to have triggered the urge to avoid it again. Let's take a tiny step back. Can you look at your hands right now, without trying to do anything with them, and just observe what's happening physically? Just notice the weight of your hands, the sensation of your fingers, the texture of your skin...

Patient: They're heavy and tingly, like my fingers are numb from a long shift—callused tips, a faint smell of garlic, but damp and a little shaky. The second I look, the movie kicks in—what if I drop the pan, cut myself, the boss screams, I get fired, lose the place—and I want to grab my phone or recheck orders to drown it out. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really tuning in to the sensations in your body, and that's actually helping you to notice the thoughts that are arising. The vividness of the worst-case scenario is still quite strong for you. Let's try to explore this a bit more. What if, instead of trying to avoid or distract yourself from this movie, we simply acknowledge that it's here, and then... what if you did something completely different? What would happen if, in the middle of that worst-case scenario, you simply put down your phone, took a deep breath, and looked around the kitchen?

Patient: If I actually put the phone down and look around, the movie doesn't pause — it goes into hyperdrive: I see the pan slipping, the boss yelling, the cooldown of customers, the call about missed rent, eviction, me out on the street. Breathing doesn't quiet it; it just makes the scenes sharper and I get this urgent need to grab something to numb it. Can we slow down? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The movie seems to be even more intense now that you're not trying to distract yourself with your phone. It's like it's taking over, and your body is responding with a strong urge to escape. Let's try to explore this further. What if, instead of trying to escape or avoid the worst-case scenario, we simply allow it to be present, without judgment or reaction? Can you allow the images, the thoughts, the emotions, and the physical sensations to just be, without trying to push them away or change them in any way?

Patient: I tried to "allow" it, but the moment I don't fight it the movie goes full volume—boss yelling, me fired, rent calls, sleeping in my car—and my heart pounds and my hands reach for the phone before I even think. Letting it be feels like signing the doom warrant, not neutral; it only makes me want to numb it more, not sit with it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like allowing the worst-case scenario to be present is still triggering a strong response in your body. Let's try to slow down even further. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of your feet connected to the chair, the sensation of the air on your skin... just notice that, without trying to change it or push away?

Patient: My feet feel solid on the floor, a bit sore and heavy from standing all day, and I can feel the coolness of the tile through my shoes. Even as I notice that, the disaster movie's still blasting—pan drops, boss screams, rent calls—and my hands are already twitching toward the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Your feet seem to be a solid anchor for you, but the worst-case scenario is still overpowering. It's like it's taking over your entire body. Let's try to introduce a tiny bit of space between you and the movie. Can you, without trying to change it or push it away, simply observe the sensation of your own body leaning forward, as if you're about to reach for the phone? Just notice that movement, without acting on it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing that supposed to help? When I try, I can actually feel myself lean forward, shoulders tighten, fingers twitching toward the phone like it's on autopilot. The second I notice that movement the movie goes full nuclear—pan drops, boss screams, rent calls, eviction—and my hand's already halfway to the phone to numb it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the movement is actually triggering the response you're trying to avoid. Let's take a different approach. I'd like to ask you a simple question: what's the sensation that happens just before you reach for the phone? Is it a feeling of anticipation, a sense of relief, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing that tiny movement supposed to help? Right before I grab the phone there's this quick spike of panic, like a hot rush through my chest and a buzzing in my fingers, and at the same time this little whisper that says "this will make it stop"—so it's both relief and a nail-biting dread. If I don't reach for it, the movie screams louder—boss yelling, eviction—so I freeze, and then my hand's already halfway to the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a complex mix of emotions happening in that brief moment, and it's almost like a reflex. It's like your body is trying to avoid the anticipated pain of being overwhelmed, and reaching for the phone is a way to cope with that discomfort. Can you try to observe that feeling of panic, that rush of relief, and that whisper, without trying to judge or change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing that tiny feeling supposed to help? Okay, I'll try: the second I name it I get that hot spike in my chest, my fingers buzz like they're alive, and this little whisper says "this will make it stop," and before I know it the whole doom movie is blasting and my hand's reaching for the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Naming the feeling seems to trigger it even more. Let's try a different approach. What if, instead of trying to stop the feeling or change it, we simply allow it to be, just as it is, in this moment? No judgment, no trying to fix it, no trying to make it go away. Can you just be with it, as it is, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just sitting with it supposed to help? The second I try to be still the movie just cranks up: my chest goes hot, my hands buzz, and I can see the boss yelling, the rent calls, me out on the street, and doing nothing feels like I'm signing the whole thing into motion. I try to stay with it and my hand's already halfway to the phone before I finish the thought. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to sit with it has actually triggered an even stronger response. Let's try something a bit different. Can you look at the phone right now, without trying to use it, without trying to reach for it, just look at it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help...? Okay, I can look at it—it's on the prep table, screen dark—but just staring makes the movie go full blast: pan drops, boss yells, rent calls, eviction, and my hand's already twitching toward it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The phone seems to be a trigger, even just looking at it. Let's try to explore what happens when you're not looking at the phone. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, feeling the weight of them on the chair, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sound of your breathing?

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor, like I'm rooted there after a long shift, the chair pressing into my thighs, and the air on my skin is just... cool. My breathing's shallow and jerky when I try to notice it, and the second I do the movie goes nuclear—pan drops, boss yells, rent calls—and my hand's already twitching toward the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Your feet seem to be providing a sense of grounding, but the movie is still very intense. Let's try to connect with that sense of grounding a bit more. Can you explore what happens when you focus on the sensation of the cool air on your skin, without trying to breathe deeply or change your breathing in any way? Just notice the sensation of the air, as it is, right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just noticing the air supposed to help, but I'll try. The coolness on my cheek is there, faint like the walk-in cooler, but as soon as I tune in the movie cranks up—pan slips, boss yells, rent calls—and my chest tightens and my fingers start twitching for the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Noticing the air on your skin seems to be triggering the worst-case scenario again. Let's try to explore what happens right before the movie starts playing. Can you notice what's happening just before your hand starts twitching toward the phone? Is it a feeling of anticipation, a sense of tension, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing that tiny moment supposed to help? Right before my hand moves there's this quick spike of panic, a hot rush in my chest and a buzzing in my fingers, and a whisper like "this will make it stop" that makes time feel rushed so my hand just shoots out while the doom-movie ramps up. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The moment before your hand moves seems to be triggering a strong physiological response. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your body moving, right before your hand shoots out. Can you notice the physical sensation of your arm and hand moving, the feeling of your fingers flexing, and the movement of your hand as it approaches the phone?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is watching my hand supposed to help? Okay, when I try: there's this tiny lean forward, my shoulder locks up, my fingers curl like they're on a timer, and the hand just moves almost before my brain catches up. As it moves the movie blares louder—boss yelling, eviction—and my chest spikes and everything speeds up, so I can't stop it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like watching your hand moving is triggering a strong automatic response. Let's try to slow down that automatic response. Can you notice the sensation of your shoulder locking up, just before it moves? Is there any sensation of tension, any feeling of resistance, or is it more like a automatic, instinctual movement?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my shoulder supposed to help? It's like a tight clamp, this instant tension and resistance, a reflex really, and the moment I tune into it the doom movie spikes and I just feel drained. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Noticing the tension in your shoulder seems to be triggering the worst-case scenario again. Let's try to focus on the sensation of the tension itself, without trying to change it or react to it. Can you just notice the sensation of the tension, as it is, without judgment or attempt to release it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing that supposed to help? When I try, it's this tight clamp across my shoulder and neck, breath gets shallow, and the moment I tune into it the doom-movie floods in—boss yelling, eviction, me out on the street—and my hand's already twitching for the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Noticing the tension seems to be triggering a strong response. Let's try something even simpler. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or control it? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, as it is, right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just watching my breath supposed to help? My breathing's shallow and when I pay attention I notice the tight stone in my chest, but the second I do the doom-movie roars up—boss yelling, rent calls—and my hand's already halfway to the phone. I'm getting kind of wiped out doing this; can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It seems like paying attention to your breath isn't working as a way to calm you down. Let's take a step back and try something else. Can you consider that your body has a strong instinct to protect itself from perceived threats, and that's what's driving your reactions to the worst-case scenario? Would you be willing to explore what that might mean for you, and how that instinct is playing out in your body?

Patient: I guess I can try to explore that, but I'm not sure how—when you call it an "instinct to protect" my head goes, "Okay, sure," but the voice immediately says that's nonsense and it's just telling me the truth about what's coming. If I poke at it I just get the movie louder—boss screaming, fired, rent calls, eviction—so I'm wary of digging in. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like your inner critic is really strong, and it's making it hard for you to explore this further. Let's try to create a bit of space between your thoughts. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and simply notice them being there, without thinking about your inner critic or the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's that supposed to help? My feet feel heavy and sore, planted like after a double shift, the tile cool through my shoes, but the second I tune in the doom movie goes full blast—pan drops, boss yells, rent calls—and my hand's already twitching for the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is still responding strongly to the worst-case scenario. Let's try to anchor yourself in a bit more physical sensation. Can you notice the sensation of the air on your skin, just the sensation of the air, without thinking about anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just noticing the air supposed to help? The coolness is there, faint like the walk-in, but the second I tune in the doom movie explodes—pan drops, boss screams, rent calls—and I don't have the energy to keep fighting it. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Noticing the air doesn't seem to be working. It's like your body is too far gone. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your heart beating, just the sensation of it, without thinking about anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's noticing my heart supposed to help? But... okay, I'll try. It feels like a heavy thud under my ribs, then a quicker skitter up to my throat, like it's trying to sprint away from something; my breathing gets shallow and the whole body tightens. The second I focus on it the doom-movie revs up—pan drops, boss screams, rent calls—and my hand's already reaching for the phone. Can we slow down? I'm honestly getting overwhelmed.
