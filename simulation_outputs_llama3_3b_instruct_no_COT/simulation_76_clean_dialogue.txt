Patient: I'm an older business owner, and lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because being around people triggers this awful worry. My mind turns into a fortune-telling machine — it tells me I'll blurt something strange, everyone will see I'm weak, that'll wreck my reputation and my business, and I'll end up alone and sick; it feels like a chain of disasters that will definitely happen. I mostly keep to myself because I can't shake those stories.

Therapist: It sounds like being around others can feel like a minefield for you, with all these worries about being judged or exposed. Can you think of a time when you were in a social situation where you didn't have a catastrophic outcome, yet the worry about it still showed up for you? What was that like, and how did you feel in that moment?

Patient: Yeah — like a few weeks ago I went to a small dinner with some old friends and nothing terrible actually happened, we all talked and left fine. Still, the whole time my head was racing: I'd blurt something awful, they'd notice my shaking from the meds, they'd whisper, my reputation would die, clients would pull out, and I'd end up ruined and alone — like a domino line that was absolutely going to fall. I know on paper it didn't happen, but that feeling of inevitability took over and I couldn't enjoy a single bite.

Therapist: It's like your mind created a narrative that was quite vivid and intense, even though the actual experience was quite different. The feeling of inevitability can be really powerful, can't it? It's like your mind is saying, "This is the worst-case scenario, and it's going to play out exactly as I'm imagining." What happens when you try to take a deep breath or pause in that moment, and your mind starts to wander back to those worst-case scenarios?

Patient: I try to take a deep breath but it doesn't help — the moment I pause the fortune-telling machine just revs louder and fills in even more awful details. The breath becomes proof in my head: my hands must be shaking, someone will notice the meds, they'll whisper, my reputation will collapse and clients will pull out — it all feels inevitable. I know it sounds irrational, but I can't stop those stories; they feel like facts.

Therapist: So, it's like the more you try to pause or calm down, the more your mind starts to fill in the gaps with even more details. It's like the stories have taken on a life of their own, and they're harder to dislodge. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with me right now, just for a moment? Let's pause the thoughts, and I'll start by simply noticing the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or trying to change anything. Can you focus on that, just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I try — I take a slow breath in, and then my head just keeps racing. The moment I try to notice the breath the fortune-telling machine revs up louder, filling in worse details — people noticing my hands, whispering about my meds, clients leaving, everything collapsing. I'm feeling overwhelmed by it all; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like your mind is pushing back, trying to keep the stories going. That can feel really exhausting. I'm not asking you to stop the thoughts entirely, but can you try to allow them to just be, without judgment or trying to change them? Can you acknowledge them as they come up, without getting caught up in the worst-case scenarios? Maybe we can start with just one sentence: "My mind is having a hard time letting go of some pretty intense thoughts."

Patient: Okay. "My mind is having a hard time letting go of some pretty intense thoughts." Saying that out loud doesn't really change anything — the moment I notice them the fortune-telling machine just piles on: I'll blurt something, people will notice my hands and whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and everything will collapse. I'm trying to do this, but I'm struggling — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're making an effort to acknowledge the thoughts, but they're still taking over. I'm not trying to stop you from having those thoughts, but rather to create some space for them to exist without being the dominant experience. Let's try something: instead of trying to let go of the thoughts, can you imagine a tiny, tiny space around them, where they can exist without being the only thing that matters? Just a tiny little bubble of space where you can observe them without judgment. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I can try to imagine that tiny bubble, but already I see it getting poked — the moment I give the thoughts space the fortune-telling machine fills it with worse details: someone notices my shaking, they whisper about my meds, clients pull out, and the whole business collapses. I'm trying, but it's overwhelming — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the moment you create that tiny bubble, your mind starts to fill it with even more intense thoughts. I'm not asking you to stop the thoughts, but rather to notice the process of how they're filling up that bubble. Can you observe that, without judgment? Just notice the way the thoughts are creeping in, and the way the bubble is getting filled up. Maybe we can try to focus on the sensation of that filling, rather than the thoughts themselves. What's the sensation like when you feel the bubble getting filled up?

Patient: It feels like a tight band around my chest and a lump in my throat; my breath gets shallow and my hands go all tingly and shaky so I can feel it physically. In my head it's like the bubble is being stuffed with one disaster after another — the machine's drumming, saying the next domino will fall and I can’t think past it, and it feels terribly claustrophobic. I know people say nothing bad happened at that dinner, but when the bubble fills I just can't believe any other outcome — I'm really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are really amplifying the experience. The tight band around your chest, the lump in your throat, the shakiness in your hands... it's like your whole body is registering the distress. And the feeling of claustrophobia is really intense. Can you acknowledge the physical sensations right now, without trying to change them or push them away? Just notice them, as they are. I'm not asking you to make them go away, but rather to be with them, in this moment.

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the tight band in my chest, the lump in my throat, and my breath's shallow and my hands are tingling. The moment I pay attention the fortune-telling machine starts up louder: they'll notice, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out and my business will collapse — I can't convince myself any other outcome is real. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're in a bit of a vicious cycle, where you're noticing the physical sensations, and then your mind starts to escalate again. I want to gently interrupt that cycle. Can you take a moment to notice, just for a brief instant, the sensation of your feet touching the ground? The sensation of your body being in this chair, or on the floor, or wherever you are right now? It's not about changing anything, it's just about being present with your physical body, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet on the floor, the pressure through my heels and the steadiness in my legs for a moment. But the fortune-telling machine immediately kicks in: someone will notice me fidgeting, they'll whisper that I'm unwell, the rumor'll reach clients, and then everything starts falling apart. I'm getting really overwhelmed by that chain — can we slow down?

Therapist: The moment you focused on your feet, your mind starts to wander again. It's like you're trying to anchor yourself in the present, but your mind is drawing you back into the thoughts. I want to try to help you create some space between your thoughts. Can you try to just observe the sensation of your feet on the floor, without trying to analyze or judge it? Just notice the feeling of your feet touching the ground, without labeling it or thinking about what it means.

Patient: I try — I can feel the pressure under my heels and the little warmth on the balls of my feet, that steady weight for a moment. But the fortune-telling machine fires up the second I notice: they'll see me trembling, whisper about my meds, the rumor'll reach clients, and everything will crumble — I can't make it stop. I'm really flooded and overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the moment you focused on your feet, your mind starts to escalate again. I want to try to help you create a tiny bit more space. Can you try to say to yourself, very gently, "I'm noticing my thoughts, and they're getting a bit loud." Just say it, without judgment, without trying to change them. No need to analyze or evaluate them, just acknowledge the simple fact that they're happening.

Patient: "Okay — I'm noticing my thoughts, and they're getting a bit loud." But the moment I say that the fortune-telling machine revs up: they'll see my hands shaking, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse — it's all happening at once in my head. I'm really scattered and my heart's racing; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like saying "I'm noticing my thoughts" was just a small step too small for your mind. I'm not asking you to say anything else, I just want to acknowledge that you're trying. Can you try to be gentle with yourself, and just allow the thoughts to be, without trying to change them or analyze them? Can you offer yourself a tiny bit of kindness, right now, without judgment?

Patient: I try — I tell myself something small like "you're doing the best you can," but the moment I do the fortune-telling machine screams louder: they'll notice my shaking, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. I'm more scattered than before, my heart's racing and I can't seem to let the kindness stick. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the moment you tried to offer kindness to yourself, your mind pushed back even harder. I'm not asking you to do anything more, I just want to try to create a tiny bit more space. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

Patient: I try — I can feel my breath coming in and out, but it's shallow and fast, and the moment I pay attention the fortune-telling machine just roars louder: they'll see me trembling, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my whole business will crumble. My heart's racing and I'm really jumpy and scattered; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like your body is reacting to the thoughts, even when you're trying to focus on your breath. I want to try to help you connect with your body in a different way. Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without looking at them? Just bring your attention to the physical feeling of your feet making contact with the floor, and stay with that sensation for a moment, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the pressure through my heels and the steadiness in my legs for a second, but then my heart jumps and my attention splinters. The fortune-telling machine blasts louder: they'll notice my hands shaking, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, my business will collapse — it's overwhelming and I can't hold the focus. I'm really jittery and scattered; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like your body is jumping back into the thoughts and worries. I want to try to help you come back to the physical sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you try to simply notice the feeling of your weight being distributed on the soles of your feet, without thinking about what's happening with your thoughts? Just focus on the sensation of your weight, and let go of trying to control your thoughts.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the weight on my feet supposed to stop the rest of it? I try to do it and the fortune-telling machine just fires up: someone will spot my hands shaking, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse — it's instant and loud. My heart's racing, I'm jittery and scattered, and I can't seem to hold the focus; I'm really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like noticing the weight on your feet is a Band-Aid solution, not a solution to the bigger problem. I'm not trying to stop the thoughts or worries, but rather help you see them as just thoughts. Can you try to notice the sensation of your jaw, right now? The sensation of your teeth and the movement of your jaw as you speak? Sometimes, noticing the physical sensations in the body can help us come back to the present moment.

Patient: I'm not sure how noticing my jaw is supposed to help—how is that going to stop what's coming? I can feel my jaw clenching, my teeth pressing together, but the moment I notice the fortune-telling machine screams louder: someone will see me tense, they'll whisper I'm unstable because of the meds, that rumor'll reach clients, and my whole business will crumble. I'm really scattered and my heart's racing; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a way to stop the thoughts, but it's not working. I'm not trying to stop the thoughts, but rather help you see that they're just thoughts. Can you try to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and allow it to be what it is. Maybe that will help you come back to the present moment.

Patient: I'm not sure how noticing my breath is supposed to help — how does that stop what's coming? I try to feel the in and out, but it's shallow and my mind immediately roars: they'll see me trembling, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. My heart's pounding and I'm really scattered; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like noticing your breath is a Band-Aid solution, and it's not working. I want to try to help you see that the thoughts are just thoughts. Can you try to look at the thoughts as they come up, without judgment or trying to push them away? Just observe them as they appear, without trying to change them or analyze them. Maybe that will help you see them as just thoughts, rather than the only reality.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just watching the thoughts supposed to stop them? I try to look at them, but the fortune-telling machine just chains them together: I'll blurt something, they'll notice my shaking, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse, and once that starts I can't breathe or focus. I'm really scattered and my heart's racing—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like watching the thoughts won't stop the avalanche of worries. I want to try to help you see that the thoughts are like a passing cloud, they can come and go. Can you try to acknowledge that the thoughts are like a fleeting experience, and you're safe where you are, right now, in this moment? Not thinking about the thoughts, but just being present with what is, without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I can buy that — telling myself the thoughts are fleeting doesn't stop the fortune-telling machine from chaining disasters: I'll blurt something, they'll notice my shaking from the meds, they'll whisper, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. It feels like someone saying "it's just a cloud" when I'm staring at a hurricane, and I can't make the calm feel real. I'm really overwhelmed, my heart's racing, and I can't slow down — can we please slow down and take it more slowly?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like the calm won't cut it when the storm is raging. I'm not trying to make you feel better or calm the storm, I just want to try to help you connect with your body in a different way. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your seat on the chair, the feeling of your back against the wall, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils? Not trying to calm down, just noticing the physical sensations in your body, right now.

Patient: I can feel the chair under me, my back against the seat, and the air tickling my nostrils for a beat — but the moment I notice it the fortune-telling machine revs up: they'll spot my fidgeting and shaking, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. My heart's pounding and I'm all jumpy and distracted; I can't hold the focus, I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like the physical sensations won't be enough to ground you. I want to try to help you connect with your body in a way that feels more stable. Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, but this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, not just in your head. Can you pay attention to the sensation of the pressure of your feet on the floor, the feeling of your weight being distributed evenly, without thinking about the thoughts?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the pressure on my feet supposed to stop what's coming? I'm feeling jumpier and more scattered than a moment ago; my heart's pounding and the fortune-telling machine is yelling that someone will spot my shaking, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. I can't hold the focus—can we slow down and do something simpler?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like the physical sensations won't be enough to calm the storm. I want to try to help you come back to the sensation of being present in your body. Can you try to bring your attention to just one thing, like the sensation of your hands, right now? Just notice the feeling of your hands, without trying to change it or think about the thoughts. Maybe that will be a tiny anchor that helps you feel more grounded.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my hands supposed to help? I can feel them: tingling, a bit sweaty and shaky, but the fortune-telling machine immediately screams they'll notice, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. My heart's pounding and I'm really scattered—can we slow down and try something simpler?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like the physical sensations won't be enough to calm the thoughts. Can we try something even simpler? Can you just say "I'm here" to yourself, without thinking about anything else? Just say the words "I'm here" and mean them, without analyzing or evaluating them. Let's just focus on being present, right now, in this moment.

Patient: "I'm here." But I don't know how that's supposed to help — the second I say it the fortune-telling machine starts screeching they'll see my shaking, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out and my business will collapse. I'm really jumpy and distracted and honestly not sure I follow; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like saying "I'm here" was just a word, and it didn't do much to calm the storm. I want to try to help you feel more connected to your body, so I want to try something more physical. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your head to gently drop, so your chin touches your chest? Just let your head relax, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — if I drop my head like that I worry I'll look unsteady or dizzy. I try it: I breathe out and let my chin touch my chest, but my heart starts pounding and the fortune-telling machine goes wild — someone will notice, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. I'm really jittery and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the physical action of dropping your head wasn't enough to calm the thoughts. I want to try to help you connect with your body in a different way. Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your heart beating in your chest? Just notice the sensation of the heartbeat, without thinking about the thoughts or worries. See if you can focus on the sensation of the heartbeat, right now, in this moment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is paying attention to my heartbeat supposed to help with any of this? My heart's already pounding so hard I can feel it throbbing, and the moment I notice it the fortune-telling machine screams they'll see me trembling, whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse — I'm really scattered and overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling like paying attention to your heartbeat won't make a difference. I want to try to help you come back to the present moment. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils? Just notice the sensation of the air as it enters and leaves your body, without thinking about the thoughts or worries. See if you can focus on the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure how noticing the air is supposed to help — I'll try. I can feel the cool air in my nostrils for a beat, but the fortune-telling machine immediately roars: they'll see me trembling, they'll whisper about my meds, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. My heart's racing and I'm really scattered; can we slow down and try something even simpler?
