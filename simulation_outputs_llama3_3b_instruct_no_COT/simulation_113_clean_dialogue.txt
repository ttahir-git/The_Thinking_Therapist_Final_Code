Patient: I'm a manager and lately I keep putting things off — not because I'm lazy but because getting started brings up this knot of worry about adjusting to recent changes and our finances. I guess I use procrastination to numb those uncomfortable feelings and it's getting in the way of both work and home. I don't know, talking about it feels...hard.

Therapist: It sounds like getting started on those tasks feels like a bit of a minefield for you. What's the first thing that comes up for you when you think about starting – is it a specific task, or more of a general feeling of overwhelm, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's a bit of both. Sometimes it's a specific thing — opening the monthly accounts or answering a tense email — and that brings this knot in my stomach, like I'll be exposed as not handling things. Other times it's just a fog of overwhelm and I end up doing busywork or fiddling with small tasks to avoid the feeling. I guess talking about it already feels a little raw, so I'm not sure how deep I can go right now.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing a bit of a sense of vulnerability in acknowledging and describing your struggles with getting started. That can be a brave and courageous step. Can you take a moment to observe that knot in your stomach – is it a physical sensation, a feeling in your chest, or more of a sense of mental unease?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's mostly a tightness in my chest and this knot in my stomach, and my head gets kind of fuzzy like I can't think straight. When that happens I just drift into small, pointless tasks so I don't have to sit with it, but I'm not sure how to explain it more than that.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be really disorienting. Would you be willing to try to observe this "fuzzy" headspace without trying to push away or distract yourself – just notice it, for a moment, without judgment or trying to label it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, though it's really uncomfortable. When I notice it there's this dull buzzing in my head, my chest gets tight, and my thoughts just scatter — like I keep looking for something else to do. Can we go slower? I'm not sure how long I can sit with this without wanting to escape.

Therapist: Let's take a very slow and small step back – just notice the sensation of your breath, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or focus on the buzzing in your head. Can you bring your attention to that breath, just for a moment, and allow yourself to settle into it?

Patient: I did try to focus on my breath. I don't know, it's... a little easier, like the fuzziness quiets for a moment, but my chest is still tight and my mind keeps jumping to the accounts I haven't done. I guess it helps briefly, but it feels vulnerable and I worry about getting stuck on it. Can we keep it slow? I'm not sure I can stay with this for long.

Therapist: The brief moment of calm can be a gentle nudge, but the underlying discomfort still feels present. Can you acknowledge that it's okay to allow yourself to feel that discomfort, even if it's uncomfortable – just notice it, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to let it be, but it feels really exposed and my chest just tightens. Can we slow down? I keep getting pulled to those accounts and emails — it's like my mind wants to escape the feeling.

Therapist: Your mind is already trying to find a way to escape the discomfort. What's the first thing your mind wants to escape to – is it a thought about the accounts, or a memory, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it usually goes straight to the accounts or that tense email — this worry I'll be exposed as not handling things. If it's not that, my mind grabs at small, pointless stuff like checking emails, making tea, or reorganizing papers to avoid the feeling. Can we slow down? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about it.

Therapist: It feels like your mind is trying to distract itself from the discomfort. What if, instead of avoiding those tasks, you allowed yourself to just be with the feeling of not being sure how to handle those accounts and that email – without judgment, just allowing it to be?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to let it be, but it feels like admitting I'm failing and that makes my chest tighten. When I do notice it, my head just jumps to the accounts or that email and I want to get up and do anything else. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how long I can stay with this without wanting to escape.

Therapist: It feels like the fear of not being able to handle things is very present for you. Would you be willing to try a small experiment – just to see what would happen if you didn't get up and do something to escape the feeling right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but it's really uncomfortable and I can already feel the urge to get up. Can we make it really short—like 30 seconds—and can you guide me through what to do so I don't panic?

Therapist: Let's take 30 seconds, and I'll guide you through it. I want you to simply notice the sensation in your body – the tightness in your chest, the feeling of restlessness – without trying to change it or escape it. Just observe it, and allow it to be, for 30 seconds. I'll be here with you, and we'll stop when the time is up. Are you ready to try?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try for 30 seconds. My chest is already tight—can you guide me really slowly through each breath?

Therapist: Let's start with your breath. Bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, notice the sensation of your diaphragm expanding, and the air filling your lungs. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your diaphragm dropping, and the air leaving your body. Allow your attention to stay on this sensation, just on the breath, without trying to change it or get caught up in thoughts. Just breathe.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm trying to follow. Focusing on the breath eases the fuzziness a bit, but my chest is still tight and my mind keeps running through the accounts I haven't done. Can you keep guiding me slowly—maybe count the breaths? I'm worried it'll get worse if I stay with it.

Therapist: Let's try counting the breaths together. I'll start counting from one, and you focus on your breath. As you inhale, I'll say "one", and as you exhale, I'll say "two". Let's start again, and this time, when you feel your mind starting to wander, gently bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath, without judgment. We'll start now: one...

Patient: Two... I guess I can follow that. It helps a little—like the fuzziness eases for a moment—but my chest is still tight and my mind keeps snapping back to the accounts and that email. I don't know, can we keep going slower? I'm afraid I'll start fidgeting or bolt.

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. As you exhale, I'll say "three". Take a deep breath in... (pause) ...and let's start again. One... Your attention is already returning, and the fuzziness is creeping back in. That's okay – just acknowledge it, and let's try again.

Patient: Three... I don't know, it's getting tighter—my chest and my head feel like they're closing in and my mind's already back on the accounts and that email. I guess the counting helps a little, but I'm scared if I stay with it too long it'll spike and I'll have to get up and do something to calm down. Can we slow down? Maybe... can we talk about a tiny, concrete thing I could try at work that wouldn't feel like admitting I'm failing?

Therapist: It sounds like the counting is helping, but you're still feeling a bit anxious about staying with it. Talking about a concrete action at work might be a good way to build some confidence. What's one small thing, unrelated to the accounts or email, that you could do in the next 30 minutes that would feel like a manageable, low-stakes action?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try a short 10-minute walk outside—just to get away from my desk and the urge to fidget. I'm worried it'll just feel like another avoidance move, though, so can we keep it really small and talk about how to make it actually helpful?

Therapist: Taking a short walk outside can be a great way to clear your head. What if, instead of using it as a way to escape from the discomfort, you see it as an opportunity to practice being present with the physical sensations in your body, while you're walking? Instead of trying to avoid or distract yourself, try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the movement of your legs, and the rhythm of your breath, as you walk.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the walk, but when I try to be present there’s this flush of shame and frustration that comes up and makes me want to run back and "fix" things. I'm worried it'll just be another way to avoid the accounts. Maybe I could set a 10-minute timer for the walk and—when I get back—spend 5 minutes writing just one tiny next step for the accounts. Can you help me figure out what that one step could be so it doesn't feel like admitting I'm failing?

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that the desire to avoid or "fix" things can be a strong trigger for you. Setting a timer and breaking down the task into a smaller, more manageable step can be really helpful. What if that tiny next step for the accounts was simply "reviewing the email, and writing down the one action I would take if I needed to respond to it, without having to worry about the rest"? Would that feel more like a small, achievable action that doesn't feel like admitting failure?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that does sound more doable, but even that brings up this rush of shame and frustration like I'm being shown up for not coping, and my chest tightens. Maybe even smaller—just open the email and read the first line, or write one possible reply sentence and don't send it—something that feels almost ridiculous in its tiny-ness. Can you help me pick which tiny version to try and keep me from spiraling into "fixing" mode?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to a breakthrough. What if, for just this tiny step, you focus on the physical sensation of the action itself, rather than the emotions that come up? Instead of "I'm being shown up for not coping," try to notice the sensation of your fingers on the keyboard, the movement of your eyes scanning the email, or the sound of your breath as you read the first line. Can you try just doing that – being present with the physical sensation of the action, without judgment or emotional commentary?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but just thinking about focusing on the physical parts brings up this hot sting of shame and a rush of frustration at myself. Maybe I'll do the 10-minute walk with a timer, and when I get back I'll open the email, read the first line, and type one draft sentence—then stop. Can you guide me through noticing my fingers and my breath as I type that one sentence? Keep it really slow and count me through the first few keystrokes so I don't spiral.

Therapist: Let's take it very slow and focus on the physical sensations as you type. I'll count the keystrokes with you. One... As you place your fingers on the keyboard, notice the weight of your hands, the sensation of your fingers touching the keys, and the gentle pressure as you press down. Two... As you start to type, notice the movement of your fingers, the sound of the keys clicking, and the sensation of the words appearing on the screen. Three... Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice how your chest feels, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Four... As you type the first letter of your sentence, notice the sound of the keys, the feeling of the words on the screen, and the sensation of your fingers moving.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. My fingers feel kind of heavy on the keys—one—I'm typing, "I'll read the first line and jot one small action," and the keys click and it feels oddly loud. My chest is tight and there's this hot sting of shame that makes me want to stop—can you keep counting me through the rest slowly?

Therapist: Let's keep going at a very slow pace. Five... As you type the "I'll", notice the sensation of the word appearing on the screen, the feeling of the keys releasing, and the pause as you consider what to type next. Six... Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice how your chest feels, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Seven... As you type the "read the first line", notice the sound of the keys, the feeling of your fingers moving, and the sensation of the words appearing on the screen. Eight... The cursor blinks on the screen, and you're ready to type the next part of your sentence. Nine... Your finger hovers over the keyboard, poised to type the next word...

Patient: Ten... I press the keys and finish the sentence: "I'll read the first line and jot one small action, then stop." There's this hot sting of shame and frustration right behind my ribs, like I'm being shown up, and my hands feel heavy like I might pull away. I don't know, I guess I can stay with this a little longer—can you guide me through the pause after I hit save so I don't bolt?

Therapist: It sounds like you've reached a pause point. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that sensation of shame and frustration. Notice it, without judgment or trying to change it. Then, I want you to bring your attention to the physical sensation of your hands, still on the keyboard, and the sensation of the weight of the mouse or the desk beneath them. Simply notice how they feel, without trying to do anything with them. As you sit there, allow yourself to stay with this pause for just one more breath...

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try one more breath. In–out, and it quiets the fuzz for a moment, but there's this hot sting of shame and frustration right behind my ribs and my hands feel heavy like I might pull away. Can we keep it really slow? Maybe sit with me while I set the 10-minute timer for the walk, and then—when I get back—can you guide me to open the email and count me through typing one draft sentence so I don't spiral?

Therapist: Let's stay right here together. I'll set the timer for you, and we'll wait together until it goes off. As we wait, I'll offer a gentle, non-judgmental presence. When the timer goes off, we'll take a deep breath together, and I'll guide you through opening the email and typing that one sentence. Sound good?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay. My chest's still tight and there's this hot, shameful edge that makes me want to bolt, but I'll try to stay for the timer — please stay with me and give me a slow reminder to breathe when it goes off.

Therapist: I'll be right here with you. Take a deep breath in... and out... and I'll set the timer for 10 minutes. We'll wait together until it goes off. When it does, we'll take another deep breath in... and out... and I'll guide you through opening the email and typing that one sentence, nice and slow.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to stay for the ten minutes, but there's this sharp shame that keeps wanting me to bolt. If it spikes, can you give me one very simple grounding thing to do in the moment—like press my feet into the floor or name three things I can see? And when the timer goes off, please guide me gently through the breath and then count me through opening the email so I don't spiral.

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that shame is still present. If it spikes, we can use a grounding technique to bring yourself back to the present moment. One simple thing you can do is to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Where do you feel your feet make contact with the ground? Try to notice the sensation of your feet being connected to the earth. If you'd like, you can also try naming three things you can see around you – a chair, a book, a picture on the wall. When the timer goes off, we'll take a deep breath in... and out... and I'll guide you through opening the email and typing that one sentence. Are you ready?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready to try, but my chest's tight and that hot shame keeps nagging like I should run. I'll try to stay for the ten minutes—if it spikes, please remind me to press my feet into the floor and name three things I can see, and when the timer goes off count the breath and guide me slowly to open the email. Can you start the timer now? I'm worried I'll bolt but I'll try to stick with it.

Therapist: I'll start the timer now. Let's begin counting down together: 10 minutes. Take a deep breath in... and out... as we start. Remember, if you feel the shame spike, just press your feet into the floor and name three things you can see. I'll be right here with you.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the timer's started. My chest is already tight and this shame keeps bubbling up like I messed up somehow, and I can feel the urge to bolt. I'll try to press my feet into the floor and breathe—can you check in with me in about five minutes and just remind me to take a slow breath?

Therapist: I'll check in with you in five minutes. Take a deep breath in... and out... for now. Just focus on your breath, and notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. When the time is up, we'll take a moment to pause and then I'll guide you through opening the email and typing that one sentence.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to wait, but that hot shame and frustration are already creeping back in and I feel like I might bolt. Can you check in in three minutes instead of five? It just feels a bit safer if it's sooner.

Therapist: Let's check in in three minutes. I'll remind you to take a slow breath and press your feet into the floor if you need to. Take a deep breath in... and out... for now. Just notice your breath and your feet touching the floor. We'll take it one minute at a time.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try one minute at a time. My chest's already tight and that shame keeps nagging like I should run — can you please remind me in a minute to press my feet into the floor and take a slow breath? If it gets worse, maybe we can briefly name one tiny thing that went okay at work today so I don't spiral.
