--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Um, lately I've been feeling really anxious in social settings — I keep avoiding small get-togethers with even my close friends because I just feel too overwhelmed. I started a demanding new job in social work and it’s made the whole adjustment worse, like my nerves are always on edge. I don't know, it's frustrating because I'm usually outgoing but lately I just pull back and I guess I don't know how to fix it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling with this feeling of overwhelm and not knowing how to cope with it. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel anxious in social settings? What's the first thing that comes up for you, or what's the first thing you notice when you feel overwhelmed?

Patient: Usually the first thing is my chest tightens and my face gets hot, and then my mind kind of goes blank. I start worrying that people will notice and judge me, so I either clam up or start scanning for an exit. I don't know, I guess afterwards I feel guilty for bailing or like I should've forced myself, but I just couldn't.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is physically reacting to feelings of anxiety, and then your thoughts are getting caught up in a "should" story - should you be able to handle it, should you be able to make it through, should you be able to control your reactions. Would you be willing to try to notice what's happening with your body when you start to feel anxious, just for a moment, without judgment, and see if you can say "ah, I'm feeling my chest tighten and my face get hot" and just acknowledge it without getting caught up in the rest of the story?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try, but it feels... uncomfortable and like it'll just make the panic worse. Could you guide me through it slowly?

Therapist Answer:
Let's start small. I'll guide you through a brief, gentle exercise. When you feel your chest tightening and your face getting hot, I want you to notice it without trying to change it. Can you take a deep breath in and out, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am feeling my chest tighten" or "I am feeling my face get hot"? Just acknowledge the sensation, without trying to change it or add any thoughts to it. Let's just focus on noticing it for a moment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. (deep breath) As I exhale: "I'm feeling my chest tighten" and "I'm feeling my face get hot." I guess it did make me notice it more, but I also feel a little panicky and like I want to leave—I'm not sure how to stay with it. Can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're bringing your attention to the physical sensations, which is a good start. Now, I'd like to explore the sensation of panic that comes up when you want to leave. Can you describe it in a sentence or two, without judgment or trying to change it? What does it feel like to have that urge to leave?

Patient: I don't know — it's like a knot in my chest and this urgent, blaring alarm that says I need to leave right now. My thoughts jump to "they'll notice" or "I don't belong," and then I get shaky and kind of frozen. Can we slow down a bit? It's making me a little lightheaded.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the panic is really intensifying. Would you be willing to take another deep breath with me and focus just on the sensation of your body feeling lightheaded? No need to try to change it or stop it, just observe it as it is, for a moment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I take a deep breath. I guess I notice this woozy, foggy feeling in my head and my vision gets a bit blurry, like everything's farther away. I don't know, it makes me want to leave—can we slow down a bit? I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're doing a great job of noticing the physical sensations in your body. Now, I'd like to explore what might happen if you stayed with this feeling of being lightheaded, rather than trying to leave. What would it be like to be with this feeling, even if it's uncomfortable? Would you be able to take tiny, small steps with your body, like placing one foot in front of the other, even if you feel like you're going to faint?

Patient: I don't know — staying with it feels kind of impossible. I guess I could try a tiny step, like pressing my feet into the floor or taking a slow, counted breath, but I'm already picturing myself running out. Can we slow down? This is feeling really intense and I don't want to make it worse.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is already preparing for escape, even before you've had a chance to try to stay with the feeling. Would you be willing to take a break from trying to manage the feeling right now, and instead, just focus on being present with the sensation of your feet touching the floor? You can just notice where your feet are in relation to the ground, and see what that feels like, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try. My feet feel kind of heavy and stable—like my heels are pressing into the floor and the toes are a bit tingly. I still have this urge to bolt and it's making me anxious, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're able to notice a sense of stability and grounding in your body, which is a good contrast to the feelings of anxiety and panic. Now, I'd like to explore the story that's unfolding in your mind when you think about bolting. What's the "they" that you're worried will notice you? Can you explore what's driving that worry, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess "they" are people noticing that I'm nervous and deciding I'm incompetent or awkward. I think it's tied to being new at work and not wanting to mess up, but I don't really like digging into it. Can we slow down? This is getting a bit intense.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the worry is already there, and you're not really invested in understanding its origins. Let's focus on the physical sensation of your feet touching the floor again. Can you simply notice the feeling of your feet pressing into the ground, without adding any thoughts or judgments to it? No need to try to change anything, just observe it as it is.

Patient: Okay. My heels feel heavy and there's a slight tingle under my toes, a coolness on the tops of my feet. It sort of helps, but my chest is still tight and my mind's picturing me running out. I don't know, can we slow down? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still holding onto the sense of panic, but the physical sensations in your feet seem to be providing a small sense of grounding. Would you be willing to take a tiny step back from the image of running out, and instead, focus on the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Just notice whatever arises, without trying to change it.

Patient: Okay. I guess I notice the air on my skin—cool on my neck and a little tickle in my nostrils when I breathe in. My breaths feel shallow, like I'm only getting little bits of air, and that just makes me more panicky. Can we slow down? This is getting kind of intense and I'm worried I'm making it worse.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shallow breathing is escalating the anxiety. Let's try to simplify things even further. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without any thoughts or judgments about it. We can just be with the breath, right here, right now.

Patient: Okay... I can feel the breath—cool in my nose and warmer out, my chest rising a little. My breaths are still kind of shallow and my chest feels tight, and I don't know, I guess staying with it feels scary. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit lightheaded.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting a bit close to a breaking point. Would you be willing to take one more tiny step back, and instead of focusing on the breath, focus on the sensation of your body being in a safe space? You can just notice that you're sitting in a chair, or that your feet are touching the floor, and that's enough. No need to try to manage anything else.

Patient: Okay. I notice I'm sitting in a chair and my feet are on the floor and that does feel a little steadier, but my chest is still tight and I feel kind of embarrassed that I'm reacting like this. I don't know, I guess I don't like feeling so exposed—can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're noticing the feeling of embarrassment, and it's still adding to the anxiety. Let's try to explore what's driving that feeling of exposure. Is it the fear that others will notice your vulnerability, or is it something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm afraid they'll see I'm weak or incompetent, like being new at work and not having it together. I don't really want to dig too deep into it right now—can we slow down? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're already feeling exposed, and now you're worried about being exposed to being perceived as weak or incompetent. Let's take a step back. Can you simply notice how your body feels right now, without trying to make sense of anything else? Just rest on that feeling of your body being in the chair, with your feet on the floor. No need to add any thoughts or judgments.

Patient: Okay... I notice my shoulders are hunched and my chest is still tight, but the chair is holding me and my feet feel grounded. I don't know, I guess it helps a little to just stay here, but I'm embarrassed this is so hard. Can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're able to notice a small sense of stability in the physical sensations, and that's helping to ground you a bit. Let's just be with that for a moment. You can stay with the feeling of your shoulders hunched and your chest tight, without trying to change it. No need to do anything with it. Just be present with it, right here, in this moment.

Patient: Okay... my shoulders feel tight and my chest is still clamped. I'm getting this stupid wave of shame and frustration—I don't know why it's hitting me now, but it makes me want to hide. I guess it feels embarrassing to be so reactive, and can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty raw.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and frustration are hitting you hard. Let's take a deep breath with you. You can feel the sensation of your body being in the chair, and the shame and frustration can be present with that, without trying to change it. Can you simply acknowledge that it's there, without judgment, and just be with it?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel that shame and frustration—it's like a hot, sinking weight in my chest and this prickly, angry edge under my skin. I guess it feels stupid and unfair, like I should have this together by now, and being here with it makes me want to hide. Can we slow down? What do you want me to do with this right now?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and frustration are really intense. I don't want to ask you to do anything with it yet. Instead, I'd like to simply acknowledge that you're feeling it, and that it's okay to feel it. You can just rest with it for a moment, without trying to process it or fix it. No need to do anything with it. Just be with the sensation of the shame and frustration, and the desire to hide.

Patient: I can feel that shame and frustration—it's this hot, sinking weight and this prickly, angry edge that makes me want to disappear. I don't know what to do with it and I guess I don't want to go digging into it right now. Can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty raw.

It sounds like you're feeling like you're at the edge of something, and you're not sure how to take the next step. I want to suggest we pause here, and come back to this when you feel a bit more grounded. For now, let's just take a deep breath together, and stay with the sensation of your body being in the chair, with your feet on the floor. No need to do anything else. Just be here, with what is.

Patient: Okay. I take a deep breath—my chest is still heavy and that stupid shame is clinging to me, like I messed up and it won't stop replaying. I don't know, I guess being here helps a little but I'm still really raw and shaky. Can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is still present, and it's replaying in your mind. Let's take another deep breath together, and stay with the sensation of your body being in the chair, without trying to change anything. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel shaken, and that it's okay to be raw. You are here, in this moment, with your body and your feelings. No need to do anything else.

Patient: Okay... (deep breath) I'm still really shaky and that shame keeps replaying in my head — like everyone can see I messed up and it's so embarrassing. I don't know what to do with it, I guess I don't want to dig into why it's happening right now. Can we slow down? Maybe could we do a simple grounding thing — like name five things I can see — just to keep me from spiraling?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're getting lost in the shame. I'd be happy to help with that. Let's try a simple grounding exercise. Can you look around the room and name five things you can see? Just five things, no need to think too much, just whatever comes to mind.

Patient: Okay—five things I can see: a coffee mug on the table, a small potted plant, a bookshelf with work files, the window with gray sky, and my phone face-down. I don't know, saying them makes that stupid shame flare up again—like everyone can see I'm failing—so can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty raw.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is flaring up again. Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to notice the sensation of the words leaving your lips as you said "the bookshelf with work files". Just notice the physical sensation of that action, without judgment. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I said it my throat felt tight, my voice kind of thin, like I was speaking through cotton. It just made that stupid shame flare up—like I was saying it to prove I wasn't failing and it felt hollow. Can we slow down? I'm feeling really exposed and annoyed that this keeps happening.

It sounds like the shame is still present, and it's connected to the act of speaking. Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Just focus on the feeling of your feet, without trying to change it or add anything to it. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I guess—my feet feel heavy, heels pressing into the floor and my toes a bit tingly, like they’re anchoring me a little. But this hot shame and frustration is still clinging to my chest and it’s hard to stay with the feet when that keeps rising up. Can we slow down? I’m feeling really raw and I don’t know what to do with this.

It sounds like your feet are providing a small sense of grounding, but the shame and frustration are still really present. Let's try something different. Can you notice the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to change it or add anything to it? Just focus on the sensation of the air, and see if that's enough to anchor you for a moment.

Patient: Okay... I can feel the air—cool on my neck and a little tickle on my cheeks, warmer over my exhale against my chest. But that stupid shame keeps popping up, making even the air feel... prickly, like I'm doing this wrong. I don't know, I guess it helps a bit, but can we slow down? I'm still really raw and shaky.

But this stupid wave of shame keeps clinging, like I screwed up and everyone can see it, and it's making me want to bolt. I don't know, I guess I can't stay with it for long—can we slow down? Maybe could we do something simple, like a few slow counted breaths or another grounding thing?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting a bit overwhelmed by the shame. Let's try a simple grounding exercise. I'd like to guide you through a few slow counted breaths. Can you take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale for a count of four? Let's do that together, and see if that helps you feel a bit more centered. Ready to start?

Patient: I... I guess I'm ready to try, but can we slow it down a bit? I'm really shaky and this stupid shame keeps clicking in like I already messed it up, so if we could count more slowly that would help. Okay—I'll try: breathe in for four, hold for four, out for four, but please go slow with me.
