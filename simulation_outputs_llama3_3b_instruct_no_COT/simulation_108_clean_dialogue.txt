Patient: I'm an older construction worker, and lately I've been in this fog of sadness where I can't seem to get motivated for much. Feeling so isolated has made it worse, and it's starting to mess with my relationship at home. I don't know, I guess I'm not great at talking about this, but it's been on my mind a lot.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and isolated, and that's taking a toll on your life, including your relationship. Would you be willing to explore this feeling of isolation with me, just for a moment, and see if we can uncover what's hiding behind it for you?

Patient: I don't know if I can go too deep, but I can try. I guess it's because a lot of the guys I worked with are gone now and I don't get much company outside the job, so I just feel kind of invisible. It makes me not want to do much, and that's started causing fights at home. Can we take it slow? I don't really like talking about this.

Therapist: Feeling invisible and disconnected from others can be really tough. Would you be willing to try to observe that feeling of invisibility, without judgment, just as it is, for a moment?

Patient: I don't know if I'm doing this right, but I can try. When I notice that feeling, my chest gets heavy and I just go quiet, like I'm not worth interrupting. I guess it makes me want to shut down and keep to myself, even around my partner.

Therapist: The physical sensation of heaviness in your chest and going quiet - that can be a really strong indicator of the feeling of being invisible. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're not worth interrupting?

Patient: I don't know...when that hits I kind of make myself small and stop talking, like I don't want to take up space. I guess I'm afraid they'll think I'm whining or weak, so I keep it inside and it just builds up until I snap or shut down. It's... hard to talk about without feeling silly—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings. You're right, it can feel silly to talk about them. Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. Would you be willing to pause the conversation whenever you feel the heaviness or physical discomfort in your chest, and we can come back to it when you're ready?

Patient: I don't know if I'm doing this right, but I guess I can try to pause if it gets too heavy. My chest's already getting tight just thinking about it, so can we take it really slow and maybe talk in smaller bits? I don't like feeling pushed.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel pushed or uncomfortable. Let's take a deep breath together and focus on one small part at a time. Can you just describe what it feels like when you pause or take a step back from the conversation, without trying to analyze or explain it?

Patient: I don't know...when I pause I kind of shrink into myself. My chest eases a bit and my thoughts get fuzzy, like I'm putting a lid on everything. I guess I start noticing small things around me — the clock, the creak of the chair — just to not sit with it. Can we keep going slow?

Therapist: It sounds like pausing gives you a sense of temporary relief, and you focus on the present moment, noticing the small details around you. Would you be willing to explore that process a bit more, and see if we can understand what's behind that desire to notice the small things, like the clock and the creak of the chair?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I latch onto the clock and the creak because it keeps my head off the heavy stuff. It feels safer to notice little things than to open up—like I'm protecting myself from feeling too vulnerable. Can we keep it slow? I don't like getting pushed into the deep end.

Therapist: It's like you're using the small things to create some distance from the feelings that feel overwhelming. That makes sense. Would you be willing to acknowledge that taking small steps, like noticing the clock and the creak, is a way for you to maintain a sense of control in the moment?

Patient: I guess so. I don't know, when I focus on the clock or the chair it lets me breathe a bit — like I can hold on to something instead of falling apart. But it also gets under my skin that I'm dodging my partner and our problems, so can we keep this slow? I'm starting to feel a bit on edge talking about it.

Therapist: It's like the small things give you a temporary sense of stability, but also create a sense of unease when you realize you're avoiding the bigger issues with your partner. Would you be willing to explore what's beneath that feeling of unease, without trying to fix it right now?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to sit with that unease my chest tightens and my thoughts scatter, I get jumpy and can't focus. I guess underneath it is this fear I'm a burden and that they'll leave if I show how I feel. Can we go slow; I'm feeling on edge.

Therapist: The fear of being a burden and the fear of loss are connected to that tightness in your chest and scattering thoughts. Can you say to yourself, just for this moment, that it's okay to feel those fears, and that they're not necessarily true?

Patient: I don't know if I can really tell myself that. I guess it's okay to feel scared, but I don't buy that it isn't true — I keep thinking I'm a burden and that they'll leave. My chest just tightened and my thoughts keep darting all over, so can we slow down? I'm finding it hard to stay with this.

Therapist: It's like the thoughts are getting the upper hand, and it's hard to stay present with them. Would you be willing to take a moment to breathe, and simply acknowledge that the thoughts are there, without trying to push them away or analyze them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, my chest's tight and my mind's all over the place, I guess I can try to breathe but it feels like nothing sticks. Can we take it really slow?

Therapist: It's not about trying to change the thoughts or feelings right now, but rather just noticing them as they are. Would you be willing to focus on the sensation of your breath, right now, as you inhale and exhale, without trying to attach a meaning to it or change it in any way?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's that supposed to help? I don't know, my chest's tight and my thoughts keep jumping around, so if I try to focus on my breath it just slips away. I guess I can try one slow breath, but can we really take it slow?

Therapist: You're already taking a slow breath. Let's start with just that one breath, and then another, and see if we can bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath, without trying to do anything with it. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for the next breath?

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll try one slow breath. I breathe in and it's kind of shallow — my chest's still tight and my head keeps darting to other things. I don't know, it helps a little but I can't hold it long — can we keep doing just a couple at a time? I'm feeling on edge.

Therapist: The shallow breath is a good sign that you're willing to take it slow. Let's take just one more breath together, and then we'll pause. Can you focus on the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit, just for the next breath, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll try one more. I breathe in, try to let my shoulders drop but my chest's still tight and my head keeps darting — I don't know, it eases a bit but I'm still on edge, can we keep it slow and do just a couple more?

Therapist: You're already taking small steps towards relaxation. Let's take one more breath together, and then pause. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and see if you can feel any weight or pressure in them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's that supposed to help? I guess I can try. My feet feel heavy on the floor, like there's pressure under my heels, but my chest's still tight and my thoughts keep jumping everywhere. I don't know, can we keep it slow? I'm feeling on edge.

Therapist: The sensation of your feet on the ground can be a good anchor. Let's focus on that feeling for a moment. Can you describe the sensation of the pressure under your heels, in your own words, without trying to analyze it or change it?

Patient: I don't know...it's like a dull, solid weight under my heels, like I'm standing on a couple of bricks. It kind of grounds me for a second and pulls me out of the noise in my head, but my chest's still tight and my thoughts keep darting. Can we keep it slow? I'm finding it hard to stay with this.

Therapist: The sensation of the weight under your heels seems to be giving you a temporary sense of stability. Let's pause for a moment and see if we can hold onto that feeling. Can you just notice it, without trying to think about it or change it, as you pause here for a brief moment?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the weight under my heels — it's steady for a second and it pulls me out of the noise. My chest's still tight and my thoughts keep jumping, so can we keep it slow? I'm feeling pretty on edge.

Therapist: The weight under your heels seems to be a small victory, giving you a moment's reprieve from the noise in your head. Let's take another brief pause, and this time, before we move forward, can you simply acknowledge that you're willing to take it slow, and be kind to yourself as you're exploring these difficult emotions?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to take it slow and be kinder to myself, but I'm not sure how that works. My chest's all tight and my head's kind of fuzzy and jumpy—I'm feeling confused and on edge, so can we really keep it slow?

Therapist: You're already taking small steps towards being kind to yourself. Let's take another brief pause, and instead of trying to make any sense of it all, can you just say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm taking a breath, I'm doing the best I can"? No expectations, no judgments, just a simple acknowledgement of your presence in the moment?

Patient: I don't know if I can say that without feeling... kind of dumb, but okay. I'm here. I'm taking a breath. I'm doing the best I can, I guess — my chest's still tight though, so can we keep it slow?

Therapist: You're already being honest with yourself about how you're feeling. Let's take a deep breath together, and when you're ready, you can say it again, or we can just stay with the "I'm here, I'm taking a breath" for a little while longer.

Patient: I don't know... okay. I'm here, I'm taking a breath, I'm doing the best I can, I guess — but my chest's still tight and my head's all over the place. I don't really follow how saying that helps, and I don't like saying it out loud, but can we keep this really slow? I'm feeling pretty on edge.

Therapist: It's okay to feel uncertain or uncomfortable with the process. Let's take another deep breath together, and instead of focusing on the outcome or the words, can you just notice the sensation of your body as you exhale? Where does it feel like it's releasing to, in your body?

Patient: I don't know... when I breathe out it kind of sinks down into my stomach and a little into my shoulders, like a tiny loosening there, but my chest stays tight. I'm not sure that makes sense — my head's still darting and I feel kind of on edge. Can we really keep it slow?

Therapist: The loosening in your shoulders is a small victory. Let's take another breath together, and as you exhale, can you simply notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a tiny bit more, without trying to make sense of it or attach any meaning to it?

Patient: I don't know... I'll try. When I breathe out I can feel a tiny bit more give in my shoulders and my jaw, but my chest's still tight and my thoughts keep jumping around. I guess I need to keep doing this slowly — can we stick to just a couple more short breaths?

Therapist: The tiny bit of give in your shoulders and jaw is a small step. Let's take another brief breath, and when you're ready, we'll see if we can hold onto that feeling for just a moment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to hold onto it for a moment. I can feel a tiny loosen in my shoulders but my chest's still tight and my head keeps jumping — can we just do a couple more small breaths? I'm feeling pretty on edge.

Therapist: The loosen in your shoulders is a tiny anchor for you. Let's take one more brief breath, and when you're ready, we can pause and see what happens.

Patient: Okay, I'll try one more breath. I breathe in and let it out—my shoulders loosen a bit, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting. I don't know, can we really keep it slow? I'm feeling pretty on edge.

Therapist: You're already showing some small progress. Let's take one more deep breath together, and when you're ready, we'll pause and see if we can hold onto the loosen in your shoulders for just a moment.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try. I take a deep breath and let it out — my shoulders loosen a bit but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting. I guess I can hold onto that for a moment, but can we really keep it slow? I'm feeling pretty on edge.

Therapist: It looks like you've held onto the loosen in your shoulders for a moment. Let's pause here, and I'll wait with you, and see what happens next.

Patient: I don't know... my shoulders feel a bit looser, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting to the fight with my partner and stuff at work. I guess I appreciate you waiting, but I'm not sure I can say much more right now—can we just sit with this for a bit? I'm feeling pretty on edge.
