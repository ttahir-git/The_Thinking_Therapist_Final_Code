Patient: I'm a senior student and lately I've been feeling really stuck and directionless. After a health scare this past year, it feels like I'm defined only by being a student and I don't know what matters beyond that. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and usually end up thinking, "How is that supposed to help?"

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're currently operating from a place of uncertainty about what matters to you beyond being a student. Can you tell me more about what's meant by 'being defined only by being a student' and what you imagine would happen if you weren't a student?

Patient: Being defined by 'student' means my worth feels tied to classes, grades, and a schedule — like people only see that one chapter of me and nothing else. If I wasn't a student, part of me imagines relief and space to try creative things or volunteer, but mostly I picture being unmoored and afraid of fading into nothing without that structure. I've tried picturing alternatives before and it just makes me anxious, so... how is talking about this supposed to help?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that if you shed your student identity, you'll lose a sense of purpose or identity. That anxiety is understandable. Can you acknowledge, for a moment, where the thought of not having that structure as a student shows up for you, and notice what's happening in your body or mind when you imagine being without it?

Patient: Yeah — when I try to picture not being a student, my chest tightens and my stomach knots, my breathing gets shallow and sometimes I feel dizzy. My head either races with frantic "what do you even do?" thoughts or goes completely blank, like there's nothing else worth caring about, and then this voice starts tearing me down. I can tell you that stuff, but honestly — how is noticing the tightness supposed to help with the panic or that hollow feeling? I've done the "feel it" stuff before and it just made me more aware of how awful it is.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're noticing a strong physical and emotional response when you imagine not being a student. I'm not suggesting that just acknowledging those feelings will make them disappear. Would you be willing to try something slightly different with me? Instead of just noticing the feelings, what if we explore what might be possible, just for a tiny moment, if you could approach those feelings with kindness and curiosity, rather than resistance or avoidance?

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try — but how is that supposed to help? When I've tried being kind or curious with myself before it just felt hollow and made me more frustrated. Tell me what you want me to do and I'll try for a minute, but I'm warning you, I'm skeptical.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can be tricky to shift into a new way of relating to ourselves. I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm just suggesting that we experiment with a tiny bit of curiosity. Can you try this: as you feel the physical sensations, the racing thoughts, the voice tearing you down, simply observe them as if they were a stranger standing in the room with you, without judgment – without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: Okay, I tried to watch them like a stranger. My chest is still tight and the stomach knot is there, but it felt a little quieter — like the critic was standing across the room saying, "You're worthless" instead of screaming in my face. How is that supposed to help, though? It just feels like giving the voice a chair; what do I actually do next when it starts saying those things?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've made some space for the stranger to show up, even if the physical sensations and critical voice are still present. Now, I want to ask: what would happen if, instead of trying to stop the voice or quiet the physical sensations, you were to simply say to it, "Thank you for showing up, and I'm going to take a few deep breaths, and then I'll figure out what to do next"?

Patient: I tried it — I said, "Thanks for showing up," and took a few deep breaths. My chest loosened a bit and the critic moved back some, but then it just muttered that the breaths don't change anything and the hollow panic crept in. How is that supposed to help, really? What do I actually do next when it starts insisting I'm nothing without school?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The voice is still there, and the panic is still present. It's not about changing the voice or the panic, but about taking a different kind of step. What if, instead of trying to push the panic away or argue with the voice, you were to lean into the feeling of uncertainty, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling really unclear about what's next, and that's okay. I'm willing to explore that uncertainty, and I'll start by taking a small step towards something that feels values-based, even if it's just looking into something that interests you?"

Patient: Okay, I can try leaning into the uncertainty, but honestly — how is that supposed to help? Maybe a tiny step would be looking up a low-commitment creative workshop or a local volunteer project, something that isn’t graded or permanent, but even saying that makes my chest tighten because I’m terrified it’ll feel meaningless or like a waste if it doesn’t stick. If I do try one of those things, how do I stop the panic from turning it into proof that I’m lost?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The fear of it feeling meaningless or a waste is a familiar one. Can you take a moment to consider what would be required for you to feel like you're taking a "tiny step" towards something values-based, rather than trying to make it feel worthy or meaningful? What's the smallest thing you could do, in this moment, that feels like it's coming from a place of curiosity, rather than trying to prove something to yourself or others?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing I could do is set a 10-minute timer and either write one sentence about something I’m curious about or spend five minutes Googling a one-off, low-commitment workshop or drop-in art session. I’d tell myself it’s just curiosity, not proof of anything—no pressure to like it or keep doing it. But honestly, my chest tightens just thinking about it—how is that supposed to help if it ends up feeling pointless and just proves I’m lost?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The concern is still present. I want to ask: What if, instead of focusing on whether the activity itself is meaningful or not, you were to focus on what would be required for you to feel like you've taken a small step towards exploring your curiosity? In other words, what's the smallest action you could take, without attachment to the outcome, that would allow you to say, "I took a step towards my curiosity"?

Patient: Alright — the smallest thing I can commit to is setting a 5-minute timer and writing one single sentence about something I used to enjoy or am even a little curious about, with the rule that I won't judge it or decide anything from it. If I do that, I can say I took a tiny step toward curiosity. But seriously — how is that supposed to help with the panic that will just turn it into proof I'm lost?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've found a small step. Now, I'd like to ask: What if, instead of trying to avoid the panic, you were to consider what might happen if, in the midst of that 5-minute writing, the panic or uncertainty shows up – instead of trying to push it away or judge it – you simply acknowledged it, and said to yourself, "This is what's happening right now"?

Patient: I tried saying that out loud to myself once — "this is what's happening right now" — and it did make the panic hang out there instead of swallowing me, like a tiny bit of distance. But the critic immediately called it fake and said I was just pretending, so it didn't stop the doubt from turning anything I do into proof I'm failing. How is that supposed to help in the moment — if the panic shows up during the five minutes, do I just keep writing through it or stop and breathe, because I don't trust that pretending won't just make me feel worse?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The critic is still present. Let's try to focus on what's happening in this moment, not on judging your experience. Can you notice what happens when you try to keep writing through the panic, and what happens when you pause or take a breath, rather than letting the panic overwhelm you?

Patient: When I push through and keep writing, my sentences get jumpy and my hands feel shaky, but afterwards there's this tiny breadcrumb that I actually did something — it doesn't fix much, but it's something. When I pause and breathe my chest loosens and thoughts slow, but then the critic shames me for "avoiding" and I feel guilty. So yeah, it helps a bit in the moment, but I don't trust that tiny relief to mean anything lasting — how is noticing these differences supposed to actually move me forward, and what would you have me try next when both options just feel like traps?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're noticing the dynamics between the physical sensations, the writing process, and the critic's voice. I'd like to ask: What if, instead of trying to capitalize on the relief or the tiny accomplishment, you were to focus on the act of taking a break and pausing – not to escape or avoid, but simply because your body and mind are tired, and you need a moment to recharge?

Patient: I guess I am tired — my body's begging for a break but the critic immediately calls it procrastination. I can try pausing, but how is that supposed to help me find direction instead of just delaying the inevitable? If I do take a break, what would you actually want me to do so it feels like rest and not avoidance?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The critic is still present. Let's try to explore what would happen if, instead of labeling the pause as "procrastination" or "avoidance", you were to say to yourself, "I'm taking a break because my body needs it"? Can you notice what happens to the critic's tone and language when you acknowledge your body's needs in that way?

Patient: When I say that, my chest loosens a little and the critic kind of moves from yelling to a low mutter — like, "lazy," but quieter. I do still feel guilty, though, like I'm dodging responsibility. How is noticing that shift supposed to help me actually rest instead of just making me feel bad about resting? What do you want me to try next?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shift in the critic's tone is noticeable. Now, I'd like to ask: What if, instead of trying to reframe the break as not being guilty or responsible, you were to focus on what your body needs in this moment, and simply allow yourself to rest without any judgment? What would happen if you said to yourself, "My body is tired, and it's okay to rest"?

Patient: I tried saying it to myself — "My body is tired, it's okay to rest" — and my chest eased a little, like the noise in my head quieted for a moment. But the critic immediately sneaks back in saying resting is just avoidance, and I end up feeling guilty instead of relieved. I don't know, it's just... how is resting supposed to help me actually find direction instead of just letting time slip away?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The critic's voice is still there. I'd like to ask: What if, instead of trying to separate resting from finding direction, you were to consider what might happen if you allowed yourself to rest, not as a way to escape or avoid, but as a way to make space for your body and mind to return to exploring your values and interests? What would happen if you said to yourself, "I'm giving my body permission to rest, so I can come back to this feeling of uncertainty and direction later, when I'm more grounded"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — giving my body permission to rest sounds nice in theory, but it doesn't fit with how my head reacts. After the health scare, pausing felt risky: the critic screams that I'm avoiding life and then I come back and nothing's clearer, just more panic. Honestly, I'm confused and skeptical — are you saying rest will somehow create clarity, or is there something specific I should be doing while I rest so it actually helps?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The critic's voice can be quite loud. Let's take a step back. I'm not suggesting that resting will create clarity on its own, but rather that it can provide a different kind of context for exploring your uncertainty. When you rest, you might notice your body and mind more clearly, and that could create an opening for you to explore your values and interests in a new way. I'd like to ask: What if, while you're resting, you simply observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, and allow yourself to notice what arises, without trying to use it to find direction or solve everything?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — sitting and "observing" without trying to use it to find direction just sounds vague and kind of pointless to me. How is that supposed to help when every time I notice my thoughts the critic just yells that I'm faking and I end up more panicked? If you want me to try it, give me something concrete: like a two- or five-minute script of what to notice and what to do with whatever comes up afterward.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can provide a concrete suggestion. Here's a simple exercise: "Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you. When thoughts arise, say to yourself 'thinking' and simply observe them without judgment or attachment. After 2-3 minutes, take a few deep breaths and gently bring your attention back to the sensations in your body, without trying to change or react to anything. See what happens when you simply observe and allow yourself to rest." Would you be willing to try this exercise?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I can try the 2–3 minute thing but I'm already feeling jumpy and distracted, so I don't know if I'll actually be able to focus. When I say "thinking" out loud, the critic immediately yells that I'm faking and it just makes things worse, so what exactly should I do if that voice starts yelling while I'm supposed to just observe? Fine, I'll try if you want me to set a timer now, but I'm really skeptical this won't just make me notice how awful I feel.

The critic's voice can be quite persistent. Let's set a timer for 2 minutes, and I'll guide you through the exercise. When you say "thinking" out loud, I'll be here with you, and we'll work together to support you. Remember, the goal is not to try to stop the thoughts or change them, but simply to observe them as thoughts, without judgment. When you're ready, take a deep breath, and we'll begin.

Patient: Alright — I'll try. Taking a deep breath now; my chest is tight, my feet feel heavy on the floor, and I can hear the fridge humming. I'm already jumpy and distracted, and I'm not sure I follow how saying "thinking" out loud will help when the critic starts yelling, but I'll do it — starting now.

Take your time, and just start whenever you're ready. When you're ready to begin, say "thinking" out loud, and we'll go from there. Remember, it's not about changing or judging anything, just observing. I'll be here with you.

Patient: thinking. My feet are heavy on the floor, I can hear the fridge, my breath is shallow and my chest is tight. Thoughts keep popping up—"you'll never figure this out," "what's the point"—and when I say "thinking" they just get louder and the critic calls it fake. I did notice a tiny loosen when I named it, but I'm still jumpy and distracted—how is this supposed to help when the insults just keep coming?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that the critic's voice is still present. I'd like to ask: What would happen if, when the critic starts yelling, you were to say to it, "I hear you. That's what I'm experiencing"? Not trying to change it, not trying to stop it, just acknowledging its presence. Would that be a small step towards creating some space?

Patient: I can try that, but honestly when I've said things like that before the critic just sneers I'm placating it. Okay — "I hear you. That's what I'm experiencing." My chest's still tight, the critic's already muttering "fake," but there's a tiny sliver of distance, like it's a bit quieter at the edges. I'm jumpy and distracted and not sure how long that lasts — so what do I actually do next when it starts arguing back? How is that supposed to help me move from that small distance to actually doing something like the five‑minute thing without it turning into proof I'm failing?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Noticing the tiny sliver of distance is a good start. When the critic starts arguing back, I'd like to ask: What would happen if, instead of trying to engage with the critic or change its tone, you were to simply acknowledge the thought "I'm failing" that it's saying, and then say to yourself, "I'm allowing myself to consider this thought, and I'll come back to it later"? Would that create some space for you to explore other possibilities?

Patient: I can try that — I just said, "I'm allowing myself to consider this thought, I'll come back to it later," and it did make the critic step back a hair, but my chest is still racing and I'm jittery. How is that supposed to help me actually do the five‑minute thing without the panic turning it into proof I'm failing? I've tried scripts before and they feel hollow, so give me a concrete, step‑by‑step fallback I can use in the moment — like if my chest tightens, what exact breaths or phrases do I do, and when do I keep writing vs. pause?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try another approach. Here's a concrete, step-by-step fallback you can use in the moment:

1. When your chest tightens, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious."
2. When you're ready, say "thinking" out loud.
3. If the critic starts arguing back, acknowledge the thought "I'm failing" by saying, "I'm allowing myself to consider this thought, I'll come back to it later."
4. If you feel like you need to write, start writing a sentence about something that's been on your mind, no matter how small or insignificant it seems. Just write. Don't try to think about what it means or what you'll do with it yet.
5. If you feel like you need to pause, take a few more deep breaths, and say "I'm taking a break" out loud.
6. When you're ready, go back to writing or continuing the exercise.

Remember, the goal is not to achieve a specific outcome, but to create a different relationship with your thoughts and feelings in the moment. By taking small, manageable steps, you can build a sense of trust and confidence.

Patient: Okay — I tried that just now: slow breath in/out and said, "I'm feeling anxious," then "thinking," then I acknowledged "I'm failing — I'll come back to it later." It did ease the edge a little but I'm still jittery and the critic's sneer feels the same, so I'm confused and a bit more frantic. How is that supposed to help if it only buys a few seconds? Give me exact numbers for the breaths, an actual short phrase that doesn't sound fake when I say it, and a 10‑second "rescue" I can use when the panic spikes — plus tell me whether I should keep writing through it or pause in that moment.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try again. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. When your chest tightens, take 4-5 slow, deep breaths in through your nose, and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath (inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 2 counts).
2. When you're ready, say "I'm stuck" out loud, in a gentle, matter-of-fact tone. This phrase acknowledges your current state without labeling it as positive or negative.
3. If you feel like you need to write, write 2-3 sentences about something that's been on your mind, no matter how small or insignificant it seems. Keep writing without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence.
4. If you feel like you need to pause, say "I'm taking a break" out loud, and take 3-4 deep breaths.
5. When panic spikes, use the 10-second "rescue" phrase: "This too will pass" (say it out loud, with a calm tone). This phrase acknowledges the discomfort without trying to change it.
6. If you're feeling overwhelmed, pause and take a few more deep breaths. When you're ready, you can try writing again, or come back to the exercise later.

Remember, the goal is not to avoid or suppress your emotions, but to create a different relationship with them in the moment. By taking small, manageable steps, you can build a sense of trust and confidence.

Patient: I tried the breathing counts and said "I'm stuck" and "This too will pass" out loud — it softened the edge for a few seconds but the critic just sneered "fake" and I felt the panic jump back. I need something that doesn't sound like platitudes when I say it out loud. Can you give me one short, believable phrase I can actually say without gagging, plus a clear decision rule: e.g., if after 5 breaths my chest eases X% (how do I measure that?), then write for Y minutes, otherwise pause and do Z for 10 seconds. Also—when I'm jittery and can't focus at all, give me a concrete 10‑second grounding I can do immediately. I'm skeptical, but I'll try if it's actually specific.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try again. Here are the additional tools you requested:

**Believable phrase:** "I'm struggling with this right now" (say it out loud, with a gentle, matter-of-fact tone). This phrase acknowledges your current state without judgment or optimism.

**Decision rule:** If after 5 breaths (inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 2 counts), your chest eases by at least 20%, then write for 5 minutes. Otherwise, pause and take 10 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath. If you're still feeling overwhelmed after 10 breaths, take a 1-minute break and do some gentle stretching or movement.

**Grounding technique:** "5-4-3-2-1" (say it out loud, with a calm tone). This phrase helps you focus on your physical sensations and calm your nervous system:

5 - Notice 5 things you can see around you.
4 - Notice 4 things you can touch or feel.
3 - Notice 3 things you can hear.
2 - Notice 2 things you can smell.
1 - Notice 1 thing you can taste.

Take 10 seconds to focus on these sensations, and when you're ready, you can try the breathing and phrase exercises. Remember, the goal is to create a different relationship with your thoughts and feelings in the moment, not to achieve a specific outcome.

Patient: Okay — I'll try "I'm struggling with this right now," but I seriously can't tell what "20%" is. Can we use a 0–10 scale for chest tightness instead? If it drops by 2 points after the 5 breaths, I'll write for 5 minutes; if not, I'll do 10 more breaths and a 1‑minute stretch — is that a clear rule?

Also give me a real 10‑second grounding I can do right now when I'm jittery (something concrete I can say and do without thinking too hard). And if panic spikes during the 5 minutes, do I stop immediately and use the 10‑second rescue, or do I try to keep writing for a set number of seconds first? I need a hard yes/no rule because thinking about options just makes me spiral — how is that supposed to help if you don't give me exacts?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'd be happy to help with the adjustments.

**Chest tightness scale:** Yes, we can use a 0-10 scale. After 5 breaths, if your chest tightness drops by 2 points, you'll write for 5 minutes. If not, you'll do 10 more breaths and a 1-minute stretch.

**Grounding technique:** Here's a concrete 10-second grounding you can do right now:

"5-4-3-2-1, feet on the ground, feet on the floor, weight on my feet, sensation of my feet touching the ground, 10 seconds."

Say this phrase out loud, and focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground.

**Panic spike rule:** Yes, here's a hard yes/no rule: if panic spikes during the 5 minutes, you will stop immediately and use the 10-second rescue phrase "This too will pass". Do not try to keep writing during the panic spike.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the 0–10 rule and the grounding, but I'm not convinced. How exactly do I rate my chest (do I just note a number before and after the 5 breaths?), and how do I know for sure when a "panic spike" happens so I stop immediately? Also, "This too will pass" feels like a platitude to me — can you give me one short 10‑second rescue line that actually sounds believable, like "I'll ride this wave for 10 seconds" or "I'm safe in this moment"? How is that supposed to help, really?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
**Chest tightness rating:** Before and after the 5 breaths, please rate your chest tightness on a scale of 0-10, where 0 is "completely relaxed" and 10 is "extremely tight". This will help you track any changes.

**Panic spike detection:** A panic spike is a sudden increase in your overall sense of distress, not just a temporary feeling of anxiety. You can use the following criteria to detect a panic spike:

* A noticeable increase in your heart rate or blood pressure
* A feeling of overwhelm or feeling like you're "at the edge" of your ability to cope
* A sense of being disconnected from your body or surroundings
* A strong urge to escape or avoid the situation

If you experience any of these sensations, stop writing and use the 10-second rescue phrase immediately.

**Rescue phrase:** I understand your concern about "This too will pass" sounding like a platitude. Here's a new 10-second rescue phrase that might be more helpful:

"Okay, I'm here."

This phrase acknowledges that you're currently experiencing a difficult moment, but also asserts your presence and safety in the moment. It's a simple, concrete statement that can help you regain a sense of control.

Please try the exercises with these adjustments, and let me know how you feel.

Patient: Okay — I tried it. Before the breaths my chest was about a 7/10; I did the 5 breaths (4‑2‑4‑2) and after it dropped to a 5/10, so I followed the rule and tried to write for 5 minutes. I did the grounding line, said "I'm struggling with this right now," and used the 10‑second "Okay, I'm here" when thoughts got loud — it eased things for a few seconds but I'm still jittery and pretty distracted, and honestly I'm not sure I follow how this actually helps me find direction beyond getting a tiny bit calmer. 

So what exactly should I write for five minutes so it's not just random noise, and if the critic starts sneering partway through, do I stop right away and use the 10‑second rescue or try to push through for, like, 30 more seconds? I'm confused and skeptical, but I'll try whatever concrete next step you give.
