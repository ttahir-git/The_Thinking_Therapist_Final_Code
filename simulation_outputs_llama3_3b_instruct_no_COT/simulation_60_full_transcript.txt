Patient: Lately I've been stuck worrying all the time about how I'm doing as a teacher — like every lesson feels make-or-break and I end up putting things off until the last minute. It's making me avoid planning and then I feel guilty and more anxious. I guess... I don't know, I just feel really isolated and like I'm not doing enough.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and self-doubt as a teacher, and that's creating a big weight for you. Can you take a moment to notice what happens in your body when you think about those 'make-or-break' lessons? Where do you feel it in your body?

Patient: I don't know... it's kind of hard to say. I guess there's a tight knot in my stomach and my chest feels heavy, like I can't breathe as easily. My shoulders tense up and my hands get clammy, and sometimes my jaw hurts from clenching.

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be really uncomfortable. It sounds like your body is trying to communicate that this feeling of being under a lot of pressure and self-doubt is having a big impact on your physical well-being. Can you think of a small, tiny thing that you could do right now, just for a few seconds, to help your body relax a bit – perhaps something as simple as taking a deep breath or rolling your shoulders?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try a deep breath. Okay, I'm doing one now — it helps a little, my shoulders feel a bit looser, but it doesn't make the worry go away. I don't know, it feels weird to focus on my body instead of the lesson plans.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Focusing on the body can be a helpful way to ground ourselves, but it's understandable that your mind wants to keep thinking about the lesson plans. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to approach planning your lesson without the added pressure of feeling like it's 'make-or-break'? What would that feel like, and what might you value about taking a more relaxed approach to planning?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might feel a bit lighter, like the tightness in my chest eases and planning feels less like a deadline. Maybe I'd value being more creative, enjoying the class instead of panicking, and actually noticing when students are into something. But I keep worrying that if I relax I'll just slip up and everyone will think I'm unprepared.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
So it sounds like you value being able to approach teaching with more creativity and connection with your students, and feeling more at ease with the planning process. It's interesting that you mention worrying about slipping up, though – can you notice what happens in your body when you think about that particular worry?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my stomach knots up more and my breathing gets really shallow, like I'm holding it. My shoulders hunch and my hands want to fidget or grab my phone to distract myself. I don't know, it feels kind of embarrassing to say out loud.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can feel a bit vulnerable to share those physical sensations, but it's actually really helpful for us to acknowledge and explore them. The fact that you're willing to explore your body's responses to this worry is already a step forward. Would you be willing to explore this worry of "slipping up" in a very small, low-stakes way, perhaps with a hypothetical scenario – for example, what would happen if, in a quiet moment, you were to let go of the need to be perfect and just focus on enjoying the lesson?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try imagining it, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we go slowly? If I let go of needing to be perfect, I think the lesson would feel lighter and I might actually notice when students are engaged. But then I start worrying that if I don't control everything it'll all fall apart, and it's kind of embarrassing to admit that.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It can be tough to let go of the need for control. Let's take a step back and look at it like this: what if, in that moment, you didn't try to control the lesson, but instead allowed yourself to be present with it – to notice the students' engagement, their questions, and their responses? What would that feel like, not in terms of achieving some kind of outcome, but just being with the experience of the lesson itself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would feel lighter, like the tight knot eases and I can actually notice a kid smiling or a question instead of being on edge. But just thinking about it makes me kind of panicky—my chest tightens and I want to look away. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to actually do that without it feeling risky.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is already on high alert, making it hard to explore this further. Let's slow down even more – can you just focus on noticing your breath, and allow yourself to feel the physical sensations in your body as they are, without trying to do anything about them? Just observe them, without judgment. Would you be willing to try this for just a tiny moment, say 5-10 seconds?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try for a few seconds. Okay, I'm breathing in and out — it helps a little, my shoulders loosen a bit, but the knot in my stomach is still there and my mind keeps jumping to the things I haven't planned. I'm feeling kind of panicky and overwhelmed — can we go even slower? I don't really know how to stay with this without wanting to grab my phone.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it even slower – can you just bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or do anything with it? Notice the sensation of the air touching your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of your breath in your belly. Don't try to control it, just observe it. Would you be willing to stay with that sensation for just one more breath?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try one more breath. Okay, I did — it loosened my shoulders a bit and there was a tiny space where the knot eased, but my mind immediately jumped back to everything I haven't planned and I feel panicky again. Can we slow down? I don't really know how to stay with this without wanting to escape.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The mind can be pretty persistent, can't it? Let's take it to a very small scale – can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of the chair or floor beneath you? Just observe that, without trying to do anything with it. No thought, no focus on your breath, no goal in mind. Just being present with your physical presence in the room.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my feet feel kind of flat and heavy on the floor, like a tiny anchor. It helps a little, but my mind keeps snapping back to all the things I haven't planned and I get restless and guilty. Can we go slower? I'm not sure how to keep doing this without feeling like I'm just avoiding work.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is still looking for a way out, but your feet are grounding you in the present moment. Let's try to bring that grounding even more into focus – can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the sensation of your body sitting in the chair, without trying to think about anything else? Just the sensation of being here, in this moment, with your feet on the ground. No thoughts, no worries, just the physical presence of your body in space.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. My feet feel heavy and kind of rooted, and my back's pressed into the chair — it helps a little, but my mind instantly starts listing lesson plans and I feel guilty and restless. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by all of it right now — can we go even slower or talk about how to do this without feeling like I'm just avoiding my work?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is relaxing a bit, but your mind is still really anxious. Let's take a step back and look at the question of "how to do this without feeling like you're avoiding your work". Can you think of a moment, even if it's just a tiny one, when you've done something that felt important and meaningful to you as a teacher, and you didn't feel overwhelmed by all the details and worries? What was that like, and what did you value about that experience?

Patient: I don't know... I guess once a few weeks ago a student asked something that led to this whole messy, funny discussion and everyone got really into it — I felt calm and actually proud for a minute instead of panicked. I liked being present with them and not obsessing over the checklist, but thinking about how to get back to that makes me anxious. Can we slow down? I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed just talking about it.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that experience was a small moment of calm amidst the chaos. Let's slow down even more – can you just notice the sensation of the words leaving your mouth as you say them, the sound of your voice, the movement of your tongue and lips? Just observe that, without trying to think about the conversation or the anxiety that follows. See if you can bring your attention to the sensation of the words, and let the rest of the thoughts and feelings come and go without engaging with them.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. When I say the words I can hear my voice — it's kind of quiet and the back of my throat feels tight, my jaw tenses, and my tongue feels clumsy. It loosens a bit for a second, but then my head snaps to the to-do list and I feel guilty. Can we slow down? I don't really know how to use this without feeling like I'm just avoiding work — maybe talk about one tiny planning step I could do that doesn't feel like a huge commitment?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on that tiny step you mentioned – one small planning task that doesn't feel overwhelming. Can you think of a single, tiny action you could take right now, just for a few minutes, that would help you feel more grounded and connected to your teaching, without feeling like you're avoiding your work? Maybe something as simple as making a cup of tea, or writing down a single idea that comes to mind, or checking the weather forecast. What would that look like, and what might you value about taking that small action?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try something tiny, like writing one sentence for a learning objective — just "Students will be able to..." — and nothing else. That feels small and kind of doable, but I'm already worried it'll snowball into a long to-do list, so can we keep it really short and slow?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep it super small. Can you just write the one sentence "Students will be able to..." and then pause for just a tiny moment before adding anything else? See if you can bring your attention to the words on the page, the movement of your pen or pencil, the sensation of the paper under your hand. Don't worry about what's next, just stay with this tiny moment of writing.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I actually wrote "Students will be able to..." My hand felt kind of stiff, the pen scraped the paper, and pausing after that gave a tiny bit of relief — like a small space — but my mind jumped straight to the next things and I felt guilty and a bit panicky. Can we stay with this a moment? I'm not sure how to stop it turning into a huge to‑do.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that tiny moment of writing did create a small space for you, but your mind is already pulling you back in. Let's stay with the sensation of the pen still moving on the paper, the sensation of your hand holding the pen, the feel of the paper under your fingers. Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to think about what's next or what's behind it? Just be with the present moment of writing, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: I don't know... I guess my hand's on the pen and the paper feels rough, the ink dragging a little, and that small pause after the sentence did give a tiny bit of space. But right now a rush of shame and frustration just hit me—my fingers went stiff, my chest tightened, and I feel stupid for getting caught up in it. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and I don't want this to turn into a spiral.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the small space created a new kind of tightness. Let's go back to the sensation of your hand on the pen and paper – can you bring your attention to the rough texture of the paper, the feel of your fingers wrapping around the pen, the sensation of the ink moving across the page? No thoughts, no feelings, just the physical sensations. No judgment, no self-criticism. Just being present with your hand and the pen.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the pen supposed to help with all this? I don't know... my fingers feel stiff, the paper's rough, the ink drags, and then a wave of shame and frustration just hits my chest and I feel stupid. Can we slow down? Maybe talk about one tiny, practical planning step I can do that feels safe — like finishing that one objective — because staying with sensations is making me anxious and I'm afraid it'll just turn into avoidance.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that focusing on the sensations is feeling overwhelming for you right now. Let's take a step back and talk about that tiny, practical planning step you mentioned – finishing that one objective. What would it mean to you to complete that one sentence "Students will be able to..."? What would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take to make progress on that objective, and what would be the immediate benefit of taking that step?

Patient: I don't know... I guess finishing that sentence would feel like a tiny win — like I'm allowed to be simple instead of perfect. The smallest step I can think of is naming one clear verb and one specific skill (like "Students will be able to identify the main idea") and stopping there — literally just that line, no activities or rubrics. That would probably give me a little relief and a bit of momentum so I don't feel totally stuck, but can we keep it really slow? I'm already worrying it'll turn into a huge list.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like naming that verb and skill is a small step that could give you a sense of accomplishment and momentum. Let's take it one tiny step further – what if, instead of stopping at just naming the verb and skill, you simply write the verb "identify" on its own, without adding the skill? Just write the word "identify" on the paper, and then pause. See what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I wrote "identify" just now — my hand felt kind of stiff and the pen scraped, and for a second it felt a bit lighter. Then a wave of shame and that stupid, familiar sinking feeling flooded in and my chest tightened, and I felt kind of ridiculous. I'm not sure how writing a single word is supposed to help — can we try the next tiny step, like finishing "Students will be able to identify the main idea," but really slowly?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the wave of shame and self-criticism is still present. Let's try the next tiny step, but this time, let's focus on the process, not the outcome. Can you write the phrase "Students will be able to identify the main idea" really slowly, one word at a time, pausing for a very short time between each word? Just focus on the physical act of writing, the movement of the pen, the sound of the words on the page. Try to let go of any thoughts about what it means or what you're doing, and just focus on the sensation of the words.

Patient: I tried writing it slowly — I got the whole sentence down one word at a time, and for a second it felt a bit lighter, but then a wave of shame and frustration hit and my chest tightened and I just froze. I don't know, I'm starting to feel panicky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? Maybe can we just agree that the objective is "Students will be able to identify the main idea" and stop there for now, without talking about activities or the rest of the plan?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like we've been making progress, but the shame and frustration are still present. Let's agree to pause here, and not worry about the next step. We've established that the objective is indeed "Students will be able to identify the main idea" for now. No more thoughts, no more pressure, no more expectations. Just a simple statement, acknowledged and accepted. Can you take a deep breath, and simply be with that statement, without adding anything else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I took a breath. It helped a tiny bit, but then a rush of shame hit and my chest tightened and I felt stupid — I can't just sit with it without wanting to move on. Can we slow down? Maybe just agree to keep the objective as it is for now and talk about one tiny next step that feels safe.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is still lingering. Let's slow down even more – can you simply notice what's happening in your body right now, without trying to change it? Just observe the sensation of your chest tightening, the sensation of the shame, the feeling of wanting to move on. No judgment, no trying to fix it, no trying to change it. Just being with it, as it is.

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels really tight and my breathing's shallow, my stomach's knotted, my hands keep fidgeting, and there's this hot shame like I messed up. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing it helps — it usually just makes me feel stupid and want to escape. Can we slow down and maybe talk about one tiny, safe next step I can actually do instead of just sitting with this?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is really reacting to the shame and anxiety. Let's take a tiny step back – what's one physical thing you can do right now, in this moment, that doesn't involve trying to sit with the shame or escape from it? For example, can you slowly lift your foot off the floor, or take a tiny sip of water, or gently adjust your position in the chair? Just a tiny, tiny action that doesn't require much energy or mental effort.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could take a tiny sip of water. Okay, I did — it helped a little, my throat loosened and my shoulders dropped a notch, but then this rush of shame and frustration hit and my chest tightened and I felt kind of stupid. Can we slow down? Maybe... could we just pick one more very small, safe thing after this?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Taking a sip of water was a small, calming action. Let's slow down even further – can you simply notice the sensation of the water touching your tongue, the taste, the sensation of swallowing? Just be with that, without trying to think about anything else. No worries, no judgments, just the physical sensations of the water.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the water's cool on my tongue and swallowing loosened my throat a bit, my shoulders dropped for a second, but then that shame hit again and my chest tightened and I felt kind of stupid. Can we slow down? Maybe one more tiny, safe thing — like setting a 5‑minute timer to write one follow-up question for the lesson, and then stop.

The shame is still lingering. Let's take it one tiny step further – can you just set the 5-minute timer right now, without thinking about the question or the outcome? Just put your finger on the timer, or tap the button, or do whatever it takes to make the timer start. Just the physical act of setting the timer, without any thoughts or expectations.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can set it. Okay — I set the 5‑minute timer and it's ticking now. My hands feel shaky, my chest tightened and this stupid wave of shame hit me like I messed up again, and honestly I'm not sure I follow how a timer is supposed to help me write instead of spiraling. Can we slow down? Maybe just agree that when it goes off I'll try to write one follow‑up question, but keep it really tiny and quiet — and... can you stay with me while it counts down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
The shame is still present. Let's slow down even more – I'll stay with you and keep you company as the timer counts down. We'll do this together, slowly and quietly. I'll count down with you, one minute at a time, and when it's over, you can try writing that one tiny question. No expectations, no pressure, just the two of us counting down together. Ready to start?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready to try, but I'm really shaky and there's this stupid rush of shame hitting my chest that makes me want to bail. Can you start the countdown and say each minute out loud? Please stay with me while it ticks — I don't want to spiral.
