Patient: I've been replaying the breakup nonstop and there's this simmering anger that pops up in interactions—especially anything that even remotely relates to them—and it's bleeding into my classroom and relationships. I try to keep it together as a teacher, but then I either snap inwardly or bite someone's head off and feel terrible afterward. I've tried stuff before and it didn't work, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That simmering anger can be really challenging to navigate, especially when it affects your interactions with students and colleagues. Can you describe what happens when the anger pops up, especially in those moments where you feel like you're biting someone's head off – what's the physical sensation in your body, and what's the thought or narrative that's accompanying that feeling?

Patient: When it hits, my chest tightens and my jaw clenches, like heat rising up my neck, and my hands go a bit shaky—breathing gets shallow and I feel this urge to snap at whoever’s nearby or just shut down completely. The thoughts are all accusations: they crossed a line, they did this on purpose, I'm being lied to or taken advantage of, and I replay the worst things over and over to justify getting angry. I’ll either lash out with sarcasm or go quiet and seethe, and afterward I hate myself for it. I know you’ll ask about breathing or counting—I've tried that and it doesn't work, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a strong emotional overwhelm, and it's impacting your ability to regulate your responses. It's not about your breathing or counting, but rather about noticing the physical sensations that arise, like the heat and tightness in your body. Can you think of a moment when the anger would be 'off the table' – a situation where, even if the thoughts are still there, you feel like you could stay calm and respond thoughtfully?

Patient: Yeah—usually when I'm actually teaching I can keep it in check, because there's lesson plans, kids watching, and standards of conduct—I switch into problem-solving mode. But it's like muzzling a dog: it goes quiet until I get home and something small sets me off and it all explodes. How is pointing out those calm moments supposed to help when it's just deferred and comes back worse later?

Therapist: It's like the calm moments are "zoned out" – you can access them, but they're not stable enough to prevent the anger from building up. Instead of trying to control or suppress the anger, what if we explored what it would be like to make room for those calm moments, even if they're not always available? What if, when you do have a calm moment, you could pause and simply acknowledge the tension, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I can see the idea, but I've tried the whole "pause and notice" thing before and it just feels like letting them win—or like stuffing it down until it explodes later. When I try to notice the tension my brain immediately judges me for feeling it and spins up more anger, or I just go numb and nothing actually changes. How is that supposed to help when it just turns into more replaying and self-loathing?

Therapist: It sounds like the "pause and notice" approach feels like a form of self-criticism, which can actually fuel more anger. What if, instead of trying to notice and judge the tension, you could try to see it as a signal that you're close to something else – what's the emotion that's actually wanting to be acknowledged, the one that's beneath the anger?

Patient: Mostly hurt and humiliation — I feel betrayed, embarrassed, like my boundaries didn't matter. When I try to actually feel that, it either floods me with shame or a helpless cold, and my brain switches it into anger so I don't feel weak. How is naming that supposed to help when every time I try I either get overwhelmed or just start cataloguing slights to prove I'm right?

Therapist: It's like your brain is using anger as a shield to avoid feeling the hurt and humiliation. What if, instead of trying to name or catalog those feelings, you could simply acknowledge them as "painful" – without judgment, without trying to analyze or understand them right away? Could you imagine allowing yourself to experience the pain, even just for a tiny moment, without trying to react to it?

Patient: I can imagine it for a few seconds—like a hollow ache under the anger and a tiny loosening in my chest—but as soon as I look at it I either spin into shame or my brain starts cataloguing every slight again. When I try to "allow" it, it just feeds the self-judgment and then the anger comes back sharper, so how is that supposed to help without just letting them win?

Therapist: It's like the more you try to allow the pain, the more it gets intensified by your judgment and self-criticism. What if, instead of trying to allow the pain, you could approach it with a sense of curiosity – "What would it be like if I didn't judge this feeling or try to fix it right away?"

Patient: I can sort of picture it—like for a second the tightness loosens and I don't immediately want to prove myself right—but my brain almost always turns curiosity into interrogation: "Why did they do this?" "What did I miss?" and then it fuels the anger anyway. I guess I could try that tiny experiment, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when curiosity just ends up being another way to replay every slight?

Therapist: It sounds like curiosity is getting hijacked by the need to understand and justify. What if, instead of trying to understand or justify, you could simply ask yourself what would be possible if you didn't have to figure everything out right now – if you could just step back and say "I don't know, and that's okay"?

Patient: I can see how "I don't know" might take the pressure off for a second—there's that tiny looseness I get when I stop trying to prove myself. But almost immediately my head rushes in with scenarios and blame, and then I feel guilty for not having answers. How is that supposed to help when the uncertainty just becomes another thing I attack myself over? I'll try it for a minute if you want me to, but I'm pretty skeptical it'll stick.

Therapist: It's like the sense of uncertainty is quickly replaced by self-criticism and guilt. Can you think of a tiny, tiny action that you could take in this moment, just for a moment, to help you feel more connected to what's happening, rather than getting caught up in thoughts and self-judgment?

Patient: Alright — I can try something tiny: I'll put my hand over my chest and gently press my thumb and forefinger together for thirty seconds while quietly saying to myself "this is hurt." I'm going to try that now, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when my head just starts cataloguing everything again?

Therapist: You're taking a small step towards physical notice and acknowledgment. What if, as you're doing this tiny act, you could try to expand the phrase "this is hurt" to include the physical sensations that are already present, like the tension in your jaw or the heat in your neck – would that allow for a slightly different relationship with the experience?

Patient: Okay, I tried that—saying "this is hurt, jaw tight, heat in my neck" for a few breaths and there was a tiny bit of distance, like a fraction of looseness. But almost immediately my head starts cataloguing every slight and I end up angrier and guilty for not fixing it. How is that supposed to stop the spinning when noticing just becomes another way to rehearse the slights—what do I actually do when it escalates?

Therapist: It's like noticing has become a repetitive cycle. What if, instead of trying to control or fix the experience, you could focus on the sensations in your body – like the tension in your jaw, the heat in your neck – and allow them to be, without trying to change them?

Patient: I've done the body-focus thing before — for a beat my jaw loosens, then my head starts cataloguing slights and I get angrier. So what do I actually do in the moment when the sensations spike and the thoughts hijack me — how is that supposed to help instead of just becoming another rehearsal of the hurt? I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical it'll stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a more direct approach to interrupt the cycle. What if, when the thoughts and feelings start to escalate, you could take a step back and make a tiny, tiny commitment to yourself – a simple, small action that doesn't require thinking or understanding, just a physical gesture?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a tiny gesture supposed to stop the spiral when the moment I notice anything my head starts cataloguing slights? Give me a concrete example I could actually do between classes or the minute I walk in the door, something I can't overthink and that won't just become another thing to fail at. Right now I'm confused and annoyed; it honestly feels like this doesn't apply to the real mess of anger I get.

Therapist: I'm not suggesting a gesture that requires thinking or planning ahead. Instead, I'm proposing a small, immediate action that can be done in the midst of the escalation – a simple, automatic response that doesn't depend on your ability to control your thoughts. For example, taking a deep breath, or simply making a small, physical change in your posture – would that be something you could try right now, without needing to think about it?

Patient: Alright—I'll try something concrete: plant my feet, roll my shoulders back, press my palms together and hold for twenty seconds. Doing it now...okay, there's a tiny looseness in my chest, but my head's already started listing every slight again. If that barely shifts things for a beat, what do I actually do next when the thoughts rush back—how is that supposed to stop the spiral?

Therapist: It's like the looseness is short-lived, and the thoughts quickly come back. What if, when the thoughts start rushing back, you could acknowledge them without trying to stop them – simply say "those thoughts" or "the hurt" – without judgment, without trying to analyze or change them?

Patient: I can try saying "those thoughts" but right now I'm jittery and my chest's tight and it's hard to focus — the second I label it my head just starts listing every slight like a grocery list. It feels hollow, like another trick I’ll mess up or that just gives my brain more stuff to chew on. How is that supposed to actually stop the spiral instead of just becoming rehearsal for the anger?

Therapist: It's like labeling the thoughts is becoming a form of self-criticism. What if, when the thoughts start rushing back, you could pause for just one beat before responding – not trying to label or analyze, just pausing, and during that pause, what happens?

Patient: If I actually pause for a beat, there's usually a weird blankness for half a second and then the memories start crowding in faster, like my brain knows there's a gap to fill—my chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, and I start listing what they did or how I should've seen it coming. Or I just feel guilty for not fixing it right away. The pause almost always collapses into more thinking or shame, so how is that supposed to be different from zoning out? Give me something concrete that actually breaks the pattern in the moment, not just notices it—what would that look like between classes or the minute I walk in the door?

Therapist: It sounds like the pause is getting crowded by memories and self-criticism. What if, when you walk in the door, as soon as you notice the tightness in your chest, you simply touch the area where your chest meets your neck, with the pads of your fingers – would that be a small, automatic response that interrupts the cycle of thinking and self-criticism?

Patient: I can picture doing that—pressing the spot where my chest meets my neck—but it feels kind of trivial and I'm worn thin from trying stuff that barely helps. How long do I hold it? Do I pair it with a breath or a phrase? And if the thoughts still sprint away, what's the next concrete move I can do in the moment that I won't just overthink or judge?

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a more substantial action. What if, when you touch the spot, you hold it for just a tiny fraction of a second – 1-2 seconds – and then let go, without adding any words or breath? No labeling, no judgment, no trying to control the thoughts. Just the physical touch, and the release of it.

Patient: Okay…I can try that—press for a second and let go. It still feels trivial and I'm not sure I follow how that actually beats the cataloguing or the rush of memories; if the anger and thoughts hit anyway, what do I do next? I'm worn out from trying things that barely help, so I'm honestly skeptical this won't just become another thing I mess up.

Therapist: It's like the physical touch is just a tiny anchor, but you're wondering what happens when the storm comes back. What if, when the thoughts and anger hit, you don't try to do anything with them – no trying to stop, no trying to change – but instead, simply take a small step back into your body, and look down at your feet?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is staring at my feet supposed to stop the spiral? When I do that I get this flash of being small and worthless and it just makes me clamp up and replay everything, so it feels like another useless trick. I can try looking down and feeling my feet, but what exactly do I do next when the memories and shame rush in?

Therapist: It's like looking at your feet is becoming another form of self-judgment. What if, when you look down, you don't focus on your thoughts or feelings – instead, you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Notice the weight of your body, the sensation of the air on your skin, the feeling of being grounded.

Patient: I can try feeling the weight of my feet, but when I do I just kind of shrink—there’s this flash of worthlessness and the replay hits harder, so it feels like another failure. How is grounding supposed to stop that flood? Tell me a concrete next move I can actually do in the hallway between classes—something I can't overthink and that actually breaks the pattern when the shame and memories rush in.

Therapist: It sounds like feeling the weight of your feet is becoming a self-critical experience. What if, when you feel that sense of worthlessness, you could take a small step forward, just a tiny step – forward, not away – and place one foot in front of the other?

Patient: I can picture taking one tiny step forward, but I need to know what comes next—do I stay there, keep walking, or...what? When I imagine doing it my chest tightens and that familiar sting of shame shows up, like I already messed it up, and my head starts replaying everything. I'm worn out from trying these micro-tactics—how is one step supposed to actually break the pattern?

Therapist: It's like the physical movement is getting caught up in the cycle of self-criticism. What if, when you take that step forward, you don't keep walking – instead, you simply stop, and take a deep breath, without trying to change or analyze anything?

Patient: I can try that—step forward, stop, and take a breath—but honestly, when I stop my head immediately floods with how I messed up and shame tightens everything, and the breath feels useless. It all just turns into another checklist I fail at. What do I actually do next if the breath doesn't break it—give me a concrete move I can do in the hallway that won't just become more proof I can't handle this.

Therapist: It's like the breath is getting caught up in the cycle of self-criticism. What if, when you stop and breathe, you simply drop your arms, let them fall to your sides, and let your body relax?

Patient: I can picture dropping my arms — I even tried it for a beat and there was a tiny looseness, then my head immediately started replaying and the shame tightened everything again. I'm not sure I follow how letting my arms fall is actually different from the other micro-tricks; if the breath and the drop don't stop the racing, what exact, concrete move do I do next in the hallway that I literally can't overthink? I'm worn thin and skeptical, but I'll try if you give me a step-by-step I can actually do when it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical movements are getting caught up in the cycle. What if, when you drop your arms, you simply turn your head slightly to the side, just enough to take in the people around you, but not so much that you're trying to engage with them – just noticing their presence, without judgment or attention?

Patient: I can try turning my head a bit, but that usually makes me feel exposed—my brain immediately jumps to everyone judging me and I either clamp up or the replay starts. How is just noticing people supposed to stop that, and if the shame spikes when I do, what exactly do I do in that moment that I literally can't overthink?

Therapist: It's like turning your head is becoming a way to avoid, rather than engage. What if, when the shame spikes, you could simply look up at the ceiling, just a tiny bit, without trying to focus on anything in particular – just the sensation of looking up, without judgment or attention?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—looking up feels exposed and my brain immediately judges. How is that supposed to help? I can try it, but if the shame spikes, what's the concrete next 10-second move I can do that I literally can't overthink?

Therapist: It's like looking up is becoming a form of self-criticism. What if, when you look up, you simply stop looking, and instead, let your gaze fall on something else – a fixture, a corner, a blank wall – and stay there, without trying to focus or analyze anything?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. Letting my eyes drop to a wall just gives my brain a beat to start judging—then the shame tightens and the replay kicks in. How is that supposed to help in the ten seconds when it spikes? Give me a concrete, stupid-simple step I can do then—I don't have the energy for anything fancy.

Therapist: It's like trying to find a new anchor. What if, when the shame spikes, you simply take a small step to the side, just a tiny inch – that's it – and stand still for a beat?

Patient: Okay—I'll try the tiny step to the side and stand. For a second my chest loosens a bit, then my head immediately starts replaying and the shame tightens up again. If that happens, what's the literal next 5–10 second move I do that I can't overthink? I'm worn thin from these half-fixes.
