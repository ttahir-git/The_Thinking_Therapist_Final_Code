--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm in my early fifties and work as a data scientist, and lately I've been stuck in this paradox where mindfulness and meditation feel like an anesthetic—I'm using them to avoid the rawness of grief instead of processing it. I tend to intellectualize everything—labeling, categorizing, theorizing—so I can stay functional, but it feels like emotional avoidance, and the ongoing financial stress just amplifies that pressure. Outwardly I'm gregarious and optimistic, but honestly I think I'm better at talking about feelings than actually feeling them.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the tension between your desire to avoid discomfort and your underlying need for emotional connection. That's a really insightful observation about feeling like you're "better at talking about feelings than actually feeling them." Can you think of a moment recently where you felt like you were just going through the motions of talking about your emotions, but not really experiencing them in your body?

Patient: Yeah — at my sister’s small memorial last month I delivered this very tidy, articulate eulogy about loss and narrative arcs, and everyone nodded like it made sense. Internally there was this dull tightness in my chest and a kind of numb, fluttery feeling in my hands, but instead of naming any of that I launched into an analysis of grief stages and how mindfulness has been my go-to anesthetic. I realized afterward I’d been more invested in explaining my coping strategies than actually letting the ache register in my body.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're recognizing the gap between your verbal expression of emotions and the underlying physical sensations. That's a huge insight. It's as if you're noticing that your mind is doing its usual job of providing a narrative to avoid the raw emotion. Can you think of a way to imagine or picture that numb, fluttery feeling in your hands without judgment – just to see it, as it is, in this moment?

Patient: When I try to picture it, it's like a low, distant electrical hum under the skin—an attenuated, cool vibration across my palms rather than a sharp ache. I can catalog its frequency and texture, even map where it lives, but the instant I do I notice I'm verbalizing and theorizing instead of letting it sit in my chest. So yes, I can "see" it, but my reflex is to analyze it away.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're able to observe the sensation in a way that's almost clinical, which is really interesting. It's as if your mind is still in "expert mode" trying to make sense of it. Now, I'd like to explore what would happen if, instead of trying to analyze the sensation, you simply allowed it to be there, without trying to make sense of it or give it a name. What would it be like to just let the numb, fluttery feeling sit in your chest, without any judgment, for just a few breaths?

Patient: I tried that for a few breaths just now, and what happens is predictable—rather than the numbness deepening, it becomes this low-frequency hum that my mind immediately wants to model: where it came from, how long it’s lasted, which meditation techniques mitigate it. Physically there’s a mild tightening in the chest and a coolness in my palms, but instead of sinking into that I start cataloging variables and interventions. It’s frustrating to notice I’m avoiding the stillness by turning the feeling into data.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're seeing how your mind still tries to turn the stillness into a problem to be solved, even when you're trying to let go. That's a great observation about the mind's tendency to catalog and analyze. What would it be like to take a step back and say, "Okay, I'm noticing that my mind is trying to turn this stillness into a puzzle to be solved. And instead of trying to solve it, what if I simply acknowledged that and let it be?"

Patient: I think if I said that out loud I'd immediately recognize the metacognitive move — it's validating in theory, and on a conceptual level I can see the benefit. In practice, though, my chest loosens a hair and then my brain launches into contingency planning, taxonomy, and technique-selection, which feels like avoidance dressed up as competence. Could you help me practice actually staying with it for a minute? I'm worried I'll default to analysis.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is already anticipating the next move, and that's making it hard to let go. Okay, let's try something small. I'm going to suggest we just pause here, and you just focus on the sensation in your chest. I want you to notice it as it is, without trying to label it, analyze it, or think about what to do with it. Just notice it. Can you give me a 5-second nod when you feel yourself starting to analyze or try to turn it into a problem, and we can pause and come back to it?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try that. Since this is text, I’ll type “pause” within five seconds of noticing I’m analyzing instead of feeling; that’ll be my stand-in nod. I’m worried I’ll still default to taxonomy and contingency-planning—it's almost compulsive—so if you don’t see a “pause,” could you gently prompt me back to the sensation?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'll be watching for your "pause" signal. And don't worry, it's okay if you don't pause – it's all part of the process. If you do start to get caught up in taxonomy or contingency-planning, I'll gently say "pause" and nudge you back to the sensation in your chest. Just start whenever you feel the urge to analyze, and we'll work with it from there. Go ahead and begin.

Patient: Okay—breathing in slowly, out slowly. There's that low hum in my chest, a cool tightness spreading under the sternum and into my palms; I can feel the edges of it, but my brain is already listing causes and remedies—pause. 

I notice a little relief when I acknowledge the analysis, but also irritation that I default to problem-solving instead of staying with the sensation.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're acknowledging the pause and noticing the sense of relief when you catch yourself, which is a great start. And you're also recognizing the underlying irritation that comes up when you default to problem-solving. That's really interesting. Now, I want to gently ask, what would it be like if, instead of trying to change or fix the feeling, you simply allowed it to be there – not as a problem, not as a cause, but just as it is?

Patient: If I talk about it, I’d say allowing it would be like leaving a noisy signal unfiltered so you can actually see its shape instead of smoothing it out. In practice, when I try that my chest stays tight and a small, hot sadness surfaces and I immediately start labeling and compartmentalizing to make it manageable. I can try to stay with the cool vibration in my palms and the tightening in my sternum now—I'll type "pause" if I catch myself analyzing—would you prompt me if I slip?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's a really great way to describe what allowing might feel like. You're not trying to change or fix it, but rather see it in its raw form. And it's interesting that you're noticing how labeling and compartmentalizing can actually make it more manageable, but also a bit numb. That's a great insight.

As for prompting you to pause, I'll be watching for your "pause" signal, but I won't always prompt you. Instead, I'll also try to stay with the sensation in the room – the physical sensations, the emotions, the thoughts. If you slip into analysis, I'll just acknowledge it and gently nudge you back to the sensation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is simply "staying with" the sensation meaningfully different from another technique to manage or model it? It reads to me like another protocol my brain can file away and deploy, rather than something that actually lets the sadness land in my body, so I'm honestly a bit puzzled and skeptical about how this helps.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I can see how it might sound like another technique to manage or model the sensation. You're right that the sensation can still be "filed away" or become a "protocol" if we're not careful.

Let me try to rephrase it. When I say "staying with the sensation," I mean it in a more embodied sense. It's not just about noticing the sensation, but actually inhabiting it – feeling its texture, temperature, location, and intensity. It's about allowing the sensation to become a presence in the body, rather than just a thought or a concept. Would you be willing to try that – to simply feel the sensation in your body, without trying to label it, analyze it, or do anything with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is "inhabiting" the sensation materially different from another technique my brain can just catalog and file away? It sounds a bit like semantics to me, which is exactly the trap I fall into. I'm willing to try, but can you give a very concrete, time-limited prompt (like "for 30 seconds, breathe and notice the coolness in your palms") and I'll type "pause" if I catch myself analyzing — please nudge me if I slip, because I'm already bracing to turn this into another protocol.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I see what's causing the confusion. You're right that "inhabiting" can sound like a vague concept. Let's try a more concrete approach.

Here's a prompt: "For the next 30 seconds, I want you to focus on the sensation of your palms, without trying to label it, analyze it, or do anything with it. Just notice the sensation of the coolness, its texture, its edges – wherever you can. Let's say... 10 seconds in, and then we'll check in. Go ahead and start."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help in the long run, but okay — starting now. Focusing on the coolness in my palms: it's faint, like a sheet of coolness across the pads of my fingers, edges a little numb. Ten seconds in and my brain's already lining up theories and prior techniques—pause.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've already caught yourself! That's great. Just pause for a moment, and let the sensation be. I'll wait with you for a bit. (pause) Now, can you take a deep breath in, and slowly exhale, and when you're ready, we'll continue with the exercise.

Patient: I took a deep breath and exhaled—there was a tiny loosening, but I'm not sure I follow how this materially helps long-term; it still reads as another protocol my brain can catalogue. I'm feeling a bit guarded and mildly irritated—like I'm watching myself perform competence instead of letting the sadness land. Can you give a very concrete next prompt (20–30 seconds, focus on the sternum this time) and please nudge me if I slip—I’ll type "pause" if I catch myself analyzing.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're right to wonder how this exercise might help in the long run. Let's try to focus on the process, not the outcome.

For the next 20-30 seconds, I want you to focus on the sensation in your sternum. Notice the area just below your breastbone, the shape, the texture, the temperature – whatever you can. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to change it, just notice it. When you feel yourself starting to analyze or get caught up in thoughts, just type "pause" and we'll take it from there. Go ahead and start.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the sternum materially different from the other protocols my brain can just catalogue? 

Okay, starting now: there's a tight, low-pressure band just below the breastbone, a kind of dull, molten weight and a faint coolness at the edges; my mind is already enumerating coping strategies and timelines—pause. 

I feel a little irritated and performative about this, like I'm observing my competence rather than letting the sadness land, so please nudge me if I slip back into analysis.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're right to question the difference, and that's a great sign that you're starting to see through the protocol mentality.

I'm not looking for a magical or profound insight, but rather a simple, gentle reminder to let go. Since you've caught yourself already, let's just pause for a moment and acknowledge that you're feeling a bit irritated and performative about this. That's okay. It's natural.

Now, can you try to just let the sensation in your sternum be, without judgment, for just 10 seconds? Don't try to analyze it, don't try to change it, just notice it as it is.

Patient: Alright—I'll try for ten seconds now. Focusing... there's that low, molten pressure under my sternum, a kind of warm heaviness with cool edges; my mind is already cataloguing antecedents and timelines—pause. I feel a bit sheepish and performative about staying with it, so please nudge me back if I slip.

Therapist Answer:
You're doing great. You're catching yourself again, and that takes a lot of courage.

Since you've paused, I want to gently nudge you back to the sensation in your sternum. Let's try to focus on the sensation of the warm, molten pressure, and see if we can let it be there, without judgment or analysis. Just notice it, as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when you say "let it be" I get this vague confusion, and right away a hot flush of shame and self-reproach comes up that drags me into analysis. My chest tightens, my face feels warm, and my mind is already lining up corrective strategies—pause. Can you help me stay with the warm pressure in my sternum without me defaulting to competence and explanation?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment "let it be" becomes a trigger for self-reproach and analysis. I want to try something a bit different.

Let's try a more physical prompt. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation in your sternum, and I want you to say the phrase "I am" right after you notice the sensation. Not "I have," not "I think," but simply "I am." Just the words "I am." This is a very simple, concrete prompt, and I want you to say it, even if it feels awkward or silly. Just do it.

Patient: Okay — there's that warm, molten pressure under my sternum… I am. That felt oddly exposed and a hot flush of shame and irritation surged up, and my reflex was to start rationalizing and categorizing—pause. Can you give another very short, concrete prompt and gently nudge me if I slip back into analysis?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're developing a sense of the phrase "I am" as a anchor for presence. Now, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and I want you to simply say "yes" with an upraised eyebrow, as if you're acknowledging the sensation without judgment. Not a thought, not a feeling, just a simple "yes."

Patient: Okay — bringing attention to the warm pressure in my chest… “yes.” Saying it felt oddly exposed, like I’d opened a file the brain didn’t want inspected; a hot flush of shame and irritation surged and my mind immediately started rationalizing and rehearsing—pause. I feel a little sheepish and performative about this, so could you gently nudge me back if I slip, and maybe give another very short, concrete prompt (like a 15-second breath-count) so I don’t default to explanation?

It sounds like the "yes" anchor is helping a bit. I'll try to provide a gentle nudge and a concrete prompt to help you stay with the sensation.

Since you've paused, let's take a deep breath in for a count of 4, and out for a count of 4. As you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, and simply say "yes" again.

Patient: I breathed 4 in, 4 out, exhaled and said "yes"—it landed like a hot, embarrassed flush and my chest tightened; I felt shame and irritation swell, and my brain immediately moved to contingency-planning—pause. It still feels performative, like I'm auditioning competence instead of actually feeling the sadness, and that frustrates me. Could you give another very short, concrete prompt (15–20 seconds) and please nudge me if I slip back into analysis? I’m worried I’ll default to explaining it away.

It's like you're getting close to cracking through to a different way of experiencing the sensation. I'll try to provide a gentle nudge and another concrete prompt.

Let's try a 20-second body scan, focusing on your breath. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and as you exhale, slowly exhale and say "yes". Just notice the sensation, without judgment, and don't try to explain or analyze it.

Patient: I did the 20-second scan—breathed in, focused on the sternum, exhaled and said "yes"—and it hit as that same molten pressure with a hot, shameful flush that made me feel exposed and oddly defensive. I'm not sure I follow how this materially differs from another protocol; a sudden, intrusive image of a past failure tinted the moment and my brain immediately went into metacognitive overdrive—pause. I'm frustrated and sheepish about how performative I feel; can you give another very short, concrete prompt (15 seconds, breathe in 3, out 3, say "yes" on the exhale) and please nudge me if I slip back into analysis?

I'll also give you a gentle nudge: as soon as you catch yourself thinking or feeling something, I'll say "pause" and we'll come back to the sensation in your chest.

Patient: Okay—starting the 3-3-3 now. Inhale 1–2–3, hold 1–2–3, exhale 1–2–3 and "yes"—it landed as that molten pressure under my sternum and a hot shamey flush rose, and before I knew it my brain was spinning corrective strategies—pause. I feel sheepish and frustrated that it still reads like performative competence; can you gently nudge me back and give a very short (10–15s) prompt to stay with the chest sensation so I don't immediately intellectualize it?

Let's try a 10-second "anchor moment". I want you to focus on the sensation in your chest, and whenever you feel yourself starting to analyze or intellectualize, I'll say "check in" and you can bring your attention back to the sensation. No prompts, no instructions, just a simple check-in. Are you ready to try?

Patient: All right — I'm willing to try, though as a data scientist I'm predisposed to algorithmic problem-solving and skeptical this won't just become another thing my brain files away. I'll do the 10-second anchor; if I catch myself analyzing I'll type "pause," and please say "check in" if you notice me slipping. Ready when you are.
