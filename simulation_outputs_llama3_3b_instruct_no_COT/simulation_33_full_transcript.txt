Patient: I've been stuck in these cycles of harsh self-criticism — I obsess over perceived failures, especially after a rough breakup and losing someone close, and it's draining my energy at work and in my life. I'm a data scientist, burned out and pretty easily distracted, and it's weird because I'm usually gregarious and optimistic but this just keeps dragging me down. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried to shake it before and it didn't work, so how is talking about it supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the impact of these cycles on your life. That you're willing to explore them again suggests you're already taking a step in the right direction. What would happen if, instead of trying to shake off these thoughts, you allowed yourself to feel the discomfort of being stuck, without judgment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried sitting with the feelings before and it just becomes rumination — I replay the breakup and every mistake until I’m totally useless at work. I guess maybe, in theory, it could stop the constant fighting with myself, but I’m really skeptical it won’t just make me spiral more.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the experience of sitting with your feelings can be quite overwhelming, leading to a cycle of self-criticism. What if, instead of trying to sit with the emotions themselves, you started to explore where the urge to replay the past and self-criticize might be coming from?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I've tried tracing my patterns before and it just turns into overthinking — I end up rehashing every mistake until I'm useless. If I had to guess, it's tied to the breakup and losing someone; I started believing I'm fundamentally flawed and keep replaying things to try to fix that, but it just burns me out at work. Maybe it's also about fear of abandonment and this ridiculous perfectionism, but I'm not sure exploring it won't just make me spiral more.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the process of tracing patterns and self-reflection has led to more rumination. Can you think of a moment when you were able to tolerate some discomfort without trying to fix or replay the situation? What would happen if, in that moment, you were to notice your thoughts about the breakup and yourself, without trying to change them?

Patient: Yeah — there was one moment last week on the subway after a rough stand-up where I felt that usual knot and I actually tried what you said: I noticed the loop of “I messed up” thoughts and just watched them for a few minutes without trying to fix them. For a bit it felt less frantic, like the thoughts lost some urgency, but after maybe five minutes I couldn’t hold it and I started replaying everything again. I get the idea, but honestly — how is that supposed to help if I can’t keep it from turning into full-on rumination? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m really struggling.


--- Turn 4 ---

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to recognize when you're slipping back into rumination. It's interesting that you noticed the knot of thoughts on the subway, and for a brief moment, it felt less frantic. What would happen if, instead of trying to hold onto that sense of calm, you allowed yourself to simply return to your usual state, without judgment – like you were just riding the subway, rather than trying to control it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Letting myself drift back into the usual state just feels like giving up control, and usually that’s when the replaying gets louder and I end up useless at work. I did notice once that not fighting the thoughts made them less urgent for a minute, but it didn’t stop the spiral — so I’m skeptical. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m really struggling — what do I actually do when it starts to spiral so it doesn’t turn into that same destructive loop?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that letting go of control might lead to the same old patterns. Can you think of a time when you've been in a situation where you had to let go of trying to control a difficult emotion or situation, and it didn't completely fall apart? What was the outcome, and what was different about that experience compared to when you try to control it?

Patient: Okay—one clear time was at work last quarter: I totally bombed a sprint demo and, instead of pretending everything was fine, I said I was burned out and asked the team to cover a few tasks. They didn't judge, we redistributed the work, the demo still went okay, and I actually felt less crushed afterward because I didn't have to carry it all alone. That helped because I let people in instead of spiraling alone, but I'm still skeptical—how does that translate to the replaying of breakups when I'm by myself on the subway or alone at night?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like having a support system helped you cope with the aftermath of a difficult situation. What would happen if, when you start replaying the breakup and feeling overwhelmed, you were to start reaching out to someone or something that provides comfort and support, even if it's just a small step, like sending a text to a friend or taking a few deep breaths, rather than trying to tackle it alone?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm worried I'll just annoy people or sound needy — and if they don't respond, I feel worse. Deep breaths help for a minute sometimes, but I can't always text a friend at 2 a.m. or drag someone into my spiral. What would a realistic, low-effort plan look like that doesn't feel like I'm burdening people or just fuels the rumination more?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried about reaching out for support might not be feasible or effective. Can you think of a small, simple thing you can do right where you are, without needing to reach out to others, that might help you shift your focus or calm your nervous system when the replaying starts?

Patient: Okay — I can think of a few tiny, low-effort things that might actually be doable in the moment: a 30–60 second grounding (5-4-3-2-1 senses), a minute of box breathing or just slow breaths, or get up and grab a glass of water and step outside for one minute. How is that supposed to help? I don’t know — in practice the breathing or stepping outside sometimes breaks the loop for me for a bit, and the one-line journal trick (write one sentence about how you feel, then stop) keeps me from spiraling into analysis. I'm trying to see which of those feels realistic to try next time I start replaying.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Those tiny moments of grounding and self-care seem to be small victories in your experience. What if, when the replaying starts, you were to start with one of those simple practices, not to try to stop the thoughts or change your emotions, but simply to acknowledge the physical sensations that arise in your body as you do it – notice the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sounds around you?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Noticing sensations sometimes calms me for a minute, but as soon as I try to "observe" the feeling I end up narrating the whole breakup again. Maybe a realistic plan would help — like a tiny script I can follow: 60 seconds 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, one-line journal sentence, then get up and do one small work task. I’m willing to try it, but I’m already worried I’ll beat myself up if I can’t stick to the script.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're concerned about sticking to the plan and getting caught up in self-criticism. What if, instead of focusing on following a script, you were to approach it as an experiment – allowing yourself to see what happens when you try to follow this plan, and being kind to yourself if you get derailed, without judgment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I’ve done “experiments” before and then just end up beating myself up when they don’t work, so I’m tempted not to try. Still—if we frame it like data: a tiny hypothesis, one clear metric (did the rumination drop within 5 minutes?), and a short fallback script for when I derail ("okay, this is hard, I tried"), I might actually try it—can you help me turn that into a realistic, low-effort plan I can use at 2 a.m.?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're considering a more data-driven approach to help you stay on track. What if, instead of trying to follow a script or achieve a specific outcome, you simply started by acknowledging that you're willing to try this plan, and just began with the first step, without adding any expectations or judgments about whether it will work or not?

Patient: Okay—I can say I'm willing to try the plan, but I'm feeling really jittery and distracted right now and that makes saying it feel empty—how is that supposed to help when I already expect to fail? If we're treating it like data, give me a micro-script I can use at 2 a.m.: “60s 5-4-3-2-1 grounding → one-line journal → one tiny task,” plus a fallback line for derailment like “this was hard, I tried.” And set one clear metric I can track (did rumination drop within 5 minutes?) so I can see results without immediately beating myself up—does that seem realistic?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling to muster motivation in the moment. What if, instead of focusing on the "success" of the plan, you were to focus on simply showing up and taking the first step, without any attachment to the outcome, and acknowledge that it's okay to start small?

Patient: Okay—I can try to just start, but I’m really jittery and distracted right now and it makes committing feel empty. Here’s the micro-script I want to use at 2 a.m.: 60s 5-4-3-2-1 grounding → one-line journal sentence → one tiny task (like open a doc and type a single sentence); fallback: “This was hard. I tried.” Metric: did rumination drop within 5 minutes? yes/no. 

How is that supposed to help when I’ll probably obsess over the yes/no answer and beat myself up if it’s “no”? If the rumination doesn’t drop or gets worse, what’s a realistic next step that won’t feel like another way to fail—repeat the script, do another grounding, or something else?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're anticipating the rumination to be a persistent and self-critical voice. What if, when you reach the "yes" or "no" part of your metric, instead of dwelling on the outcome, you simply acknowledged the result, and then brought your attention back to the present moment – noticing what's happening in your body and surroundings, without judgment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm really jittery and distracted right now and I know I'll obsess over the yes/no result. Saying “acknowledge the result” feels too vague — can you give me a one-line micro-phrase I can say to myself that won't turn into analysis (like “Noted, moving on” or something)? And if it’s a “no” and the rumination gets louder, what’s a realistic next step that doesn’t feel like another test—repeat the 60s grounding once, do one quick physical reset (stand up/wash my face), then use the fallback “This was hard. I tried.”? Can you tighten that into a single, ultra-simple script I can actually follow at 2 a.m.?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a concrete action to take after the yes/no outcome. What if, when you reach that point, you said to yourself: "Done"? It's a very simple, unadorned phrase that acknowledges the completion of the task, without adding any further analysis or evaluation.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Saying “Done” feels kind of abrupt and weird — when I’m jittery and my brain’s racing it’ll probably turn into “Did I really finish?” and launch me back into analysis. 

Maybe tweak it to something tiny but concrete, like: 60s 5-4-3-2-1 grounding → one-line journal → one tiny task → say “Done. Pause.” → check metric (rumination down in 5 min? yes/no). If no: repeat one 60s grounding, do a quick physical reset (stand up/wash face), then fallback: “This was hard. I tried.” Does that seem realistic? 

Also — can we do a very quick rehearsal now? Walk me through the script one step at a time so I can see how “Done. Pause.” actually lands when I’m jittery.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a phrase that feels more solid and concrete. Revising the script to include "Done. Pause." seems like a good step. Let's rehearse it together, slowly and mindfully.

Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, begin with the first step: 60s 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. Take a moment to notice the sensations in your body, the sounds around you, and the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Now, after the grounding, what's the next step?

Patient: The next step is the one-line journal sentence — one short line about how I feel, nothing more. 

Give me the exact, strict phrasing to use because if I start with “I’m feeling…” it turns into a paragraph. Maybe an example I can copy: “I’m anxious and replaying the breakup.” After that I do the tiny task (open a doc and type one sentence), then say “Done. Pause.” and check the metric.

How is that supposed to help? I’m really jittery and distracted right now — say the one-liner and the “Done. Pause.” part slowly so I can rehearse saying it out loud without spiraling.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
Let's rehearse the exact phrasing: "Anxious and replaying the breakup." Say it out loud, slowly and clearly, with no elaboration or embellishment. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, continue with the next step.

As you say "Anxious and replaying the breakup," take a moment to pause, and then say "Done. Pause." The goal is to simply complete the phrase without judgment or analysis. 

Let's try it again, slowly and mindfully. Are you ready?

Patient: Okay — I’m ready.

“Anxious and replaying the breakup.”  
“Done. Pause.”

That felt weird and flat and my heart’s racing — my brain’s already jumping to “did I say it right” and other variations. How is that supposed to help if I immediately start analyzing it? What should I do next?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the exercise is sparking more analysis instead of the desired pause. Let's try to slow things down further. Instead of immediately checking if you said it "right," take a deep breath and simply focus on the physical sensation of your body, like the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin. Notice the physical sensation without judgment or labeling it.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try, but my chest is tight and I feel this hot shame and stupid-ness bubbling up so I can barely keep my attention on my feet. How is that supposed to help when all I can think is about failing again and then I get angrier at myself for not being able to focus? Can we slow down—give me one tiny, exact thing to notice right now (just the feet or just the breath) and I’ll try it, but honestly I’m frustrated and scared this will just turn into another spiral.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the exercise is triggering a strong emotional response. Let's take a tiny step back. Notice the sensation of your breath. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it. That's all.

Patient: Okay—I’m trying. Breath in, breath out… it feels shallow and my chest is tight, and this hot shame about screwing up keeps barging in so my mind jumps away. How is just noticing the breath supposed to stop that? Give me one tiny anchor phrase and an exact count to use right now so I don’t start analyzing—otherwise I’ll just ruminate.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is still present. Let's try a tiny anchor phrase and a specific count to help you focus. Notice: "Four seconds of breath." When you feel the shame or your mind starts to wander, simply acknowledge it and then focus on counting: "One, two, three, four..."

Patient: Four seconds of breath. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

It helps a hair, but that hot shame keeps crowding in and my brain's already replaying the failure and then I'm mad at myself for not calming down. How is that supposed to help when the shame just refuses to leave? If counting doesn't work, what's one tiny next thing right now I can actually do that won't feel like another test?

It sounds like the shame is still present. Let's try something more gentle. Instead of trying to change or analyze it, notice: "The sensation in my chest." Just acknowledge the sensation, without trying to label it or change it. No judgment, no interpretation. Just notice.

Patient: Okay — I can feel a heavy tightness, like a hot knot under my ribs. It blunts things a bit but the shame's still loud and I'm wiped out; how is that supposed to help, and what's one tiny concrete thing I can do right now that isn't another test?

It sounds like standing is helping with physical relaxation, but the shame is still present. One tiny thing you can do now is: "Wash your face." Simply go to the sink, turn on the water, and splash some water on your face. No thinking, no analysis. Just the physical action of washing your face.

Patient: I washed my face. It cooled the knot a little and pulled me out of the spiral for a moment, but the shame's still loud and I feel wiped—like I have no gas left. How is washing my face supposed to help when my brain just zooms right back to that failure? Give me one tiny, concrete next thing to do that won't feel like another test—pick one for me (like "place your hand on your chest for 10 seconds" or "walk to the window and name three things you see")—I need something stupid-simple I can actually follow.
