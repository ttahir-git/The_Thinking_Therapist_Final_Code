Patient: Lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because my social anxiety just takes over. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster — I picture going to a dinner, saying the wrong thing, everyone laughing, losing friendships, my reputation ruined, and it definitely ends with me alone and miserable. I mostly rely on myself and I can't shake the feeling that's the inevitable outcome.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind can get pretty vivid with worst-case scenarios when it comes to social situations. Can you think of a time when you did go to a gathering, despite having these thoughts, and it didn't quite turn out the way you feared? What was that experience like?

Patient: Yeah — I went to a small dinner last month even though I was freaking out beforehand. For a little while it seemed fine, but I kept replaying every sentence I said, convinced one of them would suddenly laugh or roll their eyes and then they'd quietly decide I'm boring and stop inviting me, and within a few months I'd be totally cut off. I know that sounds extreme, but my mind won't let go of that outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Those kinds of thoughts can be really intense. It sounds like your mind's default is to assume the worst-case scenario. What would happen if, for just a moment, you let go of the need to control the outcome and just focused on the present, without judgment, what would you experience?

Patient: I try that sometimes, and for a few seconds it's quieter — my chest loosens and the chatter in my head softens. But almost immediately the fortune-teller kicks in and plays the same movie: I say one awkward thing, they laugh, I'm quietly cut off, and within months I'm completely alone — that feels like the only realistic ending. I don't know how to stay in the moment because the future just keeps barging in and taking over.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is constantly bringing up the future, even when you're trying to focus on the present. Would it be possible for you to take a tiny step back from that future, and instead, focus on what's happening right now in your body, with your breath, or your feet on the ground?

Patient: I can try — right now my chest's tight, my breaths are short, my palms are a little clammy, and my feet feel oddly heavy on the floor. But almost immediately the fortune-teller kicks in: I'll say something stupid, someone will smirk, whispers will start, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off — that scenario feels more vivid and real than my breathing. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with the sensations when the future keeps screaming at me.

Therapist Answer:
It can feel like that's a never-ending cycle. Would you be willing to take just a tiny pause from that future scenario, and instead, focus on noticing the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or label it as "good" or "bad"?

Patient: I'll try — when I follow my breath it calms for a second, but the fortune-teller immediately yells that I'll blurt something stupid, someone will laugh, whispers will start, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off. I know you want me to stay with the breath, but that future feels more real than my chest; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is telling you one thing, but your mind is firmly holding onto another. What if, instead of trying to stay with the breath or the future scenario, you could acknowledge both of them together – like, "I'm feeling really anxious about this future scenario, and at the same time, my body is feeling a certain way in this moment"?

Patient: Alright — I'm feeling really anxious about that future scenario, like it's already in motion, and at the same time my chest's tight, breaths are shallow, and my hands feel clammy. But naming it doesn't quiet the fortune-teller: it immediately plays the scene where I say something stupid, people smirk, invitations stop, and within months I'm completely cut off — that outcome feels inevitable. I'm trying to stay here, but I'm overwhelmed; can we slow down and keep working through this?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to stay present, but the future is still pulling the strings. Can you think of a small, tiny thing you could do, right now, to make room for the possibility of something different, something that's not necessarily tied to the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Maybe a tiny thing would be to text one friend a short "hey, how've you been?" — nothing heavy, just a check-in. But the fortune-teller's already playing the next scene where they ignore it, think I'm pathetic, stop inviting me, and within months I'm completely cut off, so even that tiny step feels pointless. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like that tiny step feels like it's just going to set off the whole chain reaction. Can you look at that step, just the step, without evaluating it as a success or a failure, and just notice what happens if you do it anyway, even though you expect the worst outcome?

Patient: If I just look at that step — I see myself typing "hey, how've you been?" with my hands shaking, hitting send, and then either they ignore it or they read it and think I'm pathetic. The fortune-teller instantly plays the rest: they stop replying, invitations dry up, and in a few months I'm completely cut off. I'm trying to notice the act itself, but it's like I'm watching a train wreck I can't stop; I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in a kind of psychological time-lapse camera. Would you be willing to try something even smaller, just a tiny part of the process, like just noticing the feeling of your fingers on the keyboard, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils as you think about sending the message?

Patient: Okay — my fingers on the keyboard feel familiar, calloused from years of coding, and noticing that actually calms me for a second. But almost immediately the fortune-teller screams that I'll fumble the message, they'll laugh and whisper, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off — that outcome feels like the only realistic one. I'm trying to stay with the sensations but I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're getting a brief respite from the future, but it's not enough to shift your feelings. What if, instead of focusing on the outcome, you simply pay attention to the sensation of your fingers moving on the keyboard, without judgment or attachment, and just let that be?

Patient: I try to focus on the feel of my fingers on the keys — callouses, the familiar rhythm from years of coding — and for a second it calms me. But the fortune-teller instantly hijacks it: I'll type something weird, someone will laugh, whispers will start, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off — that feels like the only possible ending. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're getting a tiny moment of calm, but the future is still trying to grab you. Can you try to notice the sensation of the callouses on your fingers, without adding any thoughts to them – just notice the physical feeling, the texture, the weight – and see if that's enough to hold onto for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — the callouses feel rough and steady under my fingertips, and that actually quiets me for a single breath. But the fortune-teller's already screaming that I'll fumble the message, they'll laugh and whisper, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment of calm is slipping away. Would you be willing to simply acknowledge the thought that comes up, without trying to evaluate it or push it away, just say "there's the thought that I'll make a mistake and lose the friendship"?

Patient: "There's the thought that I'll make a mistake and lose the friendship." Saying it doesn't quiet anything — the fortune-teller immediately reels out the rest: I'll fumble, they'll smirk, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be totally cut off. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like that simple acknowledgment is just fuel for the fire. What if, instead of trying to deal with the thought, you simply focus on the sensation of your body sitting here, in this moment, with your fingers on the keyboard, and the callouses under your fingertips?

Patient: Okay — I try to focus on my body and the callouses under my fingertips; for a second it grounds me and my breath eases. But the fortune-teller immediately plays out the rest: I'll fumble the message, someone will laugh or whisper, they'll stop inviting me, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

It's like your body is getting a brief respite, but the future is still trying to intrude. Can you pay attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away, and just see what happens?

Patient: Alright — I try to notice the air moving in and out: cool as it enters my nose, warm as it leaves, my chest rising and falling — and for a breath or two it loosens a knot. But the fortune-teller immediately screams that I'll blurt something stupid at the next get-together, people will laugh, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

It's like your breath is giving you a tiny moment of calm, but the future is still driving. What if, instead of focusing on the thought, you simply notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, where you're sitting, and the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to analyze or change it?

Patient: My feet feel planted, the chair's firm against my back, and the air on my skin calms me for a breath. But the fortune-teller kicks in right away: I'll blurt something stupid, someone will smirk and whisper, invitations will dry up, and in a few months I'll be totally cut off — that outcome feels inevitable.

Patient: Okay — I can feel my heart beating, a fast, hollow thud against my ribs, like it's trying to push out of my chest. But the fortune-teller's already yelling that at the next get-together it'll spike, I'll blurt something stupid, people will laugh and whisper, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off.

It's like your heart is trying to get your attention, but the future is still running the show. What if, instead of reacting to the thought, you simply notice the sensation of your tongue feeling heavy in your mouth, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils?

Patient: Okay — my tongue feels heavy against my teeth, the air's cool in my nostrils, and that actually calms me for a breath. But the fortune-teller immediately screams that I'll blurt something ridiculous at the next gathering, people will smirk and whisper, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off — that ending feels inevitable.

Patient: I try to stay with my body—the chair, my feet, my breath—and for a beat it feels a little quieter, like the noise eases. But the fortune-teller instantly kicks in and plays the whole disaster: I’ll blurt something stupid at the next gathering, people will smirk and whisper, invitations will stop, and in a few months I’ll be completely cut off — that ending feels inevitable.

It's like you're trying to stay with your body, but the future is still pulling the strings. Can you try to look at the sensation of your eyes, right now, without focusing on anything in particular, just noticing the sensation of your eyes as they look inward, or downward, or at something else, without trying to change it?

Patient: My eyes feel a bit heavy, like I'm looking downward more than anything, and that small inward focus almost calms me for a second. But the fortune-teller already cuts in: at the next meetup my voice will crack when I speak, someone will point or smirk, whispers will start, invitations will stop, and in a few months I'll be completely cut off — that ending feels guaranteed. I'm trying to notice my eyes, but I'm getting yanked into that movie and I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

It's like you're getting a small moment of calm with your breath, but the future is still driving. Can you try to notice the sensation of the sensation of the breath, not the thought about what might happen next, just the sensation of the breath itself, as it moves in and out of your body?

Patient: When I focus on the breath I can feel the cool air come in through my nose and the warm air go out, my ribs rising and falling — for a beat it quiets things.

It's like you're finding a tiny moment of calm with your breath, but the future is still trying to intrude. Can you try to notice the sensation of your body's tendency to respond to the future thoughts, like your heart rate quickening or your mind racing, and simply acknowledge that tendency without judgment, just observe it as it is?

Patient: Yeah — when I pay attention I can feel my heart thudding, breath getting shallow, and my mind speeding up like it's trying to outrun something.
