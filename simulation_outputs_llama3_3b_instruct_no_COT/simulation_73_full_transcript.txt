Patient: Um, lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed — since I lost my job it's been hard to get motivated and it's left me pretty sad, which is starting to strain my relationship. I try to stay upbeat and keep myself busy with school, but I get distracted and then feel guilty about not doing more. I don't know... it's just a lot.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really caught up in the struggle right now. It's like there's a lot of emotional weight on you, and it's affecting your relationships and daily life. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you feel overwhelmed and your mind starts to wander?

Patient: Yeah, when it happens my mind just scatters — I start a bunch of little things and none of them get finished, then I feel guilty and worse. I get this heavy sadness that makes getting out of bed or focusing on school feel impossible, and it bleeds into how I am with my partner. I guess I try to cover it up with jokes or staying busy, but mostly I just feel stuck and I don't know what to do.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling to find a way to make sense of and cope with these feelings of overwhelm and guilt. It's like your mind is racing and your body is physically feeling heavy. You're trying to put on a brave face with the jokes and staying busy, but underneath, you're really feeling stuck. Can you think of a time when you were able to take a break from all the responsibilities and just allowed yourself to feel the weight of those emotions without judgment? What happened when you did?

Patient: I guess there was this one Sunday a few weeks after I lost the job — my partner made breakfast and I just let myself cry on the couch instead of trying to be funny or busy. After that I felt a little lighter and actually managed to get a few things done that day, but I don't know, it never seems to last because I start spiraling about bills and school and then I distract myself. Can we... I mean, I don't know, what do people even do to make that stick?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like taking that break and allowing yourself to feel your emotions that day helped you find a small sense of relief, but it's like it's hard to sustain. It's like you're constantly fighting against the urge to distract yourself or escape from those feelings. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do start to feel that urge to distract yourself – what's the first thing that comes up for you, like a trigger to pull the rug out from under your feet?

Patient: I guess it usually starts with something small — a bill reminder, an email I wasn't sure about, or even my partner looking stressed — and my chest just tightens and I can't focus. I immediately do something I can control: clean the kitchen, start a bunch of tiny tasks, or scroll through my phone and make a joke to change the mood. I don't know... it feels like keeping busy keeps the awful thoughts from hitting, but then I feel worse afterward.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using those small tasks and distractions as a way to cope with the physical sensation of anxiety in your chest. It's like your body is responding to the feeling of overwhelm and you're using busyness as a way to try to make yourself feel better, at least for a little while. Would you be willing to try something different, just for a moment, to see what happens? Maybe we could start with taking a deep breath, and just notice where you are, physically and emotionally, without doing anything at all?

Patient: Okay... I tried the breath. My chest is still tight and my mind keeps flicking to the list of things I should be doing. It feels really weird to just sit with it — I start wanting to clean or check my phone instead. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body and mind are really set in their ways, and it's hard to break free from the patterns of distraction and busyness. Can you think of a time when you were doing something you really enjoyed, something that made you feel connected to yourself and happy, and what was happening in your body when you were doing that?

Patient: I guess the community garden last summer — just digging, planting, talking to folks — felt really good. My shoulders actually loosened, my breathing got slower, and I wasn't stuck in that tight chest for a while. I don't know, it feels weird saying that out loud because it fades so fast and then I start scrolling or cracking jokes to hide that it went away.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the sense of connection and calm you felt in the community garden is fleeting, and you're already seeking to fill the void with other things. That's understandable, but it's also interesting that you mention the shoulders loosening and breathing slowing down – it sounds like there might be a physical sense of relaxation that's getting lost in the busyness. Would it be possible to explore what's happening when you're digging and planting in the garden – is it not just the activity itself that's bringing you comfort, or is there something else at play?

Patient: I think it's more than just the digging — it's the fresh air, the steady rhythm of the work, and people actually noticing the plants. My shoulders loosen and my head stops racing; I guess it's a tiny feeling of purpose and not being judged. I don't know, it's kind of awkward talking about this — could something like that be brought into other parts of my week?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the sense of purpose and connection with others, combined with the physical sensations of fresh air and rhythmic activity, is a powerful combination for you. It's not about changing the situation, but rather finding ways to tap into those feelings in other parts of your week. Can you imagine, just for a moment, taking a few deep breaths and noticing what's present in your body right now, without doing anything in particular, just observing how your body feels?

Patient: I tried that. I took a few deep breaths, but my chest's still tight, my shoulders feel clenched, and my mind just jumps to bills and emails. It feels weird to sit with it — I start wanting to clean or scroll — I guess the garden popped into my head and my shoulders loosened for a second, but I don't know how to make that stick; could we try something small I could do when it hits?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment of calm and connection is fleeting, and you're already looking for a distraction. I'm not asking you to stop thinking about bills or emails, but rather what would happen if, when you feel the urge to distract yourself, you took a tiny pause, just 5-10 seconds, to notice where your body is, and what's present in this moment?

Patient: I guess I could try that, but it feels really weird — my chest tightens and my hands want to do something, like clean or grab my phone. Maybe a tiny active thing would help me pause better, like standing up and stepping outside for a minute or naming three things I can see. I don't know, it's hard to do when I'm already spiraling and this is getting kind of close to the stuff I usually try to avoid.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is already in motion, and your mind is already racing, making it hard to pause. Taking a small, tangible action can sometimes be a way to ground yourself and give yourself a tiny bit of space. Would you be willing to try naming three things you can see right now, as you said, and then standing up to get a glass of water or something?

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try. Three things I can see: a blue mug, my laptop with stickers, and a little potted fern. I'll stand up and get a glass of water—I don't know, it feels weird doing this stuff out loud, but maybe it'll help.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the simple act of noticing and naming the physical objects around you is helping to slow things down a bit. Getting up to get a glass of water can also be a good way to create some physical space between you and your racing thoughts. As you're standing up, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin... and take a sip of water before we go back to exploring.

Patient: Okay, I took a sip — my feet feel a little more grounded and the chest's a bit less tight, but it doesn't last long before my mind zips to bills. I don't know, it feels really awkward doing this out loud, but maybe stepping outside for a minute could help next time. I guess… can we talk about how to fit something like the garden into my week without it feeling like another thing to fail at?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment of grounding is temporary, and you're already getting pulled back in. Stepping outside can be a good idea, but maybe instead of focusing on the garden as a specific activity, we can explore what values and qualities are important to you – what made it feel good to be in the garden, and how can you bring some of those qualities into your daily life?

Patient: I guess what made the garden feel good was being outside, doing steady, small tasks, and feeling like my work mattered a little — and people noticing the plants made me feel seen. Maybe I could try tiny versions of that: 10–20 minute walks, watering my little fern each morning, or one short volunteer shift a week — but I don't know, that already feels like another thing I could fail at. This is kind of awkward to say out loud and I panic a bit thinking about committing — can you help me figure out one really low-pressure step I could try that won't feel like a chore?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to recreate the sense of purpose and connection that you had in the garden, but it's feeling overwhelming to commit to new things. Let's start small, really small. What if, just for today, you simply commit to noticing your fern and taking care of it, without putting any expectations on yourself or thinking about it as a "volunteer shift"? Would you be willing to just observe the fern, and see what happens, without trying to do anything more?

Patient: I guess I can try just looking at the fern—maybe water it or touch the soil for a minute—but I'm already feeling this shame, like I'm about to add "not doing it" to the list of things I fail at, and that makes me tense. It's awkward saying that out loud. Could you help me make it even smaller—like one quick check of the soil each morning—so it doesn't feel like another chore?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the shame and self-criticism are already creeping in, making it hard to let go. Let's make it even smaller, really tiny. Instead of checking the soil, what if you just notice the soil right now, without thinking about the fern or even the task of watering it? Just a tiny glance, a brief observation of the texture, color, and feel of the soil beneath your finger?

Patient: Okay… I guess I can try that. I looked — the soil’s dry and crumbly, dark brown, with a few bits of old leaf — and I kind of feel stupid even saying I had to look, like I should’ve noticed sooner. I don't know, it helps a tiny bit but I’m already worrying I’ll mess it up or forget.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like even the small act of observing the soil is getting caught up in self-criticism and worry. Would you be willing to simply acknowledge that thought, and then let it go, without trying to change it or fix it? You could say to yourself, "Ah, I'm noticing that the soil feels dry and crumbly..." and then just pause, without adding any judgment or commentary?

Patient: I tried that and as soon as I noticed the thought a harsh voice jumped in — "you always mess things up" — and I felt that shame flare up, which just makes me clam up. I don't know how to let it sit without judging it; I guess saying the thought out loud might make it less sticky, but it's embarrassing. Could we try something more active instead, like you guiding me through naming five things and a quick stretch?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the harsh inner critic is always there, waiting to pounce. Sometimes, it can be helpful to engage with it in a more active way, rather than trying to push it away. Let's try a quick physical exercise to help shift your focus. I'll guide you through a simple stretch, and as you move your body, notice what happens in your mind. Can you start by rolling your shoulders, and then let's move down to your chest, and finally, up to the top of your head?

Patient: Okay... I rolled my shoulders — they were stupidly tight, like they didn't want to move. When I moved down to my chest it felt heavy and the tightness didn't let up, and thinking about the top of my head just made this flash of shame and frustration pop up, like I'm failing at even this. I don't know, it helps a tiny bit but I already want to make a joke or check my phone — could we do that five-things naming and a quick stretch instead?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the tension and shame are still present, but the physical release of the stretch is helping a bit. Sometimes, our bodies can provide clues about what we need. Let's try the five-things naming exercise instead, and see if that helps us shift focus. I'll guide you through it, and this time, when you start to feel the shame or frustration, I want you to pause, and then just label it as "ah, shame" or "frustration" – no judgment, no judgment – just a simple acknowledgment. Ready to try?

Patient: Okay... I guess I'm ready. Five things I can see: a blue mug, my laptop with stickers, the potted fern, a stack of mail, and the window. Ah—shame. Ah—frustration. Saying that out loud makes my chest clamp up and I feel this stupid hot flush like I'm failing all over again. Can we... keep going?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like acknowledging the shame and frustration doesn't quite have the calming effect we were hoping for. Let's try something a bit different. I want you to notice the physical sensations in your body right now, like the heat in your chest, the tightness in your shoulders, and the flush on your skin. Can you simply observe these sensations, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: Okay... I notice the heat in my chest and my shoulders all tight, my breath's shallow and there's this knot in my stomach. As soon as I name it, this stupid shame spikes up and I want to look away or make a joke. I don't know, it's awkward and makes me panic a bit—could we try something more active, like a short walk or another grounding move instead?

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment of self-awareness is triggering the shame again, and it's hard to sustain. Sometimes, getting up and moving can help shift the focus away from the discomfort. I'd like to suggest a simple, gentle action that might help calm the nervous system. Let's take a slow, deep breath together, and then I'll guide you through a gentle, subtle movement with your toes. Can you wiggle your toes, spread them apart and then bring them back together?

Patient: Okay — I tried it. I wiggled my toes, spread them, brought them back together; for a second my feet felt a little looser, like it grounded me a tiny bit. Then that stupid shame spiked up and I felt flushed and clumsy, like even this simple thing proves I mess up. I don't know — maybe a short walk outside would actually help more?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the physical sensation of wiggling your toes provided a brief sense of grounding, but the shame and self-criticism quickly came back. Sometimes, a change of scenery can be helpful. Let's take a short walk outside, even just to the other room, or to a different part of the house. Sometimes, getting out of the same environment can help shift the focus away from internal critics. Can you take a few slow steps towards the door, without thinking too much about what might happen, and just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground?

Patient: I took a few slow steps toward the door — I could feel my feet on the floor and it actually calmed me for a second. Then this stupid shame rushed in, like that old failed thing, and my chest clamped up and I felt clumsy and like I'd just mess this up if I tried to go out. I don't know… I guess I could try to actually go outside, but can we slow down? This is getting kind of close to the stuff I usually avoid and I'm already wanting to check my phone.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment of taking small steps towards the door triggered the shame and self-doubt again. Sometimes, it's helpful to slow down and approach things in tiny, manageable increments. Let's take it even further back. What if we just stand right where we are, and focus on noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor, without thinking about going outside or doing anything else? Can you just be with the feeling of your feet touching the ground, without judgment or distraction?

Patient: I guess I can try — my feet feel kind of solid on the floor, a tiny bit grounding, like a little relief. But as soon as I notice it that stupid shame spikes up and I start thinking I can’t do anything right. Can we slow down? This is getting kind of close and I’m feeling overwhelmed.

It's like the small moment of grounding is getting triggered by the shame again, and it's hard to sustain. Let's take it way back. Let's just sit here, together, in this space, without thinking about going outside or doing anything else. Can you simply focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or think about anything else?

Patient: Okay, I tried to focus on the breath — it's shallow, my chest's tight and my stomach's in a knot, and when I really notice that shame just spikes and I get frustrated and panicky. I guess I don't know how to sit with it without wanting to look away or make a joke. Can we slow down? Maybe something gentler, like a very short walk or just keeping the window open while we talk?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the attempt to focus on the breath is getting triggered by the shame and frustration again. Sometimes, it's helpful to create a sense of safety and comfort in the space we're in. Let's try opening the window instead of taking a walk. Can you gently turn the handle and let in some fresh air, just a little bit, without thinking about what might happen or how you'll react?

Patient: Okay — I cracked the window a little and a cool breeze came in; for a second my shoulders eased and it felt kind of okay. Then that stupid shame rushed back and my chest tightened like before, and I felt hot and clumsy like I’d just mess it up. I don't know, can we keep it open a bit and maybe do something gentle, like name two things I can smell or hear from outside? This is getting kind of close and I want to slow down.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the fresh air and slight sense of relief from opening the window are getting triggered by the shame again. Let's keep the window open a bit and try to focus on the present moment. Can you simply notice two things you can smell from outside, without thinking about the shame or frustration? It might be something as simple as the fresh air itself, or maybe something like the scent of trees or grass. Just notice two things you can smell, and let's stay with that for a moment.

Patient: I guess I can smell damp earth and cut grass, and maybe someone brewing coffee down the street. I don't know — saying that makes that stupid shame flare up and I feel clumsy, like I'm failing at even this. Can we slow down a bit? I'm kind of panicky and want to keep this really gentle.

Can you simply notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without thinking about the smells or the shame? Just pay attention to the feeling of the air touching your skin, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay... I can feel the air on my face — it's cool and my shoulders loosened a tiny bit, my breath feels a little fuller. But as soon as I notice that, that stupid shame spikes and my chest tightens and I want to look away or make a joke. I don't know—can we keep it really slow? Maybe guide me through one more tiny thing so I don't freak out.

I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without looking at them or thinking about your body. Just focus on the feeling of your feet making contact with the floor, and see what happens. Can you simply notice that sensation, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay… my feet feel kind of solid and that's a tiny relief, but as soon as I notice that shame spikes up and my chest clamps and I tense. I don't know, this is getting really close and I'm starting to panic a bit — can we slow down? Maybe something super small and safe, like you naming three things in the room while I just listen, or guiding one very slow counted breath together?
