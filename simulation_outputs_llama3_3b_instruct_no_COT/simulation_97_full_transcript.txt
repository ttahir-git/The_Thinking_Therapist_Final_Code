--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm stuck worrying all the time about how I'll perform when I finally get a job — that fear turns everything into a test and I just freeze, procrastinating on applications and prep. Being unemployed, dealing with PTSD, and the money stress makes even small tasks feel impossible. Honestly, I've tried a lot of stuff and I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to do anything?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty about your job search. Can you tell me more about what would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to experience some of that uncertainty without judgment? What might you notice about your body or mind if you let go of trying to be perfect and just showed up with whatever you are in this moment?

Patient: When I try to sit with the uncertainty, my chest tightens, my stomach knots, my breathing gets shallow, and my head fills with worst‑case scenarios. My instinct is to either over-prepare or avoid everything because feeling that is unbearable and makes me freeze. I've tried breathing and 'being present' before and it didn't help — how is that supposed to help me actually get things done or stop the procrastination?

Therapist Answer:
Those physical sensations can be really intense. It sounds like you're really trying to avoid those feelings, which is actually contributing to more paralysis. What if, instead of trying to calm or escape them, you were to acknowledge them as just physical sensations, without judgment? For example, "Ah, my chest is feeling tight, my stomach is knotting, and my breathing is shallow. That's just my body responding to uncertainty. What's the purpose of trying to change this, versus just noticing it as it is?"

Patient: When I try to notice it, the sensations are still loud and my brain starts yelling worst‑case scenarios — noticing doesn't make the panic any smaller. How is naming my tight chest supposed to get me to actually hit send on an application or stop me from staring at a blank screen? I can try this, but I'm skeptical — show me how that noticing turns into something that actually helps me do the work.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on reducing the panic, what if you were to ask yourself, "What would it take for me to make a small, tiny step towards my job search right now, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable?" Not "How can I reduce the anxiety?" or "How can I calm down?" but "What's one tiny thing I could do, like opening this email or making a phone call, that would move me forward, even if it doesn't feel ideal?"

Patient: Okay—if I had to pick a tiny step right now it'd be opening one job posting and copying the role description into a blank doc, like literally just that. But how is that supposed to help? Every time I've tried micro-steps I end up staring at the blank doc for an hour and then quitting because my brain says I'm going to mess it up. I can try opening it for five minutes now, but I'm warning you, I'm not optimistic.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're waiting for the perfect moment or feeling, which can be hard to come by. What would happen if, instead of trying to control the outcome or make it perfect, you were to simply commit to opening the doc for five minutes, without any expectation of what would happen or how you'd feel? No judgment, no expectation, just showing up with a willingness to start, even if it's just for a tiny bit. Can you give that a try?

Patient: Alright—I'll try opening it for five minutes right now. Full disclosure: my chest will probably tighten, I'll start telling myself I'm going to mess it up, and I'll want to close the doc and avoid it. If I do freeze like that, what exactly should I do in the moment that won't just feel like another pointless exercise?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the urge to freeze or escape, what would happen if you simply acknowledged it and let go of the desire to "fix" or avoid it? You could say to yourself, "I can see that my body is already responding, my mind is already telling me I'm going to mess it up. I can just notice that, without judgment, and let it be." Then, instead of trying to push forward or stop yourself, you could simply... pause. Not to "do something" or achieve a specific outcome, but just to pause. Just be with the fact that you're sitting there, looking at the doc, with your body and mind doing what they're doing. Can you try just pausing for a moment?

Patient: Okay—I’m pausing. My chest is tight, my breath’s shallow, and my hands want to slam the laptop shut. Pausing just makes the panic louder and feels like dragging time out instead of doing anything useful. If I just sit here noticing it, when am I supposed to actually move and type something—how is that supposed to help me get past the freeze?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck in this cycle of trying to manage the anxiety while still wanting to make progress. What if, instead of trying to "move past" the freeze, you were to focus on the physical sensations, especially the feeling of your hands wanting to slam the laptop shut? Can you just notice the sensation of your hands, the weight of them on the keyboard, without judgment? No thought, no trying to control the outcome, just noticing what's happening with your body?

Patient: My hands feel heavy and tense, like my fingers are glued to the edges of the keyboard and there's this urge to yank the laptop closed. Noticing it makes the panic feel louder but also... a little more separate from me, weirdly—like I can watch it instead of being swallowed by it. Fine, I can keep my hands on the keys for a minute, but seriously, how is that supposed to turn into actually typing anything?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's an interesting observation about your hands feeling more separate from your panic. What if, instead of trying to bridge that gap by typing, you were to explore what would happen if your hands were to actually just rest on the keyboard, without any tension or urge to move? No typing, no doing, just the physical presence of your hands on the keys? Can you just be with that, without any expectation or goal?

Patient: Okay — I can rest my hands on the keys. They feel heavy but calmer, like the urge to slam the laptop is a bit quieter and a tiny bit more distant from me. It doesn't make me want to type, though; it just makes the panic feel less like it's swallowing me whole. Fine, I can hold this for a minute, but seriously — how does resting my hands turn into actually writing the application? I've tried grounding before and it just delays the mess—what's the bridge from this to doing the damn work?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still stuck on the bridge between resting your hands and taking action. What if, instead of trying to make a direct connection between resting your hands and typing, you were to focus on what would happen if, with your hands still resting, you were to pick up a pen or a pen and just start doodling on a piece of paper? No particular purpose, no goal, just moving your hand to make a mark. Would that be a tiny step towards making progress, or just a distraction?

Patient: Maybe — I can see how doodling might be less threatening than a blank page and could get my hand moving. But how is making squiggles supposed to turn into coherent sentences or actually hitting send on an application? I've done micro-habits before and they just become another way to avoid the hard part. Fine — I can try doodling for two minutes, but you’ve gotta give me a real next step after that, because I always freeze when the timer runs out.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to build a bridge, but it's feeling fragile. What if, instead of focusing on the end goal of typing out the application, you were to focus on what would happen if, after doodling for two minutes, you were to just... take a deep breath and notice the sensations in your body, and then... simply get up and walk away from the laptop for a bit? No need to type, no need to do anything except get up and move your body. Would that be a more manageable next step, or would it just feel like another escape?

Patient: I can see how a short break might actually help calm the panic enough to come back and try again, but honestly it also smells like an easy out if I don't put rules on it. If I doodle for two minutes, then take a strict five‑minute walk and set a timer to come right back and spend ten focused minutes just copying the role description and writing one sentence, that feels doable — otherwise I know I'll vanish. How are you going to help me stick to that plan instead of letting me bail?

[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going to dictate what you do or set rules for you. Instead, I'll observe that you're looking for a more sustainable approach. What if, after your break, instead of setting a timer or telling yourself what to do next, you simply acknowledge that you've decided to take a more flexible approach, and just show up with an intention to make progress? No specific goal, no pressure, just a willingness to take a few tentative steps towards your job search. Can you try that, without any expectations or external structures?

Patient: Okay... I can try that — just showing up with an intention instead of a strict plan. But it feels vague, like a permission slip to bail, and I'm not convinced it'll stop me from disappearing when it gets hard. How is that actually supposed to keep me accountable instead of me just walking away?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
That's a valid concern. What if, instead of relying on your intention to keep you accountable, you were to ask yourself what would happen if you were to notice when you start to feel like bailing or getting discouraged? What's the physical sensation, the thought, the feeling that's telling you to give up? Can you identify that without judgment, and simply acknowledge it, before it becomes a full-blown "I'm going to walk away"?

Patient: It usually kicks off with this buzzy fog in my head, my chest closing up, my hands twitching toward the laptop lid, and this little voice saying, "Don't even try—you're going to mess it up," and then I just drift away. I can try to label those signs, but naming them so far just starts an argument in my head and doesn't stop me from walking away—how is that supposed to actually break the momentum?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting stuck in an inner dialogue. What if, when you notice that buzzy fog, your chest closing up, your hands twitching, and that critical inner voice, you were to say to yourself, "I see this happening, and it's okay. I've seen this before, and I can ride it out"? Instead of trying to argue with the voice or name the feelings, you're simply acknowledging that this is a familiar pattern, and that you can observe it without judgment. Would that allow you to be more present with the experience, rather than getting caught up in the inner debate?

Patient: I can try saying that to myself, but when I actually do the voice just argues back and my hands already want to slam the laptop. Saying "I can ride it out" feels hollow—like another line I tell myself while I disappear. I don't have the energy for long experiments right now; give me one concrete thing to say or do in that moment that might actually snap me back, not a vague mantra.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the voice is still quite strong. What if, when you notice the inner dialogue and the physical sensations, you were to say to yourself, "I'm going to take a deep breath, and I'm going to say the first word that comes to mind"? No judgment, no editing, just the first word that pops up. Would that be a small, tangible action that might help you get unstuck?

Patient: Okay... first word: "stuck."  

There—what am I supposed to do with that? How's saying "stuck" supposed to snap me out of wanting to slam the laptop shut?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've identified a key sensation. What if, with the word "stuck", you simply acknowledge that sensation, and then pause, and then... take one tiny physical action that's opposite of slamming the laptop shut? For example, you could gently place your fingers on the keyboard, or slowly open your eyes, or tilt your head to the side. Something small, but tangible, that shows you're willing to take a tiny step towards engagement.

Patient: Okay... I’ll gently rest my fingers on the keys now. It actually dulls the urge to slam the lid a bit — the tension's a little less sharp — but I still don't get how that turns into typing. What's the next concrete tiny move that actually gets words on the page?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You're making progress. What if, with your fingers on the keys, you were to start with a simple, slow, and deliberate movement, like tapping one key, just once? Not trying to type anything, just making a small sound, like a gentle "tick". Would that be a tiny, concrete step towards making progress, or is it still too vague?

Patient: Fine—I'll tap one key. It clicked once, felt stupidly small, and it didn't magically make words appear. What's the next tiny move that actually gets letters on the page?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've taken that small step. What if, with the single key tap, you were to look at the blank space that just appeared, and then... type the first letter of the first word on the job posting? Not trying to write a whole sentence, just the first letter. Would that be a tiny, concrete action that might help you get started?

Patient: Alright... I'll do it. 

Done — I typed the first letter: "s". It felt ridiculous and my fingers trembled, but I didn't shut the laptop. My chest's still tight and the brain's already whispering to bail. What's the next concrete move that actually gets a full first sentence, not just another tiny stunt?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've typed the first letter. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome or push through the discomfort, you were to simply type the next letter, the "e" in "done"? Not trying to write a complete sentence, just the next individual letter. Would that be a tiny, incremental step towards making progress?

Patient: Okay... I'll type the "e" — done. It still feels absurd and my chest's tight; how is this supposed to turn into a real sentence or actually hitting send? Give me the next concrete move that actually leads to a sentence, not another stunt.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've typed the "e". What if, instead of trying to type a whole sentence, you were to focus on typing a small, specific word that's already in the job posting, like "security" or "responsibility"? You could type a single word, and then take a deep breath, and then... type the next word. Would that be a tiny step towards making progress?

Patient: Okay... I typed the word "security." It felt hollow — my chest's still tight and I'm running low on energy. What's the next concrete, actionable move that actually gets me to a full sentence or hitting send? I'm not asking for fluff.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've typed the word "security". What if, instead of trying to type a whole sentence, you were to focus on typing a single phrase that's already in the job posting, like "looking for a security guard"? You could type out a specific phrase, and then take a deep breath, and then... click the "apply" button.

Patient: Okay... I can type out that phrase, but actually clicking "apply" feels like jumping off a cliff — I've clicked apply before and nothing changed, so I'm skeptical. My energy's low and I'm kind of spent, so give me one concrete thing to say or do in the moment if my hands freeze after typing the phrase — not a mantra, a single blunt instruction that might actually snap me back. I'll type it now, but be direct: what exactly do I say or do to force myself to hit send?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking part is not generated with this prompt]

Therapist Answer:
You've typed the phrase. What if, when your hands freeze, you simply looked at the screen and said "send"? Just the word "send". No thinking, no planning, no reasoning. Just the physical act of saying the word, and then taking your finger and clicking the "send" button.

Patient: "send."

I said it out loud and my finger just kind of hung over the trackpad — I didn't press. I'm spent and this feels hollow; how is saying the word supposed to actually make me click? Give me one brutal, concrete next move right now — none of the soft stuff — that will force me to press the button.

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
You said the word "send". What if you were to grip your finger on the trackpad, and then... squeeze it.

Patient: Grip my finger? How is squeezing a trackpad supposed to make me actually click — but fine, I'll try it. My hands are shaking and everything feels heavy, so be blunt: tell me to "press and hold the trackpad now until it confirms." If I freeze, I'll say so.

Press and hold the trackpad now until it confirms.

Patient: Okay... I pressed and I'm holding it — it registered. My hands are shaking, my chest's tight, and my brain's already screaming to yank it away. This feels pointless unless you give me one blunt command I can follow in the panic: tell me the exact two‑word instruction I'll do if I freeze, no breathing crap, no metaphors.

Patient: Ugh... I clicked. It registered, but it felt flat — my chest's still tight and nothing really changed. How is that supposed to help me long‑term? Give me one exact, non‑fluffy instruction you'll tell me the next time my hands freeze so I actually follow it, not bail.
