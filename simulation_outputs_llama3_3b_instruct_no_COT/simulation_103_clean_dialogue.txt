Patient: Hi, I'm a nurse and lately I've been getting stuck in cycles of really harsh self-criticism — I obsess over perceived failures and it spirals, especially after mistakes at work. I think a lot of it comes from being raised in a high-achieving family where there's this constant pressure to succeed. I don't know, it's kind of hard to even say all this out loud.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share this with me. It sounds like there's a strong desire to succeed and meet expectations from others, which is really understandable, given your upbringing. Can you imagine what it would be like if you could let go of the need to be perfect and allow yourself to make mistakes without immediately jumping to self-criticism?

Patient: I don't know. I guess part of me can imagine it being a relief — fewer nights replaying stuff, less shame — but it also feels really scary, like if I relax everyone will see I'm not good enough. I worry that letting go would just mean I'm lazy or that my family would be disappointed. It's hard to even picture giving myself permission to mess up.

Therapist: It's like there's a sense of self-worth tied to your ability to meet others' expectations and avoid mistakes. Can you think of a moment when, in the past, you felt like you were able to accept a mistake without immediately criticizing yourself? What was that like, and what happened right after that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess once a few months ago I missed a small detail on a chart and my charge nurse just calmly pointed it out and said it happens, don't beat yourself up. For a little while I actually felt lighter and able to move on, but later that night I kept replaying it and telling myself I'm a fraud. It's hard to hold onto the calmer feeling—I'm not great at talking about this stuff without getting stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to momentarily let go of the criticism, but then the self-criticism kicked in again. That's really common. What if, right now, you were to sit with the feeling of replaying that mistake, without judgment, and simply observe it as a thought, without trying to change it? Would that allow you to create some space for the calmer feeling from earlier to come back in?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try, but sitting with it just makes me tense and my brain immediately starts listing everything I did wrong. Can you give me something really small to do right now to help me actually notice the thought without spiraling?

Therapist: Let's try something simple: take a deep breath in, and when you exhale, bring your attention to your feet on the ground, noticing the sensation of them touching the floor. No thought, no judgment, just the sensation of your feet. Can you do that for me right now, and when the thoughts come up, simply acknowledge them as thoughts, without trying to engage with them?

Patient: Okay, I tried. I took a deep breath and actually noticed my feet — it's weird but I could feel them — then my brain immediately started listing everything I did wrong, and I just kept saying "that's a thought" like you said. I don't know, I guess it helped for maybe thirty seconds but then I got tense again and the replaying started. Can we talk about how to make it stick longer? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's great that you were able to acknowledge the thought as "that's a thought" for a moment. It's normal that the tension and replaying started again, it's a sign that you're getting closer to where you want to be. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you could practice this "acknowledging thoughts" in a more everyday moment, like during a quiet break at work, or while waiting in line? Would that help you build some momentum?

Patient: I guess I could try it in short moments—like waiting for the elevator, standing in line at the cafeteria, or during a quick five-minute break between patients. I don't know, I'm worried I'll forget or just spiral, so can we make a tiny, specific cue or script I can actually use in those moments?

Therapist: Using a specific cue or script can help anchor the behavior. What if, when you catch yourself getting caught up in thoughts, you could say to yourself "just as I'm having this thought, I'll take a deep breath and acknowledge it" - just those four words: "just as I'm having this thought"? It's simple, but might be enough to create a small pause and bring you back to the present moment.

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try saying "just as I'm having this thought," but I'm worried it'll feel silly or I'll blank out when I'm actually stressed at work. Maybe something even shorter—like just "pause" or "breathe"—would be easier to remember and less obvious. I'm feeling kind of nervous just thinking about using it, like I'm already bracing for it not to work.

Therapist: Using a shorter cue can be helpful, especially if you're worried it might feel silly. What if, instead of a verbal cue, you used a physical one, like taking a quick pause to touch your breath, or making a small gesture, like placing one hand on your heart? Sometimes, a physical anchor can be just as effective as a verbal one.

Patient: I don't know. I guess a physical cue could work, but I'm worried it'll look weird at work—putting my hand on my heart feels too obvious. Maybe something super subtle, like pressing my thumb and forefinger together or rubbing the seam of my uniform pocket. Can we pick one and try it now? I'm kind of nervous it'll feel dumb or not help, though.

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to try a physical cue. Let's try pressing your thumb and forefinger together. I'll do it with you right now. As we do it, I'll remind you to notice just that physical sensation, without adding any thoughts or interpretation. Can you do that with me?

Patient: Okay, I did it. I could feel the slight pressure and warmth where my fingers met — it actually grounded me for maybe two breaths, then my chest tightened and my brain started listing everything I did wrong again. I don't know, I guess it helped a little but I'm still tense; can we try it a couple more times with you guiding me? I'm nervous it'll feel dumb or not work, but I'm willing to keep trying.

Therapist: Let's try it again. As we press our fingers together, I want you to focus on the physical sensation, like the warmth and pressure. When your mind starts to wander, just gently acknowledge the thought and bring your attention back to the sensation of your fingers touching. Ready?

Patient: Okay, I pressed my fingers together and felt the pressure and warmth — it calmed me for maybe two breaths, then my chest tightened and the mental list started again. I don't know, I'm kind of embarrassed and worried it'll look silly, but can we do it one more time slowly, maybe with you counting breaths so I don't blank out? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's try it again, slowly, with me counting breaths. Inhale... 1... press your fingers together... exhale... 2... feel the pressure and warmth... inhale... 3... just as you're having this thought... exhale... 4... notice the sensation of your fingers touching... inhale... 5... pause... exhale... 6... just as your mind starts to wander... inhale... 7... bring your attention back to the sensation... exhale... 8...

Patient: I felt a tiny bit calmer for those breaths, but then my chest tightened and the mental list kicked back in. I don't know, I guess I'm just frustrated that it feels so temporary and like I can't trust it to work when I actually need it. Can we talk about concrete ways to make it stick during a busy shift? I'm kind of overwhelmed and not sure where to start.

Therapist: It's normal to feel that way, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. One thing that might help is to break it down into smaller moments, so it doesn't feel like you're trying to change everything at once. What if, instead of trying to change your entire shift, you focused on just one short period, like the first 5 minutes after you start your shift? You could try the physical cue and see how you do, and then gradually build up to longer periods. Would that be a more manageable starting point for you?

Patient: I don't know. I guess the first five minutes could work in theory, but I'm worried I'll blank out when I clock in and just start ruminating. Maybe the last five minutes of my shift would be easier — it feels less pressure — but I'm overwhelmed and not sure how to actually remember to do it without freaking out. Can we figure out a tiny, practical reminder I won't hate using?

Therapist: It can be tough to start with a big goal. Let's think of a super simple reminder that you can use right now, just to get started. What if, when you clock in, you just put a sticky note on your clipboard with the phrase "pause" or "breathe" on it? That way, when you need a reminder, you can glance at it and take a quick pause without feeling embarrassed. Would that be a small enough anchor for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess a sticky note feels like something I'd just ignore or feel dumb about. Maybe something I already do, like touching the seam of my pocket or my badge when I clock in would be less weird; I'm kind of overwhelmed and worried I won't remember.

Therapist: Sometimes, we need to start with what we already do daily, without adding more. Let's go with the badge. What if, when you clock in, you touch your badge on your uniform, and then take a deep breath, before starting your shift? It's something you already do, so it might feel more automatic, and the breath might help you pause before getting into the flow of the day. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is touching my badge supposed to help? I don't know, I guess I can try it, but I'm worried I'll forget or feel stupid doing it when I'm already flustered. I'm kind of overwhelmed thinking about adding another thing to remember; could I maybe set a quiet phone reminder instead, or would that be too... obvious?

Therapist: It can feel like adding another thing to remember. What if, instead of a reminder, we use the phone to remind you to touch your badge and take a deep breath after you've already clocked in? You could set a discreet alarm on your phone, so it only goes off after you've started your shift, and it would be a gentle nudge to pause and breathe. Would that feel more manageable for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how would a phone alarm actually help? I don't know, I guess a silent vibration might be less obvious, but I'm worried I'll just ignore it or it'll go off at a bad time and make me look distracted. Maybe something tied to what I already do, like when I open the first chart or badge touch, would feel less like another thing to mess up. I'm kind of overwhelmed thinking about adding reminders — it all just feels like one more potential failure.

Therapist: It can feel like we're adding more to the list of things to remember. What if, instead of a reminder, we use a small, private gesture to mark the start of your shift? For example, you could use a small dot or a slight shift in your posture when you open the first chart. That way, it's something you already do, and it becomes a private signal to yourself that you're starting your shift. Would that feel more like a subtle cue?

Patient: I don't know. I guess a subtle posture shift might feel less obvious and could work, but I'm kind of drained just thinking about adding something else. Can we just try a single slow breath when I open the chart now? I'm feeling overwhelmed but willing to try.

Therapist: Sometimes, simplicity is the best place to start. Let's just focus on that single slow breath when you open the chart. I'll be here to support you. Take a deep breath in... and out... and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your body relaxing just a little bit.

Patient: I did the slow breath when I pictured opening the chart — it relaxed me for a beat, then the chest tightened and the “you’re a fraud” loop came right back. I don't know, I guess it helps a little but I'm really scared it won't hold up during a busy shift. What do I actually do in the moment when a mistake happens and I start spiraling? I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it.

Therapist: It's like the calmness is fleeting, but it's a start. What if, when the "you're a fraud" loop starts, you could say to yourself, "this thought, again"? Just that simple phrase, to acknowledge it and create a tiny pause. No judgment, no trying to change it, just acknowledging it as a thought. Would that give you a tiny bit of space?

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying "this thought, again" might make a tiny pause, but it feels really awkward and I'm scared I'll just blank and spiral when it actually happens. I'm kind of overwhelmed thinking about it—could we try it right now, like you say it and I practice responding so it feels less weird?

Therapist: Let's try it now, just for a moment. Say "this thought, again" out loud, and I'll respond with "that's right" - no judgment, no trying to change it. Ready? "this thought, again".

Patient: I don't know... I said "this thought, again" out loud and it felt kind of stupid, but it did make a tiny pause. I guess it helped for a second, but then I started listing everything that could go wrong—what do I actually do when it tips from a thought into full-on spiraling?

Therapist: It takes courage to acknowledge that it felt a bit awkward, and it's okay. Now, when you catch yourself spiraling, can you try to acknowledge the thought again, and then simply pause? No trying to change it, no trying to stop it, just pause. The goal is to create a tiny space between you and the thought, not to stop the thought itself. Would you like to practice that pause again?

Patient: I don't know... I guess we can try it again. I'll say "this thought, again" and try to actually pause, but I'm nervous it'll feel stupid and I'll start spiraling. Can you walk me through it slowly and tell me what to do if the list starts up?

Therapist: Let's do it slowly. When you say "this thought, again", take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, pause for a brief moment. Just a pause, not a big one, just a tiny one. As you pause, notice the sensation of your body, where you are, and what you're doing. When the thought starts to come back, notice it as a thought, and then... pause again. Don't try to change it, don't try to stop it, just pause. If you start listing everything that could go wrong, acknowledge the thought, say "this thought, again", and pause again. Let's practice this together, one slow breath at a time. Ready? "this thought, again".

Patient: I don't know... I said "this thought, again" and tried to pause — there was a tiny gap, then my brain just flooded with the "you're a fraud" list and I couldn't get it to stop. I'm not sure I follow how a little pause actually helps when the spiral is that loud; what do I do next in the moment when it tips over? I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it.

Therapist: It's like the pause isn't enough to contain the spiral. Sometimes, that's okay. When the spiral feels like it's going to overwhelm you, I want you to focus on your breath. Take a few deep, slow breaths, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Don't try to stop the thoughts, just focus on the breath. Try to bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of your lungs expanding and contracting. See if that can create a small sense of calm, even if the thoughts are still swirling. Ready? Inhale...

Patient: I tried — I inhaled and felt my chest rise and for a beat it calmed, but then the "you're a fraud" loop got loud again. I don't know what to do when it doesn't stop—do I just keep breathing forever? I'm kind of worn out and scared this won't hold up during a busy shift or at night when I replay things. Can you give me one super specific thing to do or say in the middle of a full-on spiral that I can actually use without panicking?

Therapist: It's okay that the breathing didn't work this time. Sometimes, we need a tiny anchor to grab onto. Here's something simple: when the "you're a fraud" loop gets loud, just say to yourself, "I am here". That's it. Just the words, "I am here". Say them to yourself, even if you feel like you're not. Even if you feel like you're not good enough. Just say "I am here". Can you try that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I said "I am here" out loud and it felt kind of stupid, but it did calm me for like one breath — then the "you're a fraud" loop came back. I guess I'm still not sure what to do when it tips into a full-on spiral; can you give me one really concrete thing I can do in that exact moment? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed just thinking about it.

Therapist: I'm here to support you. When the "you're a fraud" loop starts spiraling out of control, the one thing you can do is look around you. Literally, just look around the room. Notice the objects, the colors, the shapes, the people around you. Just observe what's present, without judgment or trying to change it. Can you try that for me?

Patient: Okay, I tried looking around—there’s a clock, a blue chair, a stain on the counter—and for a breath it grounded me, but then the “fraud” loop came back. I don’t know, I guess it just feels temporary and I’m getting really worn out; what do I actually do when noticing things isn’t enough?

Therapist: It's like noticing things is just a temporary pause. When the "you're a fraud" loop feels like it's going to overwhelm you, the one thing you can do is take a step forward. Just one step. Literally, take one physical step forward, away from the thought. It doesn't have to be a big step, just a small one. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try it. I took a tiny step forward and it helped for like a breath, then my head just kept racing. It felt kind of dumb, and what if I'm at a bedside or stuck at a pump and can't step—what's a smaller thing I can do in those moments? I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it.

Therapist: It's like taking a step feels too much when we're already feeling overwhelmed. Let's try something even smaller. When the "you're a fraud" loop starts spiraling, the one thing you can do is look down. Just look down at your hands, at your feet, at the surface you're sitting or standing on. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I don't know — I looked down at my hands like you said and it did calm me for a breath, then the loop came roaring back. I guess if I can't look down at a bedside maybe I could squeeze my fingers together or press my thumb to my palm — something tiny and private? I'm getting kind of worn out thinking about all these strategies; can you help me pick one simple thing I won't hate doing when I'm already spiraling?
