Patient: I've been talking to friends and family constantly since my kids moved out — mostly to avoid feeling that emptiness rather than actually processing it. It feels like I'm using other people's ears to numb, and it's getting wearing. Honestly, I don't see how talking in here is supposed to help, but I'm willing to try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're acknowledging that this avoidance habit is taking a toll on you. It's almost as if you're using the connection with others to avoid the discomfort of feeling this emptiness. That emptiness might be a sign that you're not as engaged with your life as you were when your kids were living with you.

Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to get out of this process? How are you envisioning talking in here will help you move past this feeling of emptiness?

Patient: Honestly, I don’t know if this will help — talking with friends has mostly felt like quick relief that never changes anything. What I want is to stop leaning on others so much, learn to sit with that emptiness without calling someone, and get a few practical strategies that actually work instead of just numbing. But seriously, how is talking in here supposed to teach me that?

Therapist: It seems like you're looking for a more lasting change, one that goes beyond just finding quick relief. Talking in here might not have a magic answer, but it can help you explore what it's like to be with that emptiness, without the distraction of others.

Imagine if, instead of calling a friend, you sat in silence with that feeling of emptiness. What would it be like? Would you feel more overwhelmed, or would you start to notice some things about it that you hadn't before? Maybe it's not about finding a solution right now, but about getting a sense of what's really going on with that emptiness. Can you try to imagine what that might be like, without the expectation of a quick fix?

Patient: I can try, but honestly—how is imagining supposed to help? If I sat in silence I'd probably get restless and my first instinct would be to reach for the phone. Maybe at first it’d feel hollow and a bit panicky, and then maybe after a while I’d notice small, nagging things I usually cover up — the quiet house, the routines that stopped — but I’ve tried sitting with it before and most times I just end up calling someone anyway.

Therapist: It's like you're wondering how imagining this experience will translate to real life. You're right, it's one thing to sit in silence, and another to do it when you're feeling that emptiness and the urge to call someone is strong.

You're also pointing out that this isn't the first time you've tried sitting with it, and it hasn't worked out well for you. That's a good note to hit here. It suggests that maybe we need to think about this process in a slightly different way. Instead of just imagining it, let's try to understand why it's hard for you to do it. What is it about the feeling of emptiness that makes it so hard to sit with?

Patient: I think it's mostly that emptiness feels like a loss — like my days suddenly don't matter and that scares me, makes me feel useless. It shows up as this physical restlessness and anxiety, and calling someone is an easy safety valve that makes that drop right away. But I've named this stuff before and tried to sit with it — how is digging into reasons any different from just sitting and failing?

Therapist: It sounds like the emptiness is tied up in a sense of loss and feeling useless, which is a really tough place to be. It's not just about the physical restlessness and anxiety, but about the emotional sense of disconnection and powerlessness.

I think you're right that digging into the reasons behind it might not be all that different from just sitting and failing. It's possible that, at the end of the day, you're still going to be dealing with the same feelings, but maybe you'll be able to approach them from a different angle.

Can I ask, what do you think about the idea of "valued actions"? Sometimes, when we're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, it can be hard to think of what we want to do. But what if I told you that we might be able to identify some actions that are really important to you, even if they don't necessarily make the feeling of emptiness go away? Would that be something worth exploring?

Patient: I guess I can see the idea — things like keeping my routines, doing a bit of volunteer tax help, or getting back to the woodworking I used to enjoy — might be "valued actions." But how is picking a few tasks supposed to make the emptiness feel less… empty? I'm open to trying small, practical steps, but I want to know how this actually helps, not just another thing to fail at.

Therapist: It's like you're wondering how these valued actions are supposed to fill the void, or make it feel less empty. You're right to be skeptical - it's not like these actions are going to suddenly make the emptiness disappear.

But here's what I think: these valued actions might not actually make the emptiness feel better, but they might make it feel more manageable. When we're feeling lost or disconnected, it can be hard to think of what to do. But when we have a few small, meaningful tasks to focus on, it can help us get our bearings again.

It's almost like the emptiness is a kind of fog, and these valued actions are like a flashlight. They're not going to clear the fog entirely, but they might help us see a little better, and figure out what's going on. And that's a start, right?

Patient: Okay, I get the flashlight idea — sounds sensible in theory. But how is having a list of valued actions supposed to stop me from picking up the phone when that hollow panic hits? I’ve tried schedules and to‑do lists before; when the urge comes the lists feel meaningless and I just call, so I need something that actually works in the moment, not another plan that looks good on paper.

Therapist: It's like you're wondering how having a list of valued actions is supposed to stop the urge to pick up the phone, or make it feel like you're not already trying. You're right to be skeptical - it's not like these actions are going to magically prevent you from reaching for the phone when you're feeling overwhelmed.

I think you're right to say that schedules and to-do lists might not be enough. They're more like a plan, something you're supposed to follow. But what if I told you that these valued actions are more like a... a way of being? It's not about following a plan, it's about showing up in a way that feels true to who you are.

It's hard to explain, but when you're feeling that hollow panic, it's not just about the phone or the tasks. It's about feeling like you're not enough, like you're losing yourself. And that's where these valued actions come in. They're not just something you do, they're a way of being that feels good, even when it's hard. Does that make any sense?

Patient: I sort of get the difference between being and doing, but I'm skeptical. How is that supposed to help when the hollow panic hits and my hand's already on the phone? I'm getting frustrated — I've tried being present and lists before, so give me something concrete I can actually use in the moment.

Therapist: It's like you're feeling frustrated because you need a concrete solution, something you can use right now. I understand that. It's not about being present or making lists, it's about doing something that helps you move forward.

Can I try something different? Instead of trying to make a list or be present, can we focus on one small thing you can do right now? Just one. Something that doesn't require you to think or plan, just to do. What can you do right now that feels simple, even if it's just taking a deep breath?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try one small thing. I’m going to take a slow, deep breath and do a quick 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (name five things I see, four I can touch, three I hear, two I smell, one I taste). I don’t know how that’s supposed to stop my hand from reaching the phone, but I’ll try it and tell you if it helped at all.

Therapist: That's a great start. I'm glad you're willing to try something concrete. Grounding exercises can be really helpful in the moment, and it's not about stopping your hand from reaching the phone, it's about giving yourself a brief pause and a sense of connection to your body and surroundings.

Take your time, do the exercise slowly and carefully, and see how it feels. I'll be here when you're ready to share how it went.

Patient: Okay, I did the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1. It actually helped a little — my hand paused and the panic dropped a notch, enough that I noticed the hum of the fridge instead of calling. But I'm still skeptical: it feels temporary, like a band‑aid. How is doing that supposed to build into something that stops me reaching for people every time?

Therapist: It's like you're recognizing the temporary relief, but also feeling a bit frustrated that it's not a more lasting solution. That's a good sign, though - it means you're thinking critically about what's working and what's not.

It's also great that you noticed the hum of the fridge, that's a good example of how grounding can help you tune back into your surroundings and distract you from the panic. As for building it into something more lasting, it's not about replacing one quick fix with another, it's about building a foundation of self-awareness and self-regulation.

Think of it like this: if you're trying to learn to ride a bike, you don't start by just sitting on the bike and hoping it magically works. You start by getting comfortable with the feel of the bike, then you try balancing, then you start pedaling. It's a process of building skills and confidence.

Similarly, grounding is a skill that can be developed over time with practice. It's not a quick fix, but it can be a powerful tool to help you manage your anxiety and reach for more meaningful connections with others. Would you be willing to try a few more grounding exercises in the next few days, to see if we can build on this small success?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try a few more grounding exercises, maybe twice a day and anytime I feel the urge to call. I’m not expecting miracles though; if I still end up grabbing the phone, we’ll need a different plan — what would that look like, practically? And how will we tell if this is actually making a dent or just another temporary fix?

Therapist: Practicality and realism are great qualities to have. Let's break it down: if you're finding that the grounding exercises are still helping you manage your anxiety and reducing the urge to call, but you're not seeing a complete elimination of the urge, that's okay. It's a sign that we're on the right track.

As for a different plan, if you're finding that the grounding exercises are not enough, we can explore other strategies. One option could be to identify specific situations or triggers that make you want to call, and then work on developing alternative coping mechanisms for those situations. For example, if you find that you always reach for the phone when you're feeling anxious or bored, we could work on identifying other activities that bring you comfort and satisfaction.

Another option could be to explore cognitive restructuring, which is a process of identifying and challenging negative thought patterns. This can help you build more resilience and develop more adaptive coping strategies.

To tell if the grounding exercises are making a dent, we can track your progress over time. Let's start by keeping a journal or log of when you feel the urge to call, and how you're managing it. We can also explore other ways to measure your progress, such as tracking your anxiety levels or observing changes in your behavior.

In terms of practicality, I'd like to propose the following:

1. We'll start by setting aside a few minutes each day to practice grounding exercises. We can do this twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
2. We'll identify specific situations or triggers that make you want to call, and work on developing alternative coping mechanisms for those situations.
3. We'll track your progress over time, using a journal or log to record your experiences and feelings.
4. We'll explore other strategies and techniques as needed, such as cognitive restructuring or identifying specific coping mechanisms.

How does that sound? Is there anything specific you'd like to add or change?

Patient: Okay, I can try that plan, but I need it to be realistic — just thinking about a journal makes that old shame flare up, like I'm signing up for another thing I'll half‑do and feel useless about. How exactly will we measure progress so it doesn't just become another box to fail at — frequency of calls, minutes on the phone, self‑rated urge from 1–10? And if I do reach for the phone, what's the concrete, in‑the‑moment alternative you want me to use besides grounding — put the phone in another room, send a quick text instead, do a 5‑minute task? Also, if I miss the twice‑daily practice, what then — do we change the plan or hold to it?

Therapist: I understand your concerns and the shame associated with keeping a journal. Let's take a different approach. Instead of a traditional journal, we can use a simple log or a notes app on your phone. We can just keep a quick record of when you feel the urge to call and how you're managing it. This way, you can write as little or as much as you feel comfortable with, and we can focus on the big picture rather than the details.

As for measuring progress, we can use a combination of frequency of calls, minutes on the phone, and self-rated urge from 1-10. We can also add some qualitative feedback, like how you're feeling, what you're doing, and any insights you have about your behavior. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your progress.

If you do reach for the phone, we can work on an immediate alternative together. Instead of putting the phone in another room or sending a quick text, let's start with something small and achievable. For example, we can try a 5-minute task, like taking a few deep breaths, stretching, or doing a quick exercise. This can help you pause and reassess your urge to call. If you need more time, we can work on a longer-term alternative, like taking a short walk or doing some light stretching.

As for missing the twice-daily practice, we can't change the plan overnight. However, if you miss a day or two, we can reassess and adjust the plan as needed. We can talk about what's working and what's not, and make adjustments to help you get back on track. The goal is to find a sustainable and realistic plan that works for you, not to create more stress or anxiety.

How does that sound? Is there anything specific you'd like to add or change?

Patient: Okay — I can try the notes app idea; as a numbers person it actually appeals to me, but I need this to be simple or that old shame flares up and I convince myself I’ll fail again. If we’re measuring, do this: log only when the urge is a 4 or higher — note the date, number of calls that day, minutes on the phone, and the urge 1–10. Keep entries to one line so it doesn’t feel like a journal.

For in‑the‑moment alternatives: I’ll put the phone in another room on silent for 10 minutes and do a grounding exercise or a five‑minute task (stretch, walk around the block, or some quick woodworking). If I still end up calling, I’ll note it in the log so we have data, not excuses. If I miss the twice‑daily practice, let’s drop to once a day for a week and reassess — no drama, just adjust.

But be straight with me: how is the “phone in another room for 10 minutes” actually supposed to break the compulsion when my hand’s already on it? That part of me is impatient and sure this won’t work, and I can feel that shame bubbling up already. What do we do when the 10 minutes are up and the urge’s still there?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try this approach. I understand your concerns, and I want to address them directly.

Regarding the log, I agree that keeping it simple is crucial. We'll log only when the urge is a 4 or higher, and we'll keep the entries concise to one line. This way, you'll feel less overwhelmed and more focused on the data.

Now, let's talk about the in-the-moment alternatives. I understand your concern about putting the phone in another room for 10 minutes. It's not about creating a magic solution that suddenly breaks the compulsion. Instead, it's about creating a small window of time that allows you to pause, reassess, and potentially change your behavior.

When you put the phone in another room for 10 minutes, it's not about preventing the urge entirely; it's about buying yourself time to think, feel, and react. It's a small detour that gives you a chance to shift your focus, take a few deep breaths, or engage in a grounding exercise.

When the 10 minutes are up, and the urge is still there, we can try another alternative. For example, we can try a different grounding exercise, a quick task, or even a short walk. The goal is to keep the momentum going, even if it's just for a little while.

As for the shame, I want to remind you that this is a process, and it's okay to feel that way. We're not trying to create a "perfect" solution; we're trying to find something that works for you. If the shame is overwhelming, we can take a step back and reassess the plan.

Let's try to focus on the positives: you're willing to try this approach, and you're willing to take small steps towards change. That's a great starting point. How do you feel about moving forward with the plan, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way?

Patient: I feel nervous and a bit jumpy — my chest tightened reading the plan and that old shame flared up again, so forgive me if I seem scattered. I'm willing to try the log and the 10‑minute phone barrier, but honestly — how is the “phone in another room for 10 minutes” supposed to help if the urge's still high? If after 10 minutes the urge is still a 6–7, give me one concrete next step I can actually do in the moment (not “think about values”), and tell me a realistic short‑term target we can aim for in two weeks so this doesn't just become another list I fail at.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try the plan, and I'm here to help you through this process. I completely understand your nervousness and jitters - it's normal to feel that way when trying something new.

Regarding the phone barrier, I want to clarify that it's not about completely eliminating the urge, but about creating a small window of time to pause and reassess. Even if the urge is still high after 10 minutes, the goal is to create a brief moment of hesitation, which can help you make a different choice.

If after 10 minutes the urge is still a 6-7, I'd recommend a concrete next step you can do in the moment: take a few deep breaths, and then do a small, physical action that helps you pause. For example, you could:

* Take 3-4 slow, deliberate steps away from the phone.
* Do 5-10 quick shoulder rolls to release tension.
* Take a sip of water to slow down and focus.

This small action can help you create a brief moment of distance between you and the phone, allowing you to reassess and potentially make a different choice.

As for the short-term target, let's aim to reduce the number of calls or minutes on the phone by 50% over the next two weeks. This is a realistic goal that can help you build momentum and confidence. We can track your progress together and make adjustments as needed.

Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes. We're not trying to create a "perfect" solution; we're trying to find something that works for you. If you need to take a break or adjust the plan, we can do that too.

How do you feel about trying the 10-minute phone barrier and taking a few deep breaths when you're feeling the urge? And what do you think about our short-term target of reducing calls or minutes on the phone by 50% over the next two weeks?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 10‑minute phone barrier and the small in‑the‑moment stuff (3–4 steps away, sip of water, shoulder rolls), but I’m nervous — my chest’s tight and that old shame’s already whispering I’ll half‑do it. How is locking the phone away actually supposed to stop the compulsion? Still, I’ll try it if we make the measurement concrete: log only urges ≥4 with date, number of calls, minutes, and urge rating — one line each time.

If after the 10 minutes the urge’s still a 6–7, give me one clear action: lock the phone away for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes of woodworking or go for a 15‑minute walk — no talking, just do it. And if I slip, call it data, not failure, and let’s do a weekly check to adjust — can we agree to that? Also… I’m jumpy right now, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling anxious and nervous, and that's completely understandable. It's natural to have doubts and concerns, especially when trying something new.

Let's take a step back and break it down. The 10-minute phone barrier isn't about magically stopping the compulsion, but about creating a brief moment of hesitation. When you put the phone away, you're not trying to avoid the urge, you're trying to give yourself time to think, feel, and react. It's a small detour that can help you make a different choice.

Now, let's talk about the concrete measurement. I agree that we should log only urges ≥4 with date, number of calls, minutes, and urge rating. We'll write one line each time, and that's it.

If after 10 minutes the urge is still a 6-7, I want you to take a clear action. Here it is: lock the phone away for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes of woodworking or go for a 15-minute walk. No talking, just do it. We'll call this "data" instead of "failure," and we'll do a weekly check to adjust the plan as needed.

As for slowing down, I'm here to help you. Let's take a deep breath together and go at a pace that feels comfortable for you. We'll break it down into smaller steps, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way.

Can you take another deep breath with me, and let's try to feel more grounded? What do you think about starting with that first log entry?

Patient: Okay — I took a breath, but my chest’s still tight and that old shame is whispering I’ll half‑do this. I’ll start the one‑line log today and try the 10‑minute barrier, but clarify for me: log only when the urge is ≥4, and “calls” means any phone voice call (not texts or video), minutes are total for the day, right? Also — when exactly do you want the weekly check‑in (same day/time each week?), and how is collecting this data actually supposed to help me stop reaching for people in the moment? I’m nervous but willing to try if this isn’t just another list to fail at.

Therapist: I can see that you're still feeling a bit anxious, and that's okay. Let's address your concerns one by one.

Regarding the log, you're absolutely right. We'll only log when the urge is ≥4, and "calls" means any phone voice call, not texts or video. We'll also track the total minutes spent on phone calls for the day.

As for the weekly check-in, let's aim to do it every Wednesday at 3 pm. We can schedule it as a regular call, and you can share your progress, any insights you have, and any challenges you're facing. This will help us adjust the plan as needed and provide support when you need it.

Now, let's talk about how collecting this data will help you stop reaching for people in the moment. By tracking your urges and the number of calls you make, we can start to identify patterns and trends. We can see if certain times of the day or situations trigger your urge to call, and we can work on developing strategies to manage those triggers.

The log will also help us to see if the 10-minute barrier is working for you. If you're finding it difficult to stick to it, or if you're feeling like you're not making progress, we can adjust the plan to make it more effective.

Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes. We're not trying to create a "perfect" solution; we're trying to find something that works for you. By working together, I'm confident that we can develop a plan that will help you manage your urges and reduce your reliance on people in the moment.

Can you take another deep breath with me, and let's try to focus on the positive aspects of this process? What do you think about starting the log today, and trying the 10-minute barrier for the first time?

Patient: Okay — I breathed. I’ll start the one‑line log today and try the 10‑minute barrier, but I’m feeling jumpy and that old shame is already nagging at me, so I need you to be realistic about setbacks. Wed at 3 pm could work for the weekly check‑in, but can we keep it flexible if I’m having a rough week? If after 10 minutes the urge’s still a 6–7, I’ll lock the phone for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes of woodworking or a 15‑minute walk — which would you have me pick as the primary backup, or should I decide in the moment?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit anxious and jumpy, and that's okay. It's normal to feel that way when trying something new, especially when you're worried about setbacks.

Let's talk about the weekly check-in. I completely understand that Wed at 3 pm might not work for you every week. If you're having a rough week, it's perfectly fine to adjust the schedule or take a break. We can use a flexible schedule to accommodate your needs, like having a backup plan for the week, or even just a general check-in to see how you're doing.

Regarding the 10-minute barrier, I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. If you're feeling like the urge is still a 6-7 after 10 minutes, you can definitely lock the phone for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes of woodworking or a 15-minute walk. I wouldn't have you pick just one backup option, as it's a personal choice. Take a moment to think about what you're comfortable with, and then make a decision in the moment.

Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes. We're not trying to create a "perfect" solution; we're trying to find something that works for you. By being realistic about setbacks, we can work together to develop a plan that's flexible and adaptable to your needs.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on lately, and how you're feeling about this process? Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things and give you a fresh perspective.

Patient: I’m feeling really jumpy and my chest’s tight right now — that old shame’s already whispering I’ll screw this up, so excuse me if I’m scattered. Lately I’ve been calling a couple times most afternoons — yesterday it was probably two calls totalling about 40 minutes — and the grounding helped a little but the urge’s still on autopilot. I get the idea of logging and the 10‑minute barrier, but how is that data actually supposed to help me in the moment when my hand’s already reaching for the phone? Can we slow down, make the steps smaller, and agree the weekly check‑in stays flexible and nonjudgmental so this doesn’t just become another thing I fail at?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and anxious right now, and that's completely understandable. It's normal to feel like you're already behind or that you're going to mess up when you're feeling this way.

First of all, let me just acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to be willing to try something like this, especially when you're feeling as anxious and uncertain as you are right now. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that I'm not trying to judge you or make you feel worse. My goal is to help you find ways to manage your urges and make positive changes in your life.

Regarding the data, I understand that it might not be directly helpful in the moment when you're feeling the urge to call. However, having a record of your calls can help us identify patterns and trends over time. For example, we might see that you tend to make calls during certain times of the day or in response to certain triggers. This information can be really helpful in developing strategies to manage your urges and make positive changes in your life.

Let's break things down into smaller, more manageable steps. For now, let's just focus on getting through the day without making any calls. We can work on developing a plan to manage your urges and make positive changes in your life over time.

As for the weekly check-in, I completely agree that it should stay flexible and nonjudgmental. Our goal is to support you and help you make positive changes, not to add more stress or pressure to your life.

Can you take a deep breath with me and try to focus on the present moment for just a minute? I want you to know that you're not alone, and that I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: I tried the breath with you, but my chest's still tight and that old shame's whispering I'm already going to mess this up, so forgive me if I'm scattered. I appreciate you saying it's nonjudgmental — that matters — but give me one clear, in‑the‑moment action if the breathing and 10‑minute barrier don't drop the urge (like exactly: lock the phone for 30 minutes and head to the workshop for 15, no exceptions?). And please: keep the weekly check‑ins flexible — if Wednesday at 3 feels impossible one week, we reschedule without judgement.

Therapist: I can see that the anxiety is still there, and it's affecting your ability to focus. I'm not going to push you to try anything that feels overwhelming or unmanageable right now.

Instead, I want to offer you a specific, in-the-moment action that you can try if you're feeling the urge to call. It's not about locking the phone away for 30 minutes or going to the workshop right now, but it's about taking a small step that can help you pause and reassess.

Try this: Take your phone and put it in a designated spot, like a hook or a tray, where it's out of reach. This can help you break the habit of immediately picking up the phone when you feel the urge to call. You can still take a few deep breaths and check in with yourself, but the phone will be temporarily out of the way.

As for the weekly check-ins, I completely agree that they should be flexible and nonjudgmental. If Wednesday at 3 feels impossible one week, we can reschedule without any pressure or expectation. Our goal is to support you and help you make positive changes, not to add more stress or pressure to your life.

Take another deep breath with me, and let's focus on the present moment. What do you think about trying that small action with your phone, just for a minute or two?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try putting the phone in a tray out of reach for a minute or two, but my chest’s tight and I’m nervous it’ll just make me obsess. If the urge’s still high after 10 minutes, I want the clear rule we agreed on: lock it away for 30 minutes and head to the workshop for 15, no exceptions. And please — keep the weekly check‑ins flexible and nonjudgmental; I’m jumpy right now, so can we slow the pace a bit?

Therapist: I can see that you're still feeling a bit anxious and nervous about trying to manage your urge to call. I'm not going to push you to try anything that feels overwhelming or unmanageable right now.

Let's take a step back and focus on the small action you agreed to try. Putting the phone in a tray out of reach for a minute or two is a small, low-risk experiment. If you're feeling the urge to call, it's okay if it doesn't drop immediately. We can try to wait it out for a bit longer, and if the urge is still high after 10 minutes, we can reassess and move on to the next step.

As for the clear rule, I agree that it's essential to have a plan in place. If the urge is still high after 10 minutes, we will lock the phone away for 30 minutes and head to the workshop for 15 minutes. No exceptions.

Regarding the weekly check-ins, I completely agree that they should be flexible and nonjudgmental. If you're feeling jumpy or overwhelmed, it's okay to slow down the pace. We can take a break and come back to it when you're feeling more grounded.

Take another deep breath with me, and let's focus on the present moment. How do you feel about trying to put the phone in the tray for a minute or two? Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can try it now. I’ll put the phone in the tray out of reach for two minutes, though my chest’s tight and that old shame is already whispering I’ll half‑do it. I don’t really see how this stops the compulsion long‑term, but I’ll follow the 10‑minute/30‑minute backup rule if the urge stays high — and can we pause right after so I can tell you how it felt?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit anxious about putting the phone in the tray, and that's okay. It's a small step, but it can help you break the habit of immediately reaching for the phone.

Go ahead and put the phone in the tray for two minutes. I'll wait here with you.

( Wait for 2 minutes )

How did that feel? Did you notice anything different?

Patient: It helped a little — my hand actually stopped and the panic dropped a notch (maybe an 8 to a 6), and I noticed small stuff like the hum of the fridge and light on the table. But I felt anxious and on edge the whole time, with that old shame whispering I’ll half‑do this and it won’t matter, so I’m frustrated. I don’t feel convinced this will work long‑term — can we try the 10‑minute barrier now and slow the pace a bit before we move on?

Therapist: It's good that you're feeling a bit more grounded after putting the phone in the tray, even if it was just for a short time. The fact that you noticed small things around you, like the hum of the fridge, suggests that you were able to break out of your automatic reach for the phone.

However, I can see that you're still feeling anxious and on edge, and that's understandable. It's natural to feel frustrated when you're not seeing the progress you want, especially when it comes to something as important as managing your urge to call.

Let's try the 10-minute barrier now, but let's slow the pace a bit. Instead of locking the phone away for 30 minutes, let's try locking it away for 5 minutes, and then see how you feel. We can reassess after 10 minutes and decide what to do next.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way, and it's not a sign of failure. It's a sign that you're trying something new, and that's a brave thing to do. Let's take it one step at a time, and see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 5‑minute start, though honestly how is that supposed to help when my hand’s already on the phone? My chest’s tight and that old shame’s nagging, so if after 10 minutes the urge’s still a 6–7 we go to the 30‑minute lock and 15‑minute woodworking — no exceptions. And please, keep the weekly check‑ins flexible and nonjudgmental; I need that.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit skeptical about the 5-minute start, and that's okay. It's a small step, but it can help you break the habit of immediately reaching for the phone.

Let's focus on the present moment. You're feeling anxious and on edge, and that's understandable. It's natural to feel frustrated when you're not seeing the progress you want, especially when it comes to something as important as managing your urge to call.

I want to reassure you that we're not trying to force anything. We're just taking small steps to try and break the habit. The 5-minute start is just a tiny experiment. If you're feeling the urge to call, it's okay if it doesn't drop immediately. We can reassess after 10 minutes and decide what to do next.

Remember, the goal is not to stop the urge entirely, but to make it less frequent and less intense. We're not trying to change who you are or make you feel a certain way. We're just trying to find a way to manage the urge in a way that feels sustainable and realistic for you.

So, let's take it one step at a time. You're willing to try the 5-minute start, and that's great. I'm here to support you, and I want to make sure we're taking a step that feels right for you. How do you feel about that 5-minute start, and do you have any questions about it?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 5‑minute start, but my chest’s tight and I’m pretty jittery, so don’t expect sunshine. How is the 5 minutes actually supposed to help when my hand’s already on the phone — if it’s still high after 5, do we go straight to the 30‑minute lock + 15‑minute woodworking/walk, or wait until 10? Also confirm the log rules one more time (only urges ≥4, date, number of voice calls that day, total minutes, and the urge rating) and let’s lock the two‑week target at 50% reduction in calls/minutes — with the promise that weekly check‑ins stay flexible and nonjudgmental, okay? I’m nervous and already hearing that shame voice, so be straight with me.

Patient: That last message looked garbled — I couldn’t follow it, and that made me more jumpy. My chest’s tight and that old shame’s already whispering I’ll mess this up, so be blunt and slow for me: say the plan clearly one more time (log rules, what to do at 5/10 minutes, the 30‑minute lock + 15‑minute woodworking/walk backup), and confirm the weekly check‑ins stay flexible and nonjudgmental. Also be honest — why do you think this specific sequence will work when other things haven’t? I’m willing to try, but I need clarity and you to promise no blame if I slip.

Patient: That last message was garbled and I couldn’t follow it — it made me jumpier and my chest tightened. Be blunt and slow for me: restate the plan clearly so I can actually hold it.

Here’s what I need you to confirm, exactly as one‑line items so there’s no ambiguity:
- Log rule: only log urges ≥4. One line per entry: date — number of voice calls that day — total minutes on calls that day — urge rating (1–10).
- In‑the‑moment sequence when the phone’s in my hand/urge ≥4: (a) put phone in tray/out of reach for 2 minutes; (b) if urge persists, put phone in another room/out of reach for 5 minutes; (c) after 5 minutes reassess — if urge is still ≥6 at 10 minutes total, lock phone away for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes of woodworking or a 15‑minute walk (your choice in the moment). No talking during the 30‑minute backup. If I slip, treat it as data, not failure.
- Two‑week target: 50% reduction in calls/minutes.
- Weekly check‑ins: flexible day/time, nonjudgmental, resumable without blame if I’m having a rough week.

Also be straight with me: why do you think this exact sequence will work when lists and plans haven’t before? I’m willing to try, but I need you to promise there’ll be no blame if I slip, and to slow down and repeat things plainly if I get jumpy.

Patient: I still can’t follow that last message — it made me jumpier and my chest tightened. Say the plan plainly, one‑line items so there’s no ambiguity, and answer my one question at the end.

- Log rule: only log urges ≥4. One line per entry: date — number of voice calls that day — total minutes on calls that day — urge rating (1–10).  
- In‑the‑moment sequence (urge ≥4 / phone in my hand): (a) put phone in tray/out of reach for 2 minutes; (b) if urge persists, move phone to another room/out of reach for 5 minutes; (c) after 10 minutes total, if urge ≥6, lock phone away for 30 minutes and do 15 minutes woodworking OR a 15‑minute walk (my choice). No talking during the 30‑minute backup. If I slip, treat it as data, not failure.  
- Two‑week target: 50% reduction in calls/minutes.  
- Weekly check‑ins: flexible day/time, nonjudgmental, resumable without blame if I’m having a rough week.

Now be blunt: why do you think this exact sequence will work when lists and plans haven’t before? How is locking the phone away for 30 minutes supposed to stop the compulsion when my hand’s already on it? And promise: no blame if I slip, and slow down and repeat plainly if I get jumpy. I’m anxious and ashamed already, so be straight.
