Patient: I've been stuck worrying nonstop about how I'll perform when I finally get a job — it makes me procrastinate on applications and projects until it's almost too late. I'm unemployed, dealing with PTSD and constant financial stress, and even small tasks feel paralyzing. Honestly, I've done therapy before and I'm skeptical — how is talking about this supposed to help when I just end up avoiding everything?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to share this with me, especially considering your past experiences with therapy. Can you help me understand what's holding you back from feeling like your current therapy is "working"? Is it the feeling that you're just talking about the same things over and over, or that it's not translating to any real change in how you're experiencing your life right now? What is it about the anxiety around performing well that feels so overwhelming?

Patient: I guess a big part of it is that therapy so far just feels like naming the problem without changing it — I can explain why I avoid stuff but I still don't do it. The anxiety about performing is brutal because if I mess up, I lose the few chances I have and it just proves I'm a failure, so my head shuts down. I've tried to-do lists, scheduling, even some CBT exercises, and they don't stick — so how is talking about my feelings supposed to actually get me to apply or show up? I need something practical that helps me get past the freeze, not just more insight.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the pace of change, and you're wondering if talking about your feelings is just a way of acknowledging the problem without actually making it go away. You're looking for something more tangible, something that will help you break through the freeze and get moving.

Can you tell me more about what happens when your head shuts down? What does that feel like, and is there a particular moment when you realize you're not going to be able to do what you set out to do? Maybe we can explore ways to find a way in, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.

Patient: When my head shuts down it feels physical — chest tight, heart racing, my thoughts just spin into worst-case scenarios and I can’t focus on a single step. Usually it hits when I open an application or try to start a task: I stare at the screen, overthink every word until I close the tab and do something small and distracting instead. Sometimes with the PTSD it goes further into dissociation or a flashback and I just… check out. I get that tiny steps are supposed to help, but in the moment they feel impossible — so how is that supposed to actually get me moving?

Therapist: It sounds like the shutdown is a very physical and overwhelming experience, and it's not just about your head thinking worst-case scenarios, but also about feeling disconnected from your body. It's like your whole system just freezes.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you check out or dissociate? Is it like you're watching yourself from outside your body, or is it more like you're not even there at all? And when you're in that state, do you notice any sensations, like a feeling of numbness or detachment?

Also, I want to try something a little different here. Can you try to bring that physical feeling of shutdown into the room with us, just for a moment? Don't try to change it or do anything about it, just notice it. What does it feel like in your body?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. It feels like everything gets muffled, like I'm behind glass — my chest clamps tight, breathing gets shallow, my hands go tingly and numb, and my thoughts just spin in the worst-case loop until I can't pick one thing to do. Time stretches out and I sort of watch myself not do anything, like I'm both here and not; it's awful and panic-y and then exhaustion kicks in. I'm doing this, but honestly — how is just noticing that supposed to get me to actually open another tab or hit submit?

Therapist: It sounds like that's a really hard state to be in, and it's not like you're just being passive, you're actually being actively prevented from doing anything. It's like your whole body is working against you, trying to keep you from making any moves.

I want to try something that might seem a little weird, but bear with me. Can you try to bring that feeling of being muffled, like you're behind glass, into the present moment? Right now, where you're sitting with me, can you try to notice that sensation in your body? Noticing it doesn't mean changing it, it just means paying attention to it.

Also, I want to ask you something. What is the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your mind? What is it that you're afraid of happening if you do try to apply or take that step? Is there something specific that's making you feel like this is going to end in disaster?

Patient: Okay — I can feel it right now: that behind-glass muffled thing, chest tight, breathing shallow, hands tingly, head racing but nothing lands. The worst-case I keep replaying is me totally bombing it — stumbling in an interview or sending a crap application, getting rejected or laughed at, losing the one shot I had, not being able to pay rent, and it proving I'm just a failure. It feels huge and final, like one slip ruins everything, and that thought just freezes me. But seriously — how is just noticing this supposed to get me to actually open another tab or hit submit? I've tried that and it doesn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of that worst-case scenario, and it's making it hard for you to take any action at all. It's like your whole mind is focused on that one catastrophic outcome, and it's preventing you from even considering taking a step forward.

I want to try to help you shift your focus a bit. Can you tell me what would happen if, just for a moment, you were able to let go of that worst-case scenario? If you could just take a tiny little step away from it, even if it was just for a second? What would you be able to do or think about in that moment?

Also, I want to introduce a little concept. It's called "defusion". It's a way of looking at your thoughts, like the worst-case scenario you're replaying. Instead of trying to change the thought or make it go away, you try to notice it as just a thought. Like, "Ah, I'm having the thought that I'll totally bomb it." It's not trying to convince yourself of anything, just observing it.

Let's try that for a moment. Can you try to notice that worst-case scenario as just a thought, without trying to change it or make it go away? Just observe it, and see if you can take a tiny little step back from it.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying it: "I'm having the thought that I'll totally bomb it." Saying it makes it sound like a thing I'm noticing, not me. It kind of takes the edge off for a second, but my chest is still tight and I still can't make my fingers move to click submit — how does that get me to actually do the thing, not just name it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're making a great start with defusion, and it's helping to take the edge off a bit. But you're right, it's not just about naming the thought - it's about taking action despite it.

Can you think of what would happen if you were able to take that first action, even if it was just a tiny step? What would it feel like? Would it be a relief to have made a move, even if it was small? Would it give you the confidence to take another step?

Also, I want to introduce another concept. It's called "experimental acceptance". It's about accepting a difficult or uncomfortable situation, not as a fixed reality, but as a temporary and experimental state. You're not trying to make it go away, you're just trying to take a tiny little step forward, even if it's scary or hard.

Let's try an experiment. Can you make a tiny little commitment to take one small action, just for a moment? Not a big commitment, just a small one. Like, "I will click submit for just 5 seconds." What would it feel like to take that action, even if it's just for a tiny little moment?

Patient: Okay, fine — I'll try it. My chest's tight and my hands are already tingly, but I'll hover and click submit for five seconds and keep it pressed or held down. But honestly, if this just ends with me closing the tab again, how is that supposed to actually build anything—what's the next step after the five seconds?

Therapist: It's a small step, and it's not a magic bullet. But it's a start. And it's not about trying to click submit forever, it's about taking that tiny little action and seeing what happens.

When you click submit, you'll have a few options. You can close the tab, you can keep the tab open and see what happens, or you can try to do something else. But even just keeping the tab open for a moment is a step forward.

And who knows, maybe after you click submit, you'll feel a sense of relief or accomplishment that will give you the confidence to do something else. Maybe you'll feel a sense of curiosity about what happens next, and you'll want to keep exploring.

It's not about building a tower, it's about building a step. One small step. And sometimes, that's all it takes to get started.

Let's try something. Can you think of what would happen if you didn't close the tab? If you just kept it open and saw what happened? What might you learn or discover?

Patient: I guess if I didn't close the tab I might notice that nothing catastrophic happens in those few minutes — maybe the panic eases a bit or I manage to type one sentence. But honestly, I can already hear myself staring and then shutting it again, so how is leaving it open actually going to change that? If you want me to try, I could promise to keep it open for five minutes and force myself to type just one line, but I'm skeptical it'll stick.

Therapist: It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to do something dramatic to make a change, but sometimes the smallest, most mundane actions can be the most effective.

I love your suggestion to try keeping the tab open for five minutes and typing just one line. That's a tiny, almost absurd goal, but it might just be enough to help you build momentum.

And you're right, it's hard to predict how we'll behave in the moment. We might surprise ourselves and find that we can do something more than we thought. Or, we might still get caught up in the same old patterns.

But here's the thing: it's not about whether we succeed or not. It's about the process of trying, not just the outcome. By committing to try this tiny experiment, you're already taking a step forward, even if it feels like a tiny step in the right direction.

So, I want to make a deal with you. Let's try this tiny experiment, and we'll do it with a specific goal in mind: to keep the tab open for just five minutes, and type just one line. No promises, no expectations. Just a tiny, tentative step forward. Can you agree to do that?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it. I'll keep the tab open for five minutes and type one line. But I'm skeptical it'll stick; if I bail after two minutes, what do we do next? And honestly, how is this small test supposed to actually help with the rent pressure and the physical freeze from the PTSD?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try this tiny experiment.

First, let's talk about what happens if you bail after two minutes. Well, that's okay. It's not a failure. It's just a natural part of the process. We can try to adjust the goal or the time frame as needed. Maybe we can try it for 5 minutes, and if you get stuck, we can take a break and come back to it later. Or, we can try to set a smaller goal, like 2 minutes, and see if that's more manageable.

Now, about the connection to your rent pressure and PTSD. It's true that this tiny experiment might not seem directly related to those issues, but here's the thing: our bodies and brains are incredibly complex, and there are often subtle connections between seemingly unrelated things.

By taking this tiny step, you're not just trying to make a small change to your behavior; you're also testing the boundaries of your physical and emotional response. You're seeing how your body reacts to the uncertainty of the situation, and that can be incredibly revealing.

It's also worth noting that this tiny experiment might not be about solving the underlying problems right away. It's about building momentum, creating a sense of small wins, and gradually increasing your confidence. Sometimes, it's not about the end goal; it's about the process of getting there.

So, let's focus on the process, and we'll take it one step at a time. Are you ready to get started?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to do the five minutes and type one line. I’m skeptical it’ll stick, though, so if my chest clamps or I start to dissociate I’ll need something concrete from you in the moment — like a quick grounding prompt or a pairing exercise to get my hands moving; how is that actually supposed to help me finish the task? And if I bail after two minutes, don’t just tell me it’s fine — what do we do next so I don’t just spiral into feeling worse?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try this tiny experiment.

First, let's talk about what happens if you need some concrete help in the moment. I'm glad you're thinking ahead to that. If you start to feel your chest clamping or dissociate, I'd like to offer a few grounding prompts to help you get your hands moving. One of those could be a simple one: "Can you touch the keyboard with your fingers right now?" or "Can you feel the weight of your pen or pencil in your hand?" These kinds of exercises are designed to help you bring your attention back to your physical body and get your hands moving, even if your mind is racing.

As for what to do if you bail after two minutes, I want to assure you that it's not a failure. It's just a natural part of the process. If you do get stuck, I'd like to suggest a few things to help you move forward. First, take a deep breath and acknowledge how you're feeling. It's okay to take a step back and say, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now." Then, we can try to break the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, instead of trying to type one line, let's try to type just one sentence. Or, we can try to focus on just one word per sentence. The goal is to make it feel less overwhelming, not to add more pressure.

Now, are you ready to get started? Let's do that five-minute exercise, and we'll take it one step at a time. Remember, it's okay to get stuck, and we'll work together to get you moving again.

Patient: Okay — I'm starting the five minutes now and I'll set a timer. I'm already feeling my chest tighten, so if I start to slip please hit me with a grounding prompt like "name five things you see" or "press your fingertips to the keyboard" — concrete, not fuzzy. And if I bail after two minutes, don't just reassure me: ask me what exactly stopped me and what one smaller step I can try next.

Therapist: I'm glad you're starting the five minutes now. To get you started, I'll give you a simple prompt: "Name five things you see in this room right now." Try to focus on the physical space around you, without getting caught up in thoughts or worries.

As you type, remember that I'm here to help if you need it. If your chest starts to tighten or you feel yourself dissociating, just type "GRIND" and I'll give you a grounding prompt to help you get back on track.

You've got five minutes. Go ahead and type. I'll wait.

Patient: Okay: a lamp, a chipped coffee mug, my laptop with a million tabs, a stack of unpaid bills, and the cracked window sill. My chest's already clamping and my hands feel heavy — GRIND. Not convinced this helps, but I'm doing it.

Therapist: Take a deep breath and try to relax. You've got a good start. Now, I want you to focus on your hands. Can you press your fingertips to the keyboard? Just gently press them down, and then release. Try it a few times, and see if you can get a sense of movement.

Also, take a look at your laptop screen. Can you read the words on your screen? Try to focus on the text, and see if you can keep your mind there.

You're doing great so far. Keep going. Five minutes and 20 seconds left.

Patient: Okay — I pressed my fingertips like you said. It helped a little, like the numbness moved a notch and I could actually read the words, but typing a line still feels like climbing. If I bail, please don't just say it's fine — ask me what exactly stopped me and give one concrete next step (like "type one word"); and seriously, how is this supposed to help with the rent panic?

Therapist: I'm glad pressing your fingertips helped a bit. Now, let's focus on typing one word. Can you type the word "help" on your keyboard? Just one word, no matter how big or small it is. Give it a try.

As for why this is helping, it might seem like a small thing, but it's actually about building momentum. When you're stuck, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, but by taking small actions, you can start to build confidence and get moving again. Plus, this exercise is helping you develop a sense of control and agency, which is important for managing anxiety and stress.

Now, about what stopped you from continuing... Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from typing that line? Was it the thought of what to write, or was there something else going on?

Patient: My chest clamps, my mind blanks, and then the worst-case loop — they'll see I'm a fraud, I'll mess up, lose everything — just takes over and I freeze. I keep second-guessing every word, like if I type one sentence it'll prove I'm useless, so I shut down. If I bail, ask me exactly what stopped me and give one tiny concrete next step (like "type one word"); and honestly, how is typing one word supposed to help with the rent panic?

Therapist: It sounds like the worst-case loop has taken over, and it's a really tough one to break. Can you tell me exactly what happens when you start to type, and then the worst-case loop kicks in? Is it a specific word or phrase that gets stuck in your head, or is it a general feeling of dread?

Also, I want to make sure I'm giving you the right support. You're right, typing one word isn't going to magically fix the rent panic. But this exercise is helping you build momentum, develop a sense of control, and learn to manage your anxiety in a small, manageable way.

Since you're feeling stuck, let's try something even smaller. Can you type just one letter? Yes, just one letter. See if you can get the ball rolling, even if it's just a single letter.

Patient: Okay — I typed one letter: "h". It barely shifted anything — chest's still tight and my hands feel like they might quit, so how is this supposed to help the rent panic? If I bail, don't just soothe me: ask what exactly stopped me and give one concrete next step, like "add one more letter."

Therapist: You typed the letter "h". That's a good start. It's not easy to make progress when you're feeling anxious and uncertain, but every small step counts.

As for the rent panic, I know it feels unrelated to this exercise, but the truth is that anxiety and stress are connected. When you're feeling anxious about one thing, it can make it harder to focus and take action on other things, including things that might seem unrelated, like typing.

Now, about what stopped you from continuing: Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from adding another letter to "h"? Was it the thought of what that letter would mean, or was there something else going on?

Also, I want to try to help you build on that single letter. Here's a concrete next step: Can you add the letter "e" to "h"? It's just one more letter, and it might help you feel like you're making progress.

Patient: Okay — I added the "e", so it reads "he". It barely shifted anything; my chest's still clamped and the worst-case loop took over — what stopped me was that immediate fear it’ll prove I’m a fraud and everything will crash down. If you want something concrete, say “add one more letter” and I’ll try, but seriously — how is spelling a word supposed to help me with rent?

Therapist: You added the "e" and it now reads "he". That's a good step forward.

It sounds like the fear of being a fraud and the worst-case scenario are still really holding you back. Can you try to separate those thoughts for a moment? Instead of focusing on the fear of being a fraud, can you try to focus on just getting the word out? Just spell out the word "he" again, one letter at a time.

As for helping with the rent, I know it feels unrelated to this exercise, but the truth is that building confidence and taking small actions can actually help you feel more in control of your life, including your finances. When you're feeling anxious and uncertain, it's hard to make decisions and take care of yourself, including paying bills.

Let's try to break it down even further. Here's a concrete next step: Can you add the letter "n" to "he"? Just one more letter. See if you can get the word out a little bit more.

Patient: I added the "n" — it spells "hen." It hardly moved anything; my chest's tighter and my head's jumpy, so if I bail, don't just soothe me—ask what exactly stopped me and tell me to "add one more letter." But honestly, how is spelling a word supposed to do anything about the rent panic?

Therapist: You added the "n" and it now spells "hen". That's a good try.

It sounds like you're still feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and the worst-case scenario is still holding you back. Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from continuing to work on the word "hen"? Was it the fear of being a fraud, or was there something else going on?

As for the rent panic, I know it feels unrelated to this exercise, but I want to try to connect the dots. Sometimes, when we're feeling anxious and uncertain, we can get caught up in all-or-nothing thinking. We might feel like everything will crash down if we don't do it perfectly, or if we make one small mistake. But the truth is, most things in life are not as binary as we think. They're often messy, imperfect, and full of gray areas.

Let's try to focus on the present moment, rather than the worst-case scenario. Here's a concrete next step: Can you add the letter "g" to "hen"? Just one more letter. See if you can make progress, even if it's just a tiny bit.

Patient: Okay — I added the "g", so it reads "heng". It barely shifted anything; my chest's tighter and my head's jumpy and I feel scattered, so if I bail don't just soothe me — ask what stopped me and tell me to "add one more letter." And seriously, how is spelling a nonsense word supposed to help with rent or actually get me moving?

Therapist: You added the "g" and it now reads "heng". I can see that you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed.

Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from continuing to work on the word "heng"? Was it the same fear of being a fraud, or did something else come up? I want to understand what's holding you back so I can try to help you break through it.

As for the connection to rent, I know it feels unrelated, but I want to try to help you see how this exercise can actually be connected to your daily life. Sometimes, when we're feeling anxious and uncertain, we can get stuck in a cycle of worry and indecision. We might feel like we're not good enough, or that we're not capable of handling certain situations. But the truth is, we are capable. We just need to take it one small step at a time.

Let's try to focus on that one small step. Here's a concrete next step: Can you add the letter "n" to "heng"? Just one more letter. See if you can make progress, even if it's just a tiny bit.

Patient: Okay — I added the "n." It reads "hengn." My chest's still clamped, my head's jumpy and I'm distracted, so if I bail don't just soothe me — ask what exactly stopped me and tell me to "add one more letter." And seriously, how is spelling nonsense supposed to help me pay rent or survive an interview?

Therapist: You added the "n" and it now reads "hengn". I can see that you're still struggling to focus.

Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from continuing to work on the word "hengn"? Was it the same sense of overwhelm and distraction, or did something else come up? I want to understand what's holding you back so I can try to help you break through it.

I want to be honest with you, spelling nonsense words isn't going to help you pay rent or survive an interview. But this exercise is about building momentum and developing a sense of control. It's about learning to focus and take small steps towards a goal, even when it feels overwhelming.

Let's try to shift our focus. Instead of spelling nonsense words, let's try to focus on one small action that you can take today to move closer to your goal. Can you think of one small thing you can do, just one tiny step, that will help you feel more in control and more confident?

Patient: Okay — I don’t have the energy for big steps, so one tiny thing: I’ll find one job posting and tailor one sentence in the cover letter, then try to hit submit. If I bail, don’t just soothe me — ask what exactly stopped me and tell me to “add one sentence” or “paste one skill” so my hands have a concrete next move. But honestly, how is one sentence supposed to help me with rent when everything else is collapsing?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed and exhausted. Finding one job posting and tailoring one sentence in the cover letter is a tiny, achievable goal.

Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from moving forward? Was it the same sense of overwhelm and exhaustion, or did something else come up? I want to understand what's holding you back so I can try to help you build momentum.

Let's focus on that one tiny step. I want you to add one sentence to your cover letter. Can you take the job posting and add one sentence that highlights your relevant skill or experience? It could be something as simple as "Utilized strong communication skills to negotiate a successful contract" or "Applied technical knowledge to improve efficiency in a previous role". Just one sentence. See if you can make progress on that.

And then, once you've added that sentence, I want you to paste one skill from your resume into the job posting. Can you find one skill that matches the requirements of the job posting and paste it in? See if you can make progress on that too.

Patient: Okay — I added one sentence: "I coordinated cross‑functional teams to deliver projects on time and under budget," and I pasted the skill "project management" into the job posting. It felt like dragging — chest tight, hands numb — but it's done for now. If I bail after this, don't just soothe me: ask me exactly what stopped me and tell me to "attach resume" or "paste one more skill" so my hands have a concrete next move. But seriously — how is this supposed to help with rent right now? What’s the next concrete thing you want me to do?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit drained after completing the small task. It's great that you were able to make progress, though.

Can you tell me exactly what stopped you from moving forward after adding the sentence and pasting the skill? Was it the same sense of overwhelm and numbness, or did something else come up? I want to understand what's holding you back so I can try to help you build momentum.

Now that you've made progress, I want you to attach your resume to the job posting. Can you click the "Attach file" button and upload your resume? See if you can make it feel like a small, manageable step.

And then, I want you to paste one more skill from your resume into the job posting. Can you find one skill that matches the requirements of the job posting and paste it in? See if you can make progress on that too.

Remember, this is a small, concrete step towards your goal. It's not about paying rent right now, it's about taking small steps towards a goal that will help you achieve financial stability in the long run.

Let's focus on the next small step. Are you ready to attach your resume and paste one more skill?

Patient: My energy's flat and this feels like a grind, but I’ll try to attach the resume and paste one more skill now. If I bail, don’t just soothe me—ask me what exactly stopped me and tell me to “paste one more skill” or “attach resume” right away, and honestly, how is this supposed to help me pay rent this week?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really drained and it's hard to keep going. I'm going to be honest with you, the goal of attaching your resume and pasting one more skill is not to pay rent this week, but to make progress on your job search.

Paying rent is a big priority, but it's also important to have a plan in place to pay it. By taking small steps to improve your job prospects, you're taking a step towards financial stability.

Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from attaching your resume and pasting one more skill? Was it the feeling of exhaustion, or was there something else holding you back?

Let's try to move forward, but I want to be clear about what's next. I want you to paste one more skill from your resume into the job posting. Can you find one skill that matches the requirements of the job posting and paste it in? See if you can make progress on that too.

And then, I want you to attach your resume to the job posting. Can you click the "Attach file" button and upload your resume? See if you can make it feel like a small, manageable step.

Remember, this is not a magic solution, but it's a step towards making progress on your job search. I'm here to support you, but I also need you to take small steps towards your goal.

Patient: Okay — I attached my resume and pasted another skill ("budget management"), but it was a real slog; chest's tight and I'm flat. What do you want me to do next right now — hit submit, schedule a follow-up, or something else concrete? And please — if I bail, don't just soothe me: ask what exactly stopped me and tell me to “paste one more skill” or “attach resume” so my hands have a next move; also, how is any of this supposed to help me pay rent this week?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really exhausted and it's hard to keep going. I'm going to be honest with you, the goal of attaching your resume and pasting skills is not to pay rent this week, but to make progress on your job search.

However, I understand that you're not in a place to think about job search strategies right now. Your priority is paying rent this week.

Can you tell me what exactly stopped you from moving forward? Was it the feeling of exhaustion, or was there something else holding you back?

Let's take a break from the job search for now. I want you to focus on getting something to eat, taking a shower, and getting some rest. Once you're feeling a bit more grounded, we can talk about what's next.

But here's the thing: I'm not going to leave you hanging. I want you to take one small step towards your job search, even if it's just pasting one more skill from your resume into the job posting. Can you do that for me? It's just one more small step.

And if you bail, I want you to be honest with me. I'll ask you what exactly stopped you and we'll go from there. No soothing, no empty encouragement. Just a honest conversation about what's next.

Patient: Okay — I can't do more job stuff right now; I'm going to eat and shower and try to not think about rent for a bit. But if you want me to do one more thing after that, tell me exactly: "paste one more skill" or "hit submit now" — concrete, plain instruction. And if I bail, don't soothe me: ask what exactly stopped me and tell me one tiny next move so my hands have something to do.

Therapist: I'm glad you're taking care of yourself for now. Once you've eaten, showered, and rested, I want you to come back to this conversation and take one small action.

If you're willing, I want you to paste one more skill from your resume into the job posting. Can you find one skill that matches the requirements of the job posting and paste it in? See if you can make progress on that too.

If you're not feeling up to it, I want you to be honest with me. I'll ask you what exactly stopped you and we'll go from there. No empty encouragement, just a honest conversation about what's next.

Patient: Okay — I’ll go eat and shower and try to come back to this. My chest’s still tight and I’m moving slow, but after that I’ll try to paste one more skill into the posting. If I bail, don’t soothe me — ask what stopped me and say exactly: “paste one more skill.” But seriously, how does that actually help with rent this week?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try to paste one more skill into the posting. I want you to know that I'm not trying to put any pressure on you or make it seem like this is going to magically fix your rent situation. But, taking small steps towards your job search can help you get back on track and build momentum.

It's not a magic solution, but it's a step in the right direction. Even if it's just a tiny step, it's something to build on.

If you do decide to paste one more skill, I want you to do it slowly and take your time. Don't rush it. You can take a break if you need to, and we can pick it up again later.

Now, I want you to go take care of yourself and come back when you're feeling a bit more grounded. Don't worry about the job posting right now. Just focus on getting some rest and taking care of your physical and emotional needs.

Patient: Alright. I'll go eat and shower — my energy's flat and it'll take effort, but I’ll try to come back and paste one more skill into the posting. If I bail when I get back, don't soothe me: ask what exactly stopped me and say plainly, "paste one more skill." And honestly, I still don't see how any of this pays rent this week, but I'll try anyway.
