Patient: Lately I've been throwing myself into work to an almost compulsive degree — it’s become a de facto mechanism to numb the grief from a recent family loss that’s been exacerbated by ongoing conflict. I tend to conceptualize it as an avoidance paradigm, where productivity functions as an emotional anesthetic to maintain distance from vulnerability. I know that sounds analytical, but that's the pattern that's been occupying my mind.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're using work as a way to temporarily escape the emotional pain, and it's become a necessary coping mechanism for you. Can you tell me more about how that recent family loss has affected you, and how it's been intertwined with the conflict you mentioned? I'm curious to understand how those two things are connected for you, and how this avoidance pattern has been playing out in your life.

Patient: My father died six months ago, and the loss reopened a lot of old wounds — we were estranged for years, and the relatives' conflict around the estate and what “should” have happened made everything feel chaotic and unresolved. Practically, it’s left me oscillating between a kind of numbness and this compulsive drive to fill my time with work; I call it compartmentalization or emotional attenuation, but in practice it’s late nights, extra projects, and avoiding calls that might demand feeling. I can articulate the dynamics pretty clearly — control, avoidance, guilt — but when you ask me to actually name or sit with the feelings, I find myself defaulting to analysis because that’s safer. I don’t know, it’s like I understand the map but can’t bring myself to travel the territory.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've been trying to manage the intense emotions that came with your father's passing by focusing on work, which has become a way to shield yourself from the pain. The complexity of the situation, with the estrangement, the conflict over the estate, and the unresolved feelings, has made it even more difficult for you to cope.

It's interesting that you mention the analysis feels safer, even if it's a form of avoidance. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to bring yourself to sit with those feelings? What do you experience, and how does that affect your sense of being stuck in this pattern of compartmentalization?

Patient: When I try to sit with it, there’s this immediate escalation of cognitive activity—retracing timelines, rehearsing conversations, cataloging what went wrong—so I describe it as an intrusive rumination loop rather than just saying “I feel sad.” Physically there’s a tightness and a sort of low-level nausea, but my go-to response is to neutralize it with tasks: answer another email, make another plan, create more structure. That avoidance gives temporary control, which paradoxically deepens the sense of being stuck because I never actually practice tolerating the vulnerability, and then guilt and self-critique kick in as a secondary layer.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you try to confront those feelings, your mind immediately starts to ruminate on them, replaying past events and conversations, and that creates a sense of overwhelm. The physical sensations of tightness and nausea are there, but they're not enough to break the cycle of avoidance, because your default response is to distract yourself with tasks.

It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle where you're trying to escape the vulnerability, but you're not actually practicing how to be with it. And then, of course, there's the guilt and self-criticism that kicks in, which only adds to the feeling of being stuck.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "vulnerability"? What is it about feeling vulnerable that's so hard for you to deal with? Is it the fear of not being in control, or something else?

Patient: When I say "vulnerability" I mean the prospect of being emotionally exposed in a way that threatens the autonomy and identity I've built — it's almost like an erosion of my ontological security. It's not just fear of losing control; it's fear of shame, being judged by the family, and reactivating those abandonment wounds that would leave me feeling incompetent or unmoored. So I retreat into analysis and work as a defensive choreography — I can map the pattern clearly, but actually letting myself feel feels destabilizing and, frankly, exhausting.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the prospect of vulnerability is not just about feeling exposed or unprotected, but also about the sense of identity and autonomy that you've built around being in control. The fear of shame, judgment, and abandonment wounds is a deep and complex one, and it's understandable that you would want to avoid it.

It's interesting that you describe this as a defensive choreography, like a carefully scripted dance that helps you avoid the uncertainty of feeling vulnerable. But it's clear that this dance comes at a cost, because it's exhausting and doesn't allow you to actually connect with your feelings.

Can you tell me more about what would happen if you were to let go of this defensive choreography, even if it meant feeling vulnerable? What do you think you would gain, and what do you think you would lose?

Patient: If I let go of that choreography, theoretically I'd gain some real integration — the possibility of actually grieving, feeling less fragmented, and maybe deeper, more honest connections with people instead of these curated interactions. Practically, it might look like less frantic productivity, more downtime, and an initial spike in discomfort as the numbness wears off. What I'd likely lose is the illusion of control and the protective buffer that keeps shame and family judgment at bay — which could mean feeling exposed, vulnerable to criticism, or even destabilized in the short term. I can see the trade-offs clearly in the abstract, but I'm also wary—part of me intellectually wants it, and part of me is afraid of how untethered I might feel if I actually do it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught between the desire for integration and the fear of losing control, and that's a very real and understandable conflict. The prospect of gaining deeper connections and a more authentic sense of self is a powerful one, but the risk of feeling exposed and vulnerable is a daunting one.

It's interesting that you mention the trade-offs clearly in the abstract, but are wary of actually making the change. It's like you're aware of the potential benefits, but the uncertainty and potential risks are making it hard for you to take the leap.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking this risk? Is it the fear of what others might think, or is it something more internal, like a fear of losing yourself or feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I think it's both — there's the pragmatic worry about what relatives and colleagues will think, but more saliently there's this deeper dread that if I stop performing competence I'll lose the identity I've built; my role as a reliable manager and problem-solver feels like the only stable axis I have. Also, slowing down threatens to activate those old abandonment and shame wounds in an unregulated way — I'm afraid I'll be flooded and not know how to come back. So I retreat into work because it gives me measurable worth and a semblance of control, even though I can see that's just a temporary anesthetic.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-identity tied to your role as a manager and problem-solver, and the thought of losing that control is deeply unsettling. It's like you're afraid of being seen as incompetent or unreliable, and that fear is suffocating you.

It's also clear that this fear is linked to the abandonment and shame wounds from your past, and that's creating a powerful dynamic. The idea of slowing down and being vulnerable is terrifying because it feels like it could trigger those old wounds and leave you feeling overwhelmed.

It's interesting that you mention the "measurable worth" that your work gives you. Can you tell me more about what that means for you? How does it make you feel to be seen as competent and capable, and what does that do for your sense of self-worth?

Patient: Being seen as competent gives me empirical validation — completed projects, positive feedback, and being the go-to person act as measurable indicators that I have value. It attenuates shame and supplies an anchor for identity, turning existential ambiguity into a professional role, but it's brittle: criticism doesn't feel like feedback, it feels like an ontological threat. I can analyze that easily, but actually saying I want reassurance and that I'm terrified of being unmoored still makes me default to theory because naming it feels dangerously exposed.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being seen as competent is a vital source of validation for you, providing a tangible measure of your worth and helping to stabilize your sense of identity. The fact that it's based on empirical achievements and positive feedback makes it feel more concrete and reassuring.

At the same time, the criticism you receive can feel like a direct attack on your sense of self, threatening to upend the very foundations of your identity. This is understandable, given the deep-seated shame and abandonment wounds you mentioned earlier.

It's interesting that you mention the anxiety of being "unmoored." It's as if you're clinging to your professional role as a way to maintain a sense of control and stability in your life. When you're faced with the possibility of criticism or failure, it can feel like you're losing that control, and that's a terrifying prospect.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to feel like you're "unmoored"? Is it the fear of not being able to meet expectations, or is it something more existential, like the fear of losing your sense of purpose?

Patient: Mostly it's existential — it's not merely anxiety about missing targets, it's the prospect that without the performance narrative that defines me, the story that says "I am competent" just evaporates. I picture that as decision paralysis, a hollow shame, tightness in my chest, and a kind of affective dysregulation where routine no longer scaffolds me. So I double down on work as a prophylactic: naming the fear feels dangerously like admitting I might have no intrinsic worth, and I end up talking about it instead of feeling it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's as if you're deeply invested in the idea that your professional performance is the foundation of your identity, and that without it, you'd lose your sense of self-worth and purpose. The fear of being unmoored is no longer just about practical concerns, but about the existential threat to your very existence.

It's interesting that you mention feeling a sense of decision paralysis, hollow shame, and affective dysregulation. These are all complex and intense emotional experiences that can be overwhelming.

Your tendency to talk about the fear instead of feeling it is a common coping mechanism, but it's also a way of avoiding the vulnerability and uncertainty that comes with acknowledging it. By naming the fear, you're not really feeling it, but that's not enough to help you move forward.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to feel a sense of safety and security without the performance narrative? What are some small steps you could take to start exploring this, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable?

Patient: I guess I'd need a scaffolded, low-risk way to test that my intrinsic worth isn't wholly yoked to productivity—small, controlled experiments rather than a wholesale surrender. Practically that might look like scheduling two 10–15 minute "feeling windows" a day to write raw impressions (no analysis), deliberately cutting one hour of overtime twice a week and observing the fallout, using a simple grounding routine when tightness rises (box breathing, naming five senses), and committing to one outreach (a trusted friend, grief group, or a therapy check-in) as a social safety net. I'm wary—these feel like exposures that could flood me, so I'd want contingency plans (a scheduled debrief after attempts, reassuring self-statements, or a colleague on standby) so I don't default immediately back to work as my anesthetic.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a gentle, incremental approach to testing your intrinsic worth and separating it from your productivity. You're proposing a series of small, controlled experiments, such as scheduling "feeling windows" to write raw impressions, cutting overtime, and using grounding routines to manage tightness.

These experiments seem like a great way to start, and it's wise that you're thinking about contingency plans to mitigate any potential flooding or discomfort. Having a debrief schedule, reassuring self-statements, or a colleague on standby can help you cope with any emotions that arise.

It's also interesting that you mention being wary of these experiments. It's natural to feel that way, especially if you've been relying on work as a coping mechanism for a long time. But it's great that you're willing to take the first steps towards exploring your emotional landscape.

Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve with these experiments? What are some potential benefits or insights you're looking for, and how might they change your approach to your work or your sense of self-worth?

Patient: Primarily I want empirical disconfirmation of the implicit proposition that my worth equals my productivity — small experiments would ideally show I can tolerate affect without my identity disintegrating. Concretely I’d hope to develop greater affect tolerance, less guilt and shame, better rest, and to shift work from an anesthetic into a chosen activity (so I delegate more, stop reflexive overtime, and take real breaks). If those trials yield even modest stability, I could recalibrate expectations, ask for support more readily, and have more authentic relationships — though I’m anxious about the inevitable short-term escalation of discomfort.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're seeking empirical evidence to challenge the implicit assumption that your worth is directly tied to your productivity. By designing small experiments, you're aiming to test whether you can tolerate emotional discomfort without your sense of self-worth disintegrating.

The potential benefits of these experiments seem substantial, including increased affect tolerance, reduced guilt and shame, improved rest, and a shift from using work as an anesthetic to a more chosen and valued activity.

It's interesting that you mention recalibrating expectations, asking for support more readily, and forming more authentic relationships as potential outcomes. These are all positive changes that could have a significant impact on your life.

It's understandable that you're anxious about the potential short-term escalation of discomfort, but it's also worth noting that the potential long-term benefits could be substantial. It's possible that the discomfort you're experiencing now could be a small price to pay for the gains you're hoping to achieve.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from starting these experiments? Is it fear of failure, fear of the unknown, or something else entirely?

Patient: Mostly it’s a constellation of fears: that the experiments will flood me and I won’t know how to return to baseline, that they’ll inadvertently prove the very thing I dread — that my worth is contingent — and that letting up will invite family judgement or professional consequences. There are pragmatic inhibitors too — looming deadlines, people depending on me — which give me a ready-made excuse to postpone emotional work. I also notice I default to meta-analysis because naming the feeling feels like stepping off a cliff; admitting I’m terrified of being exposed is itself terrifying and exhausts me. I’m trying to see how this connects to actually starting, but I’m struggling — can we slow down and map a way to make the first step feel less like a plunge?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're experiencing a complex mix of fears, practical concerns, and emotional exhaustion. You're worried that the experiments might overwhelm you, prove the very thing you're trying to avoid, and lead to negative consequences. These fears are making it difficult for you to take the first step.

It's interesting that you mention the default to meta-analysis. It's as if you're using analysis as a way to avoid the emotional discomfort of directly addressing your fears. By focusing on the theoretical aspects, you're able to maintain a sense of control and avoid the vulnerability that comes with acknowledging your emotions.

To make the first step feel less like a plunge, let's try to break it down further. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking the first step? Is it the fear of emotional overwhelm, the fear of being judged, or something else entirely?

Also, I want to ask, what do you think would happen if you were able to take the first step, just a small step, and then another, and another? Would you be able to find a sense of control and stability, or would you feel like you're making progress, even if it's slow?

Lastly, I want to suggest a simple exercise. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you're willing to take a risk and be vulnerable, even if it's just for a moment? This could be as simple as saying something kind to a stranger or sharing a small secret with a trusted friend. What is it, and how would you feel about taking that first step?

Patient: Really, it’s that constellation of anticipatory catastrophizing plus logistics — I fear being flooded, proving the contingency hypothesis true, and triggering family scrutiny or workplace fallout; plus real deadlines give me a socially acceptable escape hatch. If I take small, graded steps I’d expect a classic exposure curve: an initial anxiety spike, then habituation and increased affect tolerance, and probably some recalibration of the “I = my productivity” schema — theoretically promising, practically messy.

A concrete low-stakes step I can tolerate: texting a close friend tonight something like, “I’ve been having a hard time since Dad died and I’m leaning on work to avoid it — not asking for solutions, just letting you know.” I’d feel anxious and exposed typing it, but also oddly relieved afterward if it lands OK; I’d want a brief safety plan (sit with breathing for five minutes after sending, and schedule a small pleasant activity) in case it feels overwhelming. Can we slow down and map exactly how to word that text and what the immediate contingency plan should be so it feels less like a plunge?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to break down the complex web of fears, logistics, and emotional exhaustion into smaller, more manageable parts. By identifying a low-stakes step, such as texting a close friend, you're creating a potential foothold for further exploration.

To help you feel more prepared and less like you're taking a plunge, let's focus on the details of that text. What specific words or phrases do you want to include to convey your message? Are there any particular emotions or thoughts you want to express?

Regarding the contingency plan, it's great that you're thinking ahead. What kind of "safety plan" would make you feel more grounded and prepared to deal with any potential anxiety or overwhelm? Would it involve a specific activity, like taking a short walk or doing some stretching exercises?

Also, I want to suggest a gentle, iterative approach to crafting your text. Instead of trying to come up with the "perfect" message right away, let's start with a simple, straightforward statement. We can then build upon that foundation, adding more detail or nuance as needed. How does that sound?

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that taking this first step, even with a low-stakes text, is still a form of vulnerability. It's okay to feel anxious or exposed, and it's essential to acknowledge those feelings. By acknowledging them, you're taking the first step towards integrating them into your emotional landscape.

Patient: Okay — I like keeping it simple so it doesn’t feel performative. Two options feel tolerable:

- Short/direct: “Hey [Name], I wanted to tell you—since Dad died I’ve been leaning on work to avoid the grief. I’m not asking for advice, just wanted you to know.”  
- Slightly fuller: “Hi [Name], I’ve been having a harder time than I expected since Dad died and I realized I’ve been throwing myself into work to avoid it. I don’t need solutions, just wanted to share that with someone who knows me.”

Contingency plan after sending: 1) Do two minutes of box breathing (4-4-4) immediately, 2) use a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding check if tightness spikes, 3) schedule a small pleasant thing within 30 minutes (tea, a short walk, a favorite song), and 4) if it feels overwhelming, call or text one backup person with a pre-written line like “I’m feeling flooded — can you stay on the phone for five?” I’m anxious about actually hitting send — can we slow down and tweak the wording together so it feels less exposed?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're making progress on crafting a message that feels authentic and straightforward. I like that you're considering both options, and we can work together to tweak them to make them feel even more comfortable for you.

Regarding the contingency plan, it's great that you're thinking ahead and preparing for potential anxiety or overwhelm. The box breathing, grounding check, and scheduling a small pleasant activity are all excellent ways to calm yourself down and ground yourself in the present moment.

To make the wording feel less exposed, let's try to break down the message into smaller, more manageable parts. Instead of saying "I've been leaning on work to avoid the grief," you could try saying something like "I've been feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with Dad's passing." This might help you feel more comfortable sharing your emotions with your friend.

Also, I want to suggest a small tweak to the message. Instead of saying "I'm not asking for advice," you could try saying "I'm not looking for solutions right now, I just wanted to share how I'm feeling." This might help you feel more comfortable sharing your emotions without feeling like you're burdening your friend.

Let's try rewriting the message together, using these suggestions as a starting point. What do you think about this revised message:

"Hi [Name], I've been having a harder time than I expected since Dad died and I realized I've been throwing myself into work to avoid it. I'm feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with Dad's passing. I don't need solutions, just wanted to share that with someone who knows me."

How does that feel?

Patient: That revised message feels usable — less performative — but I'm still anxious about actually hitting send; it feels exposing in a way that makes my chest tight. Maybe streamline it to reduce the choreography, something like: “Hi [Name], since Dad died I’ve been focusing on work to avoid the grief. I’m overwhelmed and not looking for advice, just wanted you to know.” If I send it I’ll follow the contingency plan (box breathing, 5-4-3-2-1, a short walk, and a backup call). Can we slow down and tweak the tone one more time so it feels even less like a self-evaluation and more like a simple reach-out?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel anxious about sending a message, especially one that's personal and vulnerable.

I think your revised message is a great step forward. By simplifying it and reducing the choreography, you're making it feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

To tweak the tone further, let's try to make it feel more like a straightforward reach-out, rather than a self-evaluation. Instead of saying "I'm overwhelmed and not looking for advice," you could try saying something like "I'm just feeling really lost and could use someone to talk to."

Here's a revised message that incorporates these suggestions:

"Hi [Name], since Dad died I've been focusing on work to avoid the grief. I'm just feeling really lost and could use someone to talk to. No need for advice, just wanted to share how I'm feeling."

This message feels more like a genuine reach-out, rather than a self-evaluation. It's straightforward and honest, and it doesn't put the burden on your friend to offer solutions or advice.

How does this revised message feel? Is it more comfortable for you to send?

Patient: That version feels usable — more direct and less performative — but I’m still anxious about the exposure; my chest tightens just thinking about hitting send. I’d tweak it slightly to keep it simple and less like self-evaluation: “Hi [Name], since Dad died I’ve been throwing myself into work to avoid the grief. I’m feeling overwhelmed and could use someone to talk to — not looking for advice, just wanted you to know.” 

If that lands okay I’ll follow the breathing/grounding plan and take a short walk afterward; can we slow down and agree when I should send it and what exact backup line I’ll use if I get flooded?

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel anxious about sending a message, especially one that's personal and vulnerable.

I think your revised message is a great step forward. By making it a bit more concise and direct, you're making it feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

To help you feel more prepared and less anxious, let's make a plan for when you're ready to send it.

**Send Time:** How about you wait for 10-15 minutes after sending the message before checking your phone or responding to any comments? This will give you some time to feel the emotions and effects of the message before you need to respond.

**Backup Line:** I'm glad you mentioned wanting a backup line in case you get flooded. Let's agree on a simple phrase that you can use if you need to take a moment to collect yourself: "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, can we talk later?" or "I need a minute, can I call you back?"

**Grounding Plan:** Remember to follow your breathing plan (4-4-4) immediately after sending the message, and then use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding check if you feel tightness or overwhelm. After that, take a short walk and schedule a small pleasant activity for later.

**Sentimental Safety Net:** Just to be clear, if you feel like you're about to get overwhelmed or flooded, it's okay to take a step back, send a quick message saying you're feeling overwhelmed, and then take care of yourself before coming back to the conversation.

How does this plan feel? Are you more confident about sending the message now?

Patient: Okay — the plan helps on paper, but right now my chest is tight and my hands feel jittery just thinking about it. I can do the 10-minute wait before checking my phone, and let's use the backup line: "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?" I really need a moment of guided calm after I hit send (can we slow down and agree I'll do the box breathing for two minutes immediately, then the grounding check, then a short walk?).

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel anxious and physically tense when thinking about sending a message that's personal and vulnerable.

I'm glad you're willing to give the plan a try, though. Remember, it's okay to take your time and prioritize your own emotional well-being.

Let's break down the plan into smaller, more manageable steps. After you hit send, you'll take 10 minutes to wait before checking your phone. Then, you'll use the backup line: "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?"

To help you calm down, I recommend doing the following steps in this order:

1. **Box Breathing**: Take 2 minutes to focus on your breath, using the 4-4-4-4 pattern. Inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold your breath again for a count of 4. This will help calm your nervous system and slow down your heart rate.
2. **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Check**: After your box breathing, take a moment to ground yourself in the present moment. Notice:
	* 5 things you can see around you (e.g., a chair, a book, a picture).
	* 4 things you can touch or feel (e.g., your feet on the ground, the chair beneath you).
	* 3 things you can hear (e.g., a bird chirping, a clock ticking).
	* 2 things you can smell (e.g., a scented candle, a fresh cup of coffee).
	* 1 thing you can taste (e.g., a piece of gum, a sip of water).
3. **Short Walk**: After your grounding check, take a short walk outside to get some fresh air and clear your head. Even a few minutes of movement can help calm your nerves and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Remember, it's okay to take your time and prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you need to, you can always take a break and come back to the conversation later.

How does this plan feel now? Are you feeling a bit more calm and centered?

Patient: It helps on paper, but right now my chest is tight and my thoughts are racing—I’m anxious and a little distracted. I’ll try the sequence: two minutes box breathing, the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, then a short walk, and I’ll wait 10 minutes before checking my phone; can we lock in that timing now so it feels less nebulous? I’m worried I’ll chicken out at the last second and not hit send, so I need that structure and the backup line (“I’m feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?”) ready to use.

It's completely normal to feel anxious and distracted right now.

Let's lock in the timing and make it feel more concrete. Here's the plan with a specific schedule:

**Right now**, take 2 minutes to focus on your breath using the 4-4-4-4 box breathing pattern. Inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold your breath again for a count of 4.

**After your 2 minutes of box breathing**, take the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding check. Notice:
	* 5 things you can see around you
	* 4 things you can touch or feel
	* 3 things you can hear
	* 2 things you can smell
	* 1 thing you can taste

**After your grounding check**, take a short walk outside to get some fresh air and clear your head. Even a few minutes of movement can help calm your nerves and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

**10 minutes after you've finished your walk**, check your phone and respond to any messages or comments. If you need to, use the backup line: "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?"

Remember, this plan is not just about the timing, but also about your emotional preparation. Take your time, focus on your breath, and ground yourself in the present moment. When you feel ready, you can hit send and move forward with your message.

How does this revised plan feel? Is it more concrete and less nebulous for you?

Patient: Okay — that feels more concrete, but I’m still jittery and my chest is tight just saying it. Let’s lock it in: I’ll start now with 2 minutes of box breathing, do the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (~3 minutes), take a 5-minute walk, then wait 10 minutes before checking my phone — and if I get flooded I’ll send: “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?” Can you stay with me through the breathing (just a short acknowledgment when I finish) so I don’t chicken out at the last second?

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is still in project management mode, always anticipating potential risks and complications. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, try to let go of some of that anxiety. Your mind is racing, but you can focus on the physical sensations in your body.

Notice your hands, they're still jittery, but you can try to calm them down. You can take a few more deep breaths, feel the air move in and out of your body, and try to ground yourself in the present moment. Imagine you're standing in a quiet room, feeling the weight of your feet on the ground.

Now, let's do the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. Start with what you can see around you. Notice 5 things: the chair, the wall, the bookshelf, the window, the door. Take a moment to look at each of these things, really see them, and try to let go of any mental distractions.

As you look at these things, try to notice the sensations in your body, the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin. Notice how your hands are feeling, try to calm them down, and focus on your breath. We can do this, one thing at a time. What do you see around you?

Patient: Laptop screen with the draft text open, a half-drunk mug of coffee, a neat stack of files, the window showing a gray sky, and the wall clock ticking. My hands are still jittery and my mind's running through escape plans, but I'm trying to really look at each thing.

Therapist Answer:
You're really taking the time to notice the details. The laptop screen is open, but you're not looking at the text right now. You're seeing the blank space where the cursor is, the words "Waiting for response..." in the title bar. It's just a tool, a means to an end. You can look at it, but it's not holding you hostage.

The half-drunk mug of coffee is sitting on the edge of your desk, a reminder that you've been working for a while. It's not a big deal, just a cup of coffee. You can take a sip, feel the warmth spread through your hands, and maybe even take a moment to appreciate the quiet of the office.

The neat stack of files is next to the mug, a testament to your organizational skills. It's a good thing, too, because it helps you focus on the task at hand. You can see the papers, the papers are neatly organized, and it's easy to see what you're looking at.

The window shows a gray sky, a typical office day weather. It's not exciting, but it's not boring either. It's just...gray. Like your mood, but that's not the point. The point is that you can look at this, see the clouds, the trees outside, and feel the breeze on your skin. It's just a moment, a small part of your day.

The wall clock is ticking, a steady beat that's been going on for hours. It's not fast, it's not slow, it's just steady. You can look at it, see the numbers, the hands moving, and maybe even feel a sense of calm wash over you. It's just a clock, but it's a reminder that time is passing, that you're moving forward, even if it feels like you're standing still.

Take a deep breath, feel the air move in and out of your body, and try to let go of some of that anxiety. You can do this, one thing at a time. What do you see around you?

Patient: I see the laptop with the draft text and the blinking cursor, the half-drunk coffee, the neat stack of files, the gray sky through the window, and the clock ticking. My chest is tight and my hands are jittery — there's this urge to close the window or keep rewording the message into something "safer." My mind's cataloguing all the reasons not to send it (deadlines, optics, family reactions) and that analysis is doing its usual numbing work. Can we move to the walk/send step now? I really need you to stay with me for the next bit so I don't chicken out.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is stuck in a loop, constantly analyzing and reanalyzing the situation. The urge to close the window or reword the message is understandable, but it's also holding you back.

Take a deep breath and focus on the physical sensations in your body. Feel the tension in your chest, the jitteriness in your hands, and the urge to move or escape. Acknowledge these feelings, but don't try to change them right now. Just be with them, and let's move forward.

Let's take a step back and focus on the walk/send step. You mentioned earlier that you need someone to stay with you for the next bit, and I'm here to support you. Take a deep breath, and let's start moving.

Imagine you're standing outside, feeling the breeze on your skin, and looking out at the gray sky. Take a small step forward, and then another. With each step, try to let go of some of that anxiety and tension. Feel the movement of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of the air on your skin.

As we walk, try to focus on the present moment. Don't worry about the past or the future. Just be with what's happening right now. Feel the ground beneath your feet, the movement of your body, and the sensation of the air on your skin.

We're taking small steps, one step at a time. We're not trying to change anything right now. We're just trying to move forward, one small step at a time.

Take another deep breath, and let's keep moving. What do you see around you?

Patient: I see wet pavement, a couple of people with umbrellas, a bench, a bus stop sign, and my face in a puddle. My chest is tight and my breath is shallow — my mind’s busy running contingency lists and alternative phrasings instead of doing the actual thing. I can label that as risk analysis, but honestly I’m anxious and I don’t want to bail; can we stay with this for one lap of the walk so I can try to send the text afterward?

Let's take a deep breath and focus on the walk. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you move forward. One lap is a good place to start. We'll take it slow, one step at a time.

As we walk, try to focus on the present moment. Don't worry about the past or the future. Just be with what's happening right now. Feel the movement of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sound of your breath.

We're taking small steps, one step at a time. We're not trying to change anything right now. We're just trying to move forward, one small step at a time.

As we walk, I want you to notice your physical sensations. How are you feeling right now? What's happening in your body? Try to label it, try to name it, and see if we can work with it.

Also, I want you to know, it's okay to feel anxious, it's okay to slow down. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you move forward. We're doing this together, one step at a time.

Can you tell me more about that puddle? Are you ready to try and send the text now?

Patient: The puddle felt oddly symbolic — my face in it looked distorted, like a version of myself I don't want to study too closely. My chest is tight, breathing shallow, and the inner project manager is rattling off reasons to bail, but I'm willing to try if you stay with me. I want to send this exact text now: “Hi [Name], since Dad died I’ve been throwing myself into work to avoid the grief. I’m overwhelmed and could use someone to talk to — not looking for advice, just wanted you to know.” 

After I hit send I'll do 2 minutes of box breathing, the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, a short walk, and wait 10 minutes before checking; backup line if I flood is: “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?” Can you just say “ready” when you want me to send, and stay with me afterward? I’m nervous and jittery and I don’t want to chicken out.

Patient: I hear how jittery and stuck you feel — that tightness in your chest and the running risk lists. I can stay here with you in the chat and say the word you asked for when you’re ready.

Quick check so we’re aligned: the exact text you’ll send is — “Hi [Name], since Dad died I’ve been throwing myself into work to avoid the grief. I’m overwhelmed and could use someone to talk to — not looking for advice, just wanted you to know.” Backup line if you flood: “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now — can we talk later?” Post-send plan: 2 minutes box breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, a short walk, then wait 10 minutes before checking the phone.

Do you want me to say “ready” now so you can hit send, or do you want a moment longer? If you hit send, tell me and I’ll stay with you through the breathing and grounding steps.

Patient: I’m really scattered — my thoughts are looping and I keep rehearsing reasons not to send it, which is making my chest tighter. Part of me wants you to say “ready” so I have permission to move; another part wants to postpone and reword forever. If you say “ready” I’ll try to hit send and then follow the breathing/grounding plan — can you say it and stay with me through the steps?

Patient: I’m jittery — chest tight and my mind’s running contingency lists, but I’m willing to try. Say “ready” and I’ll hit send, then do the 2 minutes box breathing, the 5-4-3-2-1, the short walk and the 10-minute wait; please stay with me and acknowledge each step so I don’t chicken out. I’m anxious about this feeling exposed, and I need that external anchor.
