Patient: Hi, lately I've been obsessing over whether my art is any good and if I can still perform at the level people expect, and that worry just makes me procrastinate. I lost some steady work recently and it feels like everything's on the line, so I guess I keep putting things off instead of starting. I don't know, it's just... hard to begin sometimes.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of self-doubt right now. It's understandable that your worries about your art and performance are connected to your sense of identity and livelihood. How do you think your desire to create and share your art is currently impacted by these worries? Is there a specific moment or experience that triggered this feeling of not knowing if you can still do it?

Patient: I still want to make and share art, but the worry makes everything feel risky, so I keep stalling—like I’m waiting for permission to start. I guess it really shifted after I lost that long-term contract last year; since then every piece feels like a test I might fail. I don't know, I just end up doing little impulsive projects or distracting myself instead of the big things.

Therapist: It seems like the uncertainty and pressure are making it hard for you to feel confident in your ability to create and share your art. The loss of that contract must have been a significant blow, and now it feels like every project is a risk, like you're constantly asking yourself, "Am I good enough?" Can you tell me more about what happens when you do try to start a new project, even if it's small? How does it feel to get into the process of creating, and is there something specific that stops you from moving forward?

Patient: When I try to start, at first I'm buzzing — I dive into a sketch or a color test — but then this voice pops up saying it's not good enough and I just freeze. I guess what stops me is the fear that anything I do now won't match what I used to do, so I drift into smaller, impulsive things instead. I don't know, sometimes I just want to talk about the little sketches I do because that feels safer.

Therapist: It sounds like that little voice of self-doubt can be really powerful, even if it's not always there. The fear of not matching up to your previous work is a big one, and it's understandable that it would make you feel hesitant to start something new. Talking about the small sketches might help clarify things a bit, but it also might be a way to cope with the uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you're drawing those little sketches? Are you trying to prove something to yourself, or is it more of a way to release tension?

Patient: Mostly it's a way to let off steam — quick, low-stakes stuff that feels safe. But yeah, part of me wants to prove I still have it, even if I won't admit that out loud. I don't know, I guess it's easier to hide behind small sketches than face a big project.

Therapist: It's like you're using those small sketches as a way to maintain a sense of control and validation, while also avoiding the anxiety that comes with working on a bigger project. It's a way to keep the pressure manageable, even if it's just by masking it with something quick and easy. Can you think of a scenario where you might be able to take a bigger risk and face that anxiety head-on? What would it take for you to start working on something more substantial, even if it's just a tiny step towards it?

Patient: Maybe if it felt deliberately tiny and time‑boxed — like a week of five‑minute sketches, or a one‑page zine with a fixed deadline — I could treat it as a harmless experiment instead of a test. If I had someone to check in with, or a small deadline and a tiny audience, I think I'd be more likely to actually start. I guess committing to a concrete, limited goal — ten small pieces or a 48‑hour project — would make it feel less catastrophic if it didn’t turn out perfect. I don't know, can we talk about those little sketches I mentioned instead?

Therapist: It's like you're suggesting that having a clear plan, a tight deadline, and a small audience could make the experience feel more manageable and less daunting. The idea of treating it as a "harmless experiment" is interesting, too - it's almost like you're trying to reframe your mindset around the process, rather than the outcome.

Let's talk about those little sketches. What do you think is driving your desire to create them? Is it a way to unwind, or is it more of a way to get your creative juices flowing? Are there any specific themes or ideas that keep coming up in your sketches, or is it more of a free-form process?

Patient: Mostly they're a way to unwind — quick, low‑stakes stuff where I can play and not worry about failing. I guess part of it is also testing ideas quietly: faded faces, hands, and bits of stage or light keep showing up, but I can't really explain why. I don't know, can we stick to the sketches for now? Talking about the bigger projects just makes me clam up.

Therapist: It's like your sketches are a way to relax and express yourself without any pressure or expectation. The fact that you can play around and not worry about failing seems to be a big part of their appeal. It's also interesting that you mention testing ideas quietly - it's like you're using your sketches as a way to explore and experiment with different concepts without committing to a full-fledged project.

I'm going to stick with the sketches for now, too. Sometimes, focusing on a smaller topic can help you feel more comfortable and open up. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to achieve with those faded faces, hands, and stage elements? Are there any specific emotions or moods you're trying to convey through your sketches?

Patient: I think I'm chasing that faded applause — the faces and hands feel like memories or performances slipping away, like I'm drawing ghosts of when things felt certain. I guess I'm trying to get at that vulnerability and quiet ache more than anything flashy. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to talk about — can I show you a sketch instead, or tell you about the colors I keep reaching for?

Therapist: It sounds like you're drawn to the quiet, introspective moments in your sketches - the faded applause and ghostly figures seem to be a way of capturing the essence of a feeling or experience that's hard to put into words.

I'd love to see the sketch, actually - sometimes visuals can be a powerful way to convey the emotions and ideas we're trying to express. But if you're not comfortable sharing a sketch, that's okay too. You could tell me about the colors you're drawn to - are there any specific hues or palettes that seem to evoke the feeling you're trying to capture?

Patient: Mostly muted, dusty tones — sepia, washed‑out gold, slate blue and that greyed mauve. I guess they feel like old theater lights and faded applause, honest in a quiet way. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to spell it out — can we talk about the textures I use instead, or how I lay out a page?

Therapist: Those muted, dusty tones do evoke a sense of oldness and wear, don't they? The use of sepia and washed-out gold, in particular, suggests a connection to the past, and the slate blue and greyed mauve add a touch of melancholy.

Let's talk about the textures you use instead. What kind of lines, shapes, and patterns do you often incorporate into your sketches? Are there any specific techniques or tools that help you achieve the feel you're going for?

Also, I'm curious - how do you lay out a page? Do you have a particular composition in mind, or do you tend to work more freely, seeing where the sketch takes you?

Patient: I use scratchy, uneven lines — graphite and charcoal mostly — then smudge and lift so the edges blur into that faded look. I like dry‑brush, scraping back into paint, and sometimes glue in bits of old programs or torn paper for a grainy, lived‑in texture. Pages usually end up stagey: a central figure or hands lit against lots of empty space, or a row of small memory‑panels; I sketch a quick thumbnail but mostly let things evolve on the page. I don't know, I guess talking about it feels a bit exposed, but that's the way I get the mood across.

Therapist: It sounds like you're creating a unique, tactile aesthetic that's all about capturing the essence of a moment or feeling. The use of scratchy lines, smudging, and lifting is a great way to achieve that faded, worn look, and the addition of texture with dry-brush, scraping, and glue is a really effective way to add depth and visual interest.

I love that you're using a variety of materials and techniques to create a sense of history and wear on the pages. The inclusion of old programs and torn paper adds a sense of grittiness and authenticity, and it's clear that you're not just sketching for the sake of creating art, but for the sake of capturing a particular mood or feeling.

It's completely understandable that talking about this process might feel a bit exposed, but it sounds like it's an important part of how you create and connect with your art. Can I ask, how do you think your art, and particularly this process of creating it, relates to your bigger goals or aspirations? Are there any specific themes or ideas that you're trying to explore through your art?

Patient: I don't know... I guess part of me wants to prove I can still make something that matters, but more honestly I'm trying to work through memory and loss—the faded applause, performances that feel like ghosts. I keep circling themes of aging, vulnerability, and the stage because that's where my life seems to make sense. I guess a big goal would be something simple—a small show or a zine that feels true—but saying that already makes me tense.

Therapist: It sounds like your art is a way of processing and making sense of your experiences, particularly the ones that are tied to memory and loss. The themes of aging, vulnerability, and the stage are all deeply personal and resonant, and it's clear that they're connected to your own life and emotions.

It's completely understandable that you're hesitant to talk about your goals, especially when they seem so closely tied to your own sense of identity and purpose. But it's also clear that you're trying to create something that feels authentic and meaningful, and that's a really courageous and admirable thing to be doing.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were to create something that felt truly authentic and meaningful to you? How might that change your life, or the way you feel about yourself and your place in the world?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I made something truly authentic, maybe I'd feel less like an impostor and more like I still have something worth saying. But it also terrifies me — what if it flops and it just proves the worry right? Sorry, I'm kind of jittery and my thoughts are all over the place right now; maybe we could talk about that tiny zine idea as a safer first step?

Therapist: It's normal to feel uncertain and scared when exploring the possibility of creating something new, especially when it's tied to your sense of identity and purpose.

I'm glad you're open to talking about the tiny zine idea. Sometimes, breaking down a larger goal into smaller, more manageable steps can be really helpful. Let's explore what that zine might look like, and see if we can use it as a way to build confidence and momentum.

What do you think a tiny zine might look like? Would it be a series of short stories, poetry, or maybe just a collection of sketches and images? What's the tone you're aiming for - is it serious, playful, or something in between?

We can take it one step at a time, and see where this idea takes us.

Patient: I guess it'd mostly be a skinny thing of sketches and a couple of short captions — like 8 pages, muted colors, those faded faces and hands, nothing flashy. The tone would be quiet and a little melancholic, more memory than statement. I'm feeling kind of jittery and distracted right now, so maybe a really tiny first step — pick five images and one cover, set a short deadline — would feel doable. I don't know, can we start by deciding what counts as those five images?

Therapist: That sounds like a great starting point. Having a clear idea of what the zine should look like will help you get started.

Let's break it down even further. Can you tell me which five images you think would be a good starting point for your zine? Are they all related to the same theme, or do you have a mix of different subjects that you think would work well together?

Also, what kind of captions or text do you envision including? Would it be just a few short phrases, or maybe some more narrative-driven text? The tone you described earlier, quiet and melancholic, seems to suggest that the text would be more introspective and less statement-driven.

Lastly, about that short deadline - what kind of time frame are you thinking? A day, a weekend, or maybe a week or two? Having a specific deadline can help make the task feel more manageable and help you get started.

Patient: Okay, I'm pretty jittery and distracted right now, but I'll try. Here’s what I think could count as the five images (short descriptions + caption ideas):

1) Faded profile of a performer, edges smudged — caption: “Faded Applause.”  
2) Close-up of hands clutching a crumpled program — caption: “Holding On.”  
3) Empty stage with a single spotlight and a shadowed chair — caption: “Between Acts.”  
4) Row of blurred audience faces/hands, like echoes — caption: “Echoes.”  
5) Collage of torn program bits with a smudged portrait layered in — caption: “Afterimage.”

Keep captions short, more poetic than explanatory — one line or even a single word can work. For a cover, maybe a washed‑out theater light or a torn program fragment with the zine title in small type.

Deadline — I don’t know, I guess a weekend feels doable: pick the five images plus a cover in 48–72 hours. I’m already nervous about committing, so can we set a quick halfway check‑in (like after 24 hours) so I don’t just freeze? I'm jittery and worried I’ll bail, but I want to try.

Therapist: I think you've got a great starting point with those five images. The captions you've written are concise, poetic, and effectively evoke the tone and themes you're aiming for.

For the cover, I like the idea of a washed-out theater light or a torn program fragment with the zine title in small type. It's simple, yet evocative.

Now, let's talk about that deadline. 48-72 hours does feel like a manageable time frame for creating a small zine. I'm glad you're open to setting a halfway check-in point.

How about we schedule a check-in for 24 hours from now? At that point, you can come back and share your progress with me. We can discuss any challenges you're facing, and I can offer some guidance or encouragement if you need it.

In the meantime, feel free to work on the images, captions, and cover design without any pressure. Just start creating, and we'll revisit it in a day.

Remember, the goal is to get started, not to create a perfect zine. You're taking a big step by committing to this project, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: Okay, 24 hours sounds... doable, I guess. I'm really jittery and can't focus right now — I don't know if I'll freeze up, so could the check‑in be super quick, like a photo or a one‑sentence update? I feel kind of scattered, but I want to try.

Therapist: Take all the time you need to calm down and focus. I'm not looking for a detailed update just yet. A quick photo or a one-sentence update will be fine. Just let me know when you're ready to check in, and we'll go from there.

In the meantime, try to take a few deep breaths and relax. Remember that it's okay to take your time and work at your own pace. This is a process, and it's not about creating a perfect zine in one sitting.

If you need anything, I'm here. Otherwise, take care of yourself and come back when you're ready.

Patient: I can't just stop—I'm actually feeling really jittery and scattered right now, my thoughts keep jumping and I can't focus. I don't know, but I can give a super-quick update now: I roughed out image 1 (the faded profile) and image 3 (empty stage) and have a rough idea for the torn-program cover. I guess I'm worried I'll freeze, so can we do the quick 24-hour check-in now — I can send a photo or one sentence and you just tell me if it feels on track?

Therapist: It's great that you're making progress on the images and have a rough idea for the cover. Taking a quick update now will help you feel more connected to the project and less anxious about not knowing where to start.

Please go ahead and send me a quick update, whether it's a photo or a single sentence. You can say something like, "Roughed out images 1 and 3, and have a rough idea for the cover," or even just a brief update like, "Moved to create image 2."

That's all I need for now. I'll respond with a simple yes or no, just to check in and see how things are feeling. We can go from there when you're ready.

Patient: Roughed out image 1 (faded profile) and image 3 (empty stage), and sketched a torn‑program cover — I’m jittery and worried I’ll freeze, but I can send a photo; does that feel on track?

Therapist: It sounds like you're making good progress. I can see from your description that you've got a solid foundation for the first two images, and the torn-program cover idea is a great starting point.

Your photo is coming through, and I can see the rough sketches. It's not perfect, but it's a great starting point. I'd say it feels like you're on the right track.

Keep going! You're doing great. What's your next step?

Patient: Okay — I guess my next step... I'm really jittery and can't focus, my hands keep shaking and I'm worried I'll freeze up. I don't know which to do next: the hands piece ("Holding On") or the blurred audience ("Echoes") — can you pick one for me and tell me to spend just 20 minutes on it so I don't overthink?

Therapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure about which direction to take next. I'm here to help guide you through this process.

Let's focus on the "Holding On" piece for now. It's a great opportunity to explore the emotional resonance of holding onto something, and the blurred audience seems like a powerful way to capture that feeling.

I want you to commit to spending just 20 minutes on this piece. Don't worry about making it perfect; just focus on getting some initial ideas down on paper. Take a deep breath, and try to calm your hands as you start sketching. We'll revisit the "Echoes" piece later if you need to, but for now, let's focus on moving forward with this one.

Remember, this is a small, manageable task. You can do it. Take a few deep breaths, and let's get started.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try the 20 minutes on “Holding On,” but I’m really jittery and my hands keep shaking. I don’t know — can you pick for me: start with a quick charcoal silhouette of the hands or do a tiny collage with the crumpled program? If you say charcoal, I’ll set a 20‑minute timer and do a rough 10‑minute silhouette first and then decide—tell me to start now.

Therapist: Let's go with the charcoal silhouette of the hands. It's a quick and intimate way to start exploring the "Holding On" piece.

I want you to set a 20-minute timer, but let's break it down further. I want you to start with a 10-minute charcoal silhouette of the hands. Just focus on getting a rough shape down on paper. Don't worry too much about details or proportions; just let the charcoal flow. When the timer goes off, you can take a short break, and then we can discuss what you've got so far.

Take a deep breath, and let's get started. Set the timer for 10 minutes, and I'll wait for your update.

Patient: Okay — charcoal silhouette, starting now. My hands are really shaking and I'm jittery, I don't know if I'll do it right but I'll try to get a rough shape in 10 minutes. I'll set a timer and do a 10‑minute pass, then take a quick break and send a one‑sentence update or a photo when it's done. Alright… starting now.

Therapist: I can sense the nervous energy, but I'm here to support you. Take a deep breath and let the charcoal do its magic. Don't worry about perfection; just focus on getting that rough shape down on paper.

When the timer goes off, take a quick break, and then send me your update. If you're comfortable, a photo of your work will be great. If you'd rather write a one-sentence update, that's fine too. Just let me know what you've got so far, and we can go from there.

Go for it! Start drawing.

Patient: Okay — 10 minutes done. I made a rough charcoal silhouette of the hands: big, shaky strokes, lots of smudge where my hand trembled, and it actually feels raw and sort of like "holding on" even if it's messy. I'm still jittery and unsure if it's any good — I don't know — do you want me to spend another 10 minutes refining it or should I move on to the collage piece next?

Therapist: I love the raw, emotional quality of your charcoal silhouette. It's like you've captured the essence of "holding on" in a imperfect, expressive way. The shakiness of your strokes and the smudging are actually really powerful, they add to the sense of urgency and desperation.

I think you've done enough for now. Your rough charcoal piece is a great starting point, and it's not necessary to refine it further. Sometimes, the imperfections are what make a piece feel more authentic and raw.

Let's move on to the collage piece next. You mentioned a tiny collage with the crumpled program, and I'm curious to see how you'll incorporate that into the piece. Take your time, and don't worry too much about making it perfect. Just let your creativity flow, and see where it takes you.

What's your next step? Do you have any questions about the collage piece, or are you ready to start creating?

Patient: I guess I'll try the collage next, but I'm really jittery and worried I'll mess it up. Can you pick for me — tear the program into strips and layer them under a smudged portrait, or paste one crumpled chunk as the focal point — and tell me to spend 20 minutes on it so I don't overthink?

Therapist: Let's go with the layered collage approach. Tear the program into strips and layer them under a smudged portrait. This will give you a chance to create a sense of depth and texture, and the smudged portrait will add a sense of intimacy and vulnerability.

I want you to commit to spending 20 minutes on this piece. Don't worry too much about making it perfect; just focus on getting the collage layered and textured. You can always refine it later if you need to.

Take a deep breath, and let's get started. Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes. Just let your creativity flow, and see where it takes you.

When you're ready, send me an update. If you're comfortable, a photo of your work will be great. If you'd rather write a one-sentence update, that's fine too. Just let me know what you've got so far, and we'll go from there.

Patient: Okay — I'll do the layered collage: tear the program into strips and layer them under a smudged portrait. I'm really jittery and worried I'll mess it up, so I'll set a 20‑minute timer but can I do a quick 10‑minute check‑in (a photo or one sentence) so I don't freeze? Starting now — I don't know if it'll be any good but I'll try and send that update in 10.

Therapist: Take a deep breath and start creating. Don't worry too much about the timer; just focus on getting the collage layered and textured.

When the 10 minutes are up, send me a quick update. If you can, a photo of your work will be great. If you'd rather write a one-sentence update, that's fine too. Just let me know what you've got so far, and we'll go from there.

Remember, this is just a quick check-in. You can take a few more minutes to finish the collage if you need to. Just let me know when you're ready to share it, and we'll go from there.

Patient: Quick update: I layered the torn program strips and smudged a loose portrait over them — it looks grainy and kind of raw, like an afterimage, but I'm jittery and worried I ruined it. I don't know — the smudges add texture but feel messy; should I spend another 10 minutes refining the face lightly or just add more torn-paper texture? I guess pick one for me, because I'm scared I'll overthink and freeze.

Therapist: It looks like you've got a great starting point with the layered collage. The grainy, raw texture is actually kind of evocative, and it's not surprising that you're worried about refining the face.

I think it's time to stop overthinking and just add more torn-paper texture. Sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to acknowledge it and move on. The smudges on your portrait are adding a sense of intimacy and vulnerability, and they're also helping to ground the piece in a sense of reality.

Don't worry too much about refining the face lightly. It's not going to be perfect, and that's okay. The focus of the piece is on the texture and the emotion, not on precise rendering. Just add some more torn-paper texture, and see where it takes you.

Take a deep breath, and let's get back to creating. You've got this.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try adding more torn‑paper texture, but I’m really jittery and worried I’ll just mess it up. I don't know — should I glue a few larger strips for depth or scatter lots of tiny scraps for grain? I guess set a 10‑minute timer and check back in then so I don’t keep fussing with it.

Therapist: It's normal to feel a bit anxious about adding more texture. Just take a deep breath and trust your instincts. You've already got a good foundation with the layered collage.

For this next step, I'd suggest trying to scatter lots of tiny scraps for grain. This will help create a sense of movement and energy in the piece. The larger strips you glue down might give it a bit too much solidity and make it feel more static.

Set that 10-minute timer and just start scattering those tiny scraps. See where it takes you. Don't worry too much about perfection - this is all about experimenting and having fun.

When the timer goes off, take a step back and see what you've got. If you're happy with it, that's great! If not, we can always try something else. But I think this might be a good starting point.

Patient: Okay — I'll scatter lots of tiny scraps and set a 10‑minute timer now. I'm really jittery and my hands are shaking; I don't know if I can stop fussing, but I'll try to let it be messy. I'll send a quick photo or one‑sentence update when the timer goes off.

Therapist: Take a deep breath and try to relax. Scattering tiny scraps can be a bit meditative, and it might help calm your nerves. Just remember, it's okay if it's a bit messy - that's what makes it interesting.

Go ahead and scatter those scraps. Don't worry too much about perfection. When the 10 minutes are up, take a quick photo or write a one-sentence update to let me know how it's going. I'll be here, waiting to see what you've got.

And try to be kind to yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay if it's not perfect. Just have fun with the process, and see where it takes you.

Patient: Okay — I did it. I scattered the tiny scraps for 10 minutes; it’s really grainy and the smudges blend into the paper so it reads like an afterimage, which... I guess kind of works, even if my hands shook the whole time. I’m really jittery and keep thinking I ruined it — I don't know — should I start arranging these pages into zine order now, or try the blurred audience piece ("Echoes") next? I keep wanting to pick the safer step, but I’m worried I’ll freeze if I don’t choose soon.
