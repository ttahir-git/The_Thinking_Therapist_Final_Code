--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been burying myself in work and studying since my loved one died because I can't sit with the grief. The moment I try to slow down my mind tells me it's a slippery slope — I feel like I'll stop being productive, fail my classes, lose my place, end up without any support and completely ruined, and that chain of events just feels inevitable. I know it sounds extreme, but picturing anything else feels unrealistic and I keep getting sucked into those stories.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the weight of your responsibilities and the fear of losing control. The pain of your loss seems to be fueling this cycle of work and avoidance, and you're wondering how to break free from it.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to slow down your mind? You mentioned it tells you it's a slippery slope – what exactly does that message sound like, and how does it make you feel in the moment?

Patient: It’s like a voice that lays out the whole catastrophe: “If you stop now you’ll fall behind, you’ll fail the course, you’ll lose your scholarships and your housing, people will see you as a failure, you’ll end up alone and ruined.” I get this tightness in my chest, my stomach flips, and I feel this urgent need to prove myself by doing more—so I just dive back into work to quiet it. I know it’s extreme, but when that story starts I can’t imagine any other outcome and I feel trapped by it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
That voice sounds like it's creating a sense of urgency and desperation, and it's making it hard for you to think clearly. It's like it's hijacking your mind and telling you that you have to keep going, no matter what.

It's interesting that you mention feeling trapped by that story. Do you feel like you're just following that voice because you don't know how to escape it, or is there a part of you that's hoping that by pushing through your pain, you can somehow prove the voice wrong and avoid the outcome it's predicting?

Patient: I think it's both, but mostly I'm trying to prove it wrong — like if I keep pushing, maybe I can stop the collapse it predicts. Even while I work I'm frantic, convinced any slip will definitely start that whole chain and I'm just buying time. When you suggest slowing down or other outcomes it feels naive and I can't picture how that wouldn't lead straight to disaster.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of responsibility to keep pushing forward, not just to avoid the outcome that the voice is predicting, but also to prove to yourself that you're capable of handling the pressure.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to imagine slowing down or taking a break? What are some of the thoughts that come up for you? Are you thinking about how you'll never catch up, or how you'll fail, or something else entirely?

Patient: When I try to slow down the first thing that pops up is “you missed a deadline” and then it’s this whole domino run — fail the exam, lose the scholarship, lose my housing, drop out, nobody will want to help me and I’ll be completely alone and ruined. My chest tightens, I start to sweat, and I get this frantic need to do more right away to stop it from starting. And honestly, when people say “take a break” it just sounds naive — I can’t picture how pausing wouldn’t trigger that whole collapse.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the fear of missing a deadline is triggering a cascade of catastrophic thoughts, and it's creating a huge amount of anxiety for you. It's like you're seeing a domino effect where one small event (missing a deadline) could lead to a huge chain reaction of failures and consequences.

Can I try to help you see things in a different way? What if, instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, we looked at it as a normal part of the process? Maybe missing a deadline isn't the end of the world, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or abilities. It's just a setback, and it's possible to recover from it. Would you be willing to explore that idea a bit further?

Patient: I get why you'd want me to try that, but when I actually try it I can't picture anything but the collapse — it feels naive to think a break wouldn't start that whole domino run. My chest tightens just imagining it, and I end up more frantic than before. I guess I'm willing to try talking it through, but I'm really skeptical and it's hard to imagine any outcome other than disaster.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to reframe your thinking in a more positive light is having a very real, immediate effect on your body and emotions. The tightness in your chest, the feeling of frustration, it's all very intense. It's like your mind is saying, "No, no, no, this can't be what we're going to do. We have to keep pushing, keep going."

Can I ask, what do you think would need to happen for you to start to see that maybe, just maybe, taking a break isn't the end of the world? What would need to change for you to feel like you're not just being naive, but like you're actually doing something that could help?

Patient: I guess I'd need ironclad guarantees — like every deadline officially extended, written proof my scholarship and housing are safe, and someone else in place to cover any responsibilities — plus real examples showing people took breaks and didn't collapse afterward. Even picturing all that makes my chest tighten and the voice screams that some small thing will still go wrong and it'll trigger the whole domino run, so I can't see myself letting go; it still feels naive. I'm willing to talk through specifics of what those guarantees would look like, but I'm really skeptical anything short of absolute certainty will calm me.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a sense of control and security, and without that, it's hard for you to consider taking a break. You want to see a clear plan in place, with concrete steps and guarantees that everything will be okay. You're not just talking about wanting to know that something is possible, you're talking about needing to see that it's inevitable.

Can I ask, what would it be like for you to have a conversation with someone who has taken a break and come out the other side? Maybe someone who has a similar background and is facing similar challenges? Would it be helpful to talk to someone who could offer a different perspective, or maybe even just someone who could listen to your concerns and offer some reassurance?

Patient: Maybe hearing someone else's story might help a tiny bit, but I doubt it — I'd immediately think their situation was different and that some tiny thing I can't control would still set off the whole collapse. Even picturing someone saying "it worked out" makes my chest tighten and I feel like I'm fooling myself. If we did bring someone in, they'd have to have been in my exact shoes — same scholarship, housing, timing — otherwise I won't believe them.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're skeptical that anyone else's story could ever be similar enough to your own to be helpful. You're worried that their experience would be somehow tainted by differences, and that their story wouldn't be able to give you the same reassurance that you need.

Can I ask, what do you think it is about your own situation that makes it so unique? Is it the specific circumstances of your scholarship, or the timing of your deadlines? Or is it something else entirely? Trying to understand what's driving your skepticism might help us explore other options together.

Patient: I think it feels unique because everything is razor-thin: my scholarship demands a near-perfect GPA and proof of progress, on-campus housing is tied to that funding, and my deadlines all overlap so one missed thing could technically trigger review. The person who died was my safety net—no family to step in—so I can't imagine a small slip not turning into eviction, losing funding, and being completely stranded. I know that sounds like doom-mongering, but my mind insists those exact dominoes are set up and will definitely fall, which is why I can't accept reassurances from other people's stories.

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a huge amount of pressure and responsibility, with everything hanging in the balance. The scholarship, housing, and deadlines are all interlocking, and the stakes are extremely high. It's no wonder you're feeling anxious and uncertain.

It's also clear that the loss of your safety net has been a huge blow, and that you're struggling to cope with the weight of responsibility on your own. It's not about being a "doom-monger," but rather about your mind trying to protect you from the potential consequences of not meeting your obligations.

Can I try to help you explore some of these feelings in a different way? Instead of focusing on the specific dominoes that might fall, let's try to think about what it would be like to have a sense of control and agency in your life. How would that feel? What would it mean to be able to make decisions that don't feel like they're going to lead to disaster?

Patient: I guess control would feel like absolute guarantees—every deadline officially moved, my scholarship and housing locked in writing—because otherwise my mind just says one slip will start the whole collapse. Right now I can't actually imagine making choices without that certainty; my chest tightens, my thoughts race all over the place, and I get so distracted I just bury myself in work to steady it. I know it sounds extreme, but I really can't see any other outcome than disaster, so it's hard to trust that taking a different path wouldn't ruin me.


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like having control and certainty would be the only thing that could calm your mind and give you a sense of stability. You're not just looking for reassurance, but a guarantee that everything will be okay. And right now, that feeling of uncertainty is so overwhelming that it's driving you to distract yourself with work.

It's understandable that you can't imagine making choices without that certainty, given the way your mind is wired. It's like you're seeing a map of potential failure, and that's making it hard for you to take any steps without feeling like you're walking into a minefield.

Can I try to help you explore this idea of absolute guarantees a bit further? What would it mean to have those guarantees in place? Would it change the way you feel about yourself, your choices, and your future?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how talking about guarantees actually helps—what would that even change in the moment? For me "guarantees" would have to look like stamped, dated extensions on every deadline, an official email from the scholarship office saying my funding is locked for the semester, housing administration's signed amendment to the lease, a faculty member officially assigned to cover any missed obligations, and an emergency fund or backup plan for any tiny administrative hiccup. Even listing all that makes my chest tighten because my mind immediately imagines one clerk losing an email or one signature missing and then the whole domino run starts anyway, so I still can't picture how that would let me slow down.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a specific, tangible set of guarantees that would alleviate your anxiety. You're talking about concrete, official documentation and arrangements that would provide a sense of security and control.

It's like you're saying that even with all those guarantees in place, your mind is still wired to imagine the worst-case scenario. You're seeing the dominoes falling, and you can't escape the feeling that even with all the planning and precautions, disaster could still strike.

Can I try to ask a different question? Instead of focusing on the guarantees themselves, what if we looked at the underlying desire behind your need for guarantees? What is it about having control and certainty that feels so important to you? Is it about feeling safe, or secure, or accomplished?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how does talking about the desire actually stop the dominoes I see? For me it's less about pride and more about survival: certainty feels like keeping my housing, my scholarship, and not ending up completely alone and ruined. Even naming it as "safety" makes my chest tighten because my brain immediately scripts the exact way that'll fail, so I can't picture feeling anything but terrified unless there's ironclad proof.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to reframe your desire for certainty, but it's not just a matter of talking about it. You're saying that even the act of discussing your desire for safety makes you feel anxious, because your mind starts to imagine all the ways it could fail.

It's like you're trapped in a loop where your brain is constantly predicting the worst-case scenario, and no amount of reassurance or planning can stop it. You're not just worried about the future, you're living in the present with a constant sense of dread.

Can I try to ask a question that might be a bit more direct? What if, instead of trying to change your thoughts or feelings, we focused on helping you develop a sense of self-compassion? What if we explored ways to help you be kinder to yourself, even when you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how would being kinder to myself stop the dominoes? If I try to be compassionate I worry I'll relax even a little, miss something, and then it's the same chain: missed deadline, scholarship review, eviction, totally ruined. Just picturing that makes my chest squeeze and I can't see how self-kindness wouldn't be the thing that starts it.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a sense of self-punishment, where being kind to yourself would be perceived as a form of escape or a lack of responsibility. You're worried that if you're compassionate, you'll let your guard down and the dominoes will start falling.

It's like you're trapped in a cycle where you feel like you need to be harsh with yourself to stay vigilant, but that's exactly what's causing you more anxiety. You're not just worried about the future, you're also worried about not being able to handle the present moment.

Can I try to ask a question that might help us break this cycle? What if, instead of being kind to yourself, we explored ways to help you reframe your relationship with your anxiety? What if we looked at it as a signal that something is important, rather than a source of fear and dread?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is reframing anxiety as a signal supposed to help when the signal already tells me exactly what's at stake? If I treat it as "important" instead of fear, I worry it'll just confirm I need to do even more; the moment I ease up a bit the dominoes start—miss a deadline, fail an exam, scholarship gone, housing reviewed, eviction, no one to step in, totally ruined—and I can't un-see that. I'm jittery and distracted right now, my chest's tight, and every suggestion to reinterpret the panic feels like another way I could accidentally let something slip and trigger the whole collapse.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a sense of overwhelm and desperation, like you're trying to hold everything together with a thread, and every suggestion to breathe or relax feels like it could snap that thread and send everything crashing down.

In this moment, it's not about reframing your anxiety as a signal or a source of importance. It's about survival. You're not thinking about your anxiety as a problem to be solved; you're thinking about it as a threat to your very existence.

Can I try to acknowledge that, for a moment? You're not just worried about your anxiety; you're worried about losing everything that matters. Is that okay to say?

Patient: Yeah — you can say that. It really does feel like survival: if I ease up even a little the dominoes will start and I'll be completely ruined. My chest's tight, I'm jittery, and the only thing that calms me even briefly is diving back into work because otherwise I can't stop picturing eviction, loss of funding, total isolation. I don't know what to do right now — how do I stop the panic from taking over long enough to even try something different?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling completely consumed by the panic, and it's making it hard for you to even think about doing anything else. Your chest is tight, you're jittery, and the only thing that's giving you any sense of calm is the familiar distraction of work.

In this moment, it's not about trying to change your thoughts or feelings; it's about just getting through the next moment without losing yourself completely to the panic. You're not thinking about how to "stop the panic"; you're just trying to survive it.

Can I try to help you just get through the next moment? Is there anything, even small, that you can do right now to give yourself a tiny bit of space to breathe? It doesn't have to be anything big; it could just be taking a deep breath, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or even just acknowledging that you're still here.

Patient: I can try one deep breath, but I'm not sure it'll help — the moment I slow down this stupid memory of messing up pops up and the voice screams that it's already started and I'm ruined. My chest's tight and my hands are shaking; even trying to feel my feet on the floor feels thin because I keep replaying the dominoes. Fine — I'll try the breath, but I don't know if it will change anything.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like even taking a deep breath feels like a risk, because you're worried that the memory will trigger the panic again. Your body is already on high alert, and the thought of slowing down is making it worse.

Can I try to help you see this in a different way? Instead of thinking about the breath itself, what if we focus on the sensation of your body relaxing just a little bit? It doesn't have to be a full relaxation, just a tiny bit of letting go. Can you try to notice where in your body you feel the least amount of tension, and then just... let that spot be for a moment? It's not about changing anything, it's just about giving yourself a tiny bit of space to breathe.

Patient: Okay — the least tense spot is my fingers; they're still trembling but a little looser than my chest. I try to let that small looseness be, but this stupid memory of screwing up bubbles up and then the voice is already rattling the dominoes — miss a deadline, scholarship gone, housing reviewed, totally ruined — and I feel ashamed and frantic. I can try to hold onto the tiny relief in my hand, but I'm just waiting for it to slip and I don't know how to stop myself from diving back into work to tamp it down.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're able to find a tiny bit of release in your fingers, but it's quickly overshadowed by the familiar panic. The voice is already starting to whisper its negative thoughts, and you're feeling ashamed and frantic.

Can I try to help you see this as a small victory? You were able to notice the tension in your fingers and even let it go for a moment. That's something, no matter how small. It's like you're holding onto a tiny spark of hope, and it's worth keeping, even if it's hard to see right now.

I want to ask you something: what if, instead of trying to "stop" the panic or the thoughts, we focus on holding onto that tiny spark of hope? What if we try to nurture it, even if it's just for a moment? It might be enough to give you a glimmer of perspective, a chance to see that you're not alone, and that there might be a way forward, even if it's not clear right now.

Patient: Maybe I can try to hold that tiny spark, but I don't really trust it — the second I let it breathe that memory of screwing up pops up and the voice is already shouting the whole domino run: missed deadline, scholarship gone, eviction, totally ruined, and I feel ashamed like I deserve it. My chest's tight and my hands are shaking, so if we're going to try this I need something concrete and tiny I can do right now — like a 30–60 second grounding or a checklist item — because vague encouragement just makes me panic more. Can you tell me one specific, short thing to do with me now, and stay with me while I try it?

I can see that you're looking for a concrete and tangible way to try to hold onto that tiny spark of hope. I'm willing to do that with you.

Can you stay with me and literally count me through one very short thing — like pressing my palms together and squeezing for 10 seconds — slowly: count out loud and tell me when to press, hold, and release?
