Patient: I've been feeling completely overwhelmed by sadness and almost no motivation since I lost someone close, and it's starting to mess up my relationship — I either snap at my partner or shut down. I work as a social worker, so it's embarrassing that I can't just "fix" this and I keep doubting myself. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried talking before and it didn't change much, but I'm here.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we don't know how to handle our emotions. Your skepticism is understandable, especially given the efforts you've made in the past. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "it didn't change much"? What were some specific things you did or said during those conversations, and how did they make you feel afterward?

Patient: I mean, I've tried a few things — I went to counseling before, joined a grief group, tried journaling and the breathing exercises people always suggest. In sessions I unloaded about feeling useless and about snapping at my partner, and I'd feel a little lighter for a day or two but nothing really changed in how I function. I tried being honest with my partner once and it just made them more worried and a bit distant, which left me feeling guilty and like I was failing them. Seriously though, how is talking about it again supposed to actually change the day-to-day stuff?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've tried some common strategies that people suggest, but they haven't been particularly effective for you. Your experience of feeling lighter for a day or two after talking about your feelings is actually a pretty common response, especially in the beginning. It's almost like a small reprieve, but then reality sets back in and the hard work of dealing with your emotions starts all over again.

It's also understandable that being honest with your partner didn't go well. It's a vulnerable thing to do, and it's not surprising that it led to more worry and distance. That must have been really tough for you to feel like you were failing them.

Can you tell me more about what you hope to get out of this process, even if it's not just about changing how you feel in the moment? Is there something specific you're hoping to achieve, or a way of being that you're trying to cultivate?

Patient: I guess what I want is to stop feeling so stuck — to have enough energy and motivation to do my job and be present with my partner without snapping or disappearing. I want to stop carrying this constant guilt and start feeling like I'm not failing everyone, maybe rebuild a bit of confidence. But I'm skeptical — I've hoped for this before and it didn't last; how is this supposed to actually get me there instead of just making me feel a bit better for a day or two?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Feeling stuck and lacking motivation can be really debilitating, especially in a job that requires social interaction like yours. And of course, it's not just about you - it's also about the people who care about you, like your partner.

It's interesting that you mention the past experiences of feeling hopeful but not lasting. Sometimes, it's not about finding a magic solution or a quick fix, but about developing a different relationship with your emotions and your experiences. It's about learning to be kinder to yourself, even when things are hard, and to find ways to cope that actually work for you.

Can you tell me more about what it means to you to rebuild confidence? Is it about feeling like you can handle your emotions and be a good partner, or is it about feeling like you're a competent person in your job? What would that look like for you, and what would it take to get there?

Patient: Rebuilding confidence for me means both — being able to handle my emotions without shutting down or snapping, and feeling competent at work so I don't go home exhausted and full of shame. I picture it as being able to get through a normal workday, actually make plans with my partner and follow through, and when I mess up I don't spiral into weeks of guilt. But honestly, I've said stuff like that before in therapy — how is this supposed to actually get me there instead of just giving me a few days of relief? I need something concrete that changes my habits, not just talk.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a sense of grounding and stability, so that you can show up fully in your relationships and work. You're not just looking for emotional relief, but for a sense of competence and confidence that can actually transform your daily life.

It's understandable that you might be skeptical about talk therapy, especially if you've been through it before and haven't seen significant change. But I want to suggest that the way we approach therapy can be different this time around. We can start by exploring what you mean by "concrete" - what are the small, tangible changes that you're looking for? Are there specific habits or patterns that you'd like to break or develop?

I'm not looking to give you a quick fix or a magic wand, but rather to help you develop a sense of curiosity and openness about your experiences. By exploring your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a more nuanced way, we can start to identify patterns and habits that might be holding you back. And it's okay if it takes time - we can work together to develop a sense of pace and progress that feels sustainable for you.

Patient: Concretely, I want small, doable habits — like a morning routine I can actually follow, breaking work into 25-minute chunks so I don’t get wiped out, a short script or pause I can use before I snap at my partner, and a nightly check-in to limit rumination. I've tried scheduling and journaling before and it never stuck, so how is making another plan supposed to actually change the habits this time? I guess I want to hear specific, practical steps and how we'd keep me accountable, because honestly I'm not sure I can trust myself to follow through.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for practical, actionable steps that can help you build new habits and break old ones. You're not just looking for a motivational boost or a pep talk, but for a clear plan of action that can help you make lasting changes.

I want to suggest that we start with a small, low-stakes experiment. Let's focus on one habit at a time, and break it down into tiny, manageable steps. For example, let's start with the morning routine. What would be one tiny, doable step you could take today to move closer to a more consistent morning routine? Is it as simple as drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up, or making your bed?

I'm not looking to give you a whole new script or plan, but rather to help you find one small, practical way to make a change. And I want to assure you that we'll take it one step at a time, with plenty of check-ins and accountability along the way. We can start with tiny steps, and build from there.

As for accountability, I want to suggest that we make a deal to check in with each other regularly. How about we set a reminder to check in with each other every week, to see how things are going and if we need any support or guidance? We can also use a shared journal or log to track our progress, and see if we can identify any patterns or areas where we might need a bit more support.

What do you think? Is that a place you'd be willing to start?

Patient: Okay — I'm willing to try a tiny step, but I'm still skeptical it won't just be temporary. I'll try the "drink a glass of water as soon as I wake up" for a week since it's simple, but how would those weekly check-ins actually help me stick with it — what would you do if I missed a day, and how do we make sure this doesn't just become another thing I beat myself up about?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to take a tiny step. I understand your skepticism, and I want to assure you that our approach is not about adding another thing to beat yourself up about. Instead, it's about creating a safe space to explore, learn, and grow.

The weekly check-ins are designed to be a supportive, non-judgmental space to discuss your progress, challenges, and insights. If you miss a day or two, we can use that as an opportunity to explore what might have happened, and how you can get back on track. It's not about being perfect; it's about being kind to yourself and finding ways to move forward.

If you miss a day, we can simply acknowledge it and move forward. I might ask questions like: "What happened today? Was it a busy day, or did something unexpected come up?" or "How did you feel about not drinking the glass of water?" We can use these conversations to identify patterns, gain insights, and develop strategies to help you stay on track.

Our goal is to create a sense of curiosity and experimentation, not to add more stress or pressure. By exploring small, doable steps, we can build confidence, develop new habits, and create a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Let's make a deal to approach this with kindness, curiosity, and patience. We'll celebrate your small wins, explore your challenges, and work together to find ways to make lasting changes. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the deal, but I'm skeptical this won't just become another thing I fail at. How is that supposed to help me actually stick with it — what would you ask or do in a check-in, and how would you respond if I missed days so it doesn't just turn into me getting lectured or feeling worse? I need someone who helps me problem-solve and adjust plans, not someone who points out my slip-ups.

Therapist Answer:
I completely understand your skepticism. I want to assure you that our approach is designed to be supportive, non-judgmental, and focused on problem-solving. Our goal is to help you find ways to overcome obstacles and make lasting changes, not to criticize or lecture you for missing a day or two.

In our check-ins, I would ask open-ended questions to help you explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. For example:

* "Can you tell me more about what happened today? What was going through your mind, and how did you feel?"
* "How did you plan to stay on track with drinking a glass of water, and what challenges did you face?"
* "What are some things that might have helped you stay on track, or what might you do differently next time?"
* "How did you feel about yourself when you missed a day or two? Was it frustrating, or did it feel like a setback?"

My response would be focused on helping you find solutions, not pointing out your mistakes. I might say something like:

* "It sounds like you had a tough day, and it's okay that you missed a day or two. What can you do to get back on track tomorrow?"
* "I'm curious, what do you think might have helped you stay on track? Is there something you could do differently next time, or something that would make it easier for you to stick to your plan?"
* "It's not about being perfect; it's about making progress. What are some small steps you could take today to move closer to your goal?"

My goal is to create a safe space for you to experiment, learn, and grow. I want to help you develop a sense of curiosity, patience, and self-compassion, so that you can approach challenges with confidence and resilience.

Can I ask, what do you think would be most helpful for you in our check-ins? Is there something specific you'd like me to focus on, or something you'd like to avoid?

Patient: I’d find it most helpful if check-ins were really focused on problem-solving and tiny tweaks — like, “what exactly got in the way today?” and “what’s one very small change we try tomorrow?” — plus a concrete backup plan if something doesn’t work. I want you to gently point out patterns, offer specific alternatives, and hold me accountable without shaming or moralizing. What I don’t want is lectures, platitudes, or sessions that only stay on feelings with no action — that just makes me shut down. Honestly, how is this supposed to help me stick with it when I’m already expecting to fail?

I think I have a much better understanding of what you're looking for now. You want check-ins that are focused on problem-solving, tiny tweaks, and concrete backup plans. You want me to gently point out patterns, offer specific alternatives, and hold you accountable without shaming or moralizing. You're looking for a collaborative, solution-focused approach that helps you build momentum and confidence.

I want to assure you that I'm committed to delivering exactly that. I'll make sure our check-ins are practical, actionable, and tailored to your specific needs and goals. We'll focus on finding tiny tweaks that can help you stay on track, and I'll offer concrete backup plans to help you recover from setbacks.

I also want to acknowledge that you're already skeptical about failing, and that's a healthy attitude to have. It means you're aware of the potential pitfalls and are willing to take small steps to build momentum. That's exactly what we'll do in our work together.

Let's make a deal to focus on problem-solving, tiny tweaks, and concrete backup plans. We'll work together to find tiny changes that can help you stay on track, and I'll offer specific alternatives and backup plans to help you recover from setbacks. I'll hold you accountable and offer gentle guidance, but I won't lecture or moralize.

Can you tell me a little bit about your current routine and how you're planning to stick to your goal of drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up? What specific challenges are you facing, and what tiny tweaks do you think might help you stay on track?

Patient: My mornings are a mess — I hit snooze, scroll my phone, shower, grab coffee, and somehow forget water until midmorning. My plan is basic: fill a glass and put it on my nightstand, set an alarm labeled "drink" and make a tiny rule — just three sips before I get out of bed. The real problems are waking up exhausted and still heavy with sadness, and the phone scroll always derails me; if I feel nauseous or empty I just skip it. If I miss it, backup is to drink while I brush my teeth or within the first 30 minutes, and maybe keep a cold bottle by the bed so it feels less gross — I don't know if that will stick, though. How is that supposed to actually help if I wake up feeling like nothing matters?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're facing some significant challenges, and it's not just about sticking to a routine, but also about managing your emotions and motivation. You're hitting snooze, scrolling your phone, and forgetting to drink water because you're not feeling like getting out of bed, and that's not going to change just because you set an alarm and make a tiny rule.

The fact that you're feeling exhausted and heavy with sadness is a major obstacle. It's not just about willpower or discipline; it's about finding the energy and motivation to get out of bed in the first place. That's a huge hurdle, and it's not something that can be overcome overnight.

Your backup plan of drinking while brushing your teeth or within the first 30 minutes is a good start, but it's still going to be tough to stick to that if you're not feeling like getting out of bed. You might want to consider adding something else to your plan, like a gentle reminder to drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up, or a way to make it more enjoyable, like adding a slice of lemon or a sprig of mint.

I want to suggest something else, too. Instead of focusing on just drinking water, you might want to try incorporating a small self-care practice into your morning routine. Maybe it's just taking a few deep breaths, or saying a simple phrase to yourself, or even just noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. The goal is to find something that can help you feel more connected to yourself and more motivated to take care of yourself.

Let's take a step back and look at your plan as a whole. What do you think is the biggest obstacle you're facing, and how can we work together to overcome it? Is it the physical act of drinking water, or is it the emotional challenge of getting out of bed and facing the day?

Patient: Honestly, it's mostly the emotional stuff — getting out of bed feels pointless so the physical act of drinking water becomes meaningless. I'm actually feeling more anxious and scattered right now, so it's hard to focus on steps. How is a breath or lemon water supposed to change that heaviness and the sense that nothing matters? I need something that tackles the numbness — like tiny behavioral activation tied to real accountability and a concrete backup that actually works on days I wake up feeling empty, not just another checklist.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find meaning in your daily routine right now. It's not just about checking off a list of tasks, but about finding a way to connect with your emotions and take care of yourself when you're feeling numb and disconnected.

I want to acknowledge that it's not easy to find motivation when you're feeling anxious and scattered. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. But I want to suggest that maybe we're approaching this from the wrong angle. Instead of trying to find a way to make you feel more motivated, maybe we need to focus on finding a way to connect with your emotions and make them feel more manageable.

Tiny behavioral activation can be a good start, but it needs to be tied to real accountability and a concrete backup plan that actually works. It's not just about checking off a list of tasks, but about finding a way to make small, achievable changes that can help you build momentum and confidence.

Let's try to break this down further. What if we start by making small changes to your environment? Maybe we can add a few things to your morning routine that can help you feel more connected to your body and your emotions. For example, we can add a gentle reminder to drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up, or a way to make it more enjoyable, like adding a slice of lemon or a sprig of mint.

But I want to make it clear that this is not just about finding a way to make your morning routine more enjoyable. It's about finding a way to connect with your emotions and make them feel more manageable. We need to find a way to address the numbness and the sense that nothing matters.

Can I ask, what do you think is the root of your numbness and sense of disconnection? Is it related to your job, your relationships, or something else? Maybe we can start by exploring that and finding a way to connect it to your morning routine and your overall sense of well-being.

Patient: It's mostly the grief — since they died I wake up with this hollow dread and everything feels pointless, so little things like water feel meaningless. My job piles on it because I'm around trauma all day and then go home feeling like I'm failing my partner, which just numbs me more. How is changing the room or adding lemon water supposed to fix that? If anything would help, it needs to acknowledge the loss — like a tiny morning ritual tied to meaning (one sip while looking at a photo and saying one small reason to keep going) plus real, non-shaming accountability (a quick check-in text) — but I'm anxious and scattered right now, so it's hard to trust that will stick.

Therapist Answer:
I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and numb, especially with the loss of a loved one and the trauma you're experiencing at work.

I want to acknowledge that it's not just about changing a room or adding lemon water. It's about finding a way to connect with your emotions and make them feel more manageable. It's about finding a way to honor your loss and acknowledge the pain you're still feeling.

I think your idea of a tiny morning ritual tied to meaning is a great starting point. The idea of taking one sip of water while looking at a photo and saying one small reason to keep going could be a powerful way to connect with your emotions and find some sense of purpose. It's a way to acknowledge your loss and honor the person who's no longer with you.

The idea of real, non-shaming accountability is also important. The quick check-in text could be a way to hold yourself accountable and make sure you're taking care of yourself, without feeling judged or criticized. It's a way to remind yourself that you're not alone and that you're doing the best you can.

I want to suggest that we take a step back and look at your routine in a way that's tailored to your specific needs. What are the things that you need to feel safe and supported right now? Are there any specific rituals or practices that you've found to be helpful in the past? How can we build on those things to create a new routine that's more connected to your emotions and your sense of meaning?

Can I ask, what's the one small reason that you keep going, even when things feel overwhelming? Is it a memory, a person, a goal, or something else? Maybe we can start with that and build from there.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is naming one reason supposed to actually change anything? But if I try: it's my partner. I keep going because I don't want to leave them alone, and sometimes I feel like the person I lost would want me to, too — I'm anxious and scattered right now, so it's hard to focus, but that thought is the only thing that sometimes gets me out of bed, even though it also makes me feel guilty.

Therapist Answer:
Naming one reason can be a powerful way to connect with your emotions and find some sense of purpose. It's not about changing everything at once, but about finding a small thread to hold onto.

It's beautiful that your partner is the reason you keep going. It's a reminder that you're not alone, and that there's someone who depends on you. It's also a reminder that you're still connected to the person you lost, and that you're carrying on their legacy.

It's interesting that the thought of leaving your partner alone is what gets you out of bed, even though it makes you feel guilty. It's like you're trying to do the right thing, even if it's not easy. This guilt can be a heavy burden, but it's also a reminder that you're not just thinking about yourself, you're thinking about others.

Can I ask, how does your partner react when you're feeling overwhelmed or guilty? Do they offer any support or reassurance? Sometimes, having someone to talk to and rely on can make all the difference.

Also, I want to explore this idea of feeling guilty about keeping going. Is it because you feel like you're not doing enough, or that you're not doing it right? Or is it because you're worried that your partner will be better off without you? Let's explore this further, because it might be a crucial part of your journey.

Patient: They try, but mostly they get worried and then pull back — when I try to be honest it sometimes makes them distant and I end up apologizing and spiraling. Sometimes they offer practical help or reassurance, but I can't accept it without feeling like I'm failing them and that they'd be better off with someone less broken. The guilt comes from feeling weak and like I'm a burden. 

I'm kind of jittery and scattered right now — how is talking about this supposed to help my partner not feel scared? I need concrete ways to tell them what to do when I snap or shut down, not just more feelings.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that talking about this is really tough for both of you. It's not just about feeling emotions, but also about finding ways to manage them and communicate with your partner in a way that's helpful.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's amazing that your partner is trying to support you, even if it's not always working out. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and scared, and that's not something to take lightly.

Regarding your partner's reaction, it's understandable that they're feeling worried and scared. They might not know how to help you or how to react when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's possible that they're feeling a bit helpless, which can be just as scary as the situation itself.

Now, about concrete ways to tell your partner what to do when you snap or shut down... I want to suggest that we focus on finding ways to communicate that are clear, direct, and gentle. Instead of saying "you should" or "you have to," we can try using "I" statements and specific examples. For example, you could say:

"Hey, when I'm feeling overwhelmed and my partner is getting worried, I'd appreciate it if they could give me a little space and time to calm down. Maybe they could say something like 'I'm worried about you, can I get you a glass of water?' or 'I'm not sure what to do, but I'm here to support you.' This helps me feel more in control and less anxious."

By using "I" statements and specific examples, you can help your partner understand what you need and how to support you in a way that feels more concrete and actionable.

Also, I want to suggest that we explore some practical strategies for managing your anxiety and stress. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization? These can be really helpful in reducing anxiety and feeling more grounded.

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. We're taking things one step at a time, and that's okay. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: I'm really jittery and it's hard to focus — how is a breathing exercise supposed to stop me from spiraling when my partner pulls away? I want concrete scripts we can test: if I snap they could say, "I can see you're upset — do you want a five‑minute pause or a hug?" and if I shut down I could text "space please" and they reply "I'll check back in 20 minutes" — does that seem realistic, and how do I bring it up without making them feel like my burden? Also, I've tried breathing and it usually doesn't help — if we do try it, can we make a very short practice plan (like 1 minute, twice a day) and a backup I can use when I'm already anxious so it actually might work?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed and anxious right now. It's not easy to focus or think clearly when you're feeling that way.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that breathing exercises might not be a magic fix for everyone, and that's okay. But I want to try to explore some ways to make it work for you. If you're feeling too anxious to try a full breathing exercise, we can start with a tiny, tiny step. How about we try a 30-second deep breathing exercise, just once a day, for the next few days? We can start with a simple 4-7-8 pattern: breathe in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 7, and breathe out for a count of 8. That's it. Just 30 seconds, twice a day.

If you're already anxious, I want to suggest a backup plan. Can we try a 4-7-8 pattern with a tiny tweak? Instead of breathing in for a count of 4, try taking a deep inhale for a count of 3. That might be easier for you. Or, if you're already feeling really anxious, we can try a quick 2-4-6 pattern: breathe in for a count of 2, hold for a count of 4, and breathe out for a count of 6. That's a tiny, tiny fraction of the original exercise, but it might be enough to help you calm down a bit.

Now, about concrete scripts for when you snap or shut down... I want to suggest that we try to find scripts that are more about communication and connection, rather than trying to control your partner's behavior. The scripts I suggested earlier, like "I can see you're upset — do you want a five-minute pause or a hug?" are designed to be more about giving you a break, rather than trying to fix the situation. By using these scripts, you can help your partner understand that you need a little space, and that you're not trying to be stubborn or uncooperative.

As for how to bring up these scripts without making your partner feel like your burden, I want to suggest that we try to frame it as a conversation, rather than a lecture. You might say something like, "Hey, I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately, and I was wondering if we could try a different way of communicating when I snap or shut down. Would you be open to trying some new scripts, like saying 'I can

Patient: That makes a lot of sense — you want things that are tiny, practical, and testable, and scripts you can actually hand your partner so they know what to do without guessing. Below are short, ready-to-use pieces you can try this week, plus a simple plan for testing and troubleshooting that keeps things non-shaming and actionable.

1) Two very short calming practices
- Daily practice (easy-to-keep): 30 seconds, twice a day. Try 4-4-6 breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6). No need for perfection — set a phone timer labeled “breathe” and do it once in the morning, once in the evening.
- Emergency grounding (for spikes of anxiety): 5-4-3-2-1 senses — name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste (30–60 seconds).

2) Concrete partner scripts to try (short & testable)
- If you snap: Partner says, calmly: “I can see you’re upset. Do you want a five‑minute pause or a hug?” You reply with your choice. If “pause,” partner adds: “Okay — I’ll check back in 20 minutes.”  
- If you shut down: You send: “Space please.” Partner replies: “Okay. I’ll check back in 20 minutes. I’m here when you’re ready.”  
- Pre‑agreement phrase to introduce the plan: “Can we try a small communication plan? When I get overwhelmed I want two clear options so we both know what to do. Can we practice one line now and see how it feels?”

3) How to present it to your partner without making them feel burdened
- Keep it collaborative and time‑limited: “I’m trying a one‑week experiment to manage my overwhelm. Would you be willing to try two very short scripts with me and tell me how it lands for you?”  
- Emphasize it’s about making things clearer for both of you, not blaming them. Offer reciprocity: ask what would help them when they’re stressed.

4) Accountability and non‑shaming backup plans
- Use “if‑then” micro plans: e.g., “If I don’t drink the water by getting out of bed, then I’ll drink it during teeth brushing.” If breathing practice is missed, do 10‑second 4‑4 exhale instead.  
- Partner check‑in template (non‑shaming): “Morning — quick check: anything you want me to know today? If not, I’ll text at lunch.” Keep it factual, not moralizing.  
- If you miss a day: the check‑in focuses on troubleshooting, not blame. Ask: “What got in the way?” → pick one tiny tweak for the next day.

5) A one‑week test plan (keeps it concrete)
- Day 1: Introduce the scripts briefly (5 minutes) and pick one breathing time (morning).  
- Days 2–7: Do the 30s breathing twice daily + use scripts if needed. Partner uses the check‑in template once a day. Note what worked each day in one line.  
- End of week: brief review — what stuck? what felt burdensome? tweak one thing and repeat.

6) What I’ll do in our check‑ins (so you know it won’t be lectures)
- Focus: troubleshoot one missed moment, pick one tweak, and set the next micro‑goal. No shaming, no long emotional-only sessions unless you ask for that. We’ll treat it like experiments: collect one data point each day and adjust.

If you want, I can draft a 2–3 sentence message you can send your partner right now to propose the plan. Would you like me to write that for you?

Therapist Answer:
Thank you so much for providing this detailed plan and script suggestions. I can see that you've put a lot of thought into making this a manageable and non-shaming process for both you and your partner.

Before we proceed, I just want to confirm that you're feeling comfortable with the plan and the script suggestions. Are there any specific concerns or questions you have about how to implement this plan?

Also, I want to suggest that we take a moment to review the plan together before sending it to your partner. This will help ensure that we're both on the same page and that we're covering all the necessary details.

Shall we review the plan together, and then I can help you draft a message to send to your partner?

Patient: Okay — I can do this, but I’m jittery and scattered right now so keep it short. Can we do a quick run‑through of the one‑week plan (what I do each day, what partner does, and the single thing I note), then draft a 1–2 sentence text I can actually send? I’m skeptical this won’t make them feel burdened — can the message include an easy opt‑out line like “if this feels like too much, say so and we’ll stop”? Also give me two very short drafts (one casual text, one slightly more formal) and tell me, plainly, what to do if they say no so I don’t spiral.

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep it short and sweet.

**One-Week Plan Run-Through**

* Day 1: Introduce scripts briefly (5 minutes), pick one breathing time (morning), and have partner use check-in template once a day.
* Days 2-7: Do 30s breathing twice daily, use scripts if needed, and have partner use check-in template once a day. Note what worked each day in one line.
* End of week: Brief review, tweak one thing, and repeat.

**Draft Text Messages**

Casual Text:
"Hey, I'm trying a small experiment to manage my overwhelm. Want to try a simple communication plan with me? If this feels like too much, say so and we'll stop."

Slightly More Formal Text:
"Hi, I'm considering a small experiment to help me cope with stress. Would you be willing to try a simple communication plan with me? If this feels overwhelming, please let me know and we can stop."

**What to Do if Partner Says No**

If your partner says no, don't spiral. Simply acknowledge their concern and let them know that you understand their perspective. You can say something like:

"I totally get it, and I appreciate your honesty. No pressure at all - we can focus on our regular communication and support each other in other ways. What do you think would be most helpful in our relationship right now?"

This approach shows that you value their feelings and are willing to adjust your approach. It also opens the door for further discussion and exploration of other ways to support each other.

Patient: Okay, this is helpful but keep it really short — give me two final texts I can actually send right now: one casual, one softer that includes “if it’s too much, say so and we’ll stop” and a line about reciprocity. I’m jittery about sending it — what exact one‑sentence reply should I send if they say no so I don’t spiral? And give me one 30‑second grounding I can do immediately after I hit send. I’m worried this will just make them feel burdened, by the way.

**Final Text Options**

Casual Text:
"Hey, I'm trying a small experiment to manage my overwhelm. Want to try a simple communication plan with me? If it's too much, say so and we'll stop."

Softer Text:
"Hey, I'm considering a small experiment to help me cope with stress. Want to try a simple communication plan with me? If it's too much, say so and we'll stop. I want to make sure we're both on the same page and that it's not adding to your stress."

**What to Say if Partner Says No**

If they say no, reply with a simple:
"Okay, no worries. I just want to make sure we're on the same page and that you're not feeling overwhelmed."

**30-Second Grounding Exercise**

"Take a deep breath in, hold for a second, and exhale slowly. Notice your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sound around you. For 30 seconds, focus on this moment, without thinking about the conversation or your partner's response. When you're ready, we can check in and discuss next steps."

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the softer text, but can we tweak it to include reciprocity? Maybe: “Hey, I’m trying a one‑week experiment to manage overwhelm — would you be willing to try a simple communication plan with me? If it’s too much, say so and we’ll stop; also tell me what would help you.” 

I’m really jittery about sending it — if they say no I tend to spiral, so can you give me one short self‑soothing sentence to tell myself right after I see their reply? I’m thinking: “Their answer isn’t a judgement of my worth; I’m doing the next right thing.” Does that sound okay?

Also, one extra 30‑second grounding I can do standing up (I might be pacing) that isn’t the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 thing — something like box breathing while naming one thing I can feel in my hand? I don’t know if any of this will actually help, but I’ll try — if it starts to fall apart, can we troubleshoot it together right away?

Therapist Answer:
**Tweaked Text with Reciprocity**

Your suggested text is a great way to include reciprocity while still being considerate of your partner's feelings. It's clear, concise, and shows that you value their input and willingness to participate.

**Self-Soothing Sentence**

Your suggested sentence is perfect: "Their answer isn’t a judgement of my worth; I’m doing the next right thing." It's a simple, yet powerful reminder that your partner's response is not a personal attack. You can use this sentence to calm yourself immediately after seeing their reply.

**Standing Grounding Exercise**

Here's a 30-second grounding exercise you can do standing up, using box breathing while focusing on a physical sensation in your hand:

"Touch your thumb to your index finger, and hold for a second. Take a deep breath in through your nose, counting 'inhale' (4 count), 'hold' (2 count), and exhale through your mouth (6 count), 'hold' (2 count). Repeat this process 3-4 times, focusing on your hand sensations. Notice how your body responds to the exercise. You're doing great, and we're here to support you."

This exercise is designed to help calm your nervous system and focus on your breath. It's low-key, flexible, and adaptable to your current state. We can troubleshoot it together right away if it starts to fall apart.

Remember, we're in this together, and we'll work through it. Take a deep breath and enjoy the process. You're doing great!

Patient: Okay — I’ll send this: "Hey, I’m trying a one‑week experiment to manage my overwhelm — would you be willing to try a simple communication plan with me? If it’s too much, say so and we’ll stop; also tell me what would help you." I’m jittery about it, but I’ll try.

My self‑soothing line will be: "Their answer isn’t a judgement of my worth; I’m doing the next right thing."  
If they say no, I’ll reply: "Okay, thanks for telling me — I understand." 

If it starts to fall apart after I send it, can we troubleshoot right away? I’m already anxious just thinking about hitting send.

Patient: Yes — I’ll send it, but I’m freaking out. If we’re troubleshooting right away, here’s what I want to do and what I’ll do:

1) Immediately after I hit send: do the standing 30‑second grounding (thumb to index + 3 rounds box breaths) and say my self‑soothing line: “Their answer isn’t a judgement of my worth; I’m doing the next right thing.” Put the phone face down for 10 minutes.  
2) If they reply “no”: I’ll send exactly: “Okay, thanks for telling me — I understand.” Then I’ll do another 30s grounding and write one short line in my notes about how it felt (no analysis, just the fact).  
3) If they don’t reply within 24 hours: send a gentle follow‑up: “Just checking in — no pressure, did you have any thoughts on the plan?”  
4) After any reply or no‑reply, I want to troubleshoot with you immediately — role‑play likely responses and pick one tiny next step.

Can we do a quick role‑play now? I’m jittery and don’t trust myself to handle whatever they say.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that last message felt like a jumble and it's making me more anxious. I'm really jittery and need to role‑play right now: can you be my partner and give me three short responses (1. yes I'll try, 2. no, I can't, 3. what exactly do you mean?), and after each one tell me the one sentence I should reply with and one tiny calming tweak I can do immediately? Also, seriously — how is this role‑play actually supposed to help me not spiral when I hit send?

Patient: Okay — quick and short. I'm jittery, so keep these tiny.

Role-play responses (partner) + exact one-sentence reply you send + one tiny calming tweak to do immediately after you send it.

1) Partner: "Yes, I'll try."  
- Your reply (one sentence): "Thank you — that means a lot; can we test this for one week: if I text 'Space please' you say 'Okay, I’ll check back in 20 minutes' and if I snap you can ask 'Five‑minute pause or a hug?'"  
- Tiny calming tweak: do the standing thumb‑to‑index box breathing — 3 rounds of inhale 4 / hold 2 / exhale 6 while focusing on the fingertip sensation, then put the phone face down for 10 minutes.

2) Partner: "No, I can't."  
- Your reply (one sentence): "Okay, thanks for telling me — I understand."  
- Tiny calming tweak: sit, hand on your chest for 30 seconds, do 5 slow exhalations (longer out-breaths), and write one short line in your notes: "Partner said no — I feel_____" (just a word, no analysis).

3) Partner: "What exactly do you mean?"  
- Your reply (one sentence): "I want a short one‑week experiment: if I'm overwhelmed I’ll either text 'Space please' or say 'pause/hug' and you can offer the two options or check back in 20 mins — would you be willing to try that?"  
- Tiny calming tweak: do one 30‑second grounding: name one thing you can feel in your hand, then breathe in for 4, out for 6 twice.

How is this supposed to help me not spiral? Honestly, I don't know if it’ll stop a full meltdown, but rehearsing these responses reduces the unknown and gives me an automatic sentence to send so I don't overthink or rant. Pairing each reply with a tiny grounding move gives me an immediate anchor to slow my body down. It won't fix everything, but it makes the moment less chaotic — less room for catastrophizing in the pause after I hit send.

If any of these replies feel off, tweak the wording now and we can run through it again. I want to practice the "no" response most — that's the one that makes me spiral. Can we role‑play that one one more time?

3) Tell me one 30‑second standing grounding to do immediately after I send it.  
4) Give me one very short mantra (one sentence) to repeat if I start spiraling for the next minute.
