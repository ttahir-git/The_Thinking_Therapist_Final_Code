Patient: I've been stuck in this cycle of harshly criticizing myself for every little perceived failure, and it's really wrecking my confidence around people. I think a lot of it goes back to being bullied at school, and since I lost someone close it's felt even worse. I try to be outgoing, but when we get into it I get uncomfortable and end up saying, "I don't know."

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how difficult these situations have been for you. It sounds like that experience at school and the loss you've recently experienced have combined to create a sense of vulnerability for you in social situations. You've made a great effort to be outgoing, even if it's led to feeling a bit uneasy and wanting to shut down. Can you tell me more about what happens when you say "I don't know" in those situations? What do you think is driving that response?

Patient: I don't know. When I say that, I kind of shut down — my chest gets tight and I scramble to change the subject or make a joke so I don't have to show I'm upset. I guess it's this fear of being judged or picked apart like back in school, and with the loss it's just louder, but I don't like digging into it.

Therapist: It's like your mind is hijacking the conversation and causing you to physically and emotionally shut down. That must be really overwhelming. The fear of being judged or criticized is understandable, especially given your past experience. But it's also clear that this is having a huge impact on your ability to be yourself in social situations. Can you think of a time when you weren't afraid of being judged or criticized? What was that situation like, and how did you feel?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the last time I felt not judged was when I was volunteering at the community theater — everyone was focused on the task, so I felt useful and relaxed instead of scrutinized. Being around a couple of close friends who just accepted me helped too, but when things get personal I tighten up and try to steer away.

Therapist: It sounds like in that moment, you felt a sense of purpose and connection with others that made you feel more at ease. Being part of a group working together on a shared goal can be really powerful in creating a sense of belonging and acceptance. And having close friends by your side can make all the difference in how you feel about yourself and your place in the world. When you do start to feel that tightening up, though, what do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to be a little more fully present in that moment? Would that make a difference, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I don't know... I guess being more present might take the edge off for a second and let me breathe, but it scares me — like if I stop performing people will see all the stuff I'm ashamed of. I usually deflect with a joke or change the subject instead. Can we talk about small, practical ways to try staying present without feeling so exposed?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to protect yourself from what you perceive as potential judgment or rejection. That's a really tough spot to be in. Let's focus on finding a small, low-stakes way to practice being more present. Would it be helpful to start with a tiny, everyday situation, like eating a meal or walking through a quiet room? Just notice your breath and the sensations in your body without trying to change anything or make a joke. It's not about performance, it's just about being. Can you think of a time when you might be able to do something like that, even if it's just for a few seconds?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try during my morning walk or while I'm making coffee — it's just me and seems low-stakes. It still freaks me out, like if I stop performing I'll start crying or everyone will see the mess, so can we keep it really tiny? Maybe just two slow breaths and noticing my feet, then I can go back to whatever.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to anchor yourself to something familiar, like the small, everyday tasks. That's a good place to start. Can you commit to just those two slow breaths, noticing your feet on the ground, without adding anything else? Maybe when you're doing that, you can start to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment. And when you feel ready, you can take a small step forward, like moving your gaze up to the ceiling or noticing a small detail in your surroundings. We can keep it tiny, but start to build a little more comfort and confidence with each small step.

Patient: I guess I can try that during my morning walk — just two slow breaths and noticing my feet. I don't know if I won't slip into a joke or try to change the subject, but I'll stick with it for a few seconds. If it gets too much, can we slow down? It feels kind of scary.

Therapist: It's normal to feel a bit scared or unsure when you're trying something new. Can you try to approach it from a curious place, rather than a fearful one? Instead of thinking "I don't want to slip up," try thinking "I'm curious to see how this feels." Just observe your thoughts and feelings, without judgment. If you do find yourself slipping into a joke or changing the subject, that's okay. We can take a step back and try again. Remember, it's not about doing it perfectly, it's about taking that first small step. How do you feel about taking that first step, just two slow breaths and noticing your feet, during your morning walk?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm nervous but willing to try — it feels small enough that I might manage it on my morning walk. If it starts to spiral or I slip into a joke, can we slow down or just pause and talk about what came up? I don't want to get overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to prepare yourself for the possibility of it not going smoothly, and that's a good attitude to have. If it does start to spiral or you feel like you're getting overwhelmed, don't worry. We can slow down or pause the exercise and take a step back. I'm here to support you, and we can talk about what's coming up. It's not about pushing through the discomfort, it's about learning to navigate it in a way that feels manageable for you. So, let's focus on getting that first small step on your morning walk. Are you ready to try it and see how it goes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm ready to try — nervous, but willing. I'll do the two slow breaths on my morning walk, and if I start joking or clamming up I want to pause and talk about what came up. Can you remind me quickly what you want me to notice or say to bring myself back in that moment?

Therapist: It's great that you're feeling ready to try. Just to recap, when you're on your morning walk, I want you to notice your feet on the ground and take two slow, deep breaths. If your mind starts to wander or you feel like slipping into a joke, just pause and bring your attention back to your breath. You can say to yourself something simple like, "Notice my feet," or "Take a breath." It's not about doing anything complex, it's just about being present with your breath and your body. If you need to, we can always come back to this conversation and talk about how it went. Are you all set to give it a try?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm about ready to try. I'll do the two breaths and notice my feet — if it gets too much or I start joking, can we pause and talk about what came up? I'm nervous but willing.

Therapist: That's all I need to know. It's okay to feel nervous, and it's great that you're willing to try. Just remember to take it one step at a time. When you're on your morning walk, do the two slow breaths, notice your feet, and see where it goes from there. If you need to pause or talk about what's coming up, just let me know. We can do this whenever you're ready. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, go for your walk. I'll be here.

Patient: Okay, I'll try it on my walk now. I don't know... I'm nervous about stopping and crying in public, but I'll do the two slow breaths and notice my feet, and if I start joking or clamming up can we pause and talk about what came up? I guess I'll come back after and let you know how it went.

Therapist: It's great that you're taking that first step. Remember, it's okay to take your time, and it's okay to not do it perfectly. The most important thing is that you're willing to try. Take your walk, do the two slow breaths, notice your feet, and see where it goes. Don't worry about what might happen if you start crying or joking - we can deal with that when you get back. Just focus on being present with your breath and your body. I'll be here, and we can talk about it whenever you're ready. Take a deep breath, and go for your walk.

Patient: I did it — I took the two slow breaths and really noticed my feet for a few seconds. I don't know, my chest still got tight and I almost made a joke to deflect; the breaths helped a little but then a memory of being laughed at in school popped up and I felt like running. I guess I felt a tiny bit calmer afterward, but also more shaky about how quickly those old things can come back. Can we pause and talk about that memory — I don't like going into it, but it stuck with me.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that memory and its impact on you. It's understandable that it stuck with you, and it's okay that it's still affecting you. Sometimes, just acknowledging the memory and its emotions can help make it feel a little less overwhelming.

Before we dive into the memory, I want to acknowledge how brave you are for sharing this with me. It's not always easy to talk about difficult memories, especially when they're tied to feelings of shame or embarrassment.

Can you tell me more about what happened in that memory? What were you doing, and how did it make you feel? I'm here to listen, and I'll do my best to support you through this. We can take it at your pace, and we can pause if you need to.

Patient: I don't know... I guess it was around twelve — we were doing readings in class, I stumbled over a line and a bunch of kids started laughing while the teacher just looked away. I felt totally exposed, like everyone saw how stupid I was, and after that I learned to deflect with jokes so nobody could pick at me. It still hits me — chest tight, wanting to run — and I don't really like digging into it, so can we take it slow?

Therapist: It's clear that this memory is still affecting you, and it's okay to take it slow. You don't have to relive the experience if you don't want to. Let's focus on your physical sensations and emotions right now. Can you tell me more about what happens in your body when you think about that memory? You mentioned your chest gets tight and you feel like running. Are there any other physical sensations that come up for you?

We can start with small, gentle observations. If you're ready, I can try to help you notice the sensations in your body without having to talk about the memory itself. Sometimes, paying attention to our physical experiences can help us feel more grounded and connected to our bodies. Would you like to try that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but keep it really small. When that memory hits my chest goes tight, my breathing gets shallow, my hands get clammy and my stomach knots — I usually want to run or crack a joke. If it starts to feel like too much can we pause and just slow it down?

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to try. Let's take a tiny step back. Can you bring your attention to your breath right now? Just notice how it's moving in and out of your body. Don't try to change it or control it, just observe it. See if you can find a single spot in your body where you can focus on your breath, like on your belly or your chest. We can start with that one spot and see where it takes us.

Remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander. We can come back to it whenever you're ready. No need to try to change anything or tackle the memory itself. Just focus on your breath and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to notice my chest — it's tight and the breaths feel shallow. It's kind of a lot to keep paying attention to, though, so if it gets worse can we slow down or pause?

Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed, especially when you're just starting to focus on your body. If you start to feel like it's too much, we can definitely slow down or take a break. That's what this is all about - taking small steps and being gentle with yourself.

Let's try to take it one tiny step at a time. Instead of trying to focus on your entire chest, can you try to notice just one spot? Maybe it's the top of your chest, or the spot where your heart is beating. Just try to focus on that one spot for a few breaths, and see if it makes a difference. If you need to, we can take a deep breath together and then come back to it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to notice the spot by my heart for a few breaths. My chest's tight and my mind's really jumpy, so if it starts to feel worse can we slow down or pause?

Therapist: That's a great spot to focus on. Just notice the spot by your heart for a few breaths. Don't try to change anything or do anything with it, just observe it. See if you can feel any changes in your body as you breathe.

If you start to feel like it's getting worse, or if your mind is getting too jumpy, we can slow down or pause. Just let me know, and we'll take care of it. We're not trying to push you or do anything that feels uncomfortable. We're just trying to take small steps and be kind to yourself. How are you feeling right now? Is there anything that's changing or coming up for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm kind of worn out and on edge — my chest's tight, my breaths are shallow, and my mind keeps darting back to that laugh in class. Focusing on the spot by my heart helped a tiny bit, but I'm still jumpy and distracted. Can we slow down and do a very quick grounding — maybe name two things I can see and one thing I can feel? And if it gets worse, can we pause and just sit with it for a minute?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling a bit exhausted and on edge, and it's hard to focus. That's completely understandable. Let's take a quick grounding exercise to help you feel a bit more connected to your body. I want to suggest a very simple and gentle exercise.

Can you take a moment to notice two things that you can see around you right now? Maybe it's a chair, a book, or a window. Just notice what you're seeing without trying to focus on it too much. See if you can pick out two things that stand out to you.

And can you notice one thing that you can feel right now? Maybe it's the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin. Just notice what you're feeling without trying to analyze it too much.

We'll do this for just a second, and then we can see if it helps you feel a bit more grounded. If you need to pause or take a break, we can do that too. Just let me know.

Can you take a deep breath and try to notice two things you can see, and one thing you can feel?

Patient: I don't know... okay. Two things I can see: a chipped blue mug on the table and a pile of notebooks with sticky notes all over them. One thing I can feel: my shoe pressing into the floor and my heart beating a bit fast. I'm kind of jumpy and worn out, so if this starts to feel worse can we just pause and sit with it for a minute?

Therapist: It sounds like that grounding exercise helped you connect with your surroundings a bit more. The chipped blue mug and the notebooks with sticky notes might seem insignificant, but noticing them can help distract from the discomfort in your chest and the jumpy feelings.

It's great that you're feeling a bit more grounded, even if you're still jumpy and worn out. Remember, it's okay to feel this way, and it's not a sign of weakness. It's just your body and mind responding to some tough emotions.

If you're ready, we can try to slowly build on that feeling of connection to your surroundings. We can take small steps, like noticing your breath, or focusing on a different sensation in your body. But if you need to pause or take a break, we can do that too. Your safety and comfort are my top priority.

For now, let's just sit with this feeling for a minute. You can keep noticing your surroundings, and I'll be here with you. When you're ready, we can try to do something more, or we can just keep sitting and being present with your emotions. What feels most comfortable for you right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess just sitting quietly and keeping it simple feels best right now — can we just sit for a few minutes while I keep noticing the mug and my feet? My chest's still tight and my mind keeps jumping, so can we take it slow and not push me to talk? If it's okay, maybe prompt me every so often to check in instead of pushing for more.

Therapist: I'm glad we can find a comfortable pace for you. Let's take it slow and simple, and just sit together in silence for a while. You can keep noticing the mug and your feet, and I'll be here with you.

If you need a reminder, I can ask you to check in whenever you're ready. We can start with a simple "How are you feeling right now?" or just a nod to see if you're okay. We'll go from there.

For now, let's just sit and be present with each other. Your safety and comfort are my top priority, and I'm here to support you. Take a deep breath, and let's just be here for a moment.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm sitting here — my chest's tight and I'm feeling pretty drained, but looking at the mug and my feet helps a bit. I guess if you could check in every so often with a quiet "how are you?" that would help me stay grounded instead of flinching away. It's hard to talk more right now, so please keep it gentle and slow.

Therapist: That's a great plan. I'll just check in with a quiet "how are you?" every now and then. It's a gentle way to see how you're feeling, and it won't catch you off guard.

Just sit and be present for a moment. Notice the mug, your feet, and the sensations in your body. Take a deep breath in, and out. You're doing okay.

How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess my chest is still tight and my thoughts keep darting — the mug and my feet help a little, but I'm feeling pretty worn out and low on energy. Can you check in again in a minute? Please keep it gentle.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Remember, it's okay to feel that way. Your chest is still tight, and your thoughts are still darting, but you're doing the best you can.

Take a deep breath in, and out. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of the air on your skin. You're safe, and you're present.

I'll check in with you again in a minute. Just take a moment to notice how you're feeling, and see if anything has changed.

Patient: I don't know... I'm still here. My chest's tight and my mind keeps darting — I'm getting kind of distracted and it's hard to stay with it. Can you check in again in a minute like you said? Please keep it gentle.

Therapist: It's okay to get distracted. It's normal, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. Just take a deep breath in, and out, and notice how you're feeling right now.

Your chest is still tight, and your mind is still darting. That's okay. We can work with that. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. Just take your time, and notice how you're feeling. I'll be back in a minute.

Take a moment to notice your feet, the air on your skin, and the sensation of your body. Just be present with your body, and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I'm still here. My chest's tight, breathing's shallow, and I'm pretty wiped out — sitting helps a bit but my mind keeps darting. I guess I'll try to stay; please check in in a minute with that quiet "How are you?" like you said, and keep it gentle.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Your chest is still tight, and your breathing is shallow. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Take a deep breath in, and out. Notice how your body is feeling, and see if you can find any small moments of calm. It might be hard to focus, but try to stay present with your body and your breath.

I'll check in with you again in a minute, with that quiet "How are you?" like we agreed. Just take your time, and be kind to yourself. You're doing okay.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm still here — chest's tight, breaths are shallow, and my mind keeps darting so I'm jumpy and distracted. Can you check in in a minute with that quiet "How are you?" and, when you do, prompt me to take two slow breaths? I guess that's all I can manage right now — please keep it gentle.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Your chest is still tight, and your breathing is shallow. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll wait. My chest's still tight and my mind's darting — I'm pretty drained and on edge, so please check in gently in a minute with the quiet "How are you?" and prompt me to take two slow breaths. If it gets too much, can we just pause and sit with it?

If it feels too overwhelming, we can just pause and sit with it for a moment. Just take your time, and be kind to yourself. You're doing okay.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll wait. My chest's tight, breaths are shallow and my mind's all jumpy — I feel kind of out of steam and distracted. Please check in gently in a minute with the quiet "How are you?" and prompt me to take two slow breaths, and if it gets worse can we just pause and sit?

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Your chest is still tight, and your breathing is shallow. It's normal to feel a bit out of steam when we're feeling overwhelmed.
