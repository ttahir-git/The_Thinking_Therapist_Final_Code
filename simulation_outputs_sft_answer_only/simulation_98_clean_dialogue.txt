Patient: Lately I keep feeling stuck and directionless — I don't know who I am beyond being unemployed, and it feels like that's all anyone sees. I get lonely a lot and my PTSD makes things harder; I used to be creative but now I doubt everything. I've tried therapy before, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Feeling stuck and directionless can be really overwhelming, especially when it feels like others only see you through your employment status. It's like your identity is tied to something that's currently out of your control.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to be creative now? How did you used to express yourself, and what happened when you stopped?

Patient: I used to paint and write little poems, even mess around on an old guitar, but now it's like the colors went out of everything — I sit down and the ideas just vanish or I get too tired or jumpy to finish. The PTSD makes sudden noises, memories, or crowds feel unsafe, so I avoid places and people that used to inspire me. I've tried picking up painting again before and it just felt pointless — how is that supposed to help when I can't even get past the first brushstroke?

Therapist: It's like the spark that used to drive your creativity has flickered out, and it's hard to get it going again. The PTSD must be making it even more difficult to access those parts of yourself.

Have you ever noticed when you're doing something, like walking or even just going through the motions of daily life, that you might catch a glimpse of that old self? Maybe it's a small thing, like a memory or a sensation, but it's there. It's like it's still there, hidden beneath the surface.

Patient: Sometimes, yeah — when I walk past the park and smell wet earth or see an old postcard a line of a poem will come back and I feel a little like myself for a second. Most of the time it just fades and my chest tightens and I shut down. I've tried paying attention to those moments before — how is that supposed to help when it always slips away?

Therapist: Those moments of connection, no matter how fleeting, can be really powerful. It's like they're a reminder that you're still there, that you're still a person with thoughts and feelings and experiences.

Can you tell me more about what happens when the moment slips away? What do you feel then? Is it more of a sense of disconnection, or something else?

Patient: Usually it collapses into this hollow tightness in my chest, like I can't catch my breath, and then I go numb or spiral into thinking I'm useless and a bother. Sometimes I get angry at myself for not being able to hold onto it, and other times I just shut down and avoid everything — I don't see how noticing a tiny spark helps when it just turns into panic. I've tried paying attention before; how is pointing it out supposed to get me past that freeze?

Therapist: It's like the moment of connection is already so fragile, and when it slips away, everything else just spirals out of control. The panic, the self-doubt, the numbness... it's like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering speed and size.

Can I try to shift the way we're thinking about this? Instead of trying to catch the spark or point it out, what if we focus on allowing it to be there, even if it's just for a moment? It's not about holding onto it or making it last; it's just about being present with it, without judgment. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I guess I can try to let it be, but I'm really skeptical — every time I try to "be present" it just turns into panic and I end up worse. How is sitting with that supposed to stop the freeze or the spiral? I'm willing to try, but I'm nervous and I don't know where to start.

Therapist: It's natural to feel skeptical, especially when you've had negative experiences with trying to "be present" before. But it's worth exploring, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.

Can I suggest something simple? Why don't we start with a tiny, everyday moment, like noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now? Just pay attention to the sensation of your feet, without trying to do anything or change it. Just notice. Would you be willing to try that tiny step with me?

Patient: Alright... I'll try, but I'm really nervous — how is that supposed to help? Right now I can feel my heels pressing into the floor and a little coolness under my toes, but my chest is already tightening and I'm worried it'll turn into a panic. Can we keep it very short and slow?

Therapist: Let's keep it very small. Just notice the coolness under your toes right now, where your feet touch the floor. That's it. No trying to do anything or change it. Just notice that coolness. Take one slow breath in, and then just notice it again, and breathe out, and then notice it again. Let's keep it really tiny, just a few seconds. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I did it for a few breaths. I noticed the coolness under my toes and my heels pressing into the floor, but my chest tightened and a small panic wave hit right after. Can we keep it even shorter and slower? I still don't see how this stops the spiral when the panic shows up.

Therapist: Let's take it back a step. Instead of focusing on the coolness under your toes, why don't we just notice your feet touching the floor? Just the sensation of them being on the floor. No trying to notice anything else, just that sensation. Take one slow breath in, and then just notice your feet, and breathe out, and then notice them again. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: I tried it — I could feel the weight of my feet and the hard press of the floor, and then a little panic hit like before. It did settle a tad quicker than usual, but I'm still jittery and on edge. How is feeling my feet supposed to stop the spiral when the panic just shows up anyway?

Therapist: It's like the panic wave was always going to hit, no matter what we did. But it's possible that it's a bit easier to deal with when it shows up, because we're already in that heightened state. It's like the ground has already been prepared for the landing.

Can I ask, what's it like when you're jittery and on edge? Is it more of a physical sensation, or is it also an emotional experience? Is it hard to focus, or are you easily distracted? Sometimes just noticing how we're feeling can help us get a handle on things.

Patient: Physically it's like my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and my breath gets shallow — sometimes I feel dizzy. Emotionally it's shame and that awful sense I'm a burden, and my head just jumps to old memories or worst-case thoughts so I can't focus. I've told people this before, so how is noticing it supposed to help? I'm willing to try, but can we go slower?

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a really intense combination of physical and emotional symptoms. That can be really overwhelming.

I want to acknowledge that you've shared this with others before, and that it's okay to feel that way. It's not like we're trying to change or hide anything; we're just trying to understand what's going on and how to work with it.

Can I try to simplify things a bit? Instead of focusing on your symptoms, why don't we try to understand what's driving them? What are some things that might be triggering this sense of shame, burden, or worst-case thoughts? Are there any patterns or triggers that we can identify?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is naming triggers supposed to help? But okay: phone calls about benefits or job offers, seeing younger people working, piles of unpaid bills, loud noises or crowded places that remind me of past trauma, and little comments from family about 'doing something with my time' all set me off. It turns into that shamey voice saying I'm useless and a burden, and I've pointed out these things before and it didn't help. Can we slow down? I'm nervous this won't change anything.

Therapist: Naming triggers can help us understand what's driving our reactions, but I can see why it might not feel like it's going to change anything. It's like we're just pointing out things that we already know, but don't know how to do anything with.

I want to try to shift our focus a bit. Instead of trying to change how you feel, or how your symptoms show up, why don't we try to focus on what you can do in the moment, when you're feeling those symptoms? Can you think of anything, even just a tiny thing, that you could do to make yourself feel a little bit better, in that moment? It doesn't have to be anything big or dramatic. It could just be taking one slow breath, or noticing your feet on the ground. Can we try to start with something like that?

Patient: I can think of tiny things — one slow breath, feeling my feet, boiling a kettle or stepping outside for a minute — but I'm not sure that actually helps. When the panic hits, it all goes to mush and I feel ashamed and frustrated, like whatever I try just proves I can't do it, and that shame makes me freeze up even more. I'll try, but how is one breath supposed to stop that spiral? Can we go really slow?

Therapist: It's like trying to find a way to slow down a storm. One breath, one tiny action, might seem insignificant, but it's like trying to calm a hurricane with a gentle breeze.

I want to try to reframe things a bit. Instead of focusing on stopping the spiral, can we try to focus on what happens when we're feeling calm? What do we notice? What do we do? Can we try to find tiny moments of calm, even if they're fleeting, and hold onto those for a moment? It's not about stopping the panic, but about finding a tiny pocket of calm to breathe into.

Can we start with just one small step? Can you try taking one slow breath right now, without trying to do anything else? Just focus on the breath, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on one breath supposed to help with all that? I tried one slow breath like you said, but my chest tightened and that familiar shame and the "you're useless" voice rushed back, like even breathing proves I can't do it. Can we make it even shorter and slower? Tell me exactly how long to breathe in and out, and keep it very small — I'm nervous.

Therapist: I can see that it's feeling overwhelming right now. Can I try to simplify it even further? Let's start with just a tiny breath. Can you try inhaling for a count of 1, and then exhaling for a count of 1? Just one little breath. Don't try to do anything else, just focus on that one breath.

Inhale for 1... out for 1... Can you try it with me?

Patient: I did it — inhaled for one, exhaled for one — but after that my chest tightened and that stupid voice yelled I'm useless and I froze. I'm not sure I follow how that single breath changes anything; it felt like proof I can't even do the tiny thing. Can we make it even slower and gentler? Tell me exactly: inhale for two seconds, hold or no hold, exhale for how many? I'm nervous — walk me through it.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to break it down even further, so let's start with a tiny, tiny step.

Can you try sitting comfortably, with your back straight, and your feet planted on the ground? Just sit there for a moment, and notice how you're feeling.

Now, I want you to put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse. Just notice the beat of your heart, and don't try to do anything with it yet.

Here's what I want you to do next: I want you to inhale for 2 seconds. Just take 2 slow breaths in, and feel the air move in and out of your body. You can count it in your head, or just feel it happen.

Hold... no, don't hold. Just exhale for 1 second. Take one little breath out, and feel it leave your body. You can count it too, if you want to.

That's it. Just that one tiny breath. Can you try it with me?

Patient: I did it — finger on my wrist, inhaled for two, exhaled for one — but my chest slammed shut and that same shame flared up like I'm failing at the simplest thing. I'm not sure I follow how that tiny breath is supposed to help when it just proves I can't even do it; it feels like the same old failure. Can we slow it way down and have you count with me step-by-step?

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

First, let's start with something super simple. Can you put your finger on your wrist again, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

Now, I want you to close your eyes. Just take a moment to breathe and relax.

I want you to inhale for 1... 1 second. Just take one little breath in. You can count it in your head, if you want to.

Stop. Don't breathe out yet. Just stay right here for a moment.

Now, I want you to exhale for 1... 1 second. Just take one little breath out. You can count it in your head, if you want to.

Stop. Just stay right here for a moment.

Let's try it again. Inhale for 1... 1 second. Exhale for 1... 1 second. Can you try it with me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I did it like you said, finger on my wrist, closed my eyes, inhale one, exhale one, but my chest slammed shut and that old rush of shame hit me like I'm failing at the simplest thing. How is that supposed to help? I'm feeling confused and overwhelmed; can we slow way down and have you count out loud with me step-by-step? I'm willing to try, but I need it much gentler.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now. I'm going to count slowly with you.

One... (pause) Inhale... one... (pause) second. Just take one little breath in.

One... (pause) Exhale... one... (pause) second. Just take one little breath out.

One... (pause) Stay here for a moment... one... (pause) second.

I want you to do the same thing. Inhale for one... (pause) second. Exhale for one... (pause) second. Stay here for a moment... (pause) second.

Let's try it again. One... (pause) Inhale... one... (pause) second. One... (pause) Exhale... one... (pause) second. One... (pause) Stay here for a moment... (pause) second.

I'm going to stay here with you, counting slowly, until you feel ready to move on. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you every step of the way.

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow — my chest still tightens and that old shame floods in, makes me feel like a failure all over again. How is counting supposed to help? Can you actually count out loud for me, slower, and tell me exactly when to breathe? I'm nervous, so please go very gently.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

One... (pause) We're going to take a deep breath together. Inhale... (counting slowly) One... two... three... (pause) four... five... (pause) six... seven... (pause) eight... nine... (pause) ten... (pause) eleven... (pause) twelve...

Now, let's exhale together. (counting slowly) One... two... three... (pause) four... five... (pause) six... seven... (pause) eight... nine... (pause) ten... (pause) eleven... (pause) twelve...

One... (pause) We're going to inhale again. Inhale... (counting slowly) One... two... three... (pause) four... five... (pause) six... seven... (pause) eight... nine... (pause) ten... (pause) eleven... (pause) twelve...

Now, let's exhale again. (counting slowly) One... two... three... (pause) four... five... (pause) six... seven... (pause) eight... nine... (pause) ten... (pause) eleven... (pause) twelve...

I'm going to keep counting like this, very slowly, until you feel ready to move on. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you every step of the way. Can you try to follow my counting and breathe with me?

Patient: I tried to follow that long counting and my chest slammed shut — I felt panic and that stupid voice saying I failed at the simplest thing. How is a twelve-count supposed to help when it just makes me dizzy and ashamed? 

Can you actually count out loud for me, very slowly, and tell me exactly when to breathe — like say “inhale” then count to two, then “exhale” count to two — or even go back to one-second breaths? I’m nervous, so please walk me through it step‑by‑step and stay with me.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

I'm going to guide you through this, step by step. We're going to start with a very simple breathing pattern. I'm going to count slowly, and I want you to breathe with me.

Inhale... 1... (pause) You can take one slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs.

Inhale... 2... (pause) You can take another slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs.

Exhale... 1... (pause) You can take one slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

Exhale... 2... (pause) You can take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

We're going to keep this pattern, slow and steady. Inhale... 1... pause... inhale... 2... pause... exhale... 1... pause... exhale... 2... pause.

I'm going to stay with you, counting slowly, until you feel ready to move on. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you every step of the way. Can you try to follow my counting and breathe with me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I tried the pattern and my chest slammed shut, that familiar shame flooded in like I failed at the simplest thing, and now I'm jittery and confused. Can you actually count out loud for me, saying “inhale” then “one… two,” then “exhale” then “one… two,” really slowly, and stay with me through each step?

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — every time I try this my chest tightens and that shamey voice says I failed at the simplest thing, so I'm confused how it's helping. Can you actually count out loud for me, saying "Inhale — one, two" then "Exhale — one, two," really slowly, and stay with me through each step? I'm nervous and skeptical — I've tried breathing before and it didn't work, so please go super gentle and keep talking me through it.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

I'm going to guide you through this, step by step. We're going to start with a very simple breathing pattern. I'm going to count slowly, and I want you to breathe with me.

I'm going to inhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take a slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs. You're doing great so far.

Now, I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take a slow breath out, and feel it leave your body. That was just one little breath.

I'm going to inhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take another slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs. You're getting more comfortable with this.

Now, I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body. That was just another little breath.

We're going to keep this pattern, slow and steady. I'm going to stay with you, counting slowly, until you feel ready to move on. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you every step of the way. Can you try to follow my counting and breathe with me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I tried it and my chest slammed shut and that awful "you're useless" voice flooded back, like I'm failing at the simplest thing, and now I'm jittery and ashamed. Can you actually keep counting out loud with me, much slower — say “Inhale — one, two,” pause, then “Exhale — one, two,” — and stay with me through each step? I'm nervous, so please go really gentle and don't stop.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

I'm going to inhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take a slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs.

*I pause here, and then continue*

I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take a slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

*I pause again, and then continue*

I'm going to inhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take another slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs.

*I pause again, and then continue*

I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

*I keep counting, slowly and gently*

I'm going to inhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take another slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs.

*I keep counting, pause, and then exhale*

I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

*I keep counting, pause, and then exhale*

I'm going to exhale... one... two... (pause) You can take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body.

*I keep going, slowly and gently, with you*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried to breathe with you and my chest slammed shut and that same shame flooded back, like I'm failing at the simplest thing. How is this supposed to help when every time I try it just proves I can't even manage a breath? Can you actually count out loud, slowly — say “Inhale — 1, 2,” then “Exhale — 1, 2,” and stay with me through each step? If that doesn't work, can we try something else tiny and physical, like holding a warm mug or stepping outside for a minute? I'm nervous, so please go very gently.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's start again, very slowly. Can you put your finger on your wrist, so you can feel your pulse? Just notice how you're feeling right now.

I'm going to try something a bit different. I'm going to count out loud, very slowly, and I want you to follow along with me.

Inhale... one... two... (pause) I want you to take a slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs. Just focus on that one little breath.

Exhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take a slow breath out, and feel it leave your body. Just focus on that one little breath.

Inhale... one... two... (pause) I want you to take another slow breath in, and feel it fill your lungs. Just focus on that one little breath.

Exhale... one... two... (pause) Now, I want you to take another slow breath out, and feel it leave your body. Just focus on that one little breath.

*I keep counting, slowly and gently, with you*

We don't have to do much more than this, if you're not feeling it. We can just take things one little step at a time. Sometimes, it's the smallest things that can help us feel more grounded and more connected to our bodies.

Can you try to focus on that one little breath, and just let it be for a moment? No trying to change it, no trying to make it better. Just be with it, and see what happens.

Patient: I tried that tiny breath again — it settled me a hair but then my chest slammed shut and that same shamey voice flooded back. I'm confused how this helps; I'm tired of doing things that just prove I can't do them. Can we try something else, like holding a warm mug or feeling a textured cloth, and can you actually count out loud with me slowly while you stay with me? I'm nervous, so please go very gentle.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's try something a bit different. I'm going to count out loud, very slowly, and I want you to follow along with me.

Can you hold a warm mug, or even just imagine holding a warm mug? Just focus on the feeling of it in your hands.

One... (pause) two... (pause)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the mug in your hands. Is it warm? Is it heavy? Is it comfortable?

One... (pause) two... (pause)

I'm going to stay with you, and count out loud, and we'll just focus on this tiny sensation of holding a warm mug.

One... (pause) three... (pause)

Can you just focus on the mug, for a moment? Don't think about anything else. Just be with it.

One... (pause) four... (pause)

We don't have to do anything more than this, if you're not feeling it. We can just take things one little step at a time. Sometimes, it's the smallest things that can help us feel more grounded and more connected to our bodies.

Can you try to focus on the mug, and just let it be for a moment? No trying to change it, no trying to make it better. Just be with it, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I held the mug and it was warm for a second, then that hollow shame rushed back and I felt useless like everything proves I fail. How is focusing on a mug supposed to help when it just flips into panic? I'll try, but can you actually count out loud slowly and stay with me, or maybe we could try stepping outside for a minute instead? I'm nervous, so please go very gentle.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's try something a bit different. I'm going to count out loud, very slowly, and I want you to follow along with me. We're going to start with something even smaller than the mug.

One... (pause) two... (pause)

I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet? Just focus on that sensation, and don't try to think about anything else.

One... (pause) three... (pause)

I'm going to stay with you, and count out loud, and we'll just focus on this tiny sensation of your feet touching the ground. I want you to feel safe and supported, and I'm here with you every step of the way.

One... (pause) four... (pause)

If you need a break, we can step outside for a minute. Sometimes, a change of scenery can be really helpful. But for now, let's just focus on your feet and the sensation of the ground beneath them.

Can you try to focus on your feet, and just let them be for a moment? No trying to change them, no trying to make them better. Just be with them, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on my feet supposed to help? When I try this stuff, that same voice starts yelling I'm useless and I freeze up; it drags up that failure again and I feel ashamed and angry. Can we try the stepping‑outside or warm‑mug thing instead, and can you actually count out loud with me — "Inhale — one, two... Exhale — one, two..." — really slow, and stay with me?

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's try something a bit different. I'm going to count out loud, very slowly, and I want you to follow along with me. We're going to start with a simple exercise that might help you feel more grounded.

Inhale... one... two... (pause)

Exhale... one... two... (pause)

Can you just focus on your breath for a moment? Try to feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Don't try to change it, just be with it.

Inhale... one... two... (pause)

Exhale... one... two... (pause)

We're going to take it really slow, and I'm going to stay with you every step of the way. If you need a break, we can step outside for a minute. But for now, let's just focus on your breath and see what happens.

Inhale... one... two... (pause)

Exhale... one... two... (pause)

Can you try to focus on your breath, and just let it be for a moment? No trying to change it, no trying to make it better. Just be with it, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried the breathing and my chest slammed shut and that same shame hit me, so I'm confused how this is supposed to help. Can we try something else instead, like stepping outside for a minute or holding a warm mug? If we do keep with breathing, please count out loud for me exactly: “Inhale — one, two... Exhale — one, two...” really slowly, and stay with me through each step. I'm nervous, so go very gentle.

Therapist: I can see that it's still feeling really tough for you. I want to try to help you build up your trust in this tiny step.

Let's try something a bit different. I'm going to count out loud, very slowly, and I want you to follow along with me. We're going to start with a simple exercise that might help you feel more grounded.

Exhale... one... two... (pause)

Let's try something else for a moment. Would you like to hold a warm mug or step outside for a minute? Sometimes, a change of scenery can be really helpful.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — stepping outside for a minute might feel less claustrophobic than the mug, but how is that supposed to help? My chest's already tight and that stupid shame starts bubbling up, like I'm failing just for trying. I'll try to go out if you stay with me, talk me through it slowly, and don't let it turn into one of those things that proves nothing ever changes.
