Patient: I'm a teacher in my fifties, and lately I've been stuck in a cycle of seeking reassurance from colleagues and friends to quiet my social anxiety. It feels like a kind of numbness — I do it before and after interactions, especially since a recent health scare made me feel more vulnerable, and it's just exhausting. I've tried things like this before and it didn't work, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit worn out from trying different strategies in the past, and it's understandable to wonder if this one will work any better. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do seek reassurance? What do you think is behind the need for that reassurance, and how does it make you feel in the moment?

Patient: Usually I’ll replay a conversation and then message a colleague or friend asking if I came off okay, or I’ll call someone to get that quick “you’re fine” — it calms the knot in my chest for ten minutes and then the doubt comes roaring back. I think it’s rooted in fear of judgment and that health scare made me feel more fragile, so reassurance feels like a quick patch instead of actually sitting with the fear. But honestly, I don’t see how talking about this is supposed to help — I’ve tried things before and the relief never lasts.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're recognizing that the reassurance you're seeking is more of a temporary fix than a true resolution. You're pointing out that the relief you get from it doesn't last, and the doubt and fear come back. That's a really honest and painful acknowledgment. Can you tell me more about what's going on when you're sitting with that fear? What does it feel like, physically and emotionally? Is there a part of you that's already trying to move away from it, even if it's just a tiny bit?

Patient: Physically it’s a tight knot in my chest, shallow breaths, my hands go a bit clammy and my head gets foggy — like I can’t think straight. Emotionally it’s shame and this humbling vulnerability, like I’m suddenly very small and everyone’s judging me, and the health scare amplified that feeling. A tiny part of me wants to sit with it and see what’s there, but the louder part reaches for my phone almost automatically to get that quick “you’re fine.” Honestly, how is sitting with that supposed to help when every time I try I just end up seeking reassurance anyway?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like sitting with that fear and vulnerability is even more daunting than you initially thought. You're already feeling small and exposed, and the physical sensations are really intense. It's like your body is trying to protect you from feeling that way, even if it's just for a moment. And it's not surprising that you're reaching for reassurance again - it's a coping mechanism that's been there for a long time. 

One thing to consider is that the reassurance might not be a problem in and of itself, but rather a symptom of something deeper. It's possible that the need for reassurance is connected to your desire to connect with others, to be seen and heard. Can you think of times when you've felt most connected to others, and what was happening in those moments? Was it something specific you did, or was it more about how you felt?

Patient: I guess I feel most connected when a student lingers after class to thank me, or a colleague actually listens without judging — it's quiet and genuine, and I feel seen rather than performing. It's more about that sense of being understood than any particular action. But really, how is thinking about those moments supposed to stop me from grabbing my phone the second the panic starts? I've tried this kind of reflection before and it doesn't seem to stick.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a connection with others that goes beyond just actions or external validation. You want to feel seen and understood in a genuine way. And it's frustrating when you're trying to find that connection, but it's still hard to shake off the urge to reach for reassurance.

One thing to consider is that your phone is a tool that's been with you for a long time, and it's become a kind of automatic response to stress or anxiety. It's not that you're trying to use it to avoid connecting with others, but it's a habit that's hard to break.

Can you try to think of it this way: when you grab your phone, you're not just reaching for reassurance, you're also reaching for a sense of control. You're trying to calm the storm, but you're not really taking care of yourself. If you could find a way to connect with others in a more meaningful way, or if you could find a way to calm the storm on your own, would that change things?

Patient: Maybe it would, in theory, but I'm really skeptical — when I try breathing or grounding it just delays the panic for a few minutes and then I reach for the phone anyway. Part of me worries that "calming the storm on my own" just means sitting with the same awful feelings without help. If you think there's something different that actually works, how is that supposed to help me break the habit of automatically reaching for my phone?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of trying to calm the storm on your own, and you're worried that it might just prolong the feelings of anxiety and panic. And it's not just about trying to delay the panic for a few minutes - it's about the underlying sense of hopelessness and feeling unconnected.

One thing to consider is that the idea of "calming the storm on your own" doesn't mean you have to do it by yourself. It's not about willpower or self-sufficiency, but about finding a way to connect with others and with your own body in a way that feels safe and helpful.

Can you try to think of it this way: instead of trying to reach for your phone as a quick fix, what if you could find a way to pause, even if it's just for a moment, and then take a small step towards connecting with others or with your own body? It might not be the phone, but it could be something else entirely - a piece of paper, a breath, a word. And then, from there, see where it takes you.

Patient: I can see the idea, but I need something concrete — not just “pause and breathe.” Say I’m outside a parent meeting with my chest tight and my hand already on my phone: what exactly do you want me to do instead? Give me a specific tiny action or sentence I can use that actually interrupts the habit, because so far calming techniques just delay the panic and then I reach for the phone anyway. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something simple. When your hand is on your phone, I want you to pause and say to yourself, "Wait, I've got this." Just say those three words, and then take your hand away from the phone. That's it. No breathing, no grounding, no trying to calm down. Just saying, "Wait, I've got this." And then, after a moment, you can do whatever you need to do. Take a breath, check your phone, or whatever.

The goal is not to calm down or feel better right away. The goal is to interrupt the automatic response to panic, and to create a tiny moment of awareness that says, "Hey, I'm doing this. I'm in control." And then, from there, you can try to do something more, like take a breath or check your phone.

Can you try that for me? Can you say, "Wait, I've got this," and then see what happens?

Patient: Okay—"Wait, I've got this." 

That made a tiny gap in the panic, maybe a half-second; my hand still hovered over the phone and the knot's mostly there. Honestly, this feels like a band-aid—how is that supposed to help when the relief never lasts? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying "Wait, I've got this" created a small moment of hesitation, but the panic is still there. That's a good start, because it means you're not just reaching for your phone and feeling numb.

One thing to consider is that this tiny gap in the panic is like a small crack in a wall. It's not going to make the wall disappear, but it's a start. And it's not just about saying a few words - it's about creating a moment of awareness that says, "Hey, I'm doing this. I'm in control." And from there, you can try to build on that moment, and see if you can do something more.

Can you try to focus on that tiny gap in the panic? What happens right after you say "Wait, I've got this"? Do you feel a slight change in your body, or a shift in your thoughts? Try to notice that moment, and see if you can build on it.

Patient: Right after I said it there was that tiny blink — my chest loosened for a moment and my thoughts weren't as frantic. My hand still hovered and within seconds the doubt started sneaking back, like it always does, and I almost checked the phone anyway. I can see how that blink could be a chance to do something different, but honestly it feels a bit performative and I'm skeptical it will stop the next wave — how is stretching that half-second into anything real supposed to help?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that tiny blink was enough to create a small reprieve, but the doubt still crept back in. And you're right, it does feel performative, like you're trying to make something happen instead of just being with what's already there.

One way to think about it is that that blink was a tiny glimpse of what you might be able to do when you're not trying to fix everything. It was a small moment of clarity, a tiny spark of hope. And that spark might be enough to keep the panic from overwhelming you for a little while longer.

It's not about stretching that blink into something real right away. It's about seeing that spark, and being willing to take a tiny step towards being with what's already there, even if it's just for a moment. And from there, you can try to see if you can build on that moment, and do something more.

Can you try to focus on that tiny spark, and see if you can be with it for a little while longer? Not to fix everything, but just to be with it.

Patient: I tried holding onto that little blink — my chest eased for a beat and a thought quieted, but it feels like a tiny island and the tide of doubt rushes back almost immediately. I can try to sit with it longer, but I'm really worried that staying with the feeling just makes the anxiety hang around and then I'm left to endure it without a real way out. How is being with that spark supposed to help me stop automatically reaching for reassurance in the long run?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to hold onto that tiny blink, but the doubt is still overwhelming. And you're right, it does feel like a temporary reprieve, rather than a lasting solution.

One way to think about it is that being with that spark isn't about trying to fix everything or make the anxiety go away. It's about developing a sense of connection to your own body and mind, and learning to be with whatever comes up, even if it's uncomfortable.

It's not about finding a way out of the anxiety, but about learning to be with it in a new way. It's about finding a sense of curiosity and interest in the feeling, rather than trying to push it away or escape from it.

Think of it like this: when you're in a difficult situation, your body is trying to tell you something. It's not trying to scare you or overwhelm you, it's trying to alert you to something important. And by paying attention to that feeling, you can start to understand what it's trying to tell you.

Can you try to approach that spark with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to fix it or escape from it? See if you can learn to be with the feeling, and what it's trying to tell you.

Patient: I'll try, but I'm skeptical — how is being curious about it supposed to stop me reaching for my phone? When I actually notice it, it feels like a small alarm saying I'm fragile and that people might judge or abandon me, so the phone feels like a lifeline. Noticing that calms me a bit for a second, but it also makes me feel more exposed, and I hate feeling exposed, so the urge for reassurance is still loud.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being curious about the feeling might not be enough to stop you from reaching for your phone. It's like the phone is a coping mechanism that helps you deal with the anxiety and the fear of being exposed.

It's almost like you're caught in a loop where you're trying to calm down one part of your anxiety, but the other part of your anxiety is making you feel even more anxious. The phone is a way to try to control the feeling of exposure, even if it's just a temporary fix.

Can you try to explore this loop a bit more? What happens when you reach for your phone? Does it really make you feel better, or is it just a way to avoid dealing with the underlying anxiety?

Also, what do you think would happen if you didn't reach for your phone? Would you feel even more anxious, or would you be able to deal with the feeling of exposure in a different way?

Patient: When I reach for my phone it’s like someone turns down the volume on the panic — my chest eases, my thoughts slow, and I feel a tiny safe bubble for maybe ten minutes. After that I usually feel worse: embarrassed I needed it, ashamed I couldn’t sit with the feeling, and the doubt comes back louder, so I message again and the loop continues. If I didn’t reach for it the panic spikes and feels unbearable at first — sometimes it fades on its own after a while, sometimes I distract myself with work and ruminate later — and every time I try to just sit with it, it still feels like torture in the moment. Honestly, I’ve tried that “sit with it” bit before and it just feels like prolonging the pain; how is making myself suffer longer supposed to stop the habit when the phone gives instant relief?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the phone is a coping mechanism that provides temporary relief from the panic, but also perpetuates the cycle of shame, doubt, and anxiety. It's like you're stuck in a vicious loop where you're trying to manage one symptom, but it's actually making the other symptoms worse.

It's also understandable that sitting with the feeling without the phone feels like torture. When we're in the midst of a crisis, our brain is trying to protect us from pain, and that means we can't just sit with it and make it worse. Our brain is trying to help us survive, even if it's not helping us deal with the underlying anxiety.

One thing to consider is that the goal isn't to make yourself suffer longer, but to find a way to break the cycle. It's not about being a hero and sitting with the pain, but about finding a way to be with yourself that doesn't involve the phone.

Can you think of it this way: the phone is like a Band-Aid that covers up the wound, but it's not actually healing it. What if you could find a way to treat the wound, without relying on the Band-Aid? What if you could find a way to be with yourself that doesn't involve the phone, but still helps you cope with the anxiety?

Patient: Maybe — I could try a swap instead of the phone: when the urge hits I say, “Wait, I’ve got this,” tuck the phone away, and either jot one sentence in a tiny notebook or take a one-minute walk to the loo. Or set a rule: don’t message anyone for 10 minutes, and if I still need reassurance then I send a pre-written, very short text so it’s not a frantic plea. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the panic feels like it’ll crush me in those first two minutes? I’ll try one of those for a week, but I’m not optimistic — I’ll tell you straight if it just feels like more delaying.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to replace the phone with a more positive coping mechanism. The swap you described, where you say "Wait, I've got this" and then take a few minutes to calm down, could be a good starting point. It's not about replacing the phone completely, but about finding a way to break the cycle.

It's understandable that you're skeptical, given the intense panic you experience. It's like you're waiting for the storm to pass, but you're not sure if you'll be able to make it to the other side.

Can I ask, what's holding you back from trying the swap? Is it the fear of not being able to calm down, or is it something else? And what do you think will happen if you try the swap for a week and it doesn't work out? Will you be able to acknowledge that it's not working and try something else, or will you feel like you've failed?

Patient: What's holding me back is the first-two-minute terror — it genuinely feels like I won't make it without the phone, and that fear is loud. There's also the shame: I'm scared I'll fail at the swap and then feel even worse for trying, like I should've known better. I'll try the week and I will tell you straight if it just feels like more delaying and leaves me more frustrated, but how is doing that supposed to actually change things in the long run?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're being honest about the fear and shame that's holding you back. The first two minutes of terror can be overwhelming, and it's understandable that you're scared of not being able to cope without the phone.

The shame and fear of failure are also very real emotions. It's like you're stuck in a loop of "if I try and fail, I'll be worse off than before." This can be a powerful motivator, but it's also a negative one. It's causing you to hesitate and question whether trying the swap is even worth it.

In a way, acknowledging that you're scared and that it's holding you back is a huge step. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're not okay with just accepting your situation. By acknowledging this fear and shame, you're opening yourself up to the possibility of change.

It's not about changing things in the long run right now. It's about taking a small step, trying the swap, and seeing how it feels. If it doesn't work out, you can always go back to what you're doing now. But if it does work, who knows? You might find that it's a game-changer.

Can I ask, what's the worst that could happen if you try the swap and it doesn't work out? Is it really as bad as you think it is?

Patient: Worst-case, I try the swap, the panic spikes, I look shaky or say something odd in front of parents or colleagues, and I end up feeling humiliated and more ashamed — like I’ve blown my reputation. More likely it’s just an intense few minutes that pass and then I ruminate, so nothing catastrophic happens, but it feels unbearable in the moment. So again — how is risking that supposed to help me long-term when all I can picture is making a fool of myself?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that trying the swap will lead to a public humiliation, which is a huge fear for you. The thought of feeling ashamed and humiliated in front of others is a very real and painful one.

It's understandable that you're concerned about the potential consequences, especially in a situation where you're already feeling anxious and vulnerable. The fear of making a fool of yourself is a powerful one, and it's natural to want to avoid it.

However, I want to gently suggest that this fear might be preventing you from taking the first step towards change. By letting this fear hold you back, you're not really giving yourself a chance to try something new, even if it's just a small step.

Can I ask, how would you feel if you never tried the swap, and instead just stuck with your current situation? Would you be truly happy with that, or would you be constantly wondering what could have been?

It's also worth considering that the worst-case scenario you described might not be as bad as you think it is. What if, instead of feeling humiliated, you were able to laugh it off or talk it through with the people around you? What if it actually helped to break down your fears and build confidence?

I'm not suggesting that this will make a difference right now, but it's something to consider. Are you willing to take a small risk and try the swap, even if it feels scary?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the swap for a week, but I’m skeptical. This feels like a lot right now and I’m already worn thin; the first two minutes still terrify me. Before I try it, can we make a concrete backup plan — like permission to step outside for a minute, a pre-written one-line text to send if I really need to, or a tiny physical action I can do in place (press thumb and forefinger together for 30 seconds)? And honestly — how is that supposed to stop the shame spiral afterward if I still mess up?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try the swap. Having a concrete backup plan can help you feel more secure and in control.

Let's create a backup plan together. What kind of situation are you most likely to need to step away from quickly? Is it when you're talking to someone, when you're in a meeting, or when you're in a situation where you're feeling overwhelmed?

For example, if you need to step away quickly, could we create a pre-written one-line text that you can send to someone you trust, like a colleague or a family member? This could be something like "Hey, I need a minute to take care of something. Can you check in with me in 10 minutes?"

Alternatively, could we create a tiny physical action that you can do in place to help calm yourself down? For example, you could press your thumb and forefinger together for 30 seconds, or you could take a few deep breaths and do a quick stretch.

Regarding the shame spiral, I want to acknowledge that it's a real concern. However, I want to suggest that having a backup plan can actually help you feel more confident and less anxious about making a mistake. By having a plan, you're not putting yourself in a situation where you're going to fail, and you're not going to feel as bad about it.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you didn't have a backup plan, and you still made a mistake? How would you feel about it then?

Patient: Without a backup plan I’d probably freeze, then replay it over and over — humiliated, like I’d ruined whatever little respect I have, maybe calling in sick the next day to avoid people. I don’t really see how a one-line text or pressing my fingers together stops that shame spiral afterward — how is that supposed to help me not ruminate for days? I’m not sure I follow how the immediate aftermath would be handled; can we walk through exactly what I’d do in the ten minutes after the swap fails so it doesn’t turn into a full-blown shame episode?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that without a backup plan, you'd be stuck in a cycle of shame and rumination.

Let's break down what might happen in the immediate aftermath of the swap failing, and see if we can identify some potential strategies to help you cope with the shame spiral.

Assuming the swap fails, and you feel embarrassed or humiliated, here's a possible scenario:

* You take a few deep breaths, and try to calm down (this is where the pre-written one-line text or physical action like pressing your fingers together could come in handy).
* You take a moment to assess the situation, and realize that it's not the end of the world. You might think to yourself, "Okay, this is awkward, but I can handle it."
* You start to think about how you can salvage the situation. For example, you might try to laugh it off, or make a joke to lighten the mood.
* You might also think about what you can learn from the experience. For example, you could think, "Well, I guess I need to work on my ability to handle this kind of situation."
* If you're feeling overwhelmed, you might start to ruminate on the experience. You might think about all the things you could have done differently, or replay the conversation in your head.

Now, let's talk about how to break up this shame spiral. One strategy is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in negative thinking. You could try to focus on your breath, or your physical sensations. You could also try to shift your attention away from the shame and embarrassment, and towards something more neutral.

Another strategy is to try to reframe your thinking. Instead of thinking, "I'm such a failure," you could try to reframe it as, "I made a mistake, but I can learn from it." This can help you to see the experience as a learning opportunity, rather than a source of shame.

I want to emphasize that this is not about avoiding the shame or the embarrassment. It's about learning to cope with it in a healthy way. By developing strategies to manage your shame and rumination, you can start to break the cycle and move forward.

Can I ask, what do you think is the most challenging part of this process for you? Is it the shame and embarrassment, or is it something else entirely?

Patient: Mostly it’s the first two minutes and the fallout after — that instant terror that makes me feel exposed and the shame that follows, replaying it until I practically relive the humiliation. I’m also afraid that trying something different and failing will make the rumination worse, not better. Okay, so practically — when my brain is screaming “you’ve ruined everything,” how am I supposed to actually reframe that in the moment so it doesn’t turn into hours of replaying?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the initial shock and the aftermath are the most challenging parts for you. The instant terror and the feeling of exposure are intense emotions, and it's understandable that they would be replayed in your mind.

Reframing your thoughts in the moment can be difficult, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed and scared. However, one strategy that might help is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in negative thinking. You could try to ask yourself, "What am I thinking right now?" or "What's the one thing I can do to feel better in this moment?"

Another strategy is to try to find a small, immediate goal that you can work towards. This could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. By focusing on something small and tangible, you might be able to calm yourself down and break the cycle of negative thinking.

Regarding your fear that trying something different and failing will make the rumination worse, it's a valid concern. However, it's also possible that trying something new and failing might actually help you to break the cycle of rumination. By taking a small risk and facing your fears, you might be able to gain some insight and perspective that you didn't have before.

It's also worth noting that the idea that you've "ruined everything" is likely an exaggeration. It's possible that the experience was difficult, but it's not necessarily a catastrophic failure. By trying to reframe your thoughts in a more positive light, you might be able to gain some perspective and move forward.

Can I ask, what do you think is the worst thing that could happen if you try to reframe your thoughts and fail? Is it the potential for increased rumination, or something else entirely?

Patient: Worst-case is pretty much what I said — it backfires: I feel exposed and humiliated, replay it for days, maybe even call in sick to avoid people. I'm scared reframing will just give me something to fail at and then I'll feel twice as foolish. I'm not sure I follow how saying a kinder thought in the moment actually stops the replay later — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that reframing your thoughts in the moment will only make things worse, and that it won't actually help you to break the cycle of negative thinking.

You're right that reframing your thoughts in the moment might not be a magic bullet, and that it's possible that it could backfire and make you feel even more exposed or humiliated. However, I want to suggest that reframing your thoughts is not about avoiding failure or trying to will yourself to a certain outcome. It's about changing the way you're thinking about yourself and your situation, and trying to find a more compassionate and realistic perspective.

In terms of how reframing your thoughts in the moment might help, it's not about stopping the replay of the experience later. Instead, it's about trying to find a way to make the experience feel less painful and less embarrassing in the moment. By reframing your thoughts, you might be able to find a way to reframe the experience as something that happened, rather than something that defines you.

For example, if you're replaying the experience of feeling exposed and humiliated, you might be thinking something like, "I'm such a failure. I ruined everything." But if you could reframe that thought in the moment, you might be thinking something like, "I made a mistake, but it's not the end of the world. I can learn from it and move forward." By reframing the thought in a more compassionate and realistic way, you might be able to find a way to move forward more quickly, and to reduce the replay of the experience later.

Can I ask, what do you think is the most compassionate way to think about yourself right now? How would you want to be treated if you were in your own shoes?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — if I tried to be compassionate with myself I'd probably say something like, "This was hard, you did what you could, you can try again," or imagine talking to a student gently instead of tearing myself down. But honestly, how is saying kinder things supposed to stop the replaying and the shame afterward when it all still feels so raw and automatic? I can try the wording, but I need to know how that actually changes what happens ten minutes, or ten hours, later.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to understand how reframing your thoughts in a kinder way might actually help, and you're wondering how it would affect the replaying and shame that follows.

Reframing your thoughts in a kinder way might seem like a simple solution, but it's actually a more complex process. It's not just about saying kinder things to yourself, but about changing the way you're thinking about yourself and your situation.

When you're replaying the experience, you're often thinking about it in a more critical and judgmental way. You might be thinking, "I'm so stupid for forgetting that," or "I'm such a failure for not being able to handle that situation." These thoughts can be really painful and can make it hard to move on.

By reframing your thoughts in a kinder way, you're trying to change the narrative around the experience. You're saying to yourself, "This was hard, but I did what I could. I can try again." This can help you to shift your focus away from the shame and criticism, and towards a more positive and compassionate attitude.

It's not to say that the shame and criticism won't still be there, but it's possible to learn to respond to them in a more gentle and compassionate way. It's like learning to talk to a student who's struggling, instead of tearing them down. You're still acknowledging their struggles, but you're doing it in a way that's supportive and encouraging.

It's a process that takes time and practice, but it's possible to learn to be kinder and more compassionate towards yourself. And it's not just about the wording, it's about the way you're thinking about yourself and your situation.

Can I ask, what do you think is the most challenging part of trying to be kinder to yourself? Is it the initial thought process, or is it the feeling of shame and criticism that follows?

Patient: Mostly it's the shame and that automatic replay — the kinder words feel hollow when the panic is loud and my mind's already running scenes. I'm not sure I follow how saying something gentle to myself in the moment actually stops the hours of ruminating afterward; how is that supposed to help when the shame just keeps looping?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and automatic replay are really the core of your struggle, and that's where the kinder words might feel a bit hollow.

To be honest, I think there's a bit of a misconception here. Saying kinder words to yourself in the moment might not necessarily stop the replaying and ruminating afterward. In fact, it might not even seem to have an immediate effect on the shame and anxiety that's driving those thoughts.

However, what I do think is possible is that kinder words can help you to develop a bit more self-compassion and understanding in the long run. When you're in the midst of a panic, it's hard to think clearly and feel anything other than shame and anxiety. But if you can develop a bit more kindness and compassion towards yourself, even in small moments, it might help you to be a bit more gentle with yourself later on.

It's not a magic cure, and it's not going to make the shame and anxiety go away overnight. But it might help you to develop a bit more resilience and coping skills, which could make it a bit easier to deal with the shame and anxiety in the long run.

Can I ask, do you think it's possible to practice self-compassion and kindness towards yourself, even when you're feeling really overwhelmed and anxious? Maybe we can explore some small ways to start practicing that, even if it feels a bit awkward or uncomfortable at first.

Patient: Maybe — but it feels pretty hollow when the panic's already roaring. I could try a tiny practice: a one-line self-compassion phrase like, "This is hard, I'm doing my best," or a quick hand-on-heart cue, and then write one sentence afterward so I don’t ruminate all night. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the replaying for hours afterward?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to calm yourself down in the moment, but the panic is still overwhelming. I get that. The one-line phrases and hand-on-heart cues might not seem like a lot, but they can be a start.

I want to push back a bit on the idea that it's supposed to stop the replaying for hours afterward. That's a pretty tall order, especially when you're dealing with intense anxiety and shame. What I'm trying to suggest is that these small practices might help you feel a tiny bit more grounded and calm, even if it's just for a minute or two.

It's not about making the replaying stop completely, but more about giving yourself a tiny bit of breathing room to think about what's going on. When you're in the midst of a panic, it's hard to think clearly and remember that you're doing the best you can. These small practices might help you tap into that tiny bit of self-compassion and understanding, even if it's just for a brief moment.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were able to calm yourself down just a tiny bit? Would it make it easier to write down one sentence later and try to move forward?

Patient: Maybe — if I could calm even a little I think I could actually write that one sentence and it might give me a tiny break from replaying it in my head, enough to stop the loop getting louder. But I'm worn thin and honestly skeptical: I'm not sure I follow how that little pause actually prevents hours of rumination later, so I need it spelled out — what exactly should the sentence say, and who would be on the other end of that one-line text if I need it?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the loop of rumination, and you're wondering what exactly that one-line text could say to help you feel more grounded.

I want to suggest that the sentence doesn't need to be a lot, but it does need to be specific and honest. It's like a little anchor that you can cling to when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Here's an example of a one-line sentence that might help: "I'm taking care of myself, one step at a time." This sentence is simple, yet it acknowledges that you're doing the best you can, and that you're taking care of yourself.

As for who would be on the other end of that one-line text, I'm not suggesting that you send it to anyone else. This is a personal, private message to yourself. You're essentially talking to yourself, and asking yourself to be kind and compassionate.

The idea is that when you're feeling overwhelmed, and you send yourself that one-line text, you'll pause for a moment, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that you're doing okay. It's like a little reboot, to help you refocus and move forward.

It's not a magic solution, and it won't make all your worries disappear. But it might help you feel a tiny bit more grounded, and give you the courage to take that next step. Does that make sense?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — texting myself feels odd and a bit pointless. How is sending "I'm taking care of myself, one step at a time" actually supposed to stop the replay for hours? If I did need a real person on the other end, who would you recommend I pick (a colleague, my sister), and what exactly should that one-sentence I jot down afterward say so it doesn't just become another hollow thing I ignore?

Therapist Answer:
I can see how texting yourself might feel odd or pointless, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed.

As for stopping the replay, I was trying to suggest that the act of sending a message to yourself, even if it's just a text, can be a tiny step towards acknowledging that you need to take care of yourself. It's not about avoiding the replay, but more about acknowledging that it's happening and trying to find a way to move forward.

If you do need to talk to someone, it's not about choosing a colleague or a sister specifically, but more about finding someone who can listen and offer support without judgment. It could be a therapist, a trusted friend, or even a support group. Whoever it is, the goal is to find someone who can listen and offer guidance without trying to fix everything.

As for the one-sentence you jot down afterward, I'm not suggesting that it should say anything profound or wise. It's more about acknowledging your emotions and acknowledging that you need help. It could be something simple, like "I'm feeling really overwhelmed" or "I need help now." The goal is to find a sentence that feels honest and realistic, and that acknowledges your need for help.

The most important thing is to be honest and compassionate with yourself. You're not alone, and you're doing the best you can right now.

I want to ask, What do you think about this whole conversation so far? Do you feel like it's helping you move forward, or are you feeling overwhelmed and stuck?

Patient: I'm worn thin and still skeptical — part of me thinks the swap could be a tiny start, but I'm not sure I follow how sending myself a line or doing a fingertip press actually stops hours of replay. This conversation's helped me shape a plan, but I need concrete step-by-step stuff: who exactly should be my backup person, the precise one-line text I send them if I'm really panicking, and the exact sentence I should jot afterward so it actually grounds me and doesn't feel hollow.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that repeating felt muddled and it's draining me. Give me one clear, concrete backup plan right now: who should be my backup person (pick colleague or sister and say why), the exact one-line text to send them if I'm panicking, the exact single sentence I should jot afterward to ground me and stop replaying, a one-line permission I can use to step outside for a minute, and one tiny physical action to do in place. And be blunt: how exactly is that supposed to stop the shame loop afterward? I'm worn thin and skeptical, so spell it out plainly.

Patient: I'm confused by the stop stuff and I'm worn thin, but okay — here's the concrete plan I asked for. I'm skeptical, but I'll try it.

- Backup person: a colleague (someone at school). Why: they know the setting, can respond quickly without making it family drama, and are less likely to moralize than a relative.  
- Exact one-line text to send them if I'm panicking: "I need a quick check-in in 10 mins — feeling overwhelmed. Can you text me then?"  
- Exact single sentence to jot afterward (to ground and limit rumination): "This was hard; I did my best and I will rest now."  
- One-line permission to step outside: "Excuse me for a minute — I need to step outside."  
- Tiny physical action to do in place: press thumb and forefinger together for 30 seconds (slow, deliberate pressure).

How that's supposed to help (bluntly): the text + step-out line gives you permission and a scripted escape so you don't freeze or panic and reach for the phone; the thumb‑press is a quick bodily anchor to slow the panic and buy seconds; the 10‑minute rule plus the single jot externalizes the event (it becomes a bounded thing you recorded, not an endless loop in your head); the colleague check-in normalizes the reaction so shame has less fuel. It won't make the shame vanish immediately — it breaks the automatic loop and, with repetition, should weaken the habit and reduce the hours of replay. I'm trying this, but honestly I'm still skeptical and drained.
