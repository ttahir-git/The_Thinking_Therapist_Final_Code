Patient: I've been feeling kind of stuck since the move — this constant low mood and lack of motivation is bleeding into my relationship and I can't seem to shake it. I work as a chef, I'm normally outgoing and adaptable, but my OCD and this slump make even simple things feel huge. I've tried things before and I'm skeptical—how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight lately. It's not about talking about it to find answers, but more about finding a way to approach these overwhelming feelings.

Can you tell me more about what a "simple thing" looks like for you right now? How does your OCD typically show up in your daily life, and what are some of the things that feel the most manageable or unbearable?

Patient: Simple things feel huge — like making coffee, stepping out the door for a shift, or even answering a text from my partner; those tiny starts feel exhausting. My OCD’s mostly checking and contamination stuff: I double- and triple-check knives, doors, wash my hands until they sting, and intrusive doubts keep popping up while I’m supposed to be cooking. Small, repeatable routines are the only things I can manage; anything that requires starting, deciding, or being emotionally open is unbearable and just makes me shut down. I’ve done therapy and techniques before — how is talking about this supposed to help now?

Therapist: It sounds like your OCD is creating a lot of distance between you and the everyday tasks you need to perform. The checking and contamination behaviors are understandable, but they're also exhausting, aren't they? It's like you're constantly on high alert, waiting for something to go wrong.

Can you tell me more about how it feels to experience these intrusive doubts while cooking? It's like you said, it's like a voice popping up in your head, and it's hard to ignore. Do you ever feel like you're just "going through the motions" of cooking, or that you're actually present in the moment, or is it more like you're trying to push through the discomfort and get to the end of the task?

Patient: Most of the time when I'm cooking it's like I'm half on autopilot — my hands know what to do but my head's full of doubts and checks. I'll finish a prep, then some voice says, "Did you wipe that board? Was that raw juice on the counter?" and I go back, rewash, re-check, wash my hands until they sting. It kills any flow or joy, makes me late or snap at my partner, and I've tried mindfulness and exposure stuff before—how is that supposed to actually help me when service is chaotic? I want to feel present sometimes, but anything that isn't rote feels impossible.

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in this cycle of constant checking and self-questioning, even when you're trying to focus on the task at hand. It's exhausting, not just physically but also emotionally.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when the service is chaotic, and you feel like you're on the verge of cracking? Is it like you're trying to hold everything together, but it's all starting to feel like it's slipping away from you? Do you ever feel like you're just trying to survive, rather than actually enjoy the experience of cooking and serving?

Patient: When service gets chaotic everything speeds up and my head goes into overdrive — orders pile up and I start rechecking knives, counters, washing my hands till they sting while everything else falls behind. I feel like I'm just holding the place together, surviving the shift, then snapping at my partner afterward because I'm wrecked and guilty. Since the move the low mood sticks around more, so I don't bounce back between shifts and it just accumulates. I've tried mindfulness and exposure before — honestly, how is talking about this supposed to help when the chaos is constant and unpredictable?

Therapist: It's like the chaos of service is feeding into your OCD, making it even harder to cope with the constant checking and self-questioning. It's a vicious cycle, where one thing feeds into the other, and it's exhausting.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to feel guilty afterward, when the shift is over? Is it like you're beating yourself up over something specific, or is it more of a general feeling of frustration and inadequacy? And how does that guilt affect your relationship with your partner? Does it create tension or distance between you two?

Patient: Mostly it's this gnawing, general guilt — not about one thing, just that I keep snapping and then apologizing like that fixes it, and it never does. My partner's pulled back, we argue more, and there's less patience and less… closeness, which just makes me shut down even more. I've said some of this in therapy before, so forgive me, but how is talking about the guilt actually supposed to change any of that when I still go back to the same habits?

Therapist: It's like the guilt is a constant companion, one that you can't shake even when you're trying to make amends or move forward. It's like it's a weight that's pulling you down, making it harder to connect with your partner and feel more grounded.

Can you tell me more about what it means to "shut down" for you? Is it like you're physically exhausted, or is it more of a emotional numbness? And how does that affect your relationships, like with your partner? Do you feel like you're just going through the motions, or is there a sense of disconnection that's hard to explain?

Patient: Shutting down is mostly emotional numbness — I go quiet, stop texting, and just kind of check out; sometimes I crash physically and can’t get off the couch after a shift. It kills any spontaneity or intimacy with my partner, so we drift and I get more defensive or guilty, which makes me pull away even more. I’ve said this before in therapy — how is laying this out supposed to actually change the way I end up retreating?

Therapist: It's like the numbness is a shield, one that you use to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable. And it's not just physical numbness, but also emotional; it's like you're shutting down all your emotional responses, all your connection to your partner and the world around you.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to be in that state of numbness? Is it like you're observing yourself from outside, like you're watching a movie of your own life? Or is it more like you're in a fog, where everything is unclear and distant? And how does that affect your sense of self, your sense of who you are and what you want?

Patient: It's more like a fog — I'm there doing the job but kind of watching myself from the outside, everything feels distant and muted. It messes with who I think I am; I don't have clear wants or energy, and intimacy or plans just feel pointless a lot of the time. I'm trying to explain it, but honestly—how is talking about being numb supposed to actually help me?

Therapist: It's like you're living in a state of suspended animation, where everything feels distant and disconnected. It's like you're trying to describe it, but the words aren't quite right, and it's hard to put into words.

Can I try something? Instead of talking about your numbness, I want to try and help you find a sense of connection to it. Can you tell me what it's like to be in that state, right now? What do you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell? Try to bring it to the surface, even if it feels uncomfortable or difficult. Maybe that's where we can start to find some answers.

Patient: Okay — right now it feels like I'm behind a fogged window. The kitchen is full of sharp smells — garlic, oil, a faint bleach undercurrent — but they all seem dulled, like I'm smelling them through cotton; I hear the clatter and shouts but it’s muffled and there's that inner voice repeating checks. My hands feel numb and tingly from washing, the knife handle is familiar and distant at the same time, and my chest is this heavy, leaden thing that makes everything slower. I can say this stuff, but how is naming it supposed to stop me from zoning out or from losing it when service goes off the rails?

Therapist: It sounds like you're creating a vivid picture of what's going on inside you right now. The fog, the dulled smells, the muffled sounds, the numbness, the leaden chest... it's like you're painting a picture of a very specific emotional state.

I want to try something. Instead of asking you to stop zoning out or losing it, I want to ask you to try and stay with this feeling. Can you try to hold onto this sense of being behind a fogged window, with the dulled smells and muffled sounds? Can you try to stay with the numbness and the leaden chest, even though it's uncomfortable?

It's not about trying to change or fix the feeling, it's just about being with it. Can you try that? Can you try to stay with this feeling, even for just a little bit longer?

Patient: Alright — I'll try. Right now the fog gets heavier the more I focus: my breathing gets shallow, my hands tingle more, and that inner voice gets louder, like it's daring me to ignore it. I'm sitting with it, but it's uncomfortable and I can feel my chest tighten — and honestly, how is staying here supposed to stop me from snapping back into checks when the line gets slammed? I've sat with this before and it just felt like spiraling, so I'm skeptical this will change much.

Therapist: It's like you're pushing against the fog, trying to keep it at bay, but it's getting harder and harder to breathe. The numbness is getting more intense, the leaden chest is getting heavier, and the inner voice is getting louder and more insistent.

I want to acknowledge that it's okay to be skeptical. It's okay to wonder if this is going to make a difference. But I want to ask you to try and let go of that skepticism for just a moment. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the fog, rather than trying to change it?

It's not about changing the fog, it's about being present with it. Can you try to sit with the fog, rather than trying to push it away or ignore it? It might seem strange, but sometimes just being with a feeling can be enough to shift it.

And I'm not saying that it's going to stop the checks when the line gets slammed. But I am saying that it might help you be more present, more aware, and more able to respond in a way that feels more connected to your values and your goals. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried staying with it — the fog got thicker, my breathing got shallow, and that inner voice just turned up until it felt like spiraling. I did notice that the checks spike when I'm scared of screwing up or getting shouted at — it's more shame/fear than cleanliness sometimes — but honestly, how is noticing that supposed to stop it when the line goes to hell? I need something concrete I can do on the line, like one tiny action that won't make me fall apart; what exactly would you have me try in the middle of chaos?

Therapist: I can see that you're trying to hold onto your connection to the feeling, and it's taking a toll. It's understandable that you're looking for something concrete to do on the line, something that will help you cope without falling apart.

In this moment, I want to introduce a small, simple action that might help. It's not about changing your behavior or fixing the situation; it's just about creating a tiny bit of space between you and your fears. Can you try taking a deep breath and saying one word out loud: "Enough." Just say it. It's a small word, and it's not about what you're feeling or thinking; it's just about acknowledging the fact that you're feeling overwhelmed.

It might sound silly, but try it. Say "Enough" out loud, and then take another breath. Don't try to change anything else; just focus on that one word. Can you try it now, even though it's hard?

Patient: Okay, fine—I'll try it. "Enough." 

Weirdly, my shoulders loosened a little and I could actually take a deeper breath for a second, but the inner voice was still there, like it paused then kept yelling. That felt slightly useful, I guess, but how is that supposed to help when service goes to shit and I can't just stand there saying words? Give me something concrete I can do on the line—one tiny action that doesn't make me look like I'm losing it or slow everyone down.

Therapist: I'm glad you said "Enough." It was a small step, and it might have helped you feel a tiny bit more grounded.

Now, I want to give you a small, concrete action you can take on the line. It's not about changing anything else, but it's about creating a tiny bit of space between you and the chaos. Can you try this: when you feel that inner voice starting to yell, look down at your hands. Just look at them. Notice the way they're holding the knife, the shape of your fingers, the feel of the handle in your palm.

It's not about fixing anything or changing your behavior; it's just about creating a small moment of awareness. Take your eyes off the chaos around you and look at your hands. Can you do that for just a second?

Patient: Okay — I look down. The knife's warm in my hand, there's a little scar on my thumb, my fingers feel tense but steady and I actually get a deeper breath for a second and the voice quiets a hair. I can do that for a second, but when tickets start flying I can't just stare at my hands — what's one tiny, practical action I can do on the line that won't slow me down or make me look like I'm checked out?

Therapist: It sounds like looking down at your hands helped you feel a bit more grounded. Now, I want to suggest a small, practical action you can take on the line. It's something that will help you stay focused and connected, even when things get chaotic.

Can you try this: when you take a ticket, pause for a second and make eye contact with the person it's for? Just look at them, hold their gaze for a brief moment, and then hand them the ticket. It's a simple action, but it can help you stay present and connected to the people around you.

It's not about changing your behavior or trying to fix the situation; it's just about creating a small moment of connection. Take a deep breath, look at the person, and give them the ticket. Can you do that for just a second?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is making eye contact supposed to help when I'm in the weeds? It feels like that'll slow me down or make me look nervous, and I need something I can do without people noticing. Maybe a one-count breath or a quick squeeze of the knife handle would be less obvious, but I've tried little tricks before and they don't stick — what exactly would you have me do when two tickets drop at once?

Therapist: I can see why making eye contact might seem like it would slow you down or make you look nervous. It's not about changing your behavior, but about creating a small moment of connection.

In that case, let's try something even smaller. When two tickets drop at once, can you try to count the tickets in your mind, silently? Just focus on the numbers, and let your brain handle it for a second. It's a quick, discreet action that can help you stay focused.

It's not about changing anything else, but about creating a small moment of calm. Take a deep breath, count the tickets in your head, and then get back to work. Can you do that for just a second?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is silently counting supposed to help when two tickets drop and my hands are already moving? I've tried breathing/counting tricks before and they just disappear in the chaos; my head floods and I either freeze or default to checking. Maybe something physical and instant—like pressing the pad of my thumb to that little scar on my hand—might be less likely to slip, but honestly I don't know if that would actually stick either.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to think of a way to maintain focus in the midst of chaos, and you're getting frustrated with the breathing and counting tricks not sticking.

Let's try something physical and instant. Can you try pressing the pad of your thumb to the scar on your hand when two tickets drop at once? It's a small, automatic action that might help you stay present and focused. It's not about thinking about it, but just doing it. Can you try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is pressing my thumb to a scar supposed to help when two tickets drop at once? Fine, I try it: thumb to scar, I feel the ridge, it sorta anchors me for a beat and the voice quiets a hair. But it still feels flimsy — what if my hands are wet or I'm slicing? I need something that works when I'm actually moving, not just a neat trick you suggest from a chair.

Therapist: I can see why you're skeptical about the scar trick. It's not a foolproof solution, and it might not work in all situations.

Let's think about this from a different angle. You mentioned that pressing your thumb to the scar helped you feel a bit more grounded for a brief moment. That's a good thing. Can you try to build on that small moment of connection?

Instead of trying to press your thumb to the scar again, can you try to find a way to re-establish that connection when your hands are moving? Maybe you can focus on the sensation of your thumb moving against your fingers, or the feeling of the knife handle in your hand. Can you try to use those physical sensations to help you stay present and focused?

It's not about relying on a single trick, but about finding a way to create a small moment of stability in the midst of chaos. Can you try to experiment with different ways to connect with your body and your movements?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is paying attention to the knife handle or my thumb supposed to help when my hands are flying and I can't slow down? I can try to notice pressure in my grip or do a silent three-count while I move, or slide my thumb along my ring (less risky than fiddling with a scar), but I've done stuff like this in practice and it disappears in real service. Give me one exact, practical step I can do in the middle of a rush that won't slow me or make me look like I'm checked out—what would that be?

Therapist: I can see why you're frustrated with trying to find a practical solution that works in the heat of the moment.

Can I ask you to try one specific, small action that might help? As you're moving to chop a piece of meat, can you try to look at the meat with your eyes, just for a brief moment, before you chop? It's not about analyzing it or thinking about it, just about glancing at it briefly. This small moment of eye contact might help you stay present and focused on the task at hand.

It's not a game-changer, but it might be a tiny, practical step that helps you stay grounded in the chaos of the kitchen. Can you try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is a quick glance at the meat supposed to help when my hands are already moving and tickets are flying? I'll try it next shift—just a half-second look before the chop—but the inner voice usually cuts in and I go back to checks. If that doesn't work in a real rush, what's one single backup move I can do in the middle of chaos that won't slow me down or make me look like I'm checked out?

Therapist: I can see why you're skeptical about the glance at the meat. It's not a foolproof solution, and it might not work in the midst of a rush.

Can I ask you to think of a very small, automatic action that you can do in the middle of chopping? It's something that's so automatic that you don't even think about it, but it might help you stay present. Can you try to pinch your lips together for a brief moment before you chop? It's a very small action, but it might help you feel more connected to what you're doing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is pinching my lips supposed to help when the line's exploding? Fine, I try it: pinch, release, and I get a tiny beat of focus and the voice quiets a hair, which feels almost helpful. But it's flimsy — when two tickets drop I still default to checking, and I'm tired of tricks that don't stick; what one concrete backup do you actually want me to do that won't slow me down or make me look checked out?

Therapist: I can see why you're looking for a concrete backup plan that you can actually rely on.

Can I ask you to try one very simple action when two tickets drop? Can you try to take a deep breath in through your nose, and then out through your mouth, without thinking about it? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. It's a very basic, automatic action that might help you stay present and calm.

Patient: Alright — I tried the breath (in, out) and it calmed me for a beat, but the checks creep back the second tickets drop. I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing supposed to help when my hands are already moving and the line's screaming? I need one exact physical backup I can do without slowing down or looking checked out; what single move do you want me to rely on when two tickets hit? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with all these little tricks—can we slow down and make a simple plan that actually might stick?

Therapist: I can see why you're feeling overwhelmed. I think it's time to take a step back and focus on a single, simple action that you can rely on.

Can you try this? When two tickets drop, can you simply... look down at your hands? That's it. Just take a glance at your hands, without thinking about anything else. It's a very basic, automatic action that might help you stay present and focused.

I want you to try this, and I want you to commit to it. No more tricks, no more half-hearted attempts. Just look down at your hands, and stay with that for a second. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it. I’ll make a point to look down at my hands the next time two tickets drop, but I’m skeptical it’ll stick when the line goes feral — I always snap back to checks.

Can we keep it to just two things though? Look at my hands as Plan A, and if that fails give me one single backup (pinch lips or thumb-to-scar) and we commit to those two. I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and lock that simple plan in so I don’t have to remember a dozen tricks?

Therapist: I think I understand your concern now. Let's simplify things and focus on just two plans.

Plan A: When two tickets drop, look down at your hands. Just take a brief glance, without thinking about anything else. This is your primary plan to stay present and focused.

Plan B: If you find yourself defaulting to checks (Pinch lips or thumb-to-scar), take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, without thinking about it. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

We'll commit to these two plans and focus on making them stick. No more tricks or half-hearted attempts. Just look at your hands and breathe, and if that doesn't work, pinch your lips or do the thumb-to-scar thing. Can you agree to try this simple plan?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it. Plan A: look down at my hands when two tickets drop. Plan B: if that fails, a quick deep breath, and if I’m still spiraling then pinch my lips or press my thumb to the scar. 

I’m skeptical it’ll actually stick in a real rush and I’m feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and practice one of these now so it doesn’t just disappear when service goes feral?

Therapist: Let's practice Plan A right now. When you're ready, take a moment to imagine two tickets dropping at your station. I want you to look down at your hands, just for a second, without thinking about anything else. Can you do that for me?

( pause )

Remember, it's just a quick glance. Don't think about checking the tickets or doing anything else. Just look down at your hands. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I did it. I imagined the two tickets, looked down at my hands, felt the knife in my grip and my shoulders loosen for a beat and the voice quieted a bit, but it felt fragile and I’m not convinced it’ll hold in a real rush. Can we practice Plan B now (deep breath, then pinch lips or thumb-to-scar)? I’m starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down and rehearse both until they actually stick?

Therapist: I'm glad you were able to practice Plan A and get a sense of how it feels.

Let's start with Plan B. Can you take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, without thinking about it? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. You can close your eyes if that helps.

( pause )

Now, if you find yourself getting distracted or starting to check, I want you to pinch your lips together. Just a quick, gentle pinch. Don't think about it too much, just do it. And if that doesn't work, we can try the thumb-to-scar thing too.

Let's practice a few times, and I want you to focus on getting the hang of it. Remember, it's not about trying to change anything or fix the situation, it's just about creating a small moment of calm and focus.

Ready to try? Take a deep breath, and then pinch your lips together. Go ahead.

Patient: Okay — I did it. Took the breath and pinched my lips; it bought me a tiny pause, shoulders eased for a beat and the voice quieted a hair. But it still feels fragile — when tickets drop my head floods and I get overwhelmed, so can we slow down and rehearse this in a simulated rush? Tell me exactly which order you want me to use (breath then pinch, or pinch then breath?), how long to hold the pinch so it doesn't look weird, and let's run it a couple more times.

Therapist: I'm glad you were able to practice Plan B and get a sense of how it feels.

Let's simulate a rush situation. I want you to use the following order: Pinch your lips, then take a deep breath. This will help you focus on the pinch first, and then use the breath to calm down and refocus.

When you pinch your lips, hold it for about 1-2 seconds. This will give you a brief moment of focus and calm before you take a breath.

We'll start with a simulated rush situation. Imagine two tickets dropping at your station. As soon as you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, I want you to pinch your lips and take a deep breath. Don't think about anything else, just focus on the pinch and the breath.

Let's run it a few times. Ready? Pinch your lips, take a deep breath, and refocus.

( pause )

How did that feel? Did you feel more in control?

Let's do it again. Same thing: Pinch your lips, take a deep breath, and refocus.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I did the pinch then breath a couple times and it gave me a tiny beat of space: shoulders eased, the voice quieted a hair. But I'm confused about how long to hold the pinch without looking weird, and in a real rush it still feels fragile — how is this actually supposed to stick when I'm moving a hundred miles an hour? Can we slow down and run it a few more times, maybe with you counting out the timing, because I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and I want to rehearse until it feels automatic.

Therapist: I'm glad you were able to practice the pinch and breath combination and get a sense of how it feels.

To help you feel more confident and in control, I want to break down the timing for you. Here's a simple way to think about it:

1. Pinch your lips for 1 second. This is a brief, sharp action that helps you focus and calm down.
2. Immediately after the pinch, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to breathe naturally and smoothly, without thinking about it too much.

The key is to keep the pinch short and sweet, so it doesn't feel forced or awkward. If you hold the pinch for too long, it can feel weird or uncomfortable.

Let's run it a few more times, with me counting out the timing. Ready?

Pinch your lips for 1 second, then take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Let's start now.

( pause )

How did that feel? Did you feel more in control and focused?

Let's try it again. Pinch your lips for 1 second, then take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

( pause )

And again. Pinch your lips for 1 second, then take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

( pause )

We'll keep going until you feel comfortable and confident with this routine. Remember, it's not about trying to change anything or fix the situation, it's just about creating a small moment of calm and focus.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I did the pinch+breath a few times and it gives a tiny beat, but it still feels fragile. How is that supposed to help when I'm elbow-deep in sauce and two tickets drop at once? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed—can we slow down and do a realistic run where you call out rapid tickets and count the timing so I can rehearse until it feels automatic? Also tell me exactly what to do if my hands are full and I can't pinch my lips.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to rehearse and try a more realistic scenario. I want to make sure you feel comfortable and confident with this routine.

Let's start with a slow and simple scenario. I'll call out rapid tickets, and you can practice your pinch+breath routine. If your hands are full and you can't pinch your lips, we'll work out a different plan.

Ready? Here's the scenario: You're working at a busy restaurant, and it's a rush hour. Two tickets drop at once, and you need to focus quickly. I'll call out the tickets, and you can practice your routine.

 Ticket 1: "Table 12, please deliver a plate of pasta with garlic bread."
 Ticket 2: "Table 7, please bring a glass of water and a bottle of red wine."
 Ticket 3: "Table 5, can you check on the status of the grilled chicken?"

Please respond with your actions, and I'll help guide you through the scenario.

(Remember, if your hands are full, you can try to take a deep breath and focus on the task at hand. We'll work out a different plan if needed.)

Patient: Alright — here's what I did in that scenario, step by step, and tell me if I'm missing something.

When Ticket 1 and 2 dropped together I looked down at my hands for a beat — saw the knife, felt the grip — that actually gave me a tiny beat of calm. Then I pinched my lips for about a second and did a quick in-through-the-nose, out-through-the-mouth while I started the first move, handed the ticket, and kept chopping without freezing. By Ticket 3 I felt the checks creeping, so because my hands were already busy I skipped the pinch and just took one quick breath while letting my thumb press lightly into the knife handle for a split second to anchor me — it wasn’t perfect but it stopped the spiral from fully kicking in.

I’m still skeptical — it felt fragile and mechanical, and I’m worried it won’t hold when the line is actually feral. Can we run that again but faster, like rapid-fire tickets, and have you call the timing so I can rehearse the exact tempo? I want to practice until it’s automatic because right now I’m feeling overwhelmed and worried I’ll forget.
