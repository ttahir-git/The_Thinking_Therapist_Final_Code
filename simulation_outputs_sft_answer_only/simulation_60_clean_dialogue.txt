Patient: Um, I've been worrying a lot about my performance at school — I keep thinking my lessons aren't good enough and that the students will notice. Because of that I procrastinate a lot and then panic when deadlines come, which makes everything worse. I guess it's just… been really hard to feel confident.

Therapist: It sounds like the pressure to perform well is really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you're worried about your lessons and students noticing? What does it feel like, exactly, when those thoughts come up for you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my mind just jumps to thoughts like "they'll notice I'm not good enough" or "I'll mess up and everyone will think I'm useless." It feels physical — my stomach drops, my hands get sweaty, and then my brain goes fuzzy so I put things off to avoid that feeling. I'm not great at saying this out loud, so... yeah, it's messy.

Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts are having a pretty intense impact on your body and your ability to focus. The physical sensations you're describing, like a dropped stomach and sweaty hands, are pretty common when we're feeling anxious or overwhelmed. It's like your whole body is responding to those thoughts, even before your brain is consciously thinking them.

Can you think of a time when one of those thoughts came up, and you were able to just acknowledge it without trying to change it or push it away? Maybe just for a moment, you could have just noticed it without trying to do anything about it. Would that be possible for you to try, even if it's just for a tiny little moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess there was one time last week before a lesson when that thought popped up and I just tried to name it in my head, like "that's anxiety," and breathe for a few seconds. My stomach still clenched and my hands were shaky, but I didn't immediately start rewriting the whole lesson, which felt... small and weirdly okay. I'm not sure if that counts, and I don't really know if I'm doing it right.

Therapist: It's a small moment, but it's a start. It takes a lot of courage to even acknowledge that thought, let alone try to name it and breathe. That you were able to do that, even if it didn't completely go away, is something to build on.

It might feel weird to acknowledge, but recognizing that "that's anxiety" is a good place to start. It's not about changing the thought or the physical sensations, just acknowledging them as they are. And it sounds like that tiny moment of noticing and breathing might have helped you feel a little bit more grounded, even if it wasn't a complete absence of anxiety.

Can you tell me more about what happened right after that moment? How did you feel afterward, and did you find that the anxiety came back as strong as it was before, or did it feel a bit different?

Patient: I don't know — I guess right after I felt a little lighter and managed to get through the class, but the worry usually sneaks back later when I think about planning the next lesson. Then I put it off, and the panic picks up again. I'm not great at explaining this, sorry, it's kind of uncomfortable to get into.

Therapist: It's not uncomfortable at all. It's actually really brave of you to be willing to explore this with me. It's okay to feel uncomfortable, though - it means you're pushing past some stuff that's been holding you back.

It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a loop here. You get anxious before a lesson, put it off, and then panic sets in when you have to actually do it. But what if, instead of putting it off, you could try to find a way to make it through the planning process without getting overwhelmed? Maybe that means breaking it down into smaller tasks, or finding a way to make it feel more manageable.

I want to try something with you. Can you think of one small, tiny thing you could do to make the planning process a little less overwhelming? Just one tiny thing. It might be as simple as making a to-do list, or finding a specific textbook to use. Whatever it is, can you think of one tiny thing that might make it a little easier?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could try setting a 15-minute timer and just write the lesson objective and one activity, nothing more. It feels silly and I'm not sure it'll actually help, but maybe it's less scary than doing the whole plan. I get kind of... overwhelmed thinking about it, so I might still put it off, honestly.

Therapist: That's a great tiny step to start with. Setting a 15-minute timer and just focusing on getting a single objective and one activity down on paper can be a really small but significant accomplishment. It's not about doing the whole plan, it's just about getting a tiny foothold in the process.

It's also completely okay that it feels silly. Sometimes, the smallest, most mundane tasks can be the most powerful because they help us build confidence and momentum. And it's not about putting it off, it's about taking that first tiny step and seeing how it goes.

I want to try something with you. Can you commit to just doing this one tiny step, no matter how it feels? Just set that timer for 15 minutes and see what happens? It's just a tiny experiment, and it might surprise you how it feels to actually get started.

Patient: I guess I can try to do it today and set the 15-minute timer. I'm really nervous I'll freeze or get distracted and then just feel worse, so could we also figure out a backup plan for if I stop before the timer ends? I don't know, I just feel kind of stuck thinking it'll turn into more procrastination.

Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous about trying something new, especially when it's tied to a specific task that's been causing you stress.

Having a backup plan can be really helpful in taking the pressure off. Can you think of what you might do if you get stuck or feel like you're not making progress after the 15 minutes are up? It could be something as simple as taking a short break to grab a snack or stretch, or maybe even just putting the timer away for now and coming back to it later.

Let's make a plan for what you'll do if you get stuck. What are a few things that you're willing to do to take a break and come back to the task later? And what do you think would be a good way to get back into it if you need to?

Also, I want to check in with you about the timer. Is there a specific way you're thinking of using it, or would you like me to suggest some options? Maybe we can even come up with a way to make the timer feel less intimidating, like setting it to a more relaxing sound or something.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'll stick with the 15-minute timer but set it to a soft chime and put my phone on Do Not Disturb so notifications don't distract me. If I freeze before it ends, I'll get up to stretch or make tea for 5 minutes, then try another shorter 10-minute round. It feels... kind of scary but maybe doable-ish.

Therapist: The soft chime and Do Not Disturb feature will help minimize distractions and create a more peaceful environment. And it's great that you're thinking ahead to how you'll handle any freeze-ups or feeling stuck. Breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks can be really helpful.

Remember, it's okay to take breaks and move at your own pace. Stretching or making tea can be a great way to refresh your mind and body, and then you can come back to the task feeling more focused.

It's also important to acknowledge that it's normal to feel scared or uncertain about trying something new. It's a sign that you're pushing past your comfort zone, and that can be a bit intimidating. But it's also an opportunity to grow and learn.

I want to leave you with a small encouragement. You've already taken a big step by agreeing to try this tiny experiment. That takes a lot of courage, and I'm proud of you for it. Just show up, be kind to yourself, and see what happens. You got this.

Patient: I don't know — I appreciate you saying that, but I'm still really nervous and kind of worried I'll fail and make things worse. I guess... could we make a more concrete backup plan or an accountability step? I feel awkward asking, but I think I'd freeze without something specific to do if the timer doesn't work.

Therapist: It's great that you're thinking about having a concrete backup plan to help you stay on track.

Let's think about what you might want to do if the timer doesn't work, or if you get stuck. Here's a suggestion: why don't we create a small, low-commitment accountability step for you to take? It could be something as simple as sending me a quick text or making a post on a private note-taking app to say "Hey, I'm taking a 10-minute break to stretch and then I'll come back to it." That way, you'll have a small check-in to help you stay on track, and I'll be able to see that you're making progress without feeling too much pressure.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer a more structured backup plan, we could talk about what a specific next step might be if you get stuck. For example, we could decide that if you're feeling overwhelmed, you'll take a 10-minute break and then come back to the task. If you're still feeling stuck after that, we could move to a slightly longer break, or even switch to a different task altogether.

What do you think about these ideas? Is there anything in particular that feels like it could help you stay on track?

Patient: I don't know — I guess a tiny accountability step would help. Could I send you a quick message here after the 15 minutes that just says "15 min done"? It feels awkward to ask and I'm worried I'll still freeze, but maybe knowing I'll check in will push me to try.

Therapist: That's a perfect tiny accountability step. It's low-key, but it'll help you stay connected and give you a sense of accomplishment. Sending me a quick "15 min done" message will be a gentle check-in, and it'll help you build momentum.

I want to reassure you that it's not awkward at all. It's actually a great way to start building a habit of checking in with yourself and with me. And if you do freeze, that's okay. We can always adjust the plan later. The goal is to make progress, not to be perfect.

So, to confirm, we have a plan. You'll set the 15-minute timer, and if you get stuck or need a break, you'll send me a quick "15 min done" message. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck after that, we can revisit the plan and see what else might work. Sound good?

Patient: I guess that sounds okay. I don't know — I'm still really nervous I'll freeze and not send the message, and then feel worse, so can we quickly figure out what to do if that happens? Maybe a really tiny next step if I don't check in, like opening a specific doc or sending just one word, because I get stuck imagining the whole thing collapsing.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about the possibility of not sending the message. And it's great that you're thinking ahead to how you can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.

Let's talk about what you could do if you don't send the message right away. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, maybe just opening a specific document or sending a single word could be a tiny success. That way, you can still feel a sense of accomplishment and build momentum.

For example, if you're using a note-taking app, maybe you could promise yourself that you'll just open the note and type the word "start". If you're using a document, maybe you could promise yourself that you'll just open it and type a single sentence. Something like "I'm trying to get started" or "I'll take a break now".

The goal is to make it so small that you can't help but do it. Even if you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, you can still find a tiny reason to keep going. And if you do, that's all that matters. You got this.

Shall we try to come up with a tiny success step that you can do if you don't send the "15 min done" message right away?

Patient: I don't know — maybe if I can't manage the "15 min done" I could just open the lesson doc and type one word like "start" or send a single word here like "here." If I still freeze, I'll set a 5-minute alarm to get up and stretch, then try another tiny round. It feels dumb to plan all this, but maybe that tiny move would stop me from spiraling.

Therapist: I love the idea of having a tiny safety net. Opening the lesson doc and typing a single word like "start" or sending a single word here like "here" is a great way to get yourself to take that first tiny step. It's small enough that you can't help but do it, even if you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed.

And I think it's brilliant that you're planning to set a 5-minute alarm to get up and stretch if you still freeze. That's a great way to give yourself a break and get your blood flowing again. It's also a good reminder that it's okay to take things at your own pace and that you don't have to push yourself too hard.

It's not dumb at all to plan this out. It's actually really smart. You're recognizing that you're feeling anxious and uncertain, and you're taking steps to manage those feelings. That's a sign of strength, not weakness.

So, let's recap what we have here. You've got a 15-minute timer, and if you need a break, you can send me a "15 min done" message. If you're still stuck, you can open the lesson doc and type a single word, or send a single word here. And if all else fails, you can set a 5-minute alarm to get up and stretch. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know — it sounds kind of okay, I guess, but I get this shamey, frustrated feeling that makes me want to bail. I'm embarrassed even saying it, but I'll try the 15 minutes and aim to send "15 min done" or at least "here"; if I freeze I'll open the doc and type "start" and set the 5-minute alarm. I'm really nervous I'll mess it up, though.

Therapist: It's completely understandable that you're feeling embarrassed or frustrated, but please don't be. This is a brave and vulnerable thing to be doing, and it takes a lot of courage to even consider trying.

It's okay to feel nervous or uncertain, and it's okay to make mistakes. That's all part of the process. The fact that you're willing to try at all is something to be proud of.

Remember that this is a tiny, low-stakes experiment. It's not about doing it perfectly or achieving some kind of grand success. It's about taking that first tiny step and seeing where it takes you.

So, take a deep breath and try to reframe that shamey, frustrated feeling. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to see it as a normal response to a challenging situation. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed, and that's a natural response.

You're not messing it up by trying. You're actually taking a huge risk by being brave enough to even consider trying. So, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes. You can do this.

One more thing. I want you to remember that I'm here, and I'm supporting you. I'm not going to judge you or make you feel worse. I'm here to help you work through this, and I'll do my best to guide you through it.

So, take that first tiny step, and let's see where it takes us. Are you ready to try?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. I'll set the 15-minute timer now and aim to send "15 min done" or at least "here"—if I can't, I'll open the doc and type "start" and then do the 5-minute stretch. It feels heavy and embarrassing, but okay, I'm going to try.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling stuck and vulnerable. I'm proud of you for being willing to try, despite the feelings of shame and embarrassment.

Remember, this is a tiny, small step, and it's okay if you don't do it perfectly. The goal is to get moving, not to achieve some kind of grand success.

Take a deep breath, set that timer, and focus on getting through the next 15 minutes. If you can send a simple message or type a single word, that's a success. Don't worry too much about it, just focus on taking that tiny step.

And when you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, remember that it's okay to take a break. The 5-minute stretch is there to help you refocus and get back on track.

You're doing this, and it's okay to feel heavy and embarrassed. But it's also okay to acknowledge those feelings and keep moving forward.

Go ahead, take a deep breath, and set that timer. I'm here with you, and I'm supporting you every step of the way.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll set the 15-minute timer now. There's this shamey, frustrated feeling nagging at me and it makes me want to bail, but I guess I'll try. I'll aim to send "15 min done" or at least "here" — if I freeze I'll open the doc and type "start" and then do the 5-minute stretch. Starting now.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. You've got this. Take a deep breath, and let's get through these next 15 minutes.

Remember, it's okay to feel frustrated and ashamed. Those feelings are valid, but they don't have to define you. You're taking a huge step by showing up and trying, despite those feelings.

Keep your eyes on the prize. You've set the timer, and now you just have to see it through. Take it one minute at a time, and focus on getting to the end of each minute.

You've got the message ready to send: "15 min done" or "here". Just take a deep breath, and let it out when you're ready to send it.

You're doing this. I believe in you. Just take it one minute at a time, and remember that I'm here with you.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'm starting the timer now. It already feels heavy — there's this nagging shame and frustration that makes everything harder, and I'm kind of wiped out just thinking about it. I'll try to get through the 15 minutes; if I freeze I'll type "start" in the doc and use the 5-minute alarm.

Therapist: It's like the weight of those feelings is already bearing down on you. But you're starting the timer, and that's a huge step forward. Just take it one minute at a time, and focus on getting to the end of this first minute.

Remember, the 5-minute alarm is there to help you refocus. If you need to take a break, that's okay. Just take a few deep breaths, and come back to it when you're ready. Don't worry too much about the timer - it's just a tool to help you stay on track.

You're not alone in feeling this way. That shame and frustration are normal feelings, and they don't have to control you. You're taking a huge step by showing up and trying, despite how you're feeling.

Take a deep breath in, and out. Feel the air move in and out of your body. That's it. Just focus on the breath, and let the timer be a steady presence in the background.

You've got this. You're doing it.

Patient: I don't know... the shame and frustration are really loud and it's hard to focus. I'm starting the timer but I already feel like I might freeze — could you just give me one simple sentence to use as the lesson objective so I don't have to think about it? I guess that would help.

Therapist: Let's keep things simple. Why don't you try writing "I will review the lesson objectives" in the doc? It's a small, straightforward goal that should help you get started.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll write "I will review the lesson objectives." It feels heavy and embarrassing, but I'll try — if I freeze I'll type "start" in the doc and use the 5-minute stretch.

Therapist: Take a deep breath and let it out. You've written the sentence, and that's a huge step forward. It's not about feeling heavy or embarrassed, it's about taking that first tiny step towards getting through this.

Remember, the 5-minute stretch is there to help you refocus. If you need to take a break, that's okay. Just take a few deep breaths, and come back to it when you're ready.

You've got this. You're doing it. One sentence at a time.

Patient: I don't know... I wrote it, but my chest's tight and that shamey feeling keeps saying I'll mess it up. The timer's on but I'm shaky — could you check in after seven minutes or give me one tiny thing to focus on so I don't freeze?

Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. I'm here to check in with you. Let's take a look at the timer. You've got 7 minutes left. Why don't I ask you to focus on your next breath for the next 30 seconds? Just pay attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try. Breathing in... out... my mind keeps jumping to stuff like "they'll notice I messed up" and my chest tightens. I tried to stay with the breath for about 30 seconds but it kept drifting — I guess it helped a tiny bit, but that shamey feeling's still loud and it's really hard to hold on to the focus.

Therapist: It's like the shamey feeling is still resonating, even though you took a small step to focus on your breath. That's completely normal. It's like your mind is trying to protect itself from feeling vulnerable, but it's not always successful.

Let's try to break it down a bit more. Can you tell me what's going through your mind when you think "they'll notice I messed up"? What's the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your head? Sometimes talking through it can help us process it a bit more.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's not easy to stay focused when you're feeling that way. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. We can work through this together, one tiny step at a time.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the worst-case I picture is them all noticing I'm not good enough — parents complaining, colleagues judging me, maybe even getting in trouble or losing my job. It makes me feel really ashamed and small, so I usually shut down or avoid thinking about it because it just hurts too much.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight, and it's affecting your ability to focus. That worst-case scenario you described is a big one, and it's no wonder it's making you feel ashamed and small.

But here's the thing: that scenario is unlikely to happen. Most people are too caught up in their own struggles to notice your mistakes, and even if they do, it's not the end of the world. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect.

It's also worth noting that your self-worth shouldn't be tied to one task or one job. You are so much more than this one thing. You have strengths and talents that go far beyond this one area.

Can I suggest something? Instead of trying to focus on the task right now, why don't we try to focus on your self-worth? Let's talk about all the things you're good at, all the things you're proud of. Let's try to shift your focus away from the shamey feeling and towards the positive.

And remember, we're not doing this because it's easy. We're doing it because it's necessary. You're going to have to work through this, and it's going to take time. But I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere.

Patient: I don't know... it's hard to think of positives because this shame keeps buzzing in my head and makes me feel like any success will just blow up. I guess I'm patient with the kids and come up with creative activities, and sometimes parents say I'm organized—but even saying that feels awkward and small.

Therapist: It's like the shame is amplifying your self-doubt, making it hard to focus on the good things. But I want you to know that those qualities you're describing - being patient, coming up with creative activities, and being organized - they're not small at all. They're actually really valuable and important.

It's interesting that you mention feeling awkward about saying those things to yourself. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling good, even when you're doing something positive. But I want you to know that those feelings are normal, and it's okay to acknowledge them. You're not fooling yourself or anyone else by pretending everything is okay when it's not.

Let's try something. Can you think of one specific time when a parent or someone else said something positive about you or your work with the kids? Maybe it was something small, like "You're doing a great job with that activity" or "I love the way you're involving the kids in this project." Just one small moment where someone acknowledged your efforts and said something positive. Can you think of that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one time a parent emailed after a class project saying their kid loved it and thanking me for being patient and creative. It felt weird and my chest tightened — I almost wanted to delete it because I felt embarrassed, but it did make me feel a tiny bit less awful.

Therapist: It's like that small, positive moment gave you a tiny bit of hope, a tiny bit of validation. And it's okay that it made you feel embarrassed too. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling good, even when you're doing something positive.

But here's the thing: that email wasn't just a fluke. It was a real moment of connection with someone, and it's something to be proud of. Being patient and creative with kids can be really tough, but it's clear that you're making a positive impact.

It's also interesting that you mention feeling a sense of relief after reading the email. Sometimes, it's not just about feeling good about ourselves, but also about feeling safe. It's like that email gave you a sense of permission to feel good about yourself, even if it's just a tiny bit.

Let's try to build on this. Can you think of another time when you felt a sense of connection with someone, like a parent or a kid? Maybe it was a small moment, but it's something that made you feel good about yourself. We can work with this, and see if we can build on it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess once a kid stayed after class to tell me they had fun and that it helped them, and my chest actually loosened for a second. But it still feels awkward to hold onto, and the shame creeps back so fast that I want to look away. I don't really know what to say about it.

Therapist: It's like that moment of connection with the kid was fleeting, but it's still resonating with you. It's like your mind is trying to process it, but it's also trying to push it away because it's too vulnerable.

It's okay to feel awkward about holding onto that feeling. It's a small moment, but it's still a moment of connection and validation. And it's okay that the shame creeps back in. It's a natural response to a vulnerable moment.

But here's the thing: that feeling is not going away. It's still there, and it's still connected to that moment with the kid. And it's not going to hurt to acknowledge it, even if it feels awkward.

Can I suggest something? Instead of trying to hold onto it, why don't we try to just acknowledge it? Let's just say it is that feeling, and that it's okay. No judgments, no analysis. Just a simple acknowledgment that it's there.

And then we can try to do something with it. We can try to build on it, or we can try to find a way to integrate it into your daily life. But first, let's just acknowledge it. Are you ready to do that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to just notice it for a second. That shamey feeling still hits hard and makes me want to look away, so can we just name it and then not dig too deep right now?

Therapist: Let's just acknowledge the shamey feeling and name it for what it is. It's a feeling of shame, and it's normal that it's hard to look at it directly.

We don't need to dig too deep right now. We can just acknowledge that it's there, and that it's a big part of how you're feeling. No judgments, no analysis. Just a simple acknowledgment.

Can you just take a deep breath and acknowledge the shamey feeling right now? No need to try to change it, just notice it. Are you ready to do that?

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try. There's a tightness in my chest and this heat in my face — a familiar shamey frustration that wants me to look away and shut down. I guess I'm noticing it now, but it's really heavy and I don't want to go deeper at the moment.

Therapist: It's like you're acknowledging the feeling, but it's still a lot to process. The tightness in your chest and the heat in your face are physical sensations that are closely tied to this shamey feeling. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed by them right now.

Take a deep breath and just acknowledge that you're noticing these feelings. No need to try to change them or analyze them right now. Just being aware of them is a big step.

We can take it one step at a time. We've identified the shamey feeling, and we're acknowledging it. That's a good place to start. What would you like to do next? Would you like to take a break, or try to move forward with this feeling?

Patient: I don't know... can we just pause for like five minutes? My chest's still tight and that shamey frustration is loud, but I don't want to quit—maybe a short break and then try another tiny 10-minute round with one activity. I guess that's what I'd like.
