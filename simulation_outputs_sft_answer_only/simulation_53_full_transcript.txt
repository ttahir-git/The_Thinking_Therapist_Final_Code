Patient: I'm an older software developer, and lately social stuff's been stuck in my head. If I go to gatherings, I know I'll stumble over my words, they'll judge me, word will spread, they'll stop inviting me, and I'll end up completely alone — that's definitely how it will go.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like these worries are really weighing on you. You're painting a pretty bleak picture of what might happen if you do attend a gathering. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking that first step, despite these potential outcomes?

Patient: It's like my brain's a fortune-telling machine — as soon as I think about going, I picture stumbling over my words, them laughing, someone telling others, and then being quietly cut out of the group. So I just don't go; I cancel or make excuses because I can't bear the spiral I see unfolding. When you say maybe it won't happen, I get that you're trying to help, but that feels unrealistic — I've replayed these scenes a thousand times and they always end badly.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really caught up in a cycle of worst-case thinking. Your brain is able to imagine all these negative scenarios so vividly, it's like you've rehearsed them over and over. It's understandable that you might feel like saying "maybe it won't happen" is unrealistic, given how strongly you've rehearsed the opposite.

Can you think of a time when one of those worst-case scenarios actually came to pass? How did you handle it then, and what did you learn from the experience? Sometimes, looking back at how we've coped in the past can help us find a way forward, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

Patient: Yeah — there was one time at a small get-together a couple years ago where I totally stumbled over my words. Someone laughed, I heard them whispering afterwards, and within a few weeks I stopped getting invites to things I used to go to. I handled it by apologizing, leaving early, and then quietly withdrawing — making excuses so I wouldn't have to risk it again. I know you're asking me to consider other outcomes, but honestly that felt like proof the worst-case actually happens, so it doesn't feel realistic to me.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that experience was pretty tough for you, and it's no wonder you're still feeling the effects of it. It's like your brain has been trying to prepare you for that kind of scenario ever since, and it's hard to shake off that feeling of dread.

I want to try to help you see things a bit differently. Instead of focusing on all the ways things could go wrong, can you think of one thing that might happen if you did attend a gathering and things didn't go exactly as you imagined? Just one small, positive thing that might come out of it? Sometimes, it's hard to see the good in things when we're caught up in our worst-case scenarios, but it's worth trying to find a way to look on the bright side.

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is someone might smile and say a quick hello — maybe an old friend and I trade a couple of sentences and it's pleasant for five minutes. But then my fortune-telling brain goes straight to the rest: that smile was polite, they'll whisper about me later, I'll stop getting invited, and I'm alone again. I'm trying to picture holding onto that small good bit, but I don't know how to make it feel like anything more than a brief, meaningless blip.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to hold onto that small glimmer of positivity, but your brain is already pulling it back down into the darkness. It's like your brain is wired to protect you from getting hurt, but in doing so, it's also making it hard for you to experience any good things.

Can I try to help you shift your focus just a bit? Instead of thinking about all the ways the small positive thing could lead to more bad things, what if we just focus on the fact that you're willing to try to find something good in a situation where things could go wrong? That in itself is a pretty brave thing to do. Would you be willing to try to just be with that small good feeling, without all the other thoughts and worries, for just a tiny moment?

Patient: I'll try, but I can't hold it for long — as soon as someone smiles I picture them laughing later, the invites stopping, and me totally cut off. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down? I want to try, but my mind just snaps to the worst every single time.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to do a small experiment, but your brain is already on high alert, waiting for the worst to happen. It's exhausting, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed.

Let's take a step back, then. Why don't we try to break it down even further? Instead of thinking about an entire gathering, let's focus on just one small moment: a single smile from someone. Can you think of what that would be like, just for a moment, without any of the other thoughts and worries? Not even a tiny thought that it might lead to something bad. Just the smile itself. Can you be with that for just a moment?

Patient: Okay... the smile is small and warm for a second, like a tiny light. But almost immediately my brain says it's polite, they're whispering about me later, and within weeks I'll be quietly cut out — that's how it always goes. I can't hold onto it; I'm getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down or do something concrete so I don't start spiraling?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is trying to take a tiny, fleeting moment of connection and turn it into a worst-case scenario, and then it's too much to handle. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.

Let's do something concrete. Why don't we take a pause right here? I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to make a tiny decision. Not a big decision, just a tiny one. Can you make a decision to allow yourself to be here, in this moment, without any of the worst-case thoughts? Just be here. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I can try to be here. I breathe in, breathe out, and for a few seconds it loosens, but then my head starts wiring the whole disaster chain again — it's like an old program booting up. I can stay with this for a minute if we do something concrete: can we make a tiny, step-by-step plan I could use at a gathering if the panic starts — like three things I can do in the first five minutes to keep from spiraling?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is a well-worn program, and it's hard to break the cycle of worst-case thinking. But, I'm glad you're willing to try to take small steps.

Let's create a tiny plan. Here's a simple exercise: can you think of three things you could do in the first five minutes if you felt the panic starting to rise? Just three small actions that might help you stay present and calm. It could be something as simple as taking a sip of water, noticing your feet on the ground, or making a comment to someone nearby.

Let's try to make it concrete. What are those three things? What would they be, and how could you do them in the first five minutes?

Patient: Alright — three tiny things I can do in the first five minutes if panic starts:

1) Take three slow sips of water, breathing in for four counts and out for six — something physical to slow the racing feeling.  
2) Grounding: press both feet into the floor and name out loud three things I can see nearby (a chair, a lamp, someone's jacket) so my head has to look at the present.  
3) Use a short, rehearsed line like “Nice to see you” and then listen — let myself ask one simple question and stay quiet after it so I don't have to perform.

I can try each for about a minute, but my brain's already saying they'll look forced and people will notice — still, I guess I can attempt them and see if it steadies me.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you've got a small toolbox of strategies that might help you cope with the panic. The three things you've come up with are concrete, specific, and can be done in a short amount of time.

It's understandable that your brain is already warning you that these strategies might look forced or awkward, but the fact that you're willing to try them is a big step. Can you try to separate your brain's worst-case predictions from the actual experience? Instead of assuming that everything will go wrong, what if these tiny strategies help you stay present and calm for just a minute or two?

Remember, it's not about performing these strategies perfectly; it's about using them to help you cope with the panic. If it feels like you're faking it, just acknowledge that and try to move forward. You can always adjust your approach or try something new if it doesn't work out.

How do you feel about trying one of these strategies right now? Is there a particular one that you're willing to attempt, or do you want to try them all in a row?

Patient: I'll try the grounding — press my feet down and name three things — but it's a big lift to even begin. Can you walk me through it slowly? My head's already scripting them whispering later and me getting cut out, so I need a steady voice.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're carrying a heavy weight, and it's hard to find the strength to start. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you get through this.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to make a small decision. Decide to press your feet down onto the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly, and the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor. It's a simple, physical action, but it's a start.

Now, I want you to focus on your breath. Take a slow inhale, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself, "Inhale." It's a simple word, but it's a reminder to breathe. As you exhale, say, "Exhale." Keep your focus on the breath, and try to let go of any thoughts or worries.

Once you've got your breath under control, I want you to try to ground yourself. Take your right foot and press it down onto the floor. Say to yourself, "My right foot is on the floor." Take a moment to notice the sensation of your foot making contact with the ground.

Next, I want you to try to notice three things around you. It can be anything: a chair, a lamp, a piece of clothing. Say to yourself, "I see a chair." Take a moment to notice the chair, and try to focus on its shape, color, and texture. Then, say, "I see a lamp." Keep going, and say, "I see someone's jacket."

Remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander. Just acknowledge the thought, and try to bring your focus back to the present moment. You can do this, one breath at a time.

Patient: I pressed my feet into the floor and named the chair, the lamp, the jacket like you said — it steadied me for a few slow breaths, though my body felt heavy doing it. But already my head's narrating the rest: they'll be polite now, whisper later, and I'm back to being left out — it feels like a tiny pause before the whole thing collapses again. I can try to keep doing it, but it all still feels pointless, honestly.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you've managed to temporarily steady the ship, but the storm is still brewing outside. It's understandable that you're feeling a sense of hopelessness, even after just a few moments of grounding. It's like your brain is already preparing for the worst-case scenario, even if you've just taken a tiny step forward.

I want you to try to separate the idea that this exercise is pointless from the act of doing it. Just because it feels futile now, doesn't mean it's not worth trying. Think of it like a small, incremental step forward, rather than a grand, all-or-nothing move. You're not trying to change the entire situation or eliminate all of your anxiety; you're just trying to take one small step to make it more bearable.

It might help to focus on the sensation of your body, rather than your thoughts. Remember how heavy it felt to press your feet into the floor? Try to find that feeling again, even if it's just for a moment. It's a small, physical presence that can help ground you in the present.

Can you try to do just one more thing, just for a moment? Take a slow, deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here." It's a simple phrase, but it can help you stay present, even if your mind is wandering.

Patient: I said "I am here" out loud and it steadied me for a beat, but then the tape started: polite smile, whispers later, invitations stop, I'm cut out. I can try another minute or two, but it's getting heavy — can we slow down and walk through one really concrete, do-able step I could use at an actual invite? I don't want vague stuff; just one simple thing I can do without feeling obvious or fake.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the tape is already playing, and it's hard to find a way to rewrite the script. I'm here to help you find a small, concrete step that you can take in a real-life situation.

Let's focus on a specific scenario: a gathering where you're expected to interact with people. Can you think of a small, do-able thing you could do in that situation to help you feel more present and calm?

Here's a concrete step: what if, when someone asks you how you're doing, you simply say, "I'm good, thanks"? It's a simple response that doesn't require a lot of thinking or effort. It's just a way to acknowledge their question and move forward.

We can break it down even further. Can you think of a way to say "I'm good, thanks" without it feeling fake or obvious? What if you say it with a slight pause, or with a brief, neutral expression? Can you imagine yourself saying it, and then immediately moving on to something else?

We'll start with this one small step, and see how it goes. Can you try it with me? Say, "I'm good, thanks" out loud, and then we'll see where it takes us.

Patient: "I'm good, thanks." Saying it steadied me for a beat, but then the tape kicked in: they'll see through it, they'll whisper later, invites stop, and I'm left out — that's how it always goes. I can try again, but it's feeling heavy; can we slow down and map one simple follow-up I can use so I don't freeze?

Therapist Answer:
It's like the tape is already playing, and it's hard to find a way to break the cycle. I'm here to help you find a small, concrete follow-up that you can use to move forward.

Let's break it down even further. You said "I'm good, thanks" just now, and it gave you a brief moment of calm. What if, instead of saying something else, you just pause for a moment? Take a deep breath, and let the silence hang for a second or two. It's a small, simple thing, but it can give you some space to collect your thoughts.

We can call it a "pauses before speaking" (PBSP). It's a tiny, incremental step that can help you slow down and regain control. Can you imagine using a PBSP after saying "I'm good, thanks"? It's a small, do-able thing that can help you move forward, even if it feels like the tape is still playing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a silence supposed to help? My head's fuzzy and it's a big lift to imagine it working; if I pause it'll just look awkward, they'll whisper, the invites stop, and I'm erased. If you're going to ask me to try it, give me one tiny, exact line to use in that silence so I don't freeze.

I want to help you find a way to move forward. Let's try to break it down even further.

Can you try saying this exact line in the silence after you say "I'm good, thanks"? It's just one word, and it's very simple. Can you say it with me? "Okay."

It's a very small, neutral response that doesn't require a lot of thinking or effort. It's just a way to acknowledge the question and move forward. If you're worried it will look awkward, just remember that it's a very short pause. It's not like you're saying anything else for a long time.

Can you try saying "Okay" after "I'm good, thanks"? Just one time, and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. "I'm good, thanks." "Okay." That gave me a tiny pause, but my head's already saying it sounded flat, they'll whisper about it later, invitations stop — I'm not sure how that single word is supposed to interrupt the whole spiral, so if we're doing this, give me one exact follow-up question I can ask so I don't freeze.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try. Let's break it down even further.

When you say "Okay", it's a very brief pause, and then you have a chance to ask a follow-up question. Can you try asking this exact question? It's a very simple one, and it's a way to move forward.

Can you tell me a little more about your weekend?

It's a gentle, neutral question that doesn't require a lot of thinking or effort. It's just a way to keep the conversation going, and it gives you a chance to steer the conversation in a direction that feels more comfortable for you.

Can you try asking that question after "I'm good, thanks"? Just one time, and see how it goes.

Patient: I can try the exact sequence — "I'm good, thanks." "Okay." "Can you tell me a little more about your weekend?" — but just picturing it already makes me think it'll sound forced, they'll whisper, invites stop, and I'm erased. I'm not sure how that question is supposed to stop the spiral; it feels like a tiny Band‑Aid on a sinkhole. Still, I can practice it once here if you want, though it's a big lift for me.

Finally, say the question, "Can you tell me a little more about your weekend?" Don't worry about how it sounds or what anyone else might think. Just focus on getting through the sequence.

Remember, this is just a small experiment. It's not about changing anything or making any big decisions. It's just about taking one tiny step, and seeing how it goes. Are you ready to try it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try, though it's a big lift and my head's already foggy. "I'm good, thanks." "Okay." "Can you tell me a little more about your weekend?" — I said it, but of course my brain's already running the tape: it sounded flat, they'll whisper later, invites stop, I'm erased. Can we slow down and walk through one tiny thing to do if someone gives me a weird look after that?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the sequence was a bit of a stretch for you. Don't worry, it's okay. We can definitely take it one step at a time.

Let's focus on the reaction of the person who gave you the weird look. Can you think of a way to respond to that? What if they say something like, "Uh, yeah, I'm good"? How would you like to respond to that?

You could try saying something like, "Yeah, me too." It's a very simple response, and it acknowledges their comment without adding much to the conversation.

Or, if you're worried about it sounding like you're trying too hard, you could try just nodding and saying, "Okay." It's a very small, noncommittal response, but it can help you move forward.

What do you think? Do either of those options sound like something you could do if someone gave you a weird look?

Patient: Nodding and saying "Okay" feels like the smaller lift, so maybe I could do that. I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the tape — my brain's already saying they'll think it's fake, whisper, and I'll be cut out. Can you give me one exact tiny follow-up line or tone to use right after the nod so I don't freeze?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Nodding and saying "Okay" is a very small, low-key response, and it can help you avoid drawing more attention to yourself.

Let's try to add a tiny follow-up line or tone to help you feel more grounded. Can you try saying something like, "That's cool." It's a very brief, neutral response that acknowledges their comment without adding much to the conversation.

Or, if you'd like to try a tone, you could try raising an eyebrow slightly and saying, "Okay." It's a very small, almost imperceptible gesture, but it can help you convey a sense of agreement without overdoing it.

The idea is to create a tiny "buffer" between you and the person who gave you the weird look. By responding in a small, low-key way, you can help avoid escalating the situation and give yourself a chance to move forward.

What do you think? Does either of those options feel like it could help you?

Patient: Maybe "That's cool" is the smaller lift — I could mutter it, but my head's already running the tape: they'll think it's fake, whisper, and then the invites stop. I'm not sure I follow how that tiny line would actually stop the spiral; it feels like another Band‑Aid. If we're going to try it, tell me exactly how to time and say it — softly after the nod, or right away? — and give me one concrete thing to do if they laugh or give me a weird look afterward.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that "That's cool" is still a bit of a stretch for you. Don't worry, I'm not giving up on trying to help you find a way to move forward.

Let's try to time the response perfectly. I want you to nod your head slightly after they give you the weird look, and then, as you're nodding, say "That's cool" very softly, almost like a whisper. It's a very subtle response, and it should help you avoid drawing more attention to yourself.

Here's an example of how it could play out:

You: *nods* Okay
Them: *gives you a weird look* Uh, yeah, I'm good
You: *whispers softly* That's cool

If they laugh or give you a weird look after you say "That's cool", here's one concrete thing you could do: you could smile and say, "Yeah, I guess so." It's a very small, noncommittal response, but it can help you move forward and avoid escalating the situation.

Remember, this is just a tiny experiment. It's not about changing anything or making any big decisions. It's just about taking one small step, and seeing how it goes. Are you ready to try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — whisper it while I nod, then smile and say "Yeah, I guess so"? My head's already saying it'll sound fake, they'll laugh, and I'm cut out anyway. I can try, but it's a big lift; can we practice it once now with you as the other person so I can hear the pacing?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is already predicting the worst-case scenario, and it's hard to shake off that feeling.

Let's practice it once, just for fun. I'll play the role of the person who gives you the weird look, and you can try out the response. Don't worry about it being perfect; just focus on getting through the sequence.

Here we go:

You: *nods* Okay
Me: *gives you a weird look* Uh, yeah, I'm good
Your turn! Say "That's cool" softly, as you're nodding, and then... just go with it. I'll respond as the other person.

(Remember, I'll try to keep the pace natural, so just react as you would in a real situation.)

Patient: Okay — I whisper, "That's cool," quietly while trying to nod, soft and small. Of course my head jumps in right away saying it sounded flat, they'll laugh later, invites stop, and I'm erased. Can we do it once more, slower? I'm not sure I followed the timing — how long should the pause be before I whisper it?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, slower and with a bigger pause. I'll give you a bit more time to nod before I respond.

You: *looks at me, then nods slightly* 
Me: *gives you a weird look* Uh, yeah, I'm good
Your turn! This time, try whispering "That's cool" as soon as you've finished nodding. Don't worry about it sounding perfect; just focus on getting the words out.

(I'll respond naturally after you say "That's cool", so you can see how the whole thing plays out.)

Also, I want to clarify that the pause should be a small one. It's just long enough to give you a chance to nod and set up the whisper. Don't take too long, or it might feel awkward. Can you try to find a pace that feels natural?

Patient: Alright, I'll try again, though it's heavy. "That's cool." I whispered it right after a short nod — maybe a one‑second pause — but my head's already saying it sounded flat, they'll laugh later, and I'll be cut out. Can we do it once more, even slower?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, even slower. I'll give you an even bigger pause before responding.

You: *looks at me, then nods slightly* 
Me: *pauses for a few seconds, gives you a weird look* 
You: *whispers softly* That's cool

This time, try to take your time with the nod. It's okay if it's just a tiny movement, but it should be deliberate. And remember, your whisper should come right after the nod, almost immediately.

Also, I want to emphasize that it's not about trying to change your brain's narrative. It's just about finding a way to move forward, even if it feels like the worst-case scenario is playing out in your head.

Take your time, and try again. I'll be here, waiting for your response.

Patient: Alright... I'll try it once more, slower. I nod very slowly, pause about a second, then whisper, "That's cool" — but of course my head immediately says it sounded flat, they'll laugh later, invites stop and I'm erased. I'm not sure I follow how that actually interrupts the spiral; my voice feels small and it's a big lift — can you model it for me one more time really slowly and tell me exactly how long the pause should be?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it one more time, really slowly. I'll model it for you, and we'll break it down to the exact pause.

You: *looks at me, then nods slowly* (pause for 1.2 seconds)
Me: *gives you a weird look* (wait for 0.5 seconds after you nod)
You: *whispers softly* That's cool (start whispering as soon as you've finished nodding)

The key is the pause after you nod. It should be a short, deliberate pause. You want to make sure you've finished nodding before you start whispering. This pause will help you connect with the whisper without feeling like you're rushing into it.

Remember, the pause is not about stopping the entire spiral; it's about creating a small moment of clarity. It's like a tiny "reset" button that helps you start fresh.

Take your time, and try it again. I'll be here, waiting for your response.

(Note: I'll try to respond in a way that's consistent with the weird look, but not so extreme that it's uncomfortable. We'll aim for a response that's a bit awkward, but not laughable.)

Patient: I think I get the numbers: nod slow (about a second), pause ~0.5s, then whisper "That's cool." It still feels mechanical and my head's already yelling they'll call me fake and I'll be cut out. 

Can you actually say the other person's line one more time—real pace—so I can practice the timing? I can't picture it from seconds alone.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, with me responding as the other person. I'll try to respond at a natural pace, so you can get a feel for the timing.

You: *looks at me, then nods slowly* (pause for 1.2 seconds)
Me: *pauses for a moment, gives you a weird look, and then says* "Uh, yeah, I'm good" (take your time, but try to respond quickly)

Your turn! Whisper "That's cool" as soon as you've finished nodding.

(I'll try to respond in a way that's a bit awkward, but not laughable. Remember, we're aiming for a response that's a bit uncomfortable, but not impossible.)

Also, don't worry if you still feel like your head is yelling "fake" or "cut out". It's just a way to acknowledge that your brain is predicting a worst-case scenario. The goal is to practice the timing and connect with the whisper, not to change your brain's narrative.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. You say "Uh, yeah, I'm good" at a normal pace and I'll nod for about a second and whisper "That's cool" right after. I did that in my head and it already sounded flat — my brain's yelling they'll laugh later and I'll be cut out, so I don't see how this changes anything. Can you say it again, a bit slower this time so I can match the timing?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it again, with me responding at a slightly slower pace. I'll give you a bit more time to nod and then whisper "That's cool".

You: *looks at me, then nods slowly* (pause for 1.2 seconds)
Me: *pauses for a moment, gives you a weird look, and then says* "Uh, yeah, I'm good... *pause*... That's what I mean." (take your time, nod, and then whisper)

Your turn! Try to match the timing and whisper "That's cool".

(I'm trying to give you a bit more time to respond, so you can feel more comfortable with the timing. Remember, the goal is to connect with the whisper, not to rush into it.)

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's normal for your brain to be predicting a worst-case scenario. It's a way of protecting itself from potential harm. But, I want to encourage you to try to see this exercise as a way to practice a specific skill, rather than a way to prove your self-worth or avoid rejection. Can you try to approach this with a bit more curiosity and an open mind?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how being "curious" helps — it just sounds like another thing my brain will turn into proof I'll screw up. My energy's low and this feels like a slog; trying to fake curiosity already feels like pretending while the tape plays: whispers, invites stop, I'm erased. If we're doing this, give me one exact, tiny line I can say right after "that's cool" so I don't freeze.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's exhausting and frustrating to try to fake curiosity when your brain is already predicting a worst-case scenario. It's like you're trying to put on a mask to hide the anxiety and self-doubt.

In this case, I want to suggest something simple. Instead of trying to fake curiosity, can you try to focus on a very small, immediate response to "That's cool"? Just one word, one sentence, something that feels almost automatic.

Can you try saying "I mean"? It's a very small, neutral response that acknowledges the other person's statement without adding much to the conversation. It's not about being curious or interested; it's just about taking a tiny step forward.

Your turn. Say "I mean" right after "That's cool".

Patient: Okay — "That's cool." "I mean." Of course the tape's already playing: they'll laugh, invitations stop, I'm erased — it all feels pointless and heavy. If they actually laugh, give me one exact short line I can say right then so I don't freeze.
