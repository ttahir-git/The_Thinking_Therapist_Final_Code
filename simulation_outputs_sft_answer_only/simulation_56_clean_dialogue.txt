Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism since I moved away from my main support system. Every little mistake at work turns into a certainty in my head — I'm definitely going to get fired, lose my apartment, end up completely alone and ruin everything. I know my mind just spins these disaster stories, but I can't seem to stop believing them.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's been going on when these disaster stories show up? What does a typical day look like for you, and how do these thoughts feel right after they come up, before you start spinning the whole scenario out?

Patient: Most days I'm juggling meetings and team stuff, then replaying tiny slip-ups over and over — since I moved away I don't have anyone close to check in with, so those moments just swell. It usually starts as a little sting, like "I messed up," and my chest tightens and my breath gets shallow — there's this instant switch to certainty. In that short window I already see the whole catastrophe: getting fired, losing my apartment, being completely alone, and I get totally hooked on that story, even if someone says another outcome is possible.

Therapist: It sounds like those moments of self-criticism are really intensifying right now, and it's like the uncertainty of being so far away from your support system is amplifying that. It's interesting that you mention the instant switch to certainty. Can you think of a moment, just one moment, where you realized you were not just feeling the initial sting of a mistake, but then your mind started spinning the whole scenario out? Was there a particular trigger or feeling that signaled that switch?

Patient: Yeah — like last Thursday in the team meeting when my manager asked about a tiny mistake in my report; that little prick of "I messed up" flipped into something else. My chest tightened, my breath got shallow, and in seconds my mind was already scripting the end: I'm definitely getting fired, losing my apartment, calling my parents in shame and ending up completely alone — like it's already happening. I know people say other outcomes are possible, but in that moment those options feel impossible, like I'm just watching the worst-case on repeat and can't turn it off.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind was able to take that initial sting of criticism and escalate it into a full-blown narrative of disaster. It's like that one moment, the tiny mistake in the report, became a kind of trigger that allowed you to switch into that certainty. And it's interesting that you mention feeling like the other outcomes are impossible, even though you know intellectually that they're not necessarily true. Can you think of a time when you've felt like that, when you were so caught up in the worst-case scenario that it felt like it was already happening? Was there a moment where you realized you were just caught up in that story, and not actually living it?

Patient: There was one moment after that meeting when a coworker actually messaged me later saying I did a good job — for a second I thought, okay maybe I'm overreacting — but my mind immediately told me that's just because they're being nice now and it'll all fall apart tomorrow. I could feel my shoulders relax for like two breaths, then the old script kicked in and I was back picturing the firing and losing my apartment like it's already underway. I know, logically, I caught myself making a story, but I can't seem to hold onto that pause before the catastrophe takes over.

Therapist: It's like that one moment of doubt, when you thought maybe you were overreacting, was just a brief respite before your mind jumped back into the worst-case scenario. It's like your mind is constantly on high alert, ready to pounce on any potential criticism or mistake, and it's hard for you to catch your breath and think clearly.

Can you tell me more about what's been going on since you started feeling like this? Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to set off this cycle of self-criticism and disaster thinking? Is it just about work-related mistakes, or is it creeping into other areas of your life as well?

Patient: It's not just work — anything ambiguous sets it off: a delayed text from a friend, a quiet Saturday night, a landlord asking a routine question. The pattern's always the same — tiny sting, chest tightens, and my brain goes straight to the worst-case: I get fired, I lose my place, my friends stop caring, my parents are ashamed, and I'm stuck alone — like it's already happening. Sometimes it's triggered by reminders of the move or a flashback from the PTSD, or even just being tired, and those make the stories louder. I know people tell me other outcomes are possible, but honestly that just feels like wishful thinking in the moment — the disaster feels inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is always on the lookout for potential threats, and even small, ambiguous situations can trigger a cascade of worst-case scenarios. It's like you're constantly trying to prepare for the worst, and that's taking a toll on your mental state.

It's interesting that you mention PTSD and flashbacks as triggers. Can you tell me more about how those experiences affect you, and how they tie into your current struggles with self-criticism and disaster thinking? Are there any specific memories or emotions that come up for you when you're having one of those worst-case scenarios?

Also, I want to check in with you about your self-care and support system. Are you finding it hard to connect with others or reach out for help when you're feeling overwhelmed? Are there any resources or coping strategies that you've found helpful in the past, or would you like to explore some new options?

Patient: The flashbacks slam me back into that helpless place — a smell, a raised voice, that hollow panic — and they instantly become proof that I'm broken and any tiny mistake will lead to abandonment and ruin. There's this one memory of someone I relied on leaving during a fight, and whenever I mess up even a little it feels like a replay that ends with me alone and kicked out of everything. I try breathing, journaling, or throwing myself into work and sometimes a friend's message calms me for two breaths, but I can't see any of that actually stopping the avalanche — reaching out or new strategies just feels unrealistic. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like your flashbacks and memories are triggering a deep sense of vulnerability and fear of abandonment, which is then escalating into a full-blown disaster narrative. It's like your mind is constantly reminding you of past traumas and failures, and that's making it even harder for you to cope with small mistakes or setbacks.

It's interesting that you mention feeling like you can't actually stop the avalanche, even with coping strategies or support from others. It's like you're feeling overwhelmed by the weight of your own thoughts and emotions, and that's making it hard for you to see a way out.

Can I ask you to try something? Can you think of a moment, a small moment, where you felt a sense of safety or connection with someone or something? Maybe it was a conversation with a friend, a hug from a loved one, or a quiet moment of reflection. What happened in that moment that felt safe or comforting? Maybe we can try to build on that feeling, just a little bit, and see if we can find a way to make it more sustainable.

Patient: There was one time last week when a teammate pulled me aside and said I’d handled a tough call really well — I felt this small, grounding warmth and could actually breathe for a few seconds. But my next thought was that they're just being polite and it'll flip next week when I mess up, so the calm felt fragile and temporary. I want to hold onto that, but I don't know how to make it stick and it's making me kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like that moment of calm and connection was fleeting, and you're worried that it could disappear at any moment. It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the fragility of that feeling, especially when it's tied to your fear of being vulnerable and making mistakes.

Can I ask you to try to look at that moment with a bit more curiosity? What if, instead of thinking that the calm was fragile or temporary, you could try to see it as a tiny spark of hope? What if that spark could be fanned into a flame, and you could find ways to hold onto that feeling of calm and connection?

It's not about trying to make the calm last forever, but more about finding ways to make it a more sustainable part of your daily life. Maybe we can explore some strategies for helping you cultivate that feeling of calm and connection, even in the midst of a busy and challenging day.

Also, I want to check in with you about your self-talk and inner dialogue. You mentioned that your next thought was that your teammate was just being polite, and that it would flip next week when you mess up. Can you tell me more about what's going on with your inner dialogue when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Are there any negative or critical thoughts that seem to be popping up, and if so, how are you handling them?

Patient: My inner voice is instant and brutal — the second something goes wrong it says, “You’re incompetent, they’ll fire you, you’ll lose your place, you’ll be alone,” and it feels like the ending is already written. I do try to argue back with facts, breathe, journal, or message a friend, but those things calm me for two breaths and then the catastrophe story pushes them aside and any other outcome feels fake. Usually I either bury myself in work to prove it wrong or shut down and avoid people, and neither actually makes the prediction go away.

Therapist: It sounds like your inner voice is incredibly harsh and critical, and it's having a profound impact on your mental state. The way it's predicting catastrophic outcomes and labeling you as incompetent is not only painful but also seems to be fueling your anxiety and fear.

It's interesting that you mention trying to argue back with facts, breathe, journal, or message a friend, but then those things seem to have a temporary impact. It's like your inner voice is constantly trying to override those attempts to calm down and find a more positive perspective.

I want to explore the idea of defusion a bit more. Defusion is a technique where you try to notice your thoughts as thoughts, rather than believing them or acting on them. Instead of saying "I am a failure," you could say "I am having the thought 'I am a failure.'" This can help you see your thoughts as just thoughts, rather than as a reflection of reality.

Can you try to experiment with defusion in your daily life? When your inner voice is making those critical predictions, try to notice the thought as a thought, and see if you can label it as such. For example, you could say "Okay, the thought is 'I'm going to lose my place,' and I'm having that thought right now." This might help you see your thoughts in a different light and reduce their impact on your mental state.

Patient: I tried that once — I actually said out loud to myself, "I'm having the thought 'I'm going to get fired,'" and it let me breathe for maybe two breaths. But then my mind immediately jumped in with the next scene — me packing boxes, getting a call from my landlord, my parents being ashamed — like the label didn't touch the picture. It feels like putting a sticky note on a roaring train; defusion is nice for a beat but then the fortune-telling machine clicks back and says the other outcomes are impossible, and I'm left frustrated and stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to have a small moment of clarity and calmness with the defusion exercise, but then the thought just kept on going and took you back down into that same old cycle of catastrophic thinking.

It's like the defusion exercise was a tiny respite, but it didn't fundamentally change the way your mind is operating. It's still trying to push those predictions and outcomes onto you, even after you've acknowledged them as just thoughts.

I want to explore the idea of taking a step back from the defusion exercise and looking at it from a different angle. Instead of focusing on the defusion itself, let's try to think about what might be driving those thoughts and predictions in the first place.

Can you think about when you might have first started having these thoughts about getting fired, losing your place, and being alone? Was there a specific event or experience that triggered them? Maybe there's something in your past that's connected to these thoughts, even if it's not a direct cause-and-effect.

Also, I want to check in with you about your values and what's important to you. What do you stand for, and what are you trying to achieve in your life? Are there any values or goals that might be getting lost in the midst of all this catastrophic thinking?

Patient: That makes a lot of sense — thank you for laying that out. A couple of things that feel useful to explore from here:

- When I ask “when might you have first started having these thoughts,” I’m inviting you to look for an origin story or pattern. Can you think of an earlier time — maybe a specific age, relationship, or event — when small mistakes felt like total disasters? Sometimes these fortune-telling loops get wired in around a particular experience (like being blamed or abandoned) and link to later triggers.

- To help with that, a simple exercise: over the next few days, notice one catastrophe thought, write down the immediate trigger, the first physical feeling, the first sentence your mind says, and any earlier memory it evokes. That little timeline often reveals connections we don’t notice in the moment.

- About values: here’s a quick way to clarify them — name 3 things that matter to you even when you’re anxious (examples: being reliable, creativity, connection, independence). Then notice where the catastrophe-story interferes with living those values (e.g., “I avoid calling friends because I’m afraid they’ll judge me, which undermines connection”). Identifying this gap can help turn strategies into small, practical experiments.

- Two brief interventions you can try right away when the machine starts predicting disaster:
  1) A short probability check: rate how likely the worst event is 0–100, then list 2 pieces of evidence for and 2 against it. Don’t argue to win — just gather data like a curious scientist.
  2) A grounding breath: 4 seconds in, hold 4, out 6, repeat 4 times — this often loosens the immediate tightness so you can use the probability check.

- Also, because you mentioned PTSD flashbacks, it’s often helpful to have a “safety/action” list you can do in the moment (3 grounding moves, a phone number to text, a physical object that grounds you) so the flashback doesn’t become proof of future ruin.

What feels more doable right now — trying the timeline exercise to look for origins, or naming 3 values and noticing one tiny behavior this week that aligns with them?

Therapist: I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful. It sounds like you're ready to start exploring the origins of these catastrophic thoughts and how they might be connected to your values.

Let's start with the timeline exercise. Writing down the immediate trigger, the first physical feeling, the first sentence your mind says, and any earlier memory it evokes can help you identify patterns and connections that might not be immediately apparent.

To make it more manageable, let's break it down into smaller steps. Why don't we start with just one catastrophe thought and see if we can fill out the timeline for that specific scenario? Once you have that information, we can look at it together and see if we can identify any patterns or connections to your values.

As for the values exercise, I think it's a great idea to start small. Naming just three things that matter to you even when you're anxious can be a good starting point. We can then explore how the catastrophe-story interferes with living those values and see if we can identify any areas where you might need to make some small changes.

The two brief interventions you suggested are also great. The probability check can help you gather data and make a more informed decision about the likelihood of the worst event. The grounding breath can help loosen the immediate tightness and make it easier to use the probability check.

Lastly, having a "safety/action" list can be incredibly helpful in managing flashbacks. Having a physical object that grounds you, a phone number to text, or a list of grounding moves can make a big difference in how you cope with those moments.

Which of these two exercises feels more manageable to you right now? Should we start with the timeline exercise or the values exercise?

Patient: Okay — I'll start with the timeline exercise; that feels like the most concrete place to begin. But I’m already bracing that it’ll just dig up more “proof” for the fortune-telling — like it’ll show a pattern that means I’m definitely doomed, and that thought is making me kind of overwhelmed. Can we go slow with it?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to start with the timeline exercise, despite your reservations. I want to reassure you that this exercise is not about proving the existence of your catastrophic thoughts, but rather about gaining a better understanding of when they start, how they manifest, and what triggers them.

Let's take it one step at a time, and I'll guide you through the process. We can start with a simple prompt, and you can respond as honestly as you feel comfortable. Remember, this is a safe space to explore your thoughts, and I'm here to support you, not judge you.

To begin, can you think of a recent time when you had a catastrophic thought? It doesn't have to be a major one, just a thought that felt like it was about to lead to disaster. Maybe it was a few days ago, or maybe it was just a few hours ago. Can you try to recall the specific moment when that thought started to creep in?

If it helps, we can start with a very broad timeframe, like "recently" or "in the past week." We can gradually narrow it down as we go along. Just take a deep breath, and let's see where this takes us.

Patient: Okay — yesterday afternoon my manager pointed out a tiny formula error in a spreadsheet and my chest tightened, my breath got shallow, and the thought "I'm going to get fired" popped up instantly. Then my head just ran the whole movie — packing boxes, landlord calling, my parents ashamed, ending up completely alone — and it dragged up that memory of someone leaving during a fight so it felt like proof. I want to map this out but honestly it's a lot to sit with right now and I'm kind of wiped.

Therapist: It sounds like that moment with your manager was really triggering for you. It's understandable that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.

Let's break it down a bit more, if that feels okay with you. You mentioned that your chest tightened, your breath got shallow, and the thought "I'm going to get fired" popped up instantly. Can you tell me more about what happened in that moment, before the catastrophic thoughts started running? Was there anything specific that your manager said or did that made you feel that way?

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's not easy to sit with those thoughts, especially when they're tied to past experiences like the memory of someone leaving during a fight. It's like that memory is proof of something, and that can be a really heavy burden.

We can take it one step at a time, and see if we can break down the timeline a bit further. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, we can always come back to it later. How do you feel about taking a short break before we continue?

Patient: Yeah — a short break would help. I'm pretty wiped and sitting with the whole timeline feels like it might topple me, but I don't want to bail; can we pause for like five minutes and then try just one tiny piece?

Therapist: It's completely understandable that you're feeling wiped out and overwhelmed. Taking a break can help you recharge and come back to it with a clearer mind.

Let's pause for five minutes, and then we can try to tackle just one tiny piece of the timeline. We can start with something small, like just identifying the moment when the thought "I'm going to get fired" popped up. Can you try to recall exactly what happened in that moment, without adding any of the catastrophic thoughts or memories that followed?

Just take a few deep breaths, and let's see if we can focus on just that one moment. When you're ready, we can start from there and see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay... he said, "There's a small formula error in the third column," just matter-of-fact, nothing loud or hostile. My chest tightened, breath got shallow, and before I could do anything the thought "I'm going to get fired" popped in and the rest of the movie started. I'm pretty wiped, but I can try to do that one tiny piece now if you want.

Therapist: It sounds like your manager's statement was a bit of a trigger, even though it was delivered in a calm and matter-of-fact way. The fact that your body reacted with physical tension and a racing mind suggests that it's had a lasting impact on you.

Let's try to break it down a bit further. Can you tell me more about what you think might have triggered that thought "I'm going to get fired"? Was it something specific that your manager said, or was it just the fact that they pointed out an error in your work?

Patient: It's less about what he actually said and more that the word "error" hits this old nerve — in my past, mistakes meant being blamed and abandoned — so my brain reads it as proof. The second he mentioned it, the movie started playing: fired, evicted, my parents ashamed, totally alone — and in that moment any other outcome feels impossible. I can try to reason, but honestly I'm kind of wiped and the story's louder than anything else right now.

Therapist: It sounds like the word "error" has a specific emotional resonance for you, tied to past experiences of being blamed and abandoned. It's not surprising that your brain would interpret it as proof of a negative outcome, especially given the context of your past.

It's like your brain has created a kind of emotional loop, where the mention of an "error" triggers a cascade of memories and emotions that make it hard to think clearly. It's a very common experience, and it's not uncommon for people to feel like they're stuck in a kind of emotional quicksand.

Can I ask, how do you feel about trying to label the emotion behind this response? It might be helpful to acknowledge what's happening, even if it feels overwhelming. Sometimes, just giving a name to the feeling can help you feel a bit more grounded. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Okay... I guess it's mostly shame and a raw panic — this hollow tightness in my chest and this voice that screams I'm worthless and about to be abandoned. Saying the feeling out loud buys me two breaths, then the fortune-teller voice insists that shame is proof I'm already doomed — fired, evicted, alone. I'm pretty wiped, but I can try to keep going if that's okay.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and name those feelings, especially when they're as raw and intense as shame and panic. It's like you're giving yourself permission to feel these emotions, even if it's uncomfortable.

Just by saying it out loud, you've already gained a small amount of clarity and control over the situation. The fact that you're willing to keep going, even though you're feeling wiped, shows a lot of strength and resilience.

I want to try something with you. Can you try to look at this shame and panic without judgment? Can you try to see it as a signal that something is wrong, rather than as proof that you're worthless or doomed? It's not about changing the way you feel, but more about gaining a bit of perspective.

Also, I want to check in with you about your safety. Are you feeling overwhelmed to the point where you're worried about your own well-being? If so, it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your safety. We can explore some options for how to cope with these feelings in a way that feels safe for you.

Patient: No — I'm not thinking about hurting myself, but I'm really on edge and shaky; the shame plus the fortune-teller voice makes it feel like I'm about to crack. I can try one of those grounding breaths, but I'm pretty wiped and need us to go slow. Can we do one slow breath together?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're not thinking about hurting yourself, but I want to make sure you feel safe and supported. The shame and fortune-teller voice can be very overwhelming, and it's completely normal to feel like you're on the edge.

Taking one slow breath together can be a great way to start. Let's do it. Close your eyes, take a deep breath in through your nose... (pause) and hold it for a second... (pause) and then slowly breathe out through your mouth... (pause) One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight...

As we breathe together, try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about thinking or doing anything else, just be with the breath. When you're ready, we can try another slow breath together.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in slow and let it out. It helped for, like, two breaths — my shoulders loosened — then the fortune-teller voice was already whispering the next scene: calm now, collapse next week, packing boxes. I'm pretty wiped, but I can try one small step next — maybe just the 0–100 probability check for "I'm going to get fired" — but go slow, please.

Therapist: I'm glad the breathing exercise helped a little, but I understand that the fortune-teller voice is still strong for you. Let's try to focus on just one small step, and go at a very slow pace.

When you're ready, can you try to rate the probability of "I'm going to get fired" on a scale of 0 to 100? Take your time, and don't worry about giving a number right away. Just think about it, and see if you can come up with a number that feels even remotely close.

Also, can you try to look at this question without judgment? Just ask yourself, "What's the chance I'll get fired?" and see what number comes to mind.

We'll go at a slow pace, and I'll check in with you whenever you need to. No pressure, just a tiny step.

Patient: Okay... if I have to give a number, maybe 85%. 

For: 1) He pointed out an "error" and that word hits the old pattern — in the past mistakes led to being blamed and left. 2) I'm new here without my old support, so any slip feels like it could start a domino — no cushion if things go south.

Against: 1) He said it quietly, no threat or talk of discipline. 2) A teammate messaged later that I handled a tough call well and I haven't gotten any formal warnings.

But honestly those "against" things feel like breathing room for two breaths — the rest of the movie still plays and makes the 85% feel right. I'm pretty wiped; can we go slower on the next step?

Therapist: You've given a number, and it's a honest reflection of your current feeling. 85% is a significant number, and it's clear that the thought of getting fired is still a strong concern for you.

I want to acknowledge that the "against" factors you mentioned are indeed helpful in reducing the anxiety, but it's also understandable that they might not be enough to change your perception of the situation. The fact that the fortune-teller voice is still whispering the next scene, making you feel like you're on the edge, is a testament to how deeply ingrained this fear is for you.

Given that you're feeling pretty wiped, I think it's a good idea to take a step back and slow down. Can we try to explore this further, but in a way that's even more gentle and low-key? Maybe we can try to break it down into even smaller, more manageable pieces. What do you think would help you feel more grounded and less anxious in this moment?

Also, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling physically. Are there any sensations or feelings that are particularly intense or overwhelming for you right now? Sometimes, acknowledging and exploring these physical sensations can help us better understand what's going on and find ways to address it.

Patient: My chest's still tight and my breaths are shallow, my hands are a little shaky and there's this hollow knot in my stomach. My head feels foggy and every quick heartbeat pushes that fortune-telling voice louder, so the physical stuff makes the disaster feel immediate. I'm wiped, but I can try one tiny grounding thing — can we do that slow 4 in, hold 4, out 6 breath together, really slowly?

Therapist: I can see that the physical sensations are still quite intense for you. It's like the storm is still raging inside, and the calm is hard to find.

I want to try and help you find that calm, even if it's just for a moment. Let's do the slow 4 in, hold 4, out 6 breath together, just like you suggested. But this time, I want us to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, rather than trying to change your thoughts or feelings.

As we breathe in, I want you to focus on the sensation of the air moving into your nostrils, and then down into your lungs. It's like a wave of air is entering your body, and it's making your chest rise. As you hold the breath, I want you to feel the stillness of your chest, and the gentle rise and fall of your chest as you breathe in.

When we breathe out, I want you to focus on the sensation of the air leaving your body, and then down into the ground. It's like a wave of air is leaving your body, and it's making your chest fall. As you hold the breath, I want you to feel the stillness of your chest, and the gentle rise and fall of your chest as you breathe out.

Let's do this together, slowly and carefully. I'll guide you through the breath, and you can focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

In... (pause) one... two... three... four...

Hold... (pause) four...

Out... (pause) five... six... seven... eight...

Can you feel the breath moving in and out of your body, slowly and carefully? Is there anything that's changing or shifting in your physical sensations?

Patient: Yeah... I felt the breath — my shoulders eased for a couple of seconds and the tightness loosened a bit — but the hollow knot and that fortune-teller voice are still there, loud as ever when my heart races. I'm pretty wiped, but I can try one more tiny thing: maybe name one small piece of evidence against "I'll get fired" — though honestly it already feels like that evidence will just be temporary.

Therapist: I can see that the relief from the breath is short-lived, but it's still a small victory. The hollow knot and fortune-teller voice are still present, but they don't seem to be as overwhelming as before.

Let's try to focus on that one small piece of evidence against "I'll get fired". What is it that's making you think that the possibility of getting fired is lower than 100%? Is it something specific that happened recently, or is it a general sense that you've been able to handle your work well so far?

You mentioned that the evidence might just be temporary, and that's a fair point. But sometimes, even small pieces of evidence can be enough to shift our perspective and make us feel more hopeful.

Let's try to explore this further, even if it's just a tiny bit. Can you think of one specific thing that might be making you feel more confident about your job, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I guess one concrete thing is that he said it calmly — no threat, no warnings — and a teammate messaged later saying I handled a tough call well. But even that feels like a two-breath thing — my head insists they're just being nice now and the collapse is still coming. I'm pretty wiped; can we take the next step really slowly?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find some small, concrete evidence to counteract the catastrophic thinking. Even though those pieces of evidence are small, they're still significant, and it's good that you're acknowledging them.

It's also understandable that you're feeling a bit wiped, and that your head is still racing with worst-case scenarios. That's a common experience, especially when we're feeling anxious or uncertain.

Let's take the next step, but let's do it really slowly and carefully. Can you think of a specific time when you felt a sense of relief or calm, even if it was just for a moment? Maybe it was after talking to a friend, or after doing something you enjoyed. Try to recall what that felt like, and see if we can build on that feeling.

We'll do this one small step at a time, and we'll take our time. No pressure, just a tiny, tiny step towards feeling more grounded and more hopeful. How does that sound?

Patient: Yeah — the teammate praise is the clearest one: a small warmth in my chest, my shoulders dropped, and I actually breathed for a few seconds. It felt like a tiny island of "okay," but my mind immediately whispered that it's temporary — they're just being polite now and next week it'll flip into the firing/eviction scene. I'm pretty wiped, so can we keep this really slow — maybe just one tiny idea about making that warmth last a little longer? I’m not sure it’ll stick, though.

Therapist: It's like that tiny island of calm was just a fleeting moment, and your mind is already jumping back to the worst-case scenario. But let's try to hold onto that small spark of warmth for just a moment longer.

Can you think of one tiny thing that might help make that warmth last a bit longer? Maybe it's something you could do right now, or something you've done before that's helped you feel more grounded. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something small that might help you feel a bit more connected to that tiny island of calm.

We'll keep it really slow and simple, and we'll see if we can find just one tiny idea that might help. You mentioned that your mind is already whispering that it's temporary, so maybe we can try to challenge that thought just a bit. Can you think of one tiny way to argue with that voice, just for a moment?

Patient: Maybe I could tell the voice, “There’s a real chance this won’t end badly — he was calm and a teammate praised me,” but I can already hear the fortune-teller calling that a lie and predicting the collapse next week. I could try texting that teammate or scribbling the praise to reread later, but I’m so wiped I don’t expect it to stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to challenge that voice and find some small glimmer of hope, but it's like trying to hold onto a thread. You're right that you can already hear the fortune-teller dismissing that "real chance" and predicting the worst.

It's interesting that you mention trying to text or reread the praise. Sometimes, just putting our thoughts down on paper or sending a quick message to someone can help us feel more grounded and connected to our values. Even if it doesn't stick, it might help you feel a tiny bit more hopeful for a moment.

Let's try to focus on that one tiny action you could take, even if it's just scribbling down the praise or sending a quick text. Can you try to commit to that small action, even if you're feeling wiped and uncertain? It's like taking a tiny step forward, and sometimes those small steps can help us build momentum.

Patient: Okay... I'm really wiped, but I can try one tiny thing — I'll copy the teammate's message onto a sticky note and put it on my monitor so it's there when I look up. I don't expect it to silence the fortune-teller — I can already hear it saying it's temporary — but I'll do it and tell you how it feels.

Therapist: Taking a small, concrete step towards acknowledging the praise and the positive feedback. It's like creating a tiny anchor that you can cling to when you're feeling overwhelmed.

I'm curious, what does it feel like to put that sticky note on your monitor? Is it a sense of comfort, or is it more like a reminder that this feeling might not last? Tell me how it feels, and we can explore it further.

Patient: I stuck the note on my monitor and for a few seconds it actually felt like a tiny island — my chest eased a bit and I remembered someone saying something nice. But almost immediately my head whispered that it’s just a band-aid, temporary, and the whole collapse is still coming, so the warmth felt fragile and kind of pointless. I'm wiped and it takes effort to hold onto even that tiny thing, but I can try to keep it there—can we go really slow and maybe pick one more tiny, concrete move?
