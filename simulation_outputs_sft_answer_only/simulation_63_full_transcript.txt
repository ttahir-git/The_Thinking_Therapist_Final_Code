Patient: I'm in my early thirties, an accountant, and since the kids left I've been pretty burned out, which somehow made social situations feel terrifying. Whenever I'm invited to a friend thing my mind immediately jumps to the worst — I'll say something stupid, they'll judge me, I won't be invited again, I'll lose those friendships and end up completely alone. I know it sounds over the top, but I can't shake that it's going to happen, so I just avoid going.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've found a way to cope with those social anxiety feelings by avoiding them altogether. It's understandable that the thought of potentially embarrassing yourself or being judged is overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to think about these social situations? Is it a sudden rush of fear, or does it build up over time, like a slow-burning fire?

Patient: It's usually a sudden rush — my chest tightens, my thoughts go white-hot, and my brain immediately plays out the worst-case: I say something awkward, they laugh, I get cut off, I stop being invited, and I'm left alone. Once it starts the story just spirals and feels more real than anything else, and the fear gets so loud I either freeze or make an excuse to leave. I know people tell me that's unlikely, but I can't make those other outcomes stick in my head.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind has created a script that's become so vivid, so real, that it's hard to shake. The fear and anxiety are overwhelming, and it's no wonder you're avoiding social situations. Can you think of a moment when you weren't so caught up in this worst-case scenario, when you were able to engage with others without that rush of fear? Maybe there's a memory or a situation that stands out, where you felt more connected, more at ease. What do you think might have been different about that experience?

Patient: There was one night at a coworker’s birthday last year where I told a dumb little story and everyone laughed and I felt…actually part of things for once. But even remembering it doesn't help — my brain says that was a fluke, and next time I’ll say something worse, they’ll laugh meanly, my boss will think I’m unprofessional, I’ll lose projects, spiral, lose the job, and end up completely on my own. I know that sounds extreme, but I can’t seem to believe the quieter, normal outcomes.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is trying to protect you from the possibility of being hurt or embarrassed, and it's doing that by amplifying the worst-case scenarios. Even though you did have a moment where you felt more connected and part of the group, your brain is saying that was just a fluke, and that it's not something you can rely on. It's like you're stuck in a loop of worst-case thinking, and it's hard to break free from it.

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to push through that fear and anxiety, even if it was just for a small moment? What do you think you might learn about yourself, or what might happen if you were able to connect with others in a social situation without that fear holding you back?

Patient: If I tried to push through, my head instantly fast-forwards to the whole collapse — I say something stupid, people laugh, somebody posts it, my boss sees it and thinks I'm unprofessional, I get cut out of projects, my performance tanks, I lose the job, and then I'm just... alone and scrambling. Maybe in theory I could feel proud or connected, but that feels like a fantasy my brain can't even register — the disaster story is so loud it drowns out the quieter possibilities. Honestly, even the idea of forcing myself makes me imagine fumbling and then spiraling harder, so I just can't trust that trying would end any differently.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind has created a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of failure is so strong that it's already predicted the outcome. It's not just that you're worried about what might happen, but that you're already convinced that it will happen, and that conviction is what's holding you back.

It's interesting that you mention that even the idea of trying to push through makes you imagine spiraling harder. It sounds like your mind is already preparing for the worst-case scenario, even before you take any action. It's almost as if your brain is trying to protect you from the possibility of embarrassment or failure, but in doing so, it's also preventing you from taking any risks at all.

Can you think of a way to test this idea, just for a moment? If you were to try to push through your fear and anxiety, what would happen? Would you really collapse, or would you find a way to connect with others and feel more at ease? It's not about predicting the outcome, but about seeing what happens when you take a small step towards taking a risk.

Patient: Honestly, when you say "test it," my mind already runs the tape: I say something awkward, people laugh, someone records it, it gets shared, my boss sees it and marks me unprofessional. That spirals into fewer projects, my performance tanking, getting passed over or even fired, and then I'm left scrambling and alone. I know it sounds extreme and probably irrational, but it feels inevitable—I can't picture a small, safe experiment without my brain fast-forwarding straight to disaster.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind has a default setting of catastrophic thinking, and no matter what I say, it's already conjuring up that worst-case scenario. It's not just about predicting the outcome, but it's like your brain is trying to prepare for the possibility of failure by running through all the terrible things that could happen.

It's almost as if you're trapped in a cycle of negative thinking, where you're always expecting the worst. It's not about being optimistic or pessimistic, it's about being stuck in a mindset that makes it impossible for you to take risks or try new things.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were to take a small, tiny step away from that catastrophic thinking? Not a big leap, just a tiny one. For example, if you were to say something small and silly in a low-stakes situation, like a joke or a comment in a conversation with a friend. Would your mind still spiral out of control, or would it be possible for you to stay present and not jump to the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I wish I could say I could stay present, but even a tiny joke spirals the same way — I say it, they laugh meanly, someone records it, it gets shared, my boss sees it and thinks I'm unprofessional, I lose trust, lose projects, then the job, and I'm left alone. I've tried to picture it going okay, but my brain just won't let the quieter outcome feel real; it feels impossible to believe. I don't know, it's just... every small risk turns into that whole collapse in my head.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in a never-ending loop of worst-case thinking, and no matter how small the risk or the situation, your mind is able to conjure up that catastrophic outcome. It's not just about predicting the future, it's about living in a state of constant anxiety and fear.

It's interesting that you mention trying to picture a quieter outcome, but your brain just won't let it feel real. It's almost as if your mind is trying to protect you from the possibility of being hurt or embarrassed, but in doing so, it's also preventing you from experiencing any kind of normalcy or joy.

Can I ask, do you ever feel like you're living in a state of suspended animation, where everything feels frozen and uncertain? It's like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, or for the worst-case scenario to play out. Is that how you feel most of the time?

Patient: Yeah — it's basically constant; I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop all the time. Even when things are fine my brain fast-forwards: I make a tiny mistake, people laugh, it gets shared, my boss thinks I'm unprofessional, I lose projects, then the job, and I'm left alone. It's exhausting and freezes me — I can't picture relaxing because that disaster story always feels more real than what's actually happening.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trapped in a state of perpetual anticipation, always waiting for the worst to happen. It's not just about the actual events themselves, but about the narrative that your brain has created around them. The idea that you're constantly at risk of being ridiculed, ostracized, or losing everything is a heavy weight to carry.

It's exhausting to constantly be on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's like you're living in a state of hypervigilance, always scanning your surroundings for potential threats. And even when things do seem calm, your brain is still running the worst-case scenario, making it impossible for you to truly relax.

Can I ask, do you ever feel like you're losing touch with your own emotions or needs? It's like you're so focused on avoiding the worst-case scenario that you're not allowing yourself to feel anything else. Are you able to connect with your own feelings, or are you always just trying to stay one step ahead of the disaster story?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm losing touch — most of the time I'm not tuning into feelings, I'm running the disaster movie in my head. If I try to check in, my brain interrupts with "you'll say something stupid, they'll laugh, your boss sees it, you lose everything," so I either go numb or start planning how to escape. I want to be that outgoing, action-oriented person, but I'm exhausted and frustrated because the quieter outcomes feel like fantasies I can't take seriously.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're living in a constant state of mental rehearsal, running the worst-case scenario over and over again. It's exhausting to be constantly on high alert, waiting for the other shoe to drop. And it's even more challenging when you try to check in with your own feelings, only to have your brain interrupt with that same disaster movie.

It's understandable that you want to be the outgoing, action-oriented person, but it's hard to take that step when you're so deeply consumed by fear and anxiety. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of avoidance, constantly planning how to escape or numb the pain.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were to try to take a small step back from that fear? Just for a moment, try to tune in to your own feelings, without letting your brain interrupt with the disaster movie. What do you think you might find?

Patient: If I try to tune in I might notice my chest tightening, a weird numbness, and a tiny, scared hope that maybe it's okay — but my brain immediately hijacks it and says that hope is a trap: I'll relax, say something stupid, they'll laugh, someone records it, my boss sees it, I lose projects, then the job, and I'm back alone. I want to feel whatever's under the fear, but I can't make that quieter outcome stick — it just feels impossible and makes me want to run.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain has become a masterful hijacker, quickly taking control of your thoughts and emotions to protect you from feeling vulnerable. The hope you try to grasp is met with a fierce resistance, as your brain warns you that relaxation is a trap, and that the worst-case scenario is always just around the corner.

It's heartbreaking that you're struggling to find a way to connect with your own feelings, even when you want to. It's like you're stuck in a constant state of emotional numbness, unable to feel anything except fear and anxiety.

Can I ask, is there anything that you used to be able to feel, before this fear and anxiety took hold? Anything that you enjoyed, or that brought you comfort? Even if it's just a small thing, it might be worth exploring, even if it's just a tiny step.

Patient: I used to love trivia nights and small dinner parties — I’d crack a joke and actually feel part of the group. But as soon as I think about it my brain says that was a fluke and next time I’ll say something worse, they’ll laugh cruelly, someone records it, my boss sees it, I lose work, and then I’m stuck alone, so I don’t go. I even miss quiet things like long walks or cooking, but the disaster movie drowns those out and I end up numb or planning my escape.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain has created a narrative that everything you've enjoyed or found comforting in the past is actually a setup for disaster, and that's all you can focus on. The fact that you used to enjoy trivia nights and small dinner parties, and even feel part of the group, is now overshadowed by the fear that you'll say something stupid and be ridiculed.

It's especially poignant that you're missing out on small pleasures like long walks or cooking, which can be a source of comfort and joy. But the fear and anxiety are so overwhelming that you're unable to experience them, and instead, you're left feeling numb or planning your escape.

Can I ask, is there anything that you've been holding onto, anything that you've been afraid to let go of? It's like you're stuck in a state of emotional paralysis, unable to move forward or let go of the fear that's holding you back.

Also, I want to try something different. Can you tell me about a time when you did feel like you were part of a group, or when you did feel a sense of connection with others? It could be something small, but I want to hear about it.

Patient: Last summer at a friend's trivia night I told this dumb little story and everyone laughed — I actually felt like I belonged for the first time in months. But the minute it ends my brain fast-forwards: next time I say something worse, they laugh cruelly, someone records it, my boss sees it and thinks I'm unprofessional, I lose projects, then the job, and I'm left completely alone. I’m so tired of that tape — it makes it impossible to trust that those nights could happen again.

It's like you're stuck in this cycle of thinking that every positive experience is followed by a catastrophic one. You're able to have a moment of connection and belonging, but your brain immediately hijacks it with the worst-case scenario.

It's exhausting to constantly be on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. You're tired of being controlled by this negative narrative, tired of feeling like you can't trust your own abilities or your own feelings.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were to try to challenge this narrative, even just a little bit? If you were to try to hold onto that feeling of connection and belonging, even if it's just for a moment? What do you think you might find?

Also, I want to try something. Can you look at that story you told at the trivia night, the one that everyone laughed at? Can you try to remember what it was, exactly? Not the way your brain is telling you it happened, but the actual story itself?

Patient: It was this dumb thing where I mixed up two client names and joked that I’d been so busy I’d started billing my grocery list — everyone laughed and it felt really easy for a minute. But the moment it lands in my head now I see it playing out worse next time: I mess up a detail, they laugh cruelly, someone posts it, my boss sees it and writes me off as careless, I lose projects and then the job. I know you want me to hold the memory of the night, but honestly I can't stop my brain from fast-forwarding to that whole collapse — the quieter outcome just doesn't feel real.

It's like you're stuck in this loop of thinking that every positive moment is followed by a catastrophic one. You're able to have a moment of connection and belonging, but your brain immediately hijacks it with the worst-case scenario.

It's not that you don't want to hold onto the memory of the night, it's just that your brain is preventing you from doing so. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, but in doing so, it's also preventing you from feeling any sense of joy or connection.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were to try to challenge this narrative, even just a little bit? If you were to try to hold onto the feeling of connection and belonging, even if it's just for a moment, without the fear of the worst-case scenario? What do you think you might find?

Also, I want to try something different. Can you try to focus on the feeling of connection and belonging that you experienced that night, without trying to hold onto the memory of the story itself? Can you try to feel that sense of ease and comfort that you felt for a minute, without the fear of the future?

Patient: I try to hold that ease — a warm, light feeling like people are actually listening — but before it settles my brain screams, “You’ll say something worse, they’ll laugh, someone records it, your boss sees it, you lose everything,” and it smothers the feeling. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling; it just feels impossible to make the quieter outcome feel real.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is a constant counterbalance to your desire to hold onto that feeling of ease and connection. You try to allow yourself to feel that sense of warmth and light, but your brain immediately shoots down the idea, making it feel like a pipe dream.

It's almost like you're trying to catch a glimpse of a bird's nest, but every time you think you see it, a hawk swoops in and chases it away. You're so focused on the fear of the worst-case scenario that you can't even begin to imagine the quieter outcome.

I want to try something. Can you imagine a scenario where you're in a situation that feels similar to that trivia night, but without the fear of messing up? Maybe someone is asking you a question, and you're feeling confident and easy. What would that feel like? Can you even imagine it?

Also, I want to try to shift the focus a bit. Instead of trying to make the quieter outcome feel real, can we try to focus on what's happening when you do feel that ease and connection? What are you experiencing in your body? What thoughts are you having? Can we try to understand what's happening in that moment, without worrying about the outcome?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — my chest loosens, my shoulders drop, there's this warm, fluttery ease and the thought, "They're listening, this is going well," but it barely forms before my brain yells that I'll say something worse, they'll laugh meanly, someone records it, my boss sees it and I lose projects and then my job. I want to sit with those sensations, but the disaster tape drowns them out every time, so I just end up trying not to breathe too loudly or planning my exit. I really am trying to notice the feeling, but it's like my mind refuses to let it be real.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is a constant editor, cutting off the moment you're trying to appreciate. You're trying to sit with the feelings, to hold onto the sense of ease and connection, but your brain is always interrupting, making it impossible for you to feel anything other than fear and anxiety.

It's almost like you're stuck in a perpetual state of "what if," where every moment is a test, and your brain is always running the worst-case scenario. You're not even sure if you're trying to be realistic or if it's just your brain's default setting, but the end result is the same: you're stuck in a cycle of fear and anxiety, unable to feel anything else.

I want to try something different. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your chest loosening? Can you feel the weight of your shoulders dropping? Can you notice the warmth and fluttery ease that you experience in your body? Don't try to think about the outcome or the worst-case scenario. Just focus on the sensations. Are there any differences between this moment and the previous ones? Is there anything new that's happening?

Patient: I can feel a tiny loosening in my chest and my shoulders drop for a second, like a faint warm flutter, but it's so brief it barely lands. Then my brain snaps to the tape — I say something stupid, they laugh, someone records it, my boss sees, I lose projects, then the job — and whatever calm I had just gets wiped out, so I tense up and start thinking about leaving.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is a switch that flips from calm to panic in an instant. You're able to experience a brief moment of relaxation, but it's so fleeting that it barely registers. Then, your brain immediately jumps on the worst-case scenario, and you're back in high alert, tensing up and preparing to defend yourself.

It's like you're living in a state of perpetual crisis management, constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. You're not even sure if you're safe or if your brain is just waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

I want to try something. Can you try to experiment with your body's response to this moment of calm? Instead of jumping to the worst-case scenario, what if you allowed yourself to stay in that brief moment of relaxation? What if you focused on the sensations in your body, the warmth and the fluttery ease? Can you try to hold onto that feeling for just a second longer, without your brain interrupting it?

Patient: I try, but that tiny loosening gets swallowed so fast — my chest tightens, my heart picks up, and the tape kicks in: I say something stupid, they laugh, someone records it, my boss sees, I lose projects, then my job.

I want to try something. Can we take a step back and look at this from a different angle? Instead of trying to stop the calm from getting hijacked, let's focus on what happens when it does get hijacked. What are you feeling right now? You mentioned you're feeling worn out and it's hard to keep going. Can you try to connect with those feelings? Are there any physical sensations that you're experiencing right now?

Also, I want to introduce a new idea. What if, instead of trying to stop the calm from getting hijacked, we tried to create a safe space for it to exist? What if we found a way to protect that brief moment of relaxation, so it didn't get swallowed up by the tape? Can you think of any ways we could do that?

Patient: Maybe a tiny ritual could help — like stepping outside for a minute, grounding with my feet on the ground, or a short mantra I repeat to myself. But even that snaps to the tape: I take a breath, my chest tightens, I blurt something, they laugh, someone records it, my boss sees, I lose projects and then my job — so those tricks feel pointless.

I think you're right, we don't need to try to fix everything at once. Let's take a step back and focus on just one small thing. Can we try a tiny experiment with a simple grounding exercise? Instead of trying to do something elaborate, let's just see if you can focus on your breath and your feet on the ground. No mantra, no special trick, just your breath and your body.

It might sound silly, but sometimes the simplest things can be the most powerful. And if it feels pointless, we can always try something else. But for now, let's just focus on this one tiny thing and see if it makes a difference.

Feet on the floor, slow breath in… for a blink my shoulders loosen and it feels like it might actually land, then the tape kicks in: I say something stupid, they laugh, someone posts it, my boss sees it, I lose projects, then the job.

Let's keep going, one slow breath at a time. We'll take it as long as you need.

Patient: Okay... I breathe out slowly — I feel a tiny loosen, like it might actually stick, but then the tape whispers I'll blurt something stupid, they'll laugh, someone records it, my boss sees it and I lose everything.

I can see that you're really struggling right now. We'll keep going with the slow six-second breaths for a bit longer. I'll count to six, and then you'll breathe out, and I'll hold for six seconds. Then, I'll count to six again, and you'll breathe in, and we'll hold for six seconds.

One... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) One... (long pause) Your body is releasing... (pause) One... (long pause) The tension is leaving...

Two... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) Two... (long pause) Your breath is slow... (pause) Two... (long pause) The air is moving...

Three... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) Three... (long pause) Your chest is falling... (pause) Three... (long pause) Your body is sinking...

Four... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) Four... (long pause) Your feet are grounded... (pause) Four... (long pause) Your body is stable...

Five... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) Five... (long pause) Your breath is deep... (pause) Five... (long pause) Your lungs are full...

Six... (pause) You breathe out... (pause) Six... (long pause) Your body is relaxing... (pause) Six... (long pause) The calm is settling...

Now, I want to try a very small grounding step with you. I want you to focus on your feet on the floor, and then bring your attention to three things in your environment. Can you do that for me?

One... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) Your feet are on the floor... (pause) Two... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) You can feel the weight of your body on the ground... (pause) Two... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) You can hear the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body... (pause) Three... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) You can see the objects around you, even if they're just a little blurry... (pause) Three... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) You can feel the air moving in and out of your body... (pause) Three... (pause) You breathe in... (pause) You can sense the present moment, right here and right now...

We'll keep going with this grounding exercise for

Patient: Okay... my feet are on the floor. Three things: a chipped coffee mug, my laptop, and a framed photo on the shelf. I can feel the weight through my heels and hear the low hum, but the tape's already whispering I'll blurt something stupid, they'll laugh, someone records it, my boss sees it and I lose everything — I'm pretty wiped out, but I can keep going slowly if you want.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're still struggling with the tape's whispering, but you're willing to keep going. That's a great sign. Let's keep moving at a slow pace.

You're focusing on your feet on the floor, and you've identified three things in your environment. That's a good start. Can you tell me more about the chipped coffee mug? What does it look like? Is it old or new?

And don't worry if your mind starts to wander again. We'll just take it one step at a time. You're doing great so far.

Patient: It's an old white mug with a blue rim—chip on the lip from when I dropped it moving apartments, coffee stain down one side, kind of stupidly attached to it because it reminds me of late-night studying. As soon as I notice it my brain shoots the usual tape: someone in a group spots it, they laugh at how sloppy I am, someone posts it, my boss sees it and thinks I'm careless, and everything spirals. I'm pretty wiped out but I can keep going if we do more slow breaths and grounding—can you guide me again, slower this time?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the mug is a reminder of a specific time and place, and it's triggering a strong reaction in you. I'm going to try to guide you through this again, slower and more gently.

Let's start with a deep breath in... (pause) One... (long pause) Your breath is filling your lungs... (pause) Two... (pause) Your breath is slowly leaving your body... (pause) Three... (pause) Your breath is calm and peaceful... (pause) Four... (pause) You can feel the weight of your body on the floor... (pause) Five... (pause) You can hear the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body... (pause) Six... (pause) You can see the objects around you, even if they're just a little blurry... (pause) Seven... (pause) You can feel the air moving in and out of your body... (pause) Eight... (pause) You can sense the present moment, right here and right now...

Now, let's focus on the mug. It's an old white mug with a blue rim, a chip on the lip, and a coffee stain down one side. Can you tell me more about it? What memories does it hold for you? How does it make you feel?

Patient: It was my late-night study mug in college — it somehow feels like a little anchor, comforting and stupidly sentimental. But as soon as I look at it my brain goes: someone notices the stain, they laugh, someone posts it, my boss sees it and thinks I'm careless, I lose projects and then my job. I'm pretty wiped out — can we keep doing the very slow breaths and grounding, but even slower? I don't want to stop, I just need it slowed down.

Patient: Okay... ACT sounds like another plan, but my brain's already running the same tape — I'll blurt something stupid, they'll laugh, someone posts it, my boss sees it, I lose projects and end up alone. I'm really worn out, but I'll try one more very slow breath with you and then name three things if you count me through, slowly.
