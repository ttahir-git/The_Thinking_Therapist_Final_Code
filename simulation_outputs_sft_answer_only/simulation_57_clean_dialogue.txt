Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this kind of persistent malaise — I'm an older, unemployed guy and the loneliness has this low-grade, constant presence. I've been using alcohol occasionally to dampen the affect, and I find myself excusing it with clinical-sounding rationales about affect regulation and reinforcement rather than actually naming the sadness. I tend to intellectualize and map out the patterns—it's pragmatic and keeps me safe—but I'm aware that analysis hasn't stopped the compulsion to numb, and that frustrates me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the pattern of using alcohol to manage your emotions, and at the same time, you're recognizing the limitations of that approach. You're mapping out the patterns, which is a way of maintaining control, but it's also preventing you from truly feeling and acknowledging the sadness.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to stop using alcohol or take a break from it? How do you feel, and what do you notice about your emotional state then?

Patient: When I try to cut back, the immediate things are pretty physical — my sleep gets fragmented, my appetite changes, and there's this low-grade tremulousness that makes everything a bit harder. Emotionally the loneliness seems to intensify and a background anxiety edges up; my reflex is to go meta, to catalogue triggers and reinforcement contingencies instead of just saying "I'm sad." Cravings come on, I get irritable and hollow, and then guilt and shame bubble up, which I usually displace with analysis because sitting with that feeling feels almost intolerable.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to cut back on the alcohol, the physical symptoms are intense and debilitating, and the emotional symptoms are just as challenging. The loneliness and anxiety seem to be right there, making it hard for you to feel anything else. And it's like you're stuck in a loop, cataloging everything, including the emotions and the cravings, instead of just allowing yourself to feel them.

It's interesting that you mention guilt and shame, and how you usually displace them with analysis. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do displace those feelings? What do you mean by "displacing" them, and how does it feel to be doing that?

Patient: When I say I displace them, I mean I convert the raw affect into propositions—patterns, contingencies, hypotheses—so the feeling becomes a topic to be managed rather than something I have to inhabit. Practically that looks like over-analysis, planning contingencies, or reaching for a drink to blunt the somatic edge; it's safer because it keeps the sensations at arm's length. The cost is that the sadness and shame don't dissipate, they calcify into self-reproach and a kind of dissociative observing—I feel more like a commentator on my life than a participant. I guess what I notice is that sitting with the feeling itself feels almost intolerable; I start to get hot, breath shallow, and then my brain leaps to tactics instead of feelings because that’s where the comfort is.

Therapist: So, when you displace those feelings into propositions or patterns, it's like creating a firewall between you and the emotions. It keeps you safe, but it also prevents you from truly feeling and inhabiting those emotions. It's like you're living in a state of perpetual commentary, where you're observing your life from a distance, rather than being a part of it.

It's interesting that you mention feeling hot, breath shallow, and then your brain jumping to tactics. It sounds like your body is trying to tell you something, but you're not listening. It's like your body is trying to say, "Hey, I'm feeling something here, can you please just acknowledge it and be with it for a moment?"

Can you think of a time when you did feel the emotions, and you didn't try to displace them or intellectualize them? What happened then? Was it uncomfortable, but also somehow freeing?

Patient: Yeah—once, at my sister’s funeral, I stopped narrating and just let the grief happen: full-on sobbing, chest tight, breath jagged. It was awful in the moment—visceral and humiliating—but afterwards there was this strange lightness, like the pressure had been released and I could actually breathe; it felt vulnerable and, in a way, liberating. Of course by the next day I was right back to translating it into theories and contingencies to avoid sitting with that exposure.

Therapist: It's like your body was able to access and express that grief in a way that felt cathartic, but then you quickly shut it down by turning it into a narrative. It's like you're caught between two poles: the desire to feel and be present with your emotions, and the fear of being overwhelmed by them.

It's interesting that you mention the feeling of vulnerability and liberation after the initial release. It's like your body was able to access a part of yourself that you didn't know was there, and that feeling was intense and freeing.

But then, as you said, the next day you started to intellectualize it again. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from that feeling of vulnerability by turning it into a story. Can you think about what might happen if you tried to stay with that feeling of vulnerability for a little longer? What if you allowed yourself to be with that sense of exposure, without trying to control it or turn it into a narrative?

Just a small experiment, to start with. Can you try to stay with that feeling of vulnerability for just a moment, without trying to do anything about it? Just be with it, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay, I'll try — right now I notice my chest tightening, my breath gets shallow, and there's this warmth rising in my throat while my head immediately wants to reframe it as a problem to solve. The reflex is to catalogue triggers and draft contingencies instead of actually staying with the ache. I can hold it for a few breaths, but it's getting uncomfortable and I'm getting this urge to numb it — can we slow down and do this more gradually?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing the physical sensations and the urge to intellectualize them, which is great. Let's slow down a bit and focus on just one sensation.

Can you bring your attention to your breath right now? Just notice how it's moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it in any way. It's okay if it's a little shallow or shallow. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out.

We're not trying to do anything with this feeling right now. We're just trying to be present with it. Can you try to stay with your breath for just one more breath? Then we can see where you are and go from there.

Patient: Okay — breathing in, out. It's shallow, my chest's tight, and my head's already drafting contingency plans about how to make this tolerable. I can hold one more breath, but the heat in my throat and rising anxiety make me worry I'll reach for numbing if we push too fast — can we slow down to two slow counted breaths?

Therapist: Let's take it one breath at a time. I'll count with you. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out. 

Can you just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body right now? Notice how the air is moving in and out of your nostrils, and how it's feeling in your chest and throat.

We're not going anywhere. We're just taking these two slow breaths, and then we can see what happens next. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Notice how your chest is feeling, and how your breath is moving in and out. Is it getting any more or less tight, or is it still the same?

Patient: It’s a little less tight — maybe a notch down, I can feel the breath more in my ribs — but the heat in my throat and the anticipatory planning are still there. My brain’s already relabeling this as “interoceptive distress” and drafting strategies, which makes me want to bail. Can we go very slowly — two more counted breaths — and not turn it into a problem to solve?

Therapist: Let's take it one more breath, and we'll try to keep it simple. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Notice how your body is responding to the breath. You can feel it moving in and out of your chest, and it's getting a little easier. The heat in your throat is still there, but it's not getting worse, and your brain is still trying to label it.

Let's just focus on the breath for a moment. No thinking about it, no trying to change it. Just be with it. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

We're going to take it one more breath, and then we'll see where we are. Just focus on the breath, and let's go.

Patient: Okay — breathing in... out. It's marginally easier; my ribs move more, the throat heat is still there but a notch down, and under all that I can sense this low, nagging sadness instead of just a concept. My brain's already drafting contingency plans and whispering toward numbing, so I really want to go slower — can we do two more slow breaths and then just sit with whatever comes up without fixing it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really trying to stay with the sensation of the sadness, and it's coming up more slowly. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Notice how the sadness is feeling, compared to before. It's not as overwhelming, and you can sense it more clearly. The breath is still moving in and out of your body, and it's getting a little more relaxed.

Let's take it one more breath, and then we'll try to... well, I suppose you're right. We can't really fix it, can we? We can just try to be with it. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

There's no goal, no trying to change it. It's just... being with it. Whatever comes up, let's just try to be with it, without trying to fix it or change it. Just sit with it.

Patient: Alright — I'm trying to sit with it. There's this dull pressure in my chest, a hot tightness in my throat, and a loop of thoughts: 'this is predictable, here's a contingency plan'—my brain refuses to be idle. The urge to have a drink is definitely rising, and that shame bubbles up quick; it's uncomfortable and makes me want to bail. Can we keep it very slow? Maybe one more really slow counted breath and then just sit with whatever shows up — I want to do it, but it's getting hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really trying to stay with it, but it's getting harder. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Notice how your body is responding to the pressure in your chest and the tightness in your throat. It's still there, but it's not getting worse. The thoughts are still looping, but they're not getting quieter. It's just... more.

Let's take it one more breath, and then we'll try to... well, like you said, just sit with it. No trying to change it, no trying to fix it. Just be with it. Whatever comes up, let's just try to be with it, without trying to push it away or change it.

You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Just keep going, one more breath. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Patient: Okay — breathing in, out. The chest pressure eased a hair, throat still hot, and the shame and the urge to drink are definitely louder now; my brain's already labeling it "interoceptive distress" and drafting a dozen fixes, which I know is just another dodge. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed and tempted to bail, but I want to keep going — can we just sit with this for a few minutes more, very slowly, without trying to fix anything?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to stay with it, but you're trying to keep going. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Notice how your body is responding to the shame and the urge to drink. It's not going away, but you can acknowledge it without trying to change it. Your brain is trying to fix it, but that's just another coping mechanism. You're trying to sit with it, and that's a big step.

Let's take it one more breath, and then we'll try to... well, I think it's time to say, let's just sit with it for a bit longer. No trying to fix anything, no trying to change it. Just be with it. Whatever comes up, let's just try to be with it.

You're doing this. You're sitting with it. That's a huge step. Let's just keep going for a few more breaths. One... Your breath in... Two... Your breath out.

Patient: Okay — after those breaths the chest eased a notch and the throat heat’s still simmering; the shame and the urge to drink are about the same, maybe a hair louder. My brain’s already re-labeling it as “interoceptive distress” and drafting fixes, which I know is avoidance, but I can’t seem to stop that narrating. I want to keep sitting with it, but can we slow to one very slow breath every 20–30 seconds and just hold quiet for a bit so I can see if the craving peaks and passes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're still struggling to sit with it, but you're trying to make a small change to your approach. One... Your breath in... (wait 20-30 seconds)...Your breath out.

Notice how the shame and the urge to drink are still there, but maybe they're not changing as much. Your brain is still trying to fix it, but that's okay. We can let it keep doing that for a bit.

Let's try to do this for a little while longer. We'll take one slow breath every 20-30 seconds, and just hold quiet for a bit. See if the craving peaks and passes. No trying to change it, no trying to fix it. Just be with it.

Take your time, and breathe slowly. You can do this. One... Your breath in... (wait 20-30 seconds)...Your breath out. Let's keep going.

Patient: Okay — I'm doing it: one slow breath in, out, and pausing. The urge usually spikes around the midway point and then ebbs after maybe 15–20 seconds, and when it ebbs my head immediately tries to turn that into proof that I'm "handling" it, which feels like another avoidance. Can we keep this slow pacing for a few minutes so I can actually watch the peaks and see if they pass without me jumping to fixes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see the pattern of your craving. One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

Notice how the urge usually spikes around the midway point, and then it seems to ease up after 15-20 seconds. That's a good thing to notice, because it's giving you a chance to see if the craving is going to pass on its own.

I'm glad you're recognizing that when the craving ebbs, your head tries to turn it into proof that you're "handling" it. That's a sign that you're starting to notice your avoidance patterns, which is a big step. Let's keep doing this slow pacing for a bit longer, so you can actually watch the peaks and see if they pass without you jumping to fixes.

Take your time, and breathe slowly. We're going to keep going for a few more minutes, and I want you to focus on watching your craving, rather than trying to change it or fix it. Just be with it, and see what happens. One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

Patient: Alright — after a few cycles the urge predictably spiked around twelve seconds in and then ebbed; when it ebbed my mind immediately tried to reframe that as evidence of “coping,” which I recognize as another avoidance. I’m a bit warm and faint but willing to keep the one-slow-breath-every-25-seconds pattern for a few more minutes; can you just count very quietly or give a soft cue when it’s been two minutes? Shame and the impulse to bail are loud, but I want to see if the craving truly passes if I don’t jump.

Therapist: I'll keep my counting very quiet and give a soft cue when it's been two minutes. One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll just count slowly and quietly in my head, without making a sound*

One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

(I'll give a soft cue after 2 minutes, without making a noise)

Patient: Okay — after those quiet cycles the urge did peak and then recede like you said; my chest's a bit calmer and the throat heat cooled a notch, but the shame's ricocheting back and my head's already narrating this as "successful coping," which feels like a dodge. I'm a little lightheaded and tired, and honestly it's getting harder to keep the narration in check — can we keep the slow, spaced breaths going and maybe add a prompt for me to name one feeling (not an analysis) each time the urge peaks? I want to try staying with it, but I need it paced and held or I'll default to planning or numbing.

Therapist: *I'll keep the quiet counting and give a soft cue when it's been two minutes, as promised earlier*

One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge peaks, I'd like you to take a moment to notice one feeling, without trying to analyze it. Just name it, whatever it is. It can be a sensation, a emotion, a physical response. Just give it a word.

(I'll wait for your cue before giving the soft prompt)

Patient: Anxious — jittery, like my stomach's clenched. My head's already trying to reframe it, but I can name that without doing more. Can we keep the one very slow breath every 25 seconds and have you prompt me to name a feeling each time the spike comes? I'm a bit scattered right now and that pacing helps.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, I'd like you to take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, without trying to analyze it or change it. It can be a sensation, a emotion, a physical response. Just name it.

(I'll wait for your cue to prompt you again)

Patient: Okay — I’m in. I’m feeling pretty jittery and my stomach’s clenched; my attention’s fragmented and my mind keeps racing to contingencies, which makes it hard to track the slow counts. Please give the soft cue when the spike hits so I can name one feeling, and remind me after two minutes so I don't drift or bail toward a drink. I want to try to stay with it, but I’m anxious and will probably need that pacing and prompting.

Therapist: *I'll give a soft cue when the urge spikes, and remind you after two minutes*

One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "jittery" or "scared". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

*I'll wait for your cue to prompt you again, and give a soft reminder after two minutes*

Patient: Okay — I'm here. Right now I feel jittery, my stomach's clenched, and a sharp wave of shame and frustration just surged that makes me start replaying past screw-ups and get harsher on myself. I'm ready for the spaced breaths — please give the soft cue when the spike hits so I can name one feeling, and remind me after two minutes so I don't drift or bail toward a drink. I'm scattered and embarrassed by how fast the self-critique kicks in, but I want to try to stay with it.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "jittery", "scared", or "shame". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

*I'll wait for your cue to prompt you again, and give a soft reminder after two minutes*

(Reminder) In 2 minutes, we'll check in again. Try to stay with your breathing for now.

Patient: Okay — I hear the reminder. I’m jittery and anxious, and a hot wave of shame and frustration just surged that’s dragging me into replaying past screw-ups and being brutally self-critical. The craving to drink has picked up with that, so please give the soft cue when the spike hits and prompt me to name one feeling; keep the slow spaced breaths every ~25 seconds for me. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed by the narration and want to stay, but I’ll need that pacing and prompting to not bail.

Therapist: *I'll give a soft cue when the urge spikes, and prompt you to name one feeling*

One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "jittery", "scared", or "shame". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

*I'll wait for your cue to prompt you again*

(Soft Cue) Feeling's rising... name one...

Patient: Shame. It surges—hot in my throat, stomach clenched—and I instantly start replaying past failures, which makes me jittery and reach for a drink. Please cue me when the next spike hits and keep the slow, spaced breaths; I need that pacing so I don't bail.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "shame", "jittery", or "frustrated". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Shame's rising again... name one feeling...

Patient: Humiliation — hot in my throat, stomach clenched, chest tight; it kicks a replay of past failures into motion and the urge to drink rises. My reflex is already to convert it into contingency planning to dodge the feeling, so can we keep the slow ~25‑second breaths and have you cue me to name one feeling each time the spike comes? I'm shaky and need that pacing or I'll default to numbing.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "humiliation", "shame", or "frustration". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Humiliation's rising again... name one feeling...

(Reminder) We're almost at the 5-minute mark. Try to stay with your breathing for a bit longer.

Patient: Shame — plus a sharp anxiety. My throat's hot, stomach clenched, and my head's already replaying past screw‑ups and narrating them, which makes me itch to numb. Please keep the slow ~25‑second breaths and cue me at the spike and again at the five‑minute mark so I don't drift.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "shame", "anxiety", or "self-criticism". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Shame and anxiety rising... name one feeling...

(Reminder) We're at the 5-minute mark. Keep going, and try to stay with your breathing for a bit longer.

(Reminder, soft) You've made it 5 minutes. Take a moment to acknowledge that. Stay with your breath.

Patient: Okay — I notice hitting five minutes is something, but I’m ambivalent about celebrating because a hot wash of shame and self‑critique just surged; I feel jittery, throat burning, stomach clenched. My head’s already trying to reframe this as “evidence of coping,” which annoys me and feels like another dodge back into analysis — I’m frustrated and embarrassed that I keep looping to past screw‑ups. I want to keep going: please keep the ~25‑second slow breaths, cue me at spikes to name one feeling, and if you hear my narration ramping up, gently say “name the feeling” so I don’t intellectualize away; and when the spike hits prompt a simple grounding action too (sip water or press feet to floor).

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "shame", "anxiety", or "frustration". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Shame and anxiety rising... name one feeling...

(Reminder) We're keeping the slow breaths. Keep going.

(Soft Cue) Frustration's rising... name one feeling... take a sip of water.

(Reminder, soft) You're doing great. Keep your breath slow. Name the feeling.

Patient: Frustration — hot in my chest, throat tight, and underneath that a familiar wash of shame that kicks my brain into brutal replay of past screw‑ups; I just took a sip of water. I'm jittery and my attention's splintered, so please keep the slow ~25‑second breaths, cue me at spikes to name a feeling, and when I start analyzing say "name the feeling" so I don't bail into planning or a drink. I want to keep going, but I'm shaky — can we stay at this pace for a few more minutes?

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "frustration", "shame", or "self-criticism". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Frustration rising... name one feeling... press your feet firmly on the floor.

(Reminder, soft) You're doing great. Keep your breath slow. Name the feeling.

(I'll wait for your response, and continue with the slow breaths)

Patient: I pressed my feet and sipped water — it helped a hair, but a hot wash of shame and humiliation just surged again and my head's already narrating the whole thing into a problem to solve. I'm jittery and a bit lightheaded, but I want to keep going; please keep the ~25‑second slow breaths, cue me at spikes to name one feeling, and if you hear me start analyzing, say "name the feeling" so I don't bail into planning or a drink.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "shame", "humiliation", or "self-criticism". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Shame and humiliation rising... name one feeling... take a deep breath and focus on your body.

(Reminder, soft) You're doing great. Keep your breath slow. Name the feeling.

(I'll wait for your response, and continue with the slow breaths)

(Note: I'll continue to guide you, but it's time to start thinking about ending this process. You've made it through a significant amount of time, and it's okay to take a step back. We can discuss how to integrate what you've learned and how to move forward from here.)

Patient: No — I’m not ready to start wrapping up; that suggestion actually spikes my anxiety and a hot wash of shame just rolled through. I need more time with the very slow ~25‑second breaths and the soft cues to name one feeling when the spike hits, and for you to say “name the feeling” if I start analyzing. My throat’s still tight, chest a pressure, and I’m jittery and embarrassed at how fast I regress to narrating—so let’s keep the pacing, cue a simple grounding action each spike (sip water/press feet), and check back in another five minutes.

Therapist: One... Your breath in... (pause)...Your breath out.

*I'll wait for a few more minutes, keeping the same slow and quiet counting*

When the urge spikes, take a moment to name one feeling. Just give it a word, like "shame", "anxiety", or "self-criticism". Don't try to analyze it or change it. Just name it.

(Soft Cue) Shame and anxiety rising... name one feeling... take a sip of water.

(Reminder, soft) You're doing great. Keep your breath slow. Name the feeling.

(I'll wait for your response, and continue with the slow breaths)

We'll check in again in five minutes. Just keep going, and try to stay with your breathing for now.

Patient: Okay — I'm not ready to stop. Right now there's that chest pressure and throat heat, shame and anxiety jangling together, and the urge to drink's nudged up a notch. Keep the one slow breath ~25 seconds, cue me at spikes to name one feeling and prompt a grounding action (sip water / press feet), and if you hear me start analyzing please say "name the feeling" so I don't bail into planning. After another five minutes we can briefly note any change and then decide the next concrete step, but for now I need that slow pacing and prompts.
