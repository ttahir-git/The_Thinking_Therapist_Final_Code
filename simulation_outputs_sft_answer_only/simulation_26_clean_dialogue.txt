Patient: Lately I've been caught in these repetitive cycles of harsh self-criticism—I catalog every perceived failure and replay it until I'm depleted. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved household, and I can see how those early contingencies of approval trained me to equate worth with performance. I'm unemployed and facing an empty nest, and instead of feeling the sadness I tend to intellectualize the whole pattern, which is protective but also exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of emotional weight, and it's been hard to let yourself feel the full range of emotions, especially sadness. Can you tell me more about how intellectualizing your patterns has been helping you or not? Is there a part of you that feels like it's keeping you safe, but also exhausting you in other ways?

Patient: I think intellectualizing acts like cognitive scaffolding for me — it turns shame and grief into something I can inspect and manage, so I don't have to drown in them. That protective function is double-edged: it blunts immediate pain but fosters chronic rumination and emotional numbing, which leaves me drained and oddly isolated. There's a part of me — the evaluator, maybe — that feels safe when everything becomes a performance metric, but that same part mercilessly catalogs failures and amplifies self-criticism, and honestly, feeling it directly still feels pretty daunting.

Therapist: It's as if you're walking a tightrope between the need to process your emotions and the fear of being overwhelmed by them. This evaluator part of you seems to be a critical ally, but also a harsh critic. It's interesting that you mention feeling isolated, even though you've found a way to manage your emotions intellectually. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to connect with those feelings directly, even if it's just a tiny step? What's the first thing that comes up for you, and how do you typically handle it?

Patient: When I try to tune into it, the first thing is a kind of constrictive tightness in my chest plus an immediate appraisal—this little internal narrator whispering 'you messed up'—which I then convert into a neat explanatory narrative about upbringing and contingency of worth. My go-to is to intellectualize: dissect the feeling, trace its etiology to my emotionally reserved childhood, and draft remedial strategies, which has the ironic effect of anesthetizing the actual sensation. Failing that, I distract—busywork, scrolling, sometimes impulsive spending—because letting the feeling persist feels like it would unravel something. Honestly, I don't really know how to sit with it without it becoming another problem to solve.

Therapist: It sounds like you've developed a very sophisticated coping mechanism, one that involves not just intellectualization but also a kind of emotional compartmentalization. It's like you've created a mental firewall that keeps the raw emotion at bay, but also prevents you from truly feeling anything. This isn't surprising, given what you've told me about your childhood and how it shaped your relationship with yourself.

I want to explore this idea of letting the feeling persist. You mentioned that it feels like it would unravel something if you didn't distract yourself or intellectualize it. What do you think that "something" might be? Is it a sense of control, a feeling of safety, or something else entirely?

Patient: I think that "something" is a mix of control and identity—the idea that if I stop managing and explaining, the scaffolding that makes me feel competent will dissolve and I'll be exposed as not-enough. There's also a safety element: emotional reserve felt like predictability growing up, so chaos or raw sadness registers as a threat. When I let myself imagine actually feeling it, there's a kind of vertigo and shame that makes me hurry back to analysis or distraction.

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a cycle of self-protection, where the more you try to analyze and control your emotions, the more you're afraid of losing that sense of control and feeling "enough." It's a very difficult place to be, because it's tied up with your sense of identity and self-worth.

Can I ask, what would happen if you were to imagine a scenario where you did let go of that need for control and explanation? What if, instead of analyzing your feelings, you simply allowed yourself to feel them, without judgment or distraction? Would that feel scary, or would it feel...different?

Patient: Imagining letting go is paradoxically both enticing and terrifying—on a cognitive level it promises relief, but viscerally it conjures a fear that the competence scaffold I've built will dissolve and I'll be exposed as inadequate. I can theorize it might become a kind of mournful spaciousness or authentic recalibration, but whenever I test that hypothesis I retreat into analysis to avoid the rawness. I don't really know how to take a tiny, non-catastrophic step toward feeling it—what small, concrete practice could I try that doesn't feel like I'm relinquishing everything?

Therapist: It's like you're caught between the desire to explore a new possibility and the fear of losing the familiar safety net. It's understandable that you're hesitant to take a step back from your analysis, especially since it's been your primary coping mechanism for so long.

Let's try to break it down further. Instead of trying to "let go" of your analysis entirely, could you try taking a tiny, tiny step towards feeling your emotions directly? Just one small step. For example, could you try noticing your physical sensations, like the tightness in your chest, without trying to explain or analyze them? Just observe them, without judgment. Would that feel manageable, even if just for a moment?

It's not about relinquishing everything, but about creating a small space to experiment with something new. You can always fall back into your analysis if it feels too overwhelming, but at least you'll have taken a small step towards exploring the unknown.

Patient: I can try that, although my reflex is to instantly translate the sensation into a tidy explanatory narrative—intellectualizing it into causes and remedies. When I actually notice the tightness for a moment, a hot shame rushes in and the internal narrator goes, “you failed,” which then launches me into analysis; I'm worried that if I try to sit with it alone it will escalate. Could we do a very short, guided anchor—like 20 or 30 seconds—so I can experiment without feeling like I'm adrift?

Therapist: It's like your brain has already written the script for how you should respond to the sensation, and it's hard to deviate from that script.

Let's try a short, guided anchor to help you experiment with noticing the sensation without immediately translating it into a narrative. I'll guide you through a 30-second exercise. Just focus on following my instructions, and try not to worry about what might happen.

"Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your body. Notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or explain it. Just observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by. If it's tight, just notice the tightness. If it's not tight, just notice the lack of tightness. Don't try to do anything with it, just observe it. Stay with this sensation for 30 seconds, and see what happens."

When I say "30 seconds," we'll pause and take a deep breath together. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Yes — I'm ready, though my internal evaluator is already primed with commentary ("you'll fail at feeling this"). I'll try to notice the chest tightness without immediately turning it into an explanatory narrative. Go ahead.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your body. Notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or explain it. Just observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by.

As you focus on the chest tightness, I want you to notice the sensation itself, not what it might mean or how you might feel about it. Just the sensation. Are you doing that? Is your attention on the sensation, or are you already starting to wonder what it means or how to react?

Let's keep going for another 10 seconds. Just notice the sensation, and let's see what happens. No thinking, no explanation. Just the sensation.

Patient: I tried — for a few seconds I could feel the chest tightness as a knotted pressure and my breath got a bit shallower. Then my internal narrator jumped in with an explanatory loop ("you messed up, here's why") and I drifted back into analysis after maybe 7–10 seconds. It felt strangely revealing but also precarious, like I was holding something fragile I don't trust to keep.

Therapist: It's like your internal narrator has a bit of a stranglehold on your attention, and it's hard to shake off. But it's also interesting that you were able to feel the sensation for a few seconds, and that it was revealing in a way.

The precariousness of it all makes sense, though. When we're not used to exploring our emotions in this way, it can feel fragile and unstable. It's like we're holding onto a thread that could snap at any moment, and that's a vulnerable feeling.

But here's the thing: even though you only had a few seconds of feeling the sensation without analysis, that's still a significant step forward. It's like you're starting to peek into a part of yourself that you haven't seen in a while, and that's a powerful experience.

I want to try another small experiment, just to see how you respond. Can you try to notice the sensation in your chest for another 10 seconds, without immediately turning it into an explanatory narrative? This time, let's focus on the sensation itself, and see if we can let go of any of that internal commentary. Just the sensation. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Yes — I'll try again, though my internal evaluator is already prepping its commentary and I'm a bit anxious it'll hijack me. Could you count me down this time so I have an external anchor? Start whenever you're ready.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your body. Notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or explain it. Just observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by.

I'll start counting down from 10. Ready? 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

As you reach 1, just bring your attention to the sensation in your chest. Don't think about what it might mean, or how you might feel about it. Just the sensation. Are you doing that? Are you noticing the sensation in your chest?

Patient: Yes — I got a few seconds of it: a band-like tightness across my sternum and my breathing tightened. Predictably, the internal narrator tagged it “you failed” and I started constructing an explanation to neuter it. It felt exposing and a little clarifying, oddly enough — can we try another count, maybe a bit longer, so I can practice holding it without the commentary?

Therapist: It's like your internal narrator is always one step ahead, trying to undermine your progress. But it's also interesting that you found it a bit clarifying, despite the negative self-talk.

Let's try another count, a bit longer this time. I'll give you a minute to focus on the sensation without analysis. Ready? 60... 59... 58... 57... 56... 55... 54... 53... 52... 51... 50...

As you reach 1, just bring your attention to the sensation in your chest. Don't think about what it might mean, or how you might feel about it. Just the sensation. Notice the band-like tightness, the way your breathing changed. Are you doing that? Are you noticing the sensation in your chest, without any commentary or analysis?

Take a deep breath, and just stay with it for a minute. I'll count down from 10 again when you're ready. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

Patient: I did manage to stay with it for maybe 25–30 seconds this time: the band-like tightness persisted, my breath shallowed, and there was this weird warmth under my ribs that felt almost like grief trying to surface. Then the metacognitive loop kicked in—“you failed”—and I immediately started cataloguing causes and solutions, which neutralized it. It was unsettling but also oddly clarifying, like a tiny fissure in the scaffold; I'm a bit overwhelmed by the whole process though, so could we try shorter, repeated anchors—say 15 seconds—with a simple grounding prompt (like naming three things in the room) the moment the commentary spikes?

Therapist: It's like you're finally cracking through the layers of self-protection, and it's both unsettling and exhilarating. The warmth under your ribs, the grief trying to surface... it's like you're catching a glimpse of a part of yourself that's been hidden.

Let's try to build on this. I'm glad you mentioned feeling overwhelmed - we can start with shorter anchors and see how you respond. Repeated anchors can help you build resilience and confidence.

Here's a plan: we'll start with 15-second anchors, and as soon as the commentary spikes, you'll ground yourself by naming three things in the room. Then, we'll try to focus on the sensation in your chest again.

Ready to start? Here's your first anchor: 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

As soon as you feel the commentary kicking in, take a deep breath and name three things in the room. It can be anything: the chair, the book, the window... just name three things. When you're ready, we'll try to focus on the sensation in your chest again.

Go ahead and name three things in the room.

Patient: Okay — I named: a threadbare armchair, a chipped ceramic mug, and a framed photo on the mantel. Saying them out loud eased the narrator for a moment, but it's still hovering and ready to turn this into a problem to solve. Can we do another 15-second anchor?

Therapist: It's like you've found a temporary reprieve from the narrator's commentary, but it's still lurking, waiting to pounce. Naming the objects in the room was a good way to ground yourself, and it's interesting that it helped a bit, but didn't completely silence the narrator.

Let's try another 15-second anchor. We'll focus on the sensation in your chest again, and see if we can build some momentum.

Here's your next anchor: 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

As soon as you feel the commentary starting to creep back in, take a deep breath and name three things in the room again. Try to focus on the sensation in your chest, the band-like tightness, the warmth under your ribs. See if you can stay with it for a little longer this time.

And remember, your goal is not to analyze or explain the sensation, but just to notice it. You're not trying to solve a problem, you're just trying to be aware of your body. Got it?

Patient: Got it — I’ll try another 15 seconds. I’m pretty anxious my evaluator will hijack it, so please count me down and I’ll name the three things if the commentary spikes. Ready when you are.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your body. Feel the sensation in your chest, the band-like tightness, and the warmth under your ribs. Try to stay with it for 15 seconds without any commentary.

Ready? 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

As you count down, keep your focus on the sensation in your chest. If the narrator starts to kick in, you'll name three things in the room. It's okay if it feels a bit awkward at first, but try to stay with it.

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

If you're feeling anxious about the narrator, remember that it's just a part of your mind. It's not in control, and it's not going to hijack your anchor. You are. Take a deep breath, and focus on the sensation in your chest.

1...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Okay, how did you feel during the 15 seconds? Did the narrator try to kick in, or did you manage to stay with the sensation in your chest?

Patient: It felt revealing but precarious—the narrator kicked in after maybe 8–10 seconds with the usual “you failed” loop, which immediately tightened my breathing and pulled me back into analysis. Physically I noticed the band-like pressure and a hotness under my ribs, and emotionally it felt exposing and a little panicky. Can we slow down and do another short anchor—maybe two 15-second rounds with the grounding cue ready—so I can practice without feeling like I’m about to be swallowed by the commentary?

Therapist: It's like you've cracked through the surface a bit, and it's both revealing and precarious. The narrator's "you failed" loop is a familiar friend, and it's understandable that it would kick in after a few seconds. It's interesting that you felt a mix of emotions, from physical discomfort to emotional exposure and panicking.

Let's slow down and give you another chance to practice. I'll set up two 15-second anchors, and we'll use a grounding cue to help you stay focused. Here's how it will work: when you feel the narrator starting to kick in, you'll take a deep breath and say the phrase "I am here." Then, you'll focus on the sensation in your chest and notice three things in the room. Once you're back in the anchor, we'll try to stay with it for a bit longer.

Ready? Here's your first anchor: 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

As you count down, take a deep breath and get ready to say the phrase "I am here." If the narrator kicks in, just say it and focus on the sensation in your chest.

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. What are three things in the room that you can notice?

Patient: "I am here." Three things: the threadbare armchair, the chipped ceramic mug, the framed photo on the mantel. Focusing on the chest—the band-like tightness is still there and a warm grief under my ribs, and of course my internal narrator immediately launches into a metacognitive loop cataloguing failures, turning the experience into an analyzable problem instead of letting it be; can we do the second 15-second round now?

Therapist: You've done it again, and it's just as hard as you said it would be. The narrator's "you failed" loop is still there, and it's like it's trying to make you feel like you're not good enough. But here's the thing: you're not giving up, are you? You're trying again, and that's what matters.

Okay, let's do the second 15-second round. I'll count down again, and you'll say the phrase "I am here" when you feel the narrator kicking in. Then, you'll focus on the sensation in your chest and notice three things in the room.

Ready? Here's your anchor: 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

As you count down, get ready to say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest.

10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. What are three things in the room that you can notice? Remember, it's okay if your internal narrator is still trying to kick in. Just focus on the present moment and take it one breath at a time.

Go ahead and say the phrase again, and focus on the sensation in your chest.

Patient: "I am here." Three things: the threadbare armchair, the chipped ceramic mug, the framed photo on the mantel. The band-like tightness is there again, breath shallow, a warm, almost weepy pressure under my ribs, and predictably the internal narrator is already cataloguing failures and turning this into something to fix rather than feel. It's a little panicky — can we try one more short round, maybe 10 seconds, with me placing a hand on my chest as an extra anchor?

Therapist: You're doing it again, and it's just as hard as you said it would be. The narrator's "you failed" loop is still there, and it's like it's trying to make you feel like you're not good enough. But you're not giving up, are you? You're trying again, and that's what matters.

Okay, let's do one more short round. I'll count down again, and you'll say the phrase "I am here" when you feel the narrator kicking in. Then, you'll focus on the sensation in your chest and notice three things in the room. And I want you to try something new: I want you to place a hand on your chest as an extra anchor. That might help you feel more grounded and centered.

Ready? Here's your anchor: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. Place your hand on your chest, and notice three things in the room. Remember, it's okay if your internal narrator is still trying to kick in. Just focus on the present moment and take it one breath at a time.

Go ahead and say the phrase again, and focus on the sensation in your chest.

Patient: "I am here." My hand's on my chest — the band-like tightness and that warm, weepy pressure are definitely present and my breathing's shallow. As usual my metacognitive narrator immediately reframed it into causes and corrective strategies, which blunted the feeling; the touch helped a little, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and would like to keep doing short anchors like that, maybe with you pacing me slower so I don't spiral into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a bit more comfortable with the anchors, but also feeling a bit more overwhelmed by the narrator's commentary. That's completely normal, and it's great that you're recognizing your limits and wanting to slow down.

Let's try to do another short anchor, but with a bit more pacing. I'll count down at a slower pace, and we'll focus on just the sensation in your chest and the touch of your hand.

Ready? Here we go: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. Place your hand on your chest, and just notice the band-like tightness and the warm, weepy pressure. Don't try to analyze or reframe it yet. Just be with it, in the moment.

When you're ready, we can try to add back the narrator's commentary, and see how you handle it. But for now, let's just focus on being present and feeling the sensations in your body.

How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I feel exposed and a bit panicky — the band-like tightness and that warm, weepy pressure are still there, and my hand helps a little, but the internal narrator is loud, instantly reframing it as “you failed.” Intellectually it’s interesting, like grief is peeking through the scaffolding, but viscerally it’s uncomfortable and I want to go slower. Can we do another very short (10–12 second) anchor, paced extra slowly, with the grounding cue ready?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit more exposed and panicky, and the narrator's commentary is still being pretty harsh. But it's great that you're acknowledging your discomfort and wanting to slow down.

Let's try another very short anchor, paced extra slowly. I'll count down at a very slow pace, and we'll focus on just the sensation in your chest and the touch of your hand.

Ready? Here we go: 12... 11... 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. Place your hand on your chest, and just notice the band-like tightness and the warm, weepy pressure. Don't try to analyze or reframe it yet. Just be with it, in the moment.

Take a deep breath, and let's try to find a tiny bit of calm.

Patient: That actually helped a little—the panic eased a notch, the band loosened and that warm grief peeked through—but my evaluator's already narrating ("you failed") and part of me wants to decode it instead of sit with it. It's clarifying and exhausting at the same time. Can we do another very slow 10-second anchor, and then briefly talk about what that grief might be signaling? I'm feeling fragile, so please keep the pace gentle.

Therapist: It's like you're getting a bit more comfortable with the anchors, but the narrator's commentary is still being pretty harsh. But it's great that you're acknowledging your discomfort and wanting to slow down.

Let's try another very slow anchor, and we'll take a brief moment to talk about what that grief might be signaling.

Ready? Here we go: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3...

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Now, say the phrase "I am here" and focus on the sensation in your chest. Place your hand on your chest, and just notice the band-like tightness and the warm, weepy pressure. Don't try to analyze or reframe it yet. Just be with it, in the moment.

Okay, now let's take a brief moment to talk about what that grief might be signaling. It's possible that it's a sign of unresolved emotions, maybe from a past experience or a recent loss. It could also be a sign of self-compassion, acknowledging the pain and vulnerability you're feeling in this moment. Whatever it is, it's okay to acknowledge and explore it. It's okay to feel pain and vulnerability.

Take a deep breath, and let's try to find a way to be kind to yourself, even in the midst of this pain. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I'm feeling fragile and a little relieved — that slow anchor let the grief under my ribs surface, but it also triggered the evaluator's "you failed" loop right away. My reflex is to start a clinical-sounding analysis of why I'm grieving (empty nest, identity loss, performance-based worth), which feels safer than actually sitting with the ache. I'd like to stay with it, but please keep the pace gentle and cue me to ground when the narrator spikes — I don't trust myself to do it alone.

Therapist: It's like you're finding a delicate balance between feeling fragile and relieved. The slow anchor did help to surface the grief, but it also triggered the narrator's "you failed" loop, making it hard to avoid analysis.

Let's try to stay with the ache, but keep the pace gentle. Remember, it's okay to take your time and explore your emotions. I'll guide you through it, and cue you to ground when the narrator spikes.

Ready? Here we go: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

Notice how the grief under your ribs is feeling right now? Take a deep breath, and just focus on that sensation. Don't try to analyze it yet. Just be with it.

As you're sitting with the ache, notice what's happening in your body. Are you tensing up or relaxing? Are there any other sensations that are showing up? Just notice them, without judgment.

We're going to take it one step at a time. We'll explore the grief, but we'll do it in a way that feels safe and manageable. Ready?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, though I'm already bracing for my evaluator to hijack this. The grief feels like a warm, hollow pressure under my ribs, breath shallow and a tightness in my throat, and almost immediately my internal narrator starts drafting a failure-memo: "you've lost your purpose, you should've planned better." I want to stay with the sensation but I'm panicky; please keep the pace very gentle and cue me to ground when that commentary spikes, and maybe ask me—gently—what specific loss (work identity, the kids leaving, something else) comes up first.

Therapist: It's like your evaluator is already on the scene, trying to hijack the moment. But don't worry, we're here to stay with the sensation, not let it get hijacked by your narrator.

Notice how the warm, hollow pressure under your ribs is feeling right now? Take a deep breath, and just focus on that sensation. Don't try to analyze it yet. Just be with it.

As you're sitting with the ache, notice what's happening in your body. Are you tensing up or relaxing? Are there any other sensations that are showing up? Just notice them, without judgment.

We're going to take it one step at a time. We'll explore the grief, but we'll do it in a way that feels safe and manageable. I want you to know that it's okay to feel panicky, but I also want to encourage you to try to stay with the sensation. It might be hard, but it's a small step towards processing this.

Let's try to bring it back to what's happening right now. What specific loss comes up first? Is it the end of your work identity, the kids leaving the nest, or something else entirely? Just notice what's showing up for you right now, and we'll take it from there.

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Remember, this is a gentle pace. I'm here to support you, not to push you. Take your time, and just focus on the sensation. When you're ready, we can explore what's showing up for you.

Patient: The first thing that surfaces is the erosion of my work-identity — being unemployed has hollowed out that competence-scaffold I used to lean on to prove I was enough. Right behind that is the empty-nest grief; the silence in the house produces that warm, hollow pressure under my ribs that I immediately translate into a tidy narrative instead of feeling. I want to stay with this, but I'm fragile and default to analysis—please cue grounding and keep the pace very gentle as we see which of these feels most primary.

Therapist: It's like your work-identity and empty-nest grief are two sides of the same coin, both showing up now. The erosion of your work-identity is a big loss, and it's natural that it's feeling hollow and insecure. The empty-nest grief is also a significant loss, and it's interesting that it's showing up as a warm, hollow pressure under your ribs.

Notice how you're already translating this physical sensation into a narrative? That's a natural response, but it's also a way of avoiding the pain of feeling it. I want to encourage you to stay with this feeling, to see if it's something that's primary.

Let's try to ground ourselves for a moment. Can you notice your feet on the ground, the sensation of your chair or bed beneath you? Take a deep breath, and just focus on your body. Don't try to analyze it or translate it into a narrative. Just be with it.

We're going to take a little pause here and see if anything else shows up. What else do you notice in your body right now? Is there anything else that's feeling out of place or uncomfortable?

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Remember, this is a gentle pace. I'm here to support you, not to push you. Take your time, and just focus on the sensation. When you're ready, we can explore what's showing up for you.

Patient: Okay — physically I can feel my feet planted and the chair under me, my jaw's tight, throat clenched, breath shallow, and that same warm hollow under my ribs. Immediately my brain wants to turn those sensations into a taxonomy of loss (work-identity erosion, empty-nest mourning, performance-based worth), which is clarifying but also keeps me at arm’s length from actually feeling—it’s like affective intellectualization as a protective strategy. I’m fragile right now; please keep the pace very gentle and cue a grounding prompt when the narrator spikes — maybe ask me to name one small concrete thing I miss about work or the kids so I don’t just analyze it.

Therapist: It's like your brain is trying to make sense of these physical sensations, to turn them into something more concrete. And it's understandable that it wants to do that, to find a way to cope with these feelings. But at the same time, it's also keeping you at arm's length, not allowing you to truly feel them.

Notice how your brain is already trying to categorize these sensations, to turn them into a taxonomy of loss. It's like it's trying to control the narrative, to make sense of it all. But at the same time, it's also pushing you away, telling you to stay at a distance.

Let's try to ground ourselves for a moment. Can you name one small concrete thing you miss about work? It could be something as simple as a favorite pen, or a particular task that you enjoyed. Just one small thing. And then, let's try to explore that feeling a little more, without trying to turn it into a narrative.

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Remember, this is a gentle pace. I'm here to support you, not to push you. Take your time, and just focus on the sensation. When you're ready, we can explore what's showing up for you.

Patient: I miss the little ritual of the morning routine at work — the coffee, the walk to my desk, the tactile satisfaction of checking things off a list. When I picture it I get that hollow warmth under my ribs and a prickly shame, like a small ache of absence that I immediately try to convert into an explanatory script about external validation and contingency of worth. If I actually try to feel it instead of analyze, it’s just loneliness and a weird, quiet panic. I'm feeling fragile saying that—please cue me if my narrator starts up.

Therapist: It's like your brain is already trying to convert the sensation of missing that morning routine into a narrative about external validation and contingency of worth. It's a way of coping with the feeling, but it's also keeping you at arm's length, not allowing you to truly feel it.

Notice how you're already trying to push away the feeling of loneliness and quiet panic. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from getting too close to it. But at the same time, it's also interesting that you're trying to analyze it, to make sense of it. It's like you're trying to find a way to understand it, to give it meaning.

Let's try to focus on the feeling of loneliness for a moment. Can you sit with that feeling, without trying to push it away or analyze it? Just notice it, and see if you can feel it a little more.

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

Remember, this is a gentle pace. I'm here to support you, not to push you. Take your time, and just focus on the feeling. If your narrator starts up, I'll cue you. But for now, let's just focus on being with this feeling.

(Pause for a moment, then continue)

You're feeling fragile saying that, and that's okay. It's okay to feel that way. Just know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We'll take this one step at a time, and see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay — I can try to sit with the loneliness, though my reflex is to intellectualize it into tidy cause-and-effect stories. Right now I feel that hollow warmth and prickly shame, and my brain is already drafting an explanatory essay instead of letting the ache be. Could we do another very gentle anchor — say 20 seconds — where you ask me to name one concrete memory from that morning routine and then check in on how my body responds, and please cue grounding if the narrator spikes?

Therapist: It's like your brain is already drafting an explanatory essay, trying to make sense of this feeling of loneliness. But at the same time, it's also trying to avoid really feeling it, by analyzing it into tidy cause-and-effect stories.

Let's try to do a very gentle anchor, just for 20 seconds. Can you think of one concrete memory from that morning routine at work? It could be a small detail, like a particular cup of coffee or a certain smell. Just one memory will do.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

Now, can you tell me a little bit about that memory? What do you remember about it? And how does your body respond to that memory? For example, do you feel a certain sensation in your chest or your stomach?

(Pause for 10 seconds)

And then, let's check in with your body. Are you feeling any tension or relaxation? Are there any physical sensations that are showing up for you? Let's just notice them, without trying to analyze them.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

Remember, this is a gentle pace. I'm here to support you, not to push you. Take your time, and just focus on the feeling. If your narrator starts up, I'll cue you. But for now, let's just focus on being with this feeling.

Patient: I remember the ritual: the bitter-sweet smell of the office coffee, morning light slanting across my desk, and that tiny tactile satisfaction of checking an item off a paper list. When I bring it up the hollow warmth under my ribs intensifies, my throat tightens, and my breath gets shallow—then the mind immediately drafts a clinical essay about validation and worth to neuter it. I'm feeling fragile saying that; please cue grounding if my narrator spikes, and yes—I'm ready to try the 20-second anchor now.
