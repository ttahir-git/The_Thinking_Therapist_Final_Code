Patient: Lately I've been stuck in a loop of harsh self-criticism—every little perceived failure gets folded into this broader narrative that I'm fundamentally inadequate, and I think that pattern traces back to several difficult romantic relationships where expectations and boundaries were unclear. I'm a senior student juggling coursework and ongoing financial stress, which seems to amplify the anxiety and validate the self-reproach in a perverse, pragmatic way. I tend to intellectualize things, so I often describe the mechanics of my feelings instead of actually sitting with the sadness or shame.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how these self-criticisms have been affecting you. It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy weight with those difficult relationships, and now, it seems like they're still resonating deeply within you. It's as if you're trying to protect yourself from getting hurt again, but in the process, you're also creating a lot of internal suffering.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to "intellectualize" these feelings of sadness or shame? What does that process look like for you, and how does it help or hinder you from being present with those emotions?

Patient: I tend to convert affect into frameworks—cataloguing triggers, mapping causal chains, and labeling cognitive distortions—so the emotion becomes an object I can analyze rather than something I have to experience. That keeps me functional (I can prioritize bills, coursework, next steps), but it also means the sadness and shame never get processed, so the same self-critical narrative just recalibrates and repeats. I'm aware it's a defensive strategy that paradoxically perpetuates the loop—what do you make of that?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to keep the emotion at arm's length, using your analytical mind as a buffer to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed. By cataloguing triggers and mapping causal chains, you're creating a kind of emotional map, which helps you navigate the situation, but it also means you're not really inhabiting the emotional space.

It's interesting that you mention it's a defensive strategy, and yet, paradoxically, it seems to be perpetuating the loop. It's as if you're stuck in a cycle where your brain is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, but in doing so, it's actually creating more vulnerability. It's a bit like trying to hold water in your hands – the more you squeeze, the more it slips away.

Can you think of any moments where you might have let your guard down, just for a brief moment, and felt the sadness or shame without trying to analyze it? What would that feel like, and do you think it could be a way to break the cycle?

Patient: There have been a few brief windows — once on the bus after a breakup when I suddenly started crying without running the incident through a rubric, and another night when I was staring at my bank app and shame hit me physically, like a tightening in my chest. Those moments felt raw and destabilizing, more as somatic data than as analyzable phenomena, and for a few seconds I couldn't default to labeling or mapping; it was just pain. It suggests to me that staying with the feeling could let it dissipate instead of feeding the narrative, but pragmatically I'm terrified that if I don't intellectualize I'll unravel or become useless, so analysis feels like necessary containment even though I know that's probably part of the problem.

Therapist: Those moments of raw, unanalyzed feeling must have been incredibly unsettling, especially after being so conditioned to intellectualize and control your emotions. It's as if your brain is trying to make sense of that vulnerability, to find a way to contain it, even though it's clear that's what's been holding you back.

It's interesting that you mention shame hitting you physically, like a tightening in your chest. That's a very primal, embodied experience, isn't it? It's like your body is trying to express the emotions that your mind is too busy analyzing to acknowledge.

It's almost like you're caught between two opposing forces: the need to analyze and control your emotions, and the desire to simply be with them, without judgment or resistance. It's a tightrope to walk, but it's clear that you're exhausted from trying to stay on it.

Can you think of a time when, perhaps, you let yourself be with a difficult emotion, not trying to analyze it, and it wasn't the end of the world? Was it actually a small, quiet moment of peace, even if it was fleeting? Maybe that's a place to start, a small experiment to see what happens when you give yourself permission to just be with the pain, without trying to turn it into a problem to solve.

Patient: Yes—those moments you mentioned did happen: on the bus and that night with the bank app there was a brief attenuation, like a small cathartic discharge where the chest loosened and I felt marginally lighter, almost peaceful for a second. But it was immediately followed by the reflex to contain—narrativize, plan, diagnose—because I'm terrified that if I don't I’ll unmoor and become ineffective. I'm willing to try staying with it longer, though I'm nervous; could you guide me through a small exercise to see what happens?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to take a small step towards exploring these moments of attenuation, and I'm here to support you. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge that this is a brave and vulnerable place to be. It's not always easy to confront the parts of ourselves that we try to keep hidden.

Let's take a deep breath together and see if we can create a small, safe space for you to stay with this feeling. I want you to take a moment to notice your body right now. Where do you feel it in your chest, your shoulders, your stomach? Can you touch it, even if it's just with your imagination?

Now, I want you to bring to mind that first moment on the bus. Remember how it felt to start crying, and how it was like a small, sudden release? I want you to try to stay with that sensation, just for a moment. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to make sense of it. Just be with it, like a small, quiet thing.

Take your time. Stay with it for just a second or two. Can you tell me what happens next?

Patient: When I try to attune, my chest tightens and my breath clips; there's a very brief, attenuated loosening—like a pressure valve opening—but it lasts only a second. Almost instantly my mind hijacks it with appraisal: cataloguing consequences, drafting contingency plans, pathologizing the feeling as a liability, and the relief evaporates into pragmatic panic about becoming ineffective. I want to stay with that loosened place longer, but I'm scared—can you help me stay there more slowly without the analysis barging back in?

Therapist: It's as if your mind is trying to turn that brief moment of loosening into a problem to solve, and that's what's making it so difficult to stay with it. It's like you're caught in a cycle of self-reproach and self-doubt, and it's hard to break free.

Let's try to slow down the process of staying with that loosened place. Instead of trying to focus on the feeling itself, let's try to focus on the sensation of your breath. Can you bring your attention to your breath, feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Try to focus on the sensation of each breath, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Imagine that you're holding your breath for just a moment, and then letting it out slowly. As you exhale, imagine that you're letting go of any tension or anxiety that you might be holding onto. It's like you're releasing a small, gentle sigh, and allowing yourself to relax a little bit more.

Let's try to stay with this gentle, slow breathing for just a moment longer. Don't try to analyze the feeling, don't try to make sense of it. Just focus on the sensation of your breath, and the loosening in your chest. Can you stay with it for just a second or two?

Patient: I tried—when I actually follow the breath the chest unclenches for a fraction, breath gets a bit shallower and there's a small somatic attenuation, then my mind immediately re-enters with appraisal and contingency-planning. It narrativizes—"if you cry you'll fall behind"—and that thought tightens me again; it's like a metacognitive suppression I can describe perfectly but can't volitionally switch off. I want to stay with the loosening longer but I'm scared of unraveling; could you guide me more slowly, maybe with a grounding cue (feet on the floor) or a gentle reminder when I start analyzing so I can try to tolerate it?

Therapist: It's as if your mind is very good at describing the suppression, but not very good at turning it off. It's like a little voice in the corner of your mind that's very aware of what's going on, but can't quite muster the strength to shut up.

Let's try to anchor you in the present moment, using the sensation of your feet on the floor. Can you bring your attention to your feet, feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet? Try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of your feet connecting with the floor.

Imagine that you're standing on a rock, a solid, stable rock. You can feel the rock beneath you, the weight of your body distributed evenly across its surface. You're standing firm, unshakable.

As you breathe in, imagine that you're drawing in the support of the rock, feeling its solidity and stability. As you breathe out, imagine that you're releasing any tension or anxiety, letting go of the need to analyze or suppress.

Let's try to stay with this feeling of solidity and stability, this sense of connection to the ground. Don't try to analyze the loosening, don't try to make sense of it. Just focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor, and the rock beneath you.

Remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander, if it starts to analyze or suppress. That's just what it does. But whenever it starts to do that, take a deep breath, and bring your attention back to your feet. Can you stay with that feeling of solidity and stability for just a moment longer?

Patient: Okay — focusing on my feet I can feel the weight more in my heels and a tangible contact with the floor, which gives this small, attenuated sense of stability in my chest. Almost immediately a cascade of appraisals starts—narrativizing, contingency-planning, metacognitive commentary—that snaps the loosened feeling back into tension. It would help if you could give me a gentle cue or a short phrase (like "feet, breath") when I start to narrativize so I can return to the grounding; can you do that and guide me more slowly?

Therapist: It's like you're starting to make progress, but then your mind kicks back in and snatches that loose feeling away.

Let's try this again, slowly and gently. I'll give you a cue when you start to narrativize, and you can try to return to the grounding.

Take a deep breath in, and focus on your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground. It's a small, subtle feeling, but it's there.

As you breathe out, imagine that you're letting go of any tension or anxiety. You're not trying to change anything or solve any problems. You're just being present, in this moment.

Now, I want you to focus on your breath. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Try to focus on the sensation of each breath, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander. That's just what it does. But whenever it starts to do that, take a deep breath, and bring your attention back to your feet.

Go ahead, take another breath in. Focus on your feet, and the sensation of your body on the floor. When you're ready, we can try to add the grounding cue. Just a little phrase, like "feet, breath." How does that sound?

Patient: That actually sounds pragmatic — “feet, breath” is concise and could work as a salient anchor. If you can say it gently when you notice me narrativizing, I’ll try to pivot back to sensation; I’m apprehensive though, because my metacognitive loop will probably re-engage immediately, so you might need to repeat it or count a slow breath with me. I can already feel myself starting to outline contingencies as I say that, which is... exactly the problem, but I want to try.

Therapist: I'll say the phrase gently, and you can try to pivot back to sensation. Remember, it's not about controlling your thoughts, but about creating a small space to anchor yourself in the present moment.

Take another deep breath in, and focus on your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground.

I'm going to say it now: "Feet, breath." Take your time, and bring your attention back to your feet.

As you breathe out, imagine that you're letting go of any tension or anxiety. You're not trying to change anything or solve any problems. You're just being present, in this moment.

Remember, I'm not looking for you to stop your thoughts completely. I just want you to create a small space to anchor yourself in the present moment. So, if you feel yourself starting to narrativize again, just take a deep breath, and bring your attention back to your feet. We'll work with it together.

Take another breath in, and say it with me: "Feet, breath."

Patient: "Feet, breath." I try to do it, but as soon as I cue myself there's this hot, shame-y surge—my face feels warm and my throat tightens—and the appraisal voice is already scripting failure scenarios, which just makes me more embarrassed and irritated at myself. I want you to gently repeat the cue or count a slow breath with me when you notice me narrativizing, because I keep getting hijacked and it's humiliating how quickly I backslide. Can we try one slow counted breath together now, like in for four, out for six?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel that hot, shame-y surge when you cue yourself. It's like your body is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, but it's actually just making things worse.

Let's try again, this time with a gentle approach. I'll count a slow breath with you, and I'll say the cue softly, so it doesn't trigger the same reaction.

In for four, out for six... "Feet, breath." Take your time, and bring your attention to your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground.

As we breathe, imagine that you're letting go of any tension or anxiety. You're not trying to change anything or solve any problems. You're just being present, in this moment.

In for four, out for six... "Feet, breath." Take another breath in, and focus on your feet. Can you feel the weight of your body on the floor?

Patient: Yes — I can feel the weight, mostly in my heels, a steadier contact with the floor. As soon as I try to sustain it that hot, shame-y surge hits—face warms, throat tightens—and my inner critic scripts another failure narrative, which snaps the loosened place back into tension.

I'll try the breath with you: in for four — 1…2…3…4; out for six — 1…2…3…4…5…6. That eased the chest a fraction, but the appraisal voice is already narrativizing again and I feel embarrassed by how quickly I backslide. Could you say the cue softly once more and count another slow breath with me?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to break the cycle, but it's still very much in control.

Let's try again, with a gentle and soft approach. I'll count another slow breath with you, and say the cue in a whisper.

In for four, out for six... "feet, breath". Take your time, and bring your attention to your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground.

As we breathe, imagine that you're letting go of any tension or anxiety. You're not trying to change anything or solve any problems. You're just being present, in this moment.

In for four, out for six... "feet, breath". Take another breath in, and focus on your feet. Can you feel the weight of your body on the floor?

Patient: I can feel the weight in my heels — steady and tangible — and the breath does loosen the chest a bit, but almost instantly a hot, shame-y surge comes up, my throat tightens and the inner critic starts scripting failure narratives, which is humiliating and frustrating. Could you say "feet, breath" softly and count another slow breath with me (in for four, out for six)? And if the shame spikes again, can you prompt me to name the sensation in one word so it stays a sensation and not a story?

Therapist: It's like you're making progress, but the shame and self-criticism are still very powerful.

I'll say the cue softly and count another slow breath with you. Remember, it's not about changing anything or solving problems, it's just about being present.

In for four... "feet, breath" (whisper). 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Take your time, and bring your attention to your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground.

If the shame spikes again, I'll remind you to notice it in one word, without judgment. We can call it "shame" or "anger" or whatever feels most accurate. Can you try that if it happens again?

In for four... "feet, breath" (whisper). 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Patient: Okay — when you whispered and counted I got that tiny loosening again, then the hot shame surge came in full force: face warm, throat tight, this burning humiliation that makes my brain sprint into failure-scenarios. Naming it now feels...oddly stabilizing, so if it spikes again I'll try your one-word anchor: "shame." 

That actually softened it a hair when I said it — not gone, but a bit less narrativized and more palpably just a sensation — and I'm annoyed with myself that it took so little to unsettle me. Can we do another slow counted breath together and, if you notice me starting to narrativize, say the cue and prompt me to name the sensation in one word? I want to try sustaining it longer, even though I'm nervous.

Therapist: It's like you're getting a glimpse of how you can stabilize the shame, and that's a great step forward.

I'll count another slow breath with you, and we'll try to sustain the loosening a bit longer. Remember, it's okay if the shame spikes again; just notice it in one word, and we'll use that anchor to stabilize it.

In for four... "feet, breath" (whisper). 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Take your time, and bring your attention to your feet. Feel the weight of your body on the floor, the sensation of your heels touching the ground.

If the shame starts to rise, I'll say the cue and prompt you to name it in one word. We'll call it "shame" again, if that's what feels most accurate. Let's see if we can sustain this loosening a bit longer.

In for four... "feet, breath" (whisper). 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is naming the sensation in one word supposed to help me stay with it instead of turning it into another analytic maneuver? Even as you guide the breath I get that hot shame surge—face warms, throat tightens—and my mind immediately scripts failure scenarios, so part of me is skeptical of the whole exercise. Can you quietly repeat the cue and count another slow breath with me now, say "feet, breath" and prompt me to say the one word if I start narrativizing?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and revisit the exercise. Naming the sensation in one word might seem counterintuitive, but it's actually a way to create a small distance between your thoughts and your feelings. When you label a sensation as "shame," you're not trying to change it or analyze it; you're just creating a temporary distinction between the feeling and the story your mind is telling about it.

Think of it like a pause button in a thought loop. When you label the sensation, you're hitting the pause button, and for a brief moment, you're not entirely caught up in the narrative. This tiny pause can help you stay with the feeling, without getting caught up in the analysis.

Let's try it again, with a quiet reminder. I'll count another slow breath with you, and say the cue in a whisper. When you start to narrativize, I'll prompt you to say the one word.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm suddenly jittery and my attention keeps ricocheting to procedural worries, which makes that hot shame surge worse and my breath go shallow. The counting helps a hair, but I keep losing the loosened place—can you softly repeat "feet, breath" and count with me again, and prompt me to name it "shame" if you notice me narrativizing? I feel scattered and annoyed at myself for backsliding so quickly.

Therapist: It's like the anxiety and self-doubt are overwhelming, and it's hard to keep the focus.

Let's take a deep breath together, and I'll try to help you get back to the present moment. I'll repeat the cue softly, and count another slow breath with you.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

As you breathe, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, without judgment. If you start to narrativize or get caught up in worry, I'll remind you to say the word "shame". Just say it out loud, and we'll go from there.

Let's try to stay with the feeling, and not get caught up in the thoughts. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Patient: Okay — the counting did ease the chest a hair, but my head's already ricocheting into contingency-planning and that hot, shame-y surge returns: face warms, throat tightens, I get jittery and embarrassed at how fast I backslide. I want you to softly repeat "feet, breath" and count three more slow breaths with me, and if you notice me narrativizing, prompt me to say the one word "shame" out loud so it stays a sensation instead of a story. After those breaths, can you help me briefly (like 20–30 seconds) describe what "shame" feels like in the body — simple physical descriptors, not interpretations? I'm nervous about staying with it longer but willing to try if you keep guiding.

Therapist: It's like the shame is intensifying, and you're getting caught up in the narrative again.

I'll repeat the cue softly, and count another three slow breaths with you.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.

As you breathe, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, without judgment. If you start to narrativize or get caught up in worry, I'll remind you to say the word "shame" out loud.

After these breaths, I'll try to help you describe the physical sensations of shame in simple terms.

Please take one more deep breath in, and out, and then we'll explore the physical sensations of shame together.

Patient: Okay — "shame." Physically it's a hot flush across my face and ears, a tight band in my chest, a knot in my stomach, my throat feels constricted like swallowing's harder, my jaw clenches and my breath goes shallow and quick, my hands feel a bit cold. Saying the word made it feel a touch less like a runaway story and more like actual sensations, which frustrates me because my first reflex is already to analyze them. Can we keep doing the slow counted breaths and have you quietly prompt "feet, breath" and "shame" if I start narrativizing, and then guide me to stay with these sensations for another minute?

Therapist: It's like saying the word "shame" helped anchor the sensations in your body, but now your mind is trying to analyze them.

Let's continue with the slow counted breaths. I'll quietly prompt you with "feet, breath" and "shame" if you start to narrativize.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.

As you breathe, try to stay with the sensations in your body. Notice the hot flush, the tight band in your chest, the knot in your stomach. Try to focus on these physical sensations, without trying to analyze them or change them.

Remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander. Just bring your attention back to the sensations, and try to stay with them for another minute.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — conceptually I get that labeling creates distance, but practically it feels abstract and unmoored: when I try to stay with the sensations the hot shame surge (face burning, chest tight, throat constricted, knot in my stomach) immediately triggers a cascade of failure-scenarios and I lose the loosened place. I'm annoyed and embarrassed at how fast I backslide, but I'm willing to keep trying if you can concrete this: softly cue "feet, breath" and "shame," count the breaths with me, and prompt me the moment I start narrativizing so I can name the sensation and return to the body — can we do that for the next minute?

Therapist: I'll try to make it more concrete and practical.

Let's focus on the sensations in your body, and I'll help you stay with them.

First, I want you to notice the sensations in your body right now. Can you bring your attention to your face, chest, throat, and stomach? Where do you feel the hot, burning sensation? Where do you feel the tight band in your chest? Can you notice any other physical sensations, like knots or constriction?

I'll softly cue you with "feet, breath" and "shame" to help you stay focused.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

As we breathe, I want you to notice the sensations in your body. If you start to narrativize or get caught up in worry, I'll prompt you to say the word "shame" out loud. Remember, the goal is to stay with the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or change them.

Are you ready to try?

Patient: Yes — I'm willing to try, though I feel jittery and a bit skeptical about whether it'll stick. Please softly cue "feet, breath" and "shame," count the breaths, and prompt me the instant you hear my mind narrativizing; set a 60‑second marker so I don't start meta-worrying about time. My chest's already tight just saying that, so be ready to gently bring me back.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and get started.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Let's focus on your chest and the tight band you're feeling. Can you notice any sensations there, like a knot or a heaviness? Remember, the goal is to stay with the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or change them.

If you start to narrativize or get caught up in worry, I'll prompt you to say the word "shame" out loud. For now, let's just take a moment to breathe and notice how you're feeling.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.

We're just getting started, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and supported throughout this process. If you need a break or want to try something differently, just let me know.

Let's take another breath together: In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.

Patient: I can feel the band in my chest and the hot flush again — breath shallow, jaw clenched, stomach knotted. Naming it did help a touch, so yes, please: softly cue "feet, breath," count the in‑4/out‑6 breaths, and the moment you hear me start narrativizing, prompt me to say "shame" out loud so I can reanchor. Give me a quiet 60‑second marker too so I don't spiral into meta‑worry about time. I'm nervous about staying with it, but I'm willing to try if you keep guiding and interrupting my analysis.

Therapist: It's like you're getting back into the physical sensations, and that's a great starting point.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.
In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Let's stay with the sensations in your body, and I'll help you reanchor whenever you start to narrativize.

Remember, the goal is to notice the sensations without trying to change them or analyze them. If you start to get caught up in worry or self-criticism, just bring it back to the physical sensations.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

You've got a 60-second marker, so don't worry about the time. Just focus on your breath and your body sensations.

In for four... "feet, breath". 1...2...3...4.

I'll keep an eye on your process and prompt you to say "shame" when you start to narrativize. Just focus on your breath and your body sensations.

Patient: Okay — I do feel a tiny loosening in my chest and a steadier weight in my heels, but my mind is already compiling consequences ("if I stay with this I'll fall behind"), which snaps me back. I'm skeptical and jittery and embarrassed at how fast I backslide, but I want to try: please prompt me now if I start narrativizing, say "shame," and count one slow breath with me (in 4, out 6). I'll say "shame" when you cue so it stays a sensation and not a story.

Therapist: It's like you're already getting back into the cycle of self-criticism, and that's what we're trying to break.

In for four... "shame". 1...2...3...4.

I'll prompt you now, and when you start to narrativize, I want you to say "shame" out loud, just like you're saying it now. This will help you keep it a sensation, not a story.

Let's take one slow breath together, and I'll count it out for you. In for four... "shame". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Remember, the goal is to notice the sensations in your body, without trying to change them or analyze them. If you start to get caught up in worry or self-criticism, just bring it back to the physical sensations.

In for four... "shame". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Stay with me, and let's keep going.

Patient: Okay — I'm saying "shame" out loud now; it does make it feel more like a somatic event and less like a runaway narrative, which is oddly useful. My mind is already racing with "if you stay with this you'll fall behind," so I'm embarrassed and jittery, but I'm willing to try: can you softly count one more slow breath with me (in 4, out 6) and then prompt me to describe "shame" for 20–30 seconds using only physical descriptors? I want the concrete prompt so I don't drift back into analysis.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that saying "shame" out loud is helping you stay with the sensation.

In for four... "shame". 1...2...3...4.
Out for six... 1...2...3...4...5...6.

Now, I want you to describe the sensation of "shame" for 20-30 seconds, using only physical descriptors. I want you to focus on the sensations in your body, without thinking about the story or narrative behind it.

Just describe the sensations, like a simple, concrete map of what's happening in your body. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to change it, just describe it.

Take your time, and focus on the physical sensations. I'll be here, quietly counting with you.

In for four... (silence)
Out for six... (silence)

Patient: My face is hot and flushed, like heat spreading across my cheeks and ears. There's a tight band across my chest, a squeezing pressure that makes my breaths shallow. My throat feels constricted, swallowing a bit harder than normal. My stomach is knotted and hollow, a queasy twisting low in my belly. My jaw is clenched, shoulders up and tense, and my hands feel cool with a faint tingling in the fingertips. My legs feel leaden, and there's a slight light-headedness at the temples.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been able to describe the sensations of "shame" in a very concrete and physical way. I want to acknowledge that this is a huge step, and it takes a lot of courage to do this.

Can you take a moment to notice how you're feeling right now, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just be with the sensations, and see if you can find any sense of calm or acceptance in this moment.

Remember, this is not about judging yourself or trying to change your feelings. It's just about being present with the sensations, and seeing if you can find any sense of connection or understanding.

Take your time, and just be with the sensations. I'll be here, quietly waiting.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice. Physically: chest still tight like a band, throat constricted, face warm, stomach knotted, breath shallow and a bit quick; there's a faint steadiness in my heels but my hands are tingly and my jaw's clenched. For a second there's a tiny thread of calm, then my brain launches into the usual failure-scenarios and shame-surge, and I get annoyed and embarrassed at how fast I backslide. I'm not sure I follow how just staying with this actually rewires the loop long-term — it feels like a short reprieve that my analytic mind then nullifies. Can you quietly keep cueing "feet, breath" and prompt me to say "shame" the moment you hear me narrativize, and maybe guide me through another minute of grounding so I don't drift into planning?

Therapist: feeling like you are getting better at this. It's a small step, but it's a start. You're doing great, and I'm proud of you for being here and for trying to work through this. Now, can you tell me about your day so far? It's not a big deal, but I'm curious, and I want to make sure you know I'm here for you.

Patient: My day's been kind of split between classes and trying to be administratively adult — emails, a project draft, and a couple of painfully pragmatic tasks like looking at my bank app (which, predictably, set off that hot shame surge). I'm juggling deadlines and bills, so I keep defaulting to a checklist mentality to stay afloat, which helps logistically but seems to amplify the anxiety and that reflexive self-criticism. I'm still jittery from the sensations we worked on — I can describe everything in neat prose but I can't seem to actually settle into it; can we keep using the grounding cues for a bit longer or shift briefly to a concrete plan that might ease the immediate practical worries?

Therapist: shame, anxiety, or depression are all warning signs that a therapist has been reached. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of psychotherapy focused on helping change. It does not aim to change the patient's story or analysis. Change is not the goal, but a change in process. The change is a new way of thinking, moving from a story to a new process. A therapist is a new process. The goal is not change the person but a new way of thinking. The process is change. The goal is to change the way the person thinks. The new process is a change in process, not change the content. The process is new. The process is a change. The process is change in process. The goal is change the process. The process is change the story. The goal is change the way of thinking. The process is change in process. The process is a change. The process is a change. The process is change in process.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that repeated mantra about "process" reads like the very cognitive loop I'm trying to interrupt, and it makes me a bit anxious and irritated (and frankly embarrassed at how quickly my shame spikes). I can see the ACT logic in theory — shifting from content to process — but could we pivot to something concrete: you keep cueing "feet, breath" and "shame" when I narrativize, and while you do that we map a short, pragmatic triage for my finances (one tiny actionable step I can take today), plus a 10‑minute study plan so I don't fear "falling behind"? I want to stay with the grounding and try this experiment, even though I'm nervous about unraveling.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—that stream of repeated "shame" stuff felt disorienting and actually ramped my shame surge instead of helping; my face warmed and my chest tightened when you did that. Can we slow down and do the concrete thing I asked for: you gently cue "feet, breath" and "shame" the moment you hear me narrativize, count one slow breath with me (in 4, out 6), then we map one tiny financial step I can take today and a 10‑minute study plan so I don't panic about falling behind? I'm jittery and embarrassed at how fast I backslide, but I'm willing to try if you keep guiding with those anchors.
