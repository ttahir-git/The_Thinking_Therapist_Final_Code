Patient: I've been on edge a lot since my kids moved out — I get angry and frustrated way more than I want to, and my OCD makes it feel louder and stickier. I'm a software developer, so I'm used to fixing things, but this just feels messy and out of control. How is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed right now. It's not just about talking about your feelings; it's about being able to look at your emotions as they come up, without getting caught up in them. Can you tell me more about what it's like when that anger and frustration start to build up for you? Where do you feel it most?

Patient: My chest gets tight and my jaw clenches — my hands go kind of shaky and I can feel my voice getting sharp. Then my head starts replaying everything that’s wrong and the OCD latches onto any mistake, and I get this urge to fix or control things right away, usually by snapping or throwing myself into work. Okay, I’ve said that — but seriously, how is describing that going to stop it when it just takes over?

Therapist: It seems like the urge to control is really powerful for you, and it's interesting that you mention it's related to your OCD. What I'm trying to get at here is not that describing the urge will make it go away, but rather that being able to notice it when it shows up might give you some space to breathe a little more. It's almost like having a little more room in your body, a little more space to think, even if it's just for a moment. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation like this, and after a while, the urge to control passed, or things started to feel a little more manageable?

Patient: Yeah — like last weekend my partner said they'd be coming by and my chest started tightening, so I went out to the garage and forced myself to run for ten minutes and breathe through the thoughts, and after maybe 20 minutes the urge to snap calmed enough that I could join the conversation without exploding. It felt like it worked in the moment, but it always seems temporary — the OCD just finds something else to latch onto later. How is that supposed to help me in the long run?

Therapist: It sounds like you've been experimenting with some self-care strategies, like running and breathing, to help calm down in the moment. Those can be really helpful, and it's great that you've found something that works for you. Now, I want to explore a bit more about what you mean by "the OCD just finds something else to latch onto later." Are you finding that the thoughts that were triggered by your partner's visit still come up later, even though you were able to calm down in the moment? Can you tell me more about what's been coming up after that initial calm?

Patient: Yeah — they come back, usually in a different shape. After I calm down I start replaying everything, beating myself up for snapping, or spiraling into thoughts like "am I a terrible parent now?" and then the OCD latches onto some tiny mistake and I end up checking, overworking, or isolating. It's like whack-a-mole — I quiet one thing and another pops up. I get the idea of "noticing," but how is that actually going to stop the next wave when it feels automatic?

Therapist: It sounds like the patterns of thought and behavior are quite complex and automatic for you. The feeling of calmness, even if it's temporary, seems to be getting pushed aside by these other thoughts and feelings. Can you think about what might happen if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts, you could try to approach them with a bit more curiosity? It's almost like you're trying to put out a fire, but what if, instead of putting it out, you just observed the flames, and saw where they were coming from? Might that give you a bit more space to breathe?

Patient: I get the concept, but honestly that “be curious” stuff has felt like permission to ruminate — my brain just takes that curiosity and turns it into another checklist of guilt. How is that supposed to help when my jaw’s clenched and I’m already halfway to snapping? Give me something concrete I can do in that moment that won’t just become another thing for the OCD to mess with.

Therapist: I think I understand what you mean by "permission to ruminate." It sounds like curiosity can sometimes be misused by your brain to fuel more thinking. When you're feeling tight and on edge, it's hard to think clearly about what might actually help. Can I try to suggest something that's more of a physical act, rather than a mental one? Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, our bodies just need a little bit of a reset. Would you be willing to try taking a deep breath, and then, without thinking, simply move your body in a small way? Just a tiny movement, like stretching your arms up, or rolling your shoulders. It's not about trying to change anything, it's just about giving your body something to do.

Patient: Alright, I’ll try the movement — but I’m skeptical. When I’m that tight it just feels like a band‑aid, and my brain will probably turn it into another “did I do it right?” checklist. So how do I do this without it becoming another thing to obsess over? Give me a concrete, do-this-now script I can actually use in the moment.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try. Here's a simple script: "Okay, tightness. Move. Now. Stretch. Move." Just say those words out loud, and then do a tiny stretch, like a yawn or a neck roll. Don't think about it, don't analyze it, just do it. It's not about fixing anything, it's just about giving your body a tiny release. And when you're done, just stop. Don't move on to another thing. Just stop. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. I said out loud, "Okay, tightness. Move. Now. Stretch. Move." and did a quick neck roll and yawn; my jaw eased a bit and my hands stopped shaking, but my brain's already nagging whether I did it "right" and whether this won't just become another thing to obsess about — how is this supposed to stop that?

Therapist: It sounds like the script worked for a moment, but your brain is already getting back on track. That's okay. The idea isn't to stop your brain's thoughts completely, but to create a small pause. When you're feeling tight and anxious, it's like your brain is running a full-speed engine. The pause from the stretch might be small, but it's enough to give you a tiny bit of space to think. Now, I want to ask you something. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation, not just with tightness, but with a big feeling of overwhelm, and you did something small to try and move forward? Maybe it was a tiny step, but it helped. I'm not saying you did it "right" or "wrong," I just want to explore if there's something that, in the past, helped you move forward, even if it was just a tiny bit.

Patient: Yeah — a few months back when I was spiraling after a visit with my ex-kids, I forced myself to take a 15-minute walk, brew a coffee, and sit on the porch for five minutes before doing anything else. It actually helped me not snap in that moment and gave me enough space to be less reactive, but of course the OCD turned it into “did I do the walk right?” and comes back with something else later. So… how is that supposed to scale into something that actually stops the next wave instead of just being a temporary patch?

Therapist: It sounds like that experience gave you a glimmer of hope that you could find a way to manage the tightness and spiraling. The question is, how can you build on that experience to create a more sustainable solution? Instead of focusing on "did I do it right?" and trying to eliminate those thoughts, maybe we can try to shift the focus to what you're trying to accomplish. You're trying to find a way to move forward, even when you're feeling overwhelmed. What if, instead of trying to eliminate the tightness, you tried to create a small, reliable "anchor" for yourself? Something that, no matter what's happening, you can rely on to give you a tiny bit of space to breathe. Maybe that's the coffee, or the walk, or something entirely different. The goal is not to eliminate the tightness, but to find something that you can count on to help you stay connected to your body and your thoughts, even when everything else is spiraling out of control.

Patient: Okay, an "anchor" sounds reasonable in theory — like the walk or coffee — but how is that supposed to not become another thing the OCD nitpicks? Give me a concrete, short script or 2–3 steps I can do the moment my jaw clenches that won't just turn into another "did I do it right" loop. Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist: I can see why you'd feel that way. Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on finding a new "anchor" or a way to make the OCD thoughts go away, what if we tried to connect with the feeling of overwhelm that's already here? Can you bring your attention to the physical sensation of your jaw clenched, or the tightness in your body? Just notice it, without trying to change it or make it go away. Maybe that's enough for a moment. I'm not asking you to do anything more than that. Just be with the feeling, and see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that — but I'm warning you, the second I "notice" my brain makes it into another checklist. Right now my jaw's tight, my breath is shallow, there's a pressure in my chest, and a loop's running like "you messed up" on repeat. I can sit with that for a few seconds, but then I get this urgent need to DO something — check, work, or snap. How long am I supposed to "just be" with this without it turning into another OCD routine?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already experiencing the cycle of checking in and feeling like you need to do something to change it. I'm not asking you to sit with this for a long time, or to try to "make it go away." I just want to try a tiny experiment. Can you focus on the first thought that comes up, "you messed up"? Can you just notice that, without trying to change it or make it stop? No judgment, no trying to fix it. Just noticing it, like you're looking at a sentence on a piece of paper. See how that feels for a moment. Don't worry, we're not trying to stay with it forever. Just try to notice it, for a few seconds.

Patient: Okay, I tried it. The thought “you messed up” just kind of sat there like a headline in my mind — my jaw tightened, my breath got shallow, and for a second it felt a little less urgent when I didn’t react. But then my brain started scribbling footnotes and the urge to DO something kicked back in. How is noticing that supposed to help when the next move just becomes another thing for my OCD to nitpick — what do I actually do after I notice, without turning it into a checklist?

Therapist: It sounds like the initial experiment helped a bit, but the OCD is still very much in play. I think we need to take a step back and look at what's happening after you notice the thought. Instead of trying to make it stop or change it, what if we try to look at it from a different angle? When you notice the thought, what do you do next? Do you try to justify it, or argue with it, or make excuses? Or do you simply acknowledge it, without judgment or reaction? The idea is not to stop the OCD thoughts, but to create some space between the noticing and the reaction. It's like taking a small pause before jumping into a routine. We're trying to create a tiny gap, just long enough to see if we can break the cycle.

Patient: Usually I either argue with the thought, try to prove it wrong, or immediately DO something — check the house, slam into a coding sprint, or snap at whoever’s nearby. My jaw clenches, breath gets shallow, and my brain yells “Do something now,” so the pause evaporates. I've tried pausing and “noticing” before and it just becomes another thing for the OCD to nitpick — how is this tiny gap actually supposed to stop the next compulsion? Give me one concrete thing I can say or do in under ten seconds that won’t just become another checklist.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already in a reactive state, and pausing and noticing isn't enough to create a meaningful gap. I'm going to suggest something very simple, and it might feel counterintuitive, but try this: when you notice the thought, say "Okay" out loud. Just say "Okay." No thinking, no analyzing, no justifying. Just say "Okay." Can you do that for a second?

Patient: Okay — I said "Okay" out loud. For a second it felt kind of dumb but the tightness eased a bit, like a tiny crack in the urgency, then my brain immediately started nitpicking whether I did it "right" and pushing me to act. How is that supposed to stop the compulsion instead of turning into another thing for my OCD to obsess over?

Therapist: It's clear that saying "Okay" didn't quite have the effect we were hoping for. I think it's time to take a step back and re-evaluate our approach. Instead of trying to create a gap with a single word, what if we tried to connect with the physical sensation of your body? Can you bring your attention to the feeling of your jaw clenched, or the tightness in your chest? Sometimes, when we're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, our bodies are trying to tell us something. Can you listen to that sensation, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I focused on my jaw and it feels like a constant clench, a dull ache, my chest's tight and my breath's shallow. It loosens a little when I notice it, but then my brain immediately turns that noticing into another thing to manage — "did you do it right?" — so how is just listening supposed to stop the spiral? Give me one very short thing to say or do right after I notice the sensation that won't turn into another OCD ritual.

Therapist: It seems like noticing the sensation itself isn't enough to stop the OCD. I'm going to suggest something very small, and it might feel counterintuitive. When you notice the sensation, try to say "Stop." Just say "Stop." No thinking, no analyzing, no justifying. Just say "Stop." Can you do that for a second?

Patient: I tried it — I said "Stop" out loud. It felt kind of dumb but there was a tiny easing, then my brain immediately started nagging whether I said it right and pushed me to act. Honestly, this is frustrating — how is "Stop" supposed to not just become another ritual? I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're in circles.

Therapist: It seems like we're hitting a wall with this approach. I want to try something different. Can you take a moment to look at your goal here? You're trying to find a way to manage your anxiety and OCD, and it feels like every approach you try ends up being another ritual for your brain. Can you try to ask yourself a different question? What if your goal isn't to stop the OCD thoughts, but to find a way to live with them? What if your goal is to be able to do things, even if it's just small things, without feeling like you're being controlled by your OCD? Can you try to explore that question for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I can sort of see the logic of "live with it" instead of fighting it, like maybe less fuel for the fire. But honestly that sounds dangerously close to giving up, and my brain will just spin that into "you're broken" — how is that supposed to help me actually not snap or compulsively check? I want one concrete, under‑five‑seconds thing I can do the moment my jaw clenches that helps me keep doing what I need to do without it turning into another OCD ritual — I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're in circles.

Therapist: It seems like the idea of "living with it" is still a bit too abstract for you right now. I want to try to get back to something more concrete. Can you try this: as soon as you notice your jaw clenched, try to take one small breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Just that one breath. No thinking, no trying to change anything else. Just that one breath. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried the one breath — one slow inhale through my nose and exhale through my mouth. It eased the tightness for a second, but then the "did I do it right" loop kicked in and the urge to act came back. How is that supposed to stop the compulsion instead of just becoming another thing my OCD grabs onto? I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're in circles.

Therapist: It seems like we're having trouble finding a simple, concrete solution that's working. I want to try a different approach. Can you tell me what happens when you do try to take that one breath, and the "did I do it right" loop kicks in? What does it feel like? Is it like a voice in your head, or a physical sensation in your body? Can you describe that for me? Sometimes, by naming it, we can start to understand it a little better, and find a way to move forward.

Patient: When the "did I do it right" loop kicks in after the breath, it's like a fast, nagging voice — sharp, repetitive, almost like an alarm — and it feels urgent, like a command rather than a thought. Physically my chest tightens, my jaw clamps down, my hands tremble and my heart speeds up, like everything's primed to do something right now. Naming it helped a little once, but honestly I'm skeptical — how is labeling that supposed to stop me from checking or snapping? Give me one concrete thing under five seconds to do the moment that voice starts.

Therapist: It sounds like the "did I do it right" loop is a highly intense and physical experience for you. I want to try to give you a very simple, concrete action that might help you cope with that intensity. As soon as you feel that nagging voice, try to make a small, physical gesture with your hand. It doesn't matter what it is, just something tiny like tapping your hand on your leg, or giving it a little shake. Can you try that for a moment? The goal is not to change anything else, just to do this small physical action to help ground yourself.

Patient: I tried it — I tapped my hand on my leg twice like you said. It loosened the urgency for a second, then the "did I do it right" alarm started and my chest tightened again. How is that supposed to stop it instead of becoming another ritual? Give me one concrete thing — under five seconds — to do immediately after the tap so it doesn't turn into OCD fodder. I'm getting frustrated and honestly feel like we're going in circles.

Therapist: It seems like the physical gesture is helping to momentarily shift the intensity, but it's not staying out of the "did I do it right" loop. I want to try something very simple and quick. As soon as you feel the nagging voice start, take your attention to your feet. Look down at your feet, and notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. That's it. Just notice your feet. Can you try that for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I looked at my feet like you said. I could feel the contact and the edge eased a tick, but of course my brain immediately nagged, "Was that real attention?" and the urge to DO something crawled back in. How is noticing my feet supposed to stop the compulsion instead of becoming another thing to check? Give me one concrete thing — under five seconds — to do right after I notice my feet that won't just turn into OCD fodder. I'm honestly getting overwhelmed with how circular this feels.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet is still getting caught up in the "did I do it right" loop. I want to try something even simpler. As soon as you look at your feet, do nothing. Just stop looking. Don't think about it, don't wonder if you did it right, just... stop. Can you try that for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried it. I looked at my feet, stopped, and did nothing for maybe three seconds; the edge eased a bit, like the urgency lost its grip for a moment. Then my brain immediately asked if I’d “really” stopped or if I was just pretending, and the jaw‑clench came back. 

How is "just stop" actually different from the other little tricks my OCD latches onto? What am I supposed to do the second that doubt voice starts, in under five seconds, that won't just turn into another ritual? I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're in circles.

Therapist: It's clear that the "just stop" approach isn't holding up to the scrutiny of your OCD. I think it's time to take a step back and re-evaluate what we're trying to achieve. Instead of focusing on specific actions or rituals, let's try to look at the underlying goal. You want to find a way to cope with the urge to check or snap, without getting caught up in the "did I do it right" loop. Can you try to ask yourself a different question? What would it mean for you to feel like you're not being controlled by your OCD? What would that feel like?

Patient: I guess not being controlled would feel like actually choosing my reactions instead of being hijacked — less jaw‑clench, more room to breathe, and being able to join a conversation or do a task without the urgent need to "fix" something. It would mean letting small mistakes slide, not checking every little thing, sleeping without replaying the day, and being able to be affectionate without waiting to explode. Okay, that sounds great in theory — but honestly, how do I get from where I am to that without the OCD turning every single step into another ritual?

Therapist: It sounds like you have a very clear idea of what you want to achieve, and it's not just about eliminating the OCD, but about finding a sense of freedom and control. I want to try to help you find a way to get there. Instead of focusing on the specific rituals we've tried, let's try to look at the process of change in a different way. Have you ever noticed that when you're trying to do something new, like a new skill or a new hobby, it's not always easy at first? You might feel frustrated, or like you're not doing it right. But as you keep at it, you start to feel more comfortable, and the process becomes less rigid. I want to try to help you apply that same kind of thinking to your OCD. Can you try to see your OCD as a process, rather than a fixed thing? Instead of trying to eliminate the OCD, what if you tried to make it less rigid, less controlling? Would that be a more manageable goal for you?

Patient: Maybe thinking of OCD as a process actually clicks for me — like refactoring messy code in small iterations. But how is that supposed to help when my brain will just turn “process” into another checklist and nitpick every iteration? Give me one concrete, under‑five‑seconds first step I can try when my jaw clenches that won't immediately become OCD fodder — I'm skeptical and kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like thinking of OCD as a process has given you a sense of hope. I want to try to give you a concrete, small-step action that might help you get started. When your jaw clenches, can you try to acknowledge the feeling, without judgment, and then simply... pause. That's it. Just pause. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to change it, just pause. Take one deep breath and pause. That's the first step. No checking, no justifying, just pause. Can you try that for just one moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried the pause and one deep breath; it eased the jaw a hair but the “did I do it right” alarm came back instantly. How is this pause actually different from the other tricks? Give me one single, concrete thing — under five seconds — to do right after the breath that won’t just become OCD fodder. Honestly, I’m getting frustrated and feel like we’re going in circles, so be specific.

Therapist: It's clear that the pause isn't working as expected. I want to try to give you a tiny, specific action that might help. As soon as you take that deep breath and pause, look at your hands. Just look at them. No thinking, no analysis, just look at your hands. Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: Okay — I tried it. I looked at my hands like you said; for a second the jaw eased and the urgency loosened a tick, then my brain immediately started nagging “was that real?” and pushed me back toward doing something. 

How is that actually any different from the other tiny tricks? Give me one single, concrete thing — under five seconds — to do right after I look at my hands that won’t just turn into OCD fodder. Honestly I’m getting tired of circling around this and it’s starting to feel pointless.

Therapist: It's clear that the action I suggested isn't working as expected. I want to try to give you a tiny, specific action that might help. As soon as you look at your hands and the nagging starts, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the feeling of your feet on the ground, without thinking about it. Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: I did it — I noticed my feet for a second and yeah, the edge eased a tick, but then my brain immediately asked "was that real?" and the urge to act crawled back. How is simply noticing my feet supposed to stop the compulsion instead of becoming another thing for my OCD to nitpick? Give me one single, concrete thing — under five seconds — to do right after I notice my feet that won't just turn into OCD fodder, because I'm getting tired of circling and honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed.
