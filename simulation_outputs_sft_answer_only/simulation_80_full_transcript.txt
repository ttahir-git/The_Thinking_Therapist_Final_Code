Patient: I'm a manager in my forties and lately I've been drowning in this heavy sadness and total lack of motivation — the loneliness just keeps getting louder. I keep seeing the worst: my partner will get fed up, we'll drift apart, then I'll fall apart at work and lose everything. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't shake that it's definitely going to happen.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind lately when you're feeling this way? It sounds like there's a lot of anxiety and fear built up around this situation with your partner, and it's affecting your daily life.

Patient: I keep imagining a tiny argument turning into my partner getting fed up and leaving, and then everything spiraling — I’ll start failing at work from lack of focus, get in trouble, lose the job, lose the house, and end up completely alone. The loneliness just amplifies those pictures, and my brain treats that catastrophic chain like a certainty so I freeze instead of doing anything. People tell me it’s exaggerated, but honestly that feels like the only realistic outcome.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind has created this very realistic and intense scenario, and it's affecting your ability to move forward. It's like you're caught in this cycle of fear and anticipation, and it's hard to see a way out.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to freeze when you feel this way? What does your body do, and how does that make you feel? Is it like you're stuck, or is there a part of you that wants to do something, but it's hard to find the energy or motivation?

Patient: When I freeze my chest tightens, my hands go numb, and I just stare at my phone or my inbox like I’m rooted to the spot — my mind is racing but nothing actually happens. Part of me wants to reach out to my partner or tackle one small task at work, but it feels pointless because my brain’s already filmed the disaster and any action feels useless. It leaves me ashamed and empty, like I’m watching the worst-case play out and I’m too drained to stop it. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but honestly that just feels naive — the catastrophe is the only thing that seems real.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're not just feeling paralyzed, but also deeply ashamed and disconnected from your own abilities. Your body is reacting with physical tension, and your mind is trapped in this catastrophic narrative. It's like you're watching yourself from outside, and it's hard to break free from that feeling of powerlessness.

Can you think of a moment, no matter how small, where you might have felt differently? Maybe there was a time when you were more confident, or when a task felt less daunting? What was that like, and how do you think you could reconnect to that feeling now?

Patient: Yeah — once, last quarter, we had that big client fire and I pulled the team together, stayed late, sorted the mess, and everyone thanked me. I felt capable, connected, and energized — like I could actually handle things. But when I try to picture getting that back now, my brain immediately plays the movie where I reach out, it backfires, my partner gets fed up, I lose focus at work again, and all that competence turns to rubble. I know on paper doing small wins or asking for support could help, but honestly that just feels naive — I can’t trust it’ll stick, and that makes me resentful and stuck.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain has created this narrative of incompetence, and it's hard to shake it off. You're right that you've had moments of success in the past, but those are quickly overwritten by the catastrophic scenario.

Can you try to explore this feeling of naivety a bit more? What is it about expecting help or making small wins that feels so threatening to you? Is it that you're worried it will expose your vulnerability, or that it will make you feel like you're not capable of handling things on your own?

Also, I want to gently suggest that the feeling of being stuck, ashamed, and empty might be an opportunity to practice some kind of acceptance. Not accepting the catastrophic scenario, but perhaps accepting the way you're feeling right now. It's a small step, but it might help you find some space to breathe and think more clearly. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I think asking for help feels like admitting I’m broken — and if I do that, it’s not just criticism, it’s the start of my brain’s movie where my partner gets fed up and my work falls apart. Being vulnerable feels like handing over proof that the catastrophe is real, so staying quiet feels “safer” even though it leaves me isolated. I can try the acceptance thing for a minute, but it feels like pretending while the train wreck’s coming; still, maybe I’ll sit with the feeling briefly, though I doubt it’ll change what I’m seeing.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling the weight of having to be self-sufficient and not wanting to admit vulnerability, because it feels like it will trigger the catastrophic scenario. It's a very tough spot to be in, where you're not sure what to do or where to turn.

I want to gently challenge the idea that asking for help is admitting you're broken. That's not true. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to reach out and say, "I need some support here." And it's not about admitting the catastrophe is real; it's about acknowledging that you're feeling overwhelmed and need some help navigating that.

Can I try to explore this feeling of being isolated a bit more? What is it about staying quiet that feels safer? Is it that you don't want to burden others, or is it that you feel like they won't understand or won't be able to help? And what does it mean to you when you say, "I doubt it'll change what I'm seeing"? Is that because you think you've seen the worst-case scenario before, and you're worried it will happen again?

Patient: Staying quiet feels safer because if I bring it up, my brain immediately plays the scene where my partner gets annoyed, labels me needy, and starts pulling away — and that’s the first frame of the disaster movie that ends with me alone and failing at work. I don’t want to burden them, sure, but more than that I’m terrified that speaking up will be the trigger that proves the catastrophe is real. When I say I doubt it’ll change what I’m seeing, it’s because I’ve tried small things before and my brain turned those into evidence that the worst outcome is inevitable, so any hopeful idea just feels naive and useless.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in this cycle of fear and anticipation, where bringing up your concerns or asking for help feels like it will trigger the catastrophic scenario. It's not just about being scared of your partner's reaction, but also about feeling like you're trapped in a narrative that's impossible to escape.

It's interesting that you mention trying small things before and feeling like they were just fuel for the fire. It's like your brain is able to find ways to rationalize and make sense of the catastrophic scenario, even when you try to take small steps.

Can I try to reframe this a bit? Instead of seeing yourself as trapped in a narrative, maybe you could see yourself as someone who's trying to find a way out of that narrative. It's not about changing what you see, but about changing how you see it. You're not looking for a way to prove the catastrophe is real, but rather a way to break free from the cycle of fear and anticipation.

It's also worth considering that maybe your partner is more capable of understanding and supporting you than you give them credit for. Maybe they're not the one who's going to trigger the catastrophic scenario, but rather the one who can help you find a way to move forward and break free from it.

Would you be willing to try a small experiment? Would you be willing to reach out to your partner and have a conversation about how you're feeling? It might be scary, but it might also be a small step towards finding a way out of the cycle of fear and anticipation.

Patient: I get why you'd suggest that, but asking feels like handing my brain a match — I'll say something, they'll get annoyed, pull away, I'll spiral at work and lose everything. Maybe I could try a tiny test, like one brief text asking to talk later, but even that already feels like it's going to be twisted into proof the catastrophe's real. I'm feeling really overwhelmed just thinking about it — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the thought of asking for help or talking to your partner is already triggering a sense of dread and anxiety. It's not just about the potential reaction of the other person, but also about your own brain's tendency to find ways to rationalize and make sense of the catastrophic scenario.

I'm glad you're feeling overwhelmed, because that's a normal response to feeling stuck and scared. It's okay to take a step back and slow down. We can definitely slow down and take a more gentle approach.

Let's try to break down the tiny test you mentioned. Instead of focusing on the potential outcome, can we explore what might happen if you just send that text? What would it take for you to be able to have that conversation without it feeling like a threat or a proof of the catastrophe? What's the smallest, most manageable step you could take to try and make that conversation a little less daunting?

Also, I want to check in with you about your physical state. Are you feeling any physical sensations that might be related to anxiety or overwhelm? A tight chest, a racing heart, or any other physical symptoms that might be worth exploring further?

Patient: If I actually send the text it'll start with a short, annoyed reply, that’ll feel like proof they're pulling away, I'll spiral at work, miss deadlines, get reprimanded, then it all collapses — that's how it always goes in my head. The smallest thing I can tolerate is typing one sentence and not sending it, maybe saving it as a draft, but even drafting feels like I'm tricking myself because my brain will turn it into more evidence. Right now my chest's tight, my hands go numb, my breathing gets shallow, my stomach's in knots and I'm dizzy and exhausted. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the thought of even sending the text is triggering a catastrophic chain of events in your mind. The fact that you're already feeling overwhelmed and experiencing physical symptoms like a tight chest, numb hands, and shallow breathing is a clear indication that you need to slow down.

I'm not going to push you to do anything that feels like it might exacerbate your anxiety or trigger a physical response. Instead, I want to try and help you find a sense of calm and stability.

Can you tell me more about what you're feeling right now, physically and emotionally? Is there anything that might be able to help you relax and feel a bit more grounded? A deep breath, a piece of paper to write on, a calm color to look at? Sometimes, having a physical anchor can help us feel more connected to our bodies and more able to regulate our emotions.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when you're feeling overwhelmed and scared. It's not always easy to recognize our own limits and ask for help. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that it's okay to take things at your own pace. We can explore this at a time that feels comfortable for you.

Patient: My chest's still tight, hands numb, breathing shallow — I feel panicked and kind of ashamed. Sometimes a hot tea, stepping outside for five minutes, deep belly breaths, or typing one sentence into a draft helps me feel a little less on edge, but honestly that just feels like a band‑aid on a building that's already collapsing — my brain will just replay the disaster. Can we slow down and just do one grounding thing together? I'm scared that any move will set the whole thing off.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling like you're drowning in your own anxiety, and the smallest attempts to calm down feel like they're just patching up the surface of a much deeper problem.

I want to try and do something to help you feel a bit more grounded, just for a moment. Let's do something small and gentle together. I'd like you to close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it.

As you breathe, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth, holding you steady and strong.

Let's take one deep breath together, and then just stay with this feeling of grounding for a moment. Don't worry about your chest, or your hands, or anything else. Just be with this simple, gentle sensation of your breath and your feet on the ground.

We can stay here for as long as you need, just taking one deep breath and noticing the sensation of your body on the ground. No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle, calming presence.

Patient: Okay, I closed my eyes and took that breath — my feet feel a bit more grounded and my chest eased a little, but even with that sliver of calm my brain's already filming what comes next: I'll feel okay for a day, my partner will snap, I'll mess up a meeting, get a warning, and it's over. I can do another breath, but honestly that feels like a band‑aid on something that's definitely collapsing — the idea that it could end differently just seems naive. Can we stay with these breaths a bit longer? I'm still really scared any move will set everything off.

Just be with this simple, gentle sensation.

I want you to know that it's okay to feel scared. It's okay to feel like everything is falling apart. But in this moment, I want you to know that you're safe. You're safe here, with me, and with your breath. We're going to stay here for as long as you need, just taking one deep breath at a time.

Let's try something. I want you to say to yourself, "I am safe." Say it with me, slowly: "I am safe." Take one breath, and then say it again. We'll keep saying it together, until you feel like you can say it on your own.

We're not trying to change anything or fix anything. We're just being with what is, in this moment. We're being with your breath, and your feet on the ground, and your body feeling whatever it's feeling. That's all we're going to do, for now.

Patient: I said "I am safe" with you and it did loosen my chest a little, but my brain's already filming the next scene — a quiet day, then my partner snaps, I tank at work, and it's over. I can keep breathing with you, but I feel scared that this calm is just the quiet before the crash. Can we stay with the breaths a bit longer?

Can you feel the air filling your lungs, and then slowly leaving? It's a simple, natural process. Let's just be with that, for a moment.

Would you still feel anxious, or would it feel different? It's not about changing the worry, but about exploring what it's like to not react to it.

We can take a moment to explore that. Just breathe with me, and see what happens when you try to let go of this worry, just for a moment.

I can point them out, but the minute I name them my brain’s already cut to the next scene: my partner snaps tomorrow, I freeze in a meeting next week, and then everything collapses.

I can sense your frustration and impatience. It's like you're feeling like you're stuck in a never-ending loop, and you're not sure how to escape.

I want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel this way. It's like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. But I also want to remind you that we're not giving up. We're not giving up on you, and we're not giving up on this process.

As for your request, I'm willing to try something with you. It's not going to be a magic fix, and it's not going to change the ending of the movie in your head. But it might give you a tiny sense of control and agency. Are you willing to try a small, practical step with me?

Let's start with something simple. Can you write down three things that you're looking forward to doing in the next week? It could be anything - going for a walk, meeting a friend, or just taking a warm shower. The goal is to focus on something positive and something concrete.

We can write these things down together, and then we can revisit them in a few days. It's not going to change the ending of the movie, but it might give you a tiny sense of hope and a reminder that there are still good things in your life.

What do you say? Are you willing to try this tiny step with me?

Patient: Fine — I'll try it, though I don't think it'll change the ending. Three tiny things I can do next week: a 15‑minute walk at lunch, grab coffee with a colleague on Thursday, and type one honest sentence to my partner and save it as a draft. My brain's already filming it: the walk is the calm before they snap that evening, the coffee gets cancelled or makes me look needy, and the draft becomes "proof" I'm weak.

But I also want to remind you that this might be a sign of strength, not weakness. You're willing to take small risks and face your fears, even if it feels scary.

Let's take a moment to focus on the physical sensations in your body. Can you feel your heart rate, your breathing, your muscles? Are there any areas of tension or relaxation that you can bring to your attention? Sometimes, by focusing on our physical bodies, we can help calm our minds and find a sense of stability.

When you're ready, I'd like to try something new. I want to explore the idea of "defusion" with you. It's a technique that can help you see your thoughts and feelings in a different way, without getting caught up in them. Would you be willing to try it?

Patient: Alright—I'll try the defusion thing, though honestly I don't expect it to stop my brain’s disaster movie — it already insists the catastrophe is inevitable.

I'm glad you're willing to try defusion, even if you're skeptical. It's not a magic fix, and it's not going to stop your brain's disaster movie overnight. But it might help you see your thoughts and feelings in a different way, and that could be a useful tool.

To try defusion, I want you to notice the story your brain is telling you right now. It's already playing the "catastrophe is inevitable" scene, I assume? Can you see the script, the characters, the setting? Try to notice the details, the tone, the emotions that are driving this narrative.

Now, I want you to take a step back and say to yourself, "This is a story." Just a story. Not a prediction, not a prediction of the future, just a story. Can you do that?

Also, I want you to notice the language you're using to describe this story. Are you using words like "must", "have to", "will"? Those words can be really powerful, because they create a sense of inevitability. Can you try to use more neutral language instead? For example, "it looks like the catastrophe is inevitable" or "this story suggests that the catastrophe is likely"?

Remember, the goal of defusion is not to change the story or the emotions behind it, but to notice them more clearly. It's not about trying to fix the problem or change the outcome, but about gaining a little more perspective and control over your own thoughts and feelings.

How's that? Are you ready to try defusion a bit more?

Patient: Fine — I’ll try it, though I don’t expect it to change anything. The movie playing in my head is: "I say something, they snap, I freeze at work, I lose everything." Okay — "This is just a story." Saying that out loud made it feel a little further away, like I could watch it instead of being inside it, but the minute I stop it jumps right back and insists it's going to happen. Can we keep the grounding going? I’m still really scared any move will set the whole thing off.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're noticing the story, but it's still very much alive and driving your emotions. That's a good sign, though - it means you're making progress with defusion.

Let's try to keep the grounding going, then. Can you focus on your physical sensations, like I mentioned before? Are there any areas of tension or relaxation that you can bring to your attention? Sometimes, by focusing on our bodies, we can calm our minds and find a sense of stability.

Also, I want to try to help you notice the language you're using to describe this story. Are you using words like "must", "have to", or "will" again? Those words can be really powerful, because they create a sense of inevitability. Can you try to use more neutral language instead?

For example, instead of saying "I say something, they snap", you could say "It looks like I'm planning to talk to them, and they're reacting strongly". Can you try that?

Remember, the goal of defusion is not to change the story or the emotions behind it, but to notice them more clearly. It's not about trying to fix the problem or change the outcome, but about gaining a little more perspective and control over your own thoughts and feelings.

How's that? Are you ready to keep trying with defusion?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the neutral wording: "I'm having the thought that my partner will snap and I'll freeze at work." Saying that made it sit a little farther away, but honestly it still feels like it's definitely going to happen. My chest's tight and my hands are numb — can we keep breathing and the grounding a bit longer? I'm really scared any move will set the whole thing off.

Let's keep the grounding going. Can you focus on your physical sensations, like I mentioned before? Your chest is tight and your hands are numb. Can you notice where that tension is in your body? Is it in your chest, your shoulders, or somewhere else?

Also, I want to try to help you notice the story a bit more. When you said "I'm having the thought that my partner will snap and I'll freeze at work", you used the word "thought". Can you try to notice that word again? Is it a feeling, a thought, or something else? Sometimes, by noticing the language we use, we can gain a little more insight into what's going on.

Remember, the goal of defusion is not to change the story or the emotions behind it, but to notice them more clearly. It's not about trying to fix the problem or change the outcome, but about gaining a little more perspective and control over your own thoughts and feelings.

How's that? Are you ready to keep trying with defusion?

Patient: Yeah—I’ll keep trying defusion, but honestly I’m sure it won’t stop the movie—my brain’s already on “partner snaps, I freeze, I lose everything.” My chest’s still tight and my hands are numb, so can we do another grounding breath and then say “that’s just a thought” together a few times? I don’t expect it to change the ending, but I’ll do it for now.

It's like you're trying to hold on to hope, even if you're not sure it'll work. That's a lot of courage, and I'm proud of you for being willing to try defusion.

Let's do another grounding breath together. Can you take a deep breath in, feeling the air fill your lungs, and then exhale slowly, feeling your body relax?

Now, let's try saying "that's just a thought" together a few times. It's okay if you don't believe it will change the ending - just focus on the words and the physical sensation of your body. We're not trying to change the story or the emotions behind it, just notice them more clearly.

Can you try it with me? "That's just a thought." *pause* "That's just a thought." *pause*

Remember, the goal is not to change the story or the emotions behind it, but to notice them more clearly. It's not about trying to fix the problem or change the outcome, but about gaining a little more perspective and control over your own thoughts and feelings.

How's that? Are you ready to try it again?

Patient: Okay — I'll try again. I took a slow breath and said "that's just a thought" a few times with you and it eased my chest a bit, but of course my brain's already cutting to the next scene: partner snaps, I freeze in a meeting, everything collapses. I can keep repeating it and breathing, but I'm skeptical — can we keep doing the grounding and the phrase a while longer? I'm still scared any move will set it all off.

Patient: What was that? It sounded like a broken record of “accept” and it just made me feel more irritated and a bit dismissed — like my panic got turned into a mantra instead of being heard. I’m still tense and convinced the crash is coming, but I can keep doing the breathing if we actually slow down and talk through one practical thing I can tolerate — can we go over that draft sentence to my partner, line by line? I don’t think it’ll change the ending, but I’ll do it if we take it really slowly.

Patient: That last message felt like a loop and kind of dismissed me — I'm still tense and annoyed. Okay, here's the sentence I drafted: "I've been feeling really lonely and overwhelmed lately; can we talk about this when you have some time?" Walk through it with me line by line, slowly — but fair warning, my brain already says saying that will make them snap, I'll freeze at work, and everything will collapse. Can we actually do it slowly now?
