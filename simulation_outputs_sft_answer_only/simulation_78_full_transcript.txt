Patient: Honestly, I've been wrestling with this anxiety around people — even small get-togethers with friends make my chest tighten, so I usually avoid them. Since the house got quiet after the kids left, it feels worse; I guess I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing or be judged. I don't know, talking about it makes me uncomfortable.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens in those moments when you're at a gathering, and your chest starts to tighten? What are some of the thoughts that run through your head, and how do they affect your body?

Patient: I don't know — when I'm at one of those gatherings my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and my mouth goes dry. I guess my head fills with stuff like "they'll think I'm awkward" or "I'll say the wrong thing," and then my mind goes blank so I just watch everyone instead of joining in. My stomach flips and I want to leave; it's... hard to talk about, so I'm sorry if I'm vague.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like those social interactions can be really overwhelming for you. The physical sensations you're describing - the tightness in your chest, trembling hands, and dry mouth - they're all classic signs of a strong anxiety response. And it's not just the physical symptoms that are hard to talk about; the thoughts and worries that come with them can be really distressing.

Can you think of a time when you were in a situation like this, but it wasn't a social gathering? Maybe it was a different kind of anxiety-provoking event, like a job interview or a test? How did you handle it then?

Patient: I guess once I had to talk about my work at a small gallery showing — my voice trembled, my hands shook, and I kept staring at a crack in the frame to stop myself from noticing people. I rehearsed the whole thing a hundred times which helped a little, but I still rushed through and left early; I don't know, it felt humiliating. Honestly, can we... maybe talk about the piece itself instead? I find it easier to focus on the art than the feeling.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Rehearsing the conversation beforehand can be a helpful coping mechanism, but it sounds like it still wasn't enough to fully ease your anxiety in that situation. It's understandable that you'd prefer to focus on the art itself, especially since it's something you're familiar with and have control over.

Can you tell me more about what it is about the art that you find interesting? Is there a particular piece or artist that draws you in, or is it more the process of creating the art that fascinates you? Sometimes, talking about something we're passionate about can help shift our focus away from our anxiety.

Patient: I guess it's the process more than any one artist — the way pigments mix, the textures you can coax out with a knife, and how light falls across a canvas. I like small, detailed things; getting lost in the tiny decisions makes everything else quiet for a while. It feels like the one place I can control something when the rest of life feels messy, and I don't know, it's just easier to talk about than... other stuff.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's almost as if the creative process and the art itself are a refuge for you, a place where you can momentarily escape the anxiety and uncertainty that's present in other areas of your life. The tactile nature of working with art, the sense of control it gives you over the materials and the process, can be very soothing.

It's also interesting that you mention it's easier to talk about art than other things. Sometimes, people use creative pursuits as a way to process and deal with their emotions, without even realizing it. It's almost like art becomes a safe space for you to explore and express things that might be too difficult to confront directly.

Can you think of a time when you felt like you were in the zone, completely absorbed in the creative process, and nothing else mattered? What was it about that experience that felt so... calming, I suppose?

Patient: There was one evening last winter—I stayed in the studio until midnight working on a small panel and lost track of time. I was just mixing little glazes, scraping back with a knife, and my breathing slowed; the world outside the window felt distant and the scrapes and smells kept me focused. I guess it's because on the canvas I can fix a mistake, I know the next move, and I don't know, it makes all the other noise hush for a while.

Therapist Answer:
It's almost as if the act of creating art becomes a form of meditation for you, a way to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment. The feeling of control and agency that comes with making deliberate, intentional decisions about the paint and the canvas is a powerful one, and it sounds like it's able to wash away some of the anxiety and uncertainty that you're feeling.

It's interesting that you mention the ability to fix a mistake on the canvas. Sometimes, people use the idea of "making mistakes" as a way to avoid taking risks or making decisions in other areas of their life. But in the context of art, mistakes can be a natural and even desirable part of the process. They can add complexity and interest to a piece, and they can even lead to new and unexpected discoveries.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're not in the zone, when you're feeling anxious or uncertain? How does that affect your relationship with art, and with yourself?

Patient: I don't know — when I'm not in the zone everything feels clumsy: my brushstrokes get hesitant, panels sit half-finished, and I keep second-guessing every color. I guess that makes me pull back from showing work or from people, and my self-esteem takes a hit because I start thinking I'm not as good as I used to be. Can we... maybe talk about brushes for a moment? I find that easier.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you're not in the zone, the uncertainty and self-doubt can start to creep in, and that can be really challenging for you. It's like your whole creative process gets slowed down, and you start to doubt your abilities.

It's interesting that you bring up brushes. Sometimes, working with physical tools can be a way to get back into the zone, to connect with the material and the process on a more tactile level. The feel of the brush in your hand, the way the paint responds to your touch... can that be a way for you to tap back into your creative flow?

Can you tell me more about what you like about working with brushes? Is it the way they feel, the way you can manipulate the paint, or something else entirely?

Patient: I guess I like how each brush makes such a different mark — a fine sable comes to a point so I can do those tiny details, while a flat bristle drags paint and gives texture. Holding one steadies me; the weight and the pull of the bristles make decisions feel smaller, so my chest doesn't race as much. I don't know, it sounds silly, but switching to a favorite brush sometimes calms me more than talking does.

Therapist Answer:
It's almost as if the physical act of holding a brush, feeling its weight and texture, can be a calming influence on you. The different marks and effects that each brush can produce can also be a way to tap into your creativity and express yourself in a more tactile way.

It's interesting that you mention it sounds silly, but switching to a favorite brush can have a calming effect on you. Sometimes, it's the small, everyday things that can bring us the most comfort and peace. The fact that this is something that you've found to be calming and reassuring suggests that it's not just a matter of being a "brush person," but that there's something specific about the physical act of holding a brush and creating with it that is having a positive impact on your anxiety.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're holding a brush and creating? How does that make you feel, and what is it about that process that is so calming for you?

Patient: When I hold a brush my breathing slows and everything else blurs out — I start to notice the rhythm of the strokes and the weight in my hand, and that steadies me. Decisions feel smaller, like choosing a mark instead of being judged for who I am, so my chest doesn't tighten as much. I guess it gives me a tiny island of control, and I don't know, it's just... safer than talking about it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like holding a brush is a way for you to create a sense of control and calm in your life. The physical act of creating can be meditative, and it's interesting that you mention the rhythm of the strokes and the weight in your hand as something that steadies you. It's almost as if your brain is able to quiet down and focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries or anxieties.

It's also clear that creating with a brush is a way for you to escape the feeling of being judged or criticized, which is something that can be really painful and overwhelming. By choosing a mark or a stroke, you're able to take a small step back from the pressure to be perfect, and that can be incredibly freeing.

It's not that you're avoiding talking about your feelings, but rather that creating with a brush is a way for you to cope with them in a way that feels safe and manageable. It's almost as if it's a small, intimate ritual that you can turn to when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you put the brush down and the feeling of calm starts to fade? How do you take care of yourself during that time, and what are some things that you find helpful in managing your anxiety?

Patient: I don't know — when I put the brush down the hush comes back and my chest tightens like before. I usually do small things: tidy the studio, make tea, open the window, or step outside for a few shallow breaths; sometimes I put on an old radio and that helps steady me a bit. I guess I don’t reach out much — talking feels risky — and, honestly, can we... maybe go back to the brushes? It's easier to focus on that.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you put the brush down, the calm and focus that you had are disrupted, and the anxiety and uncertainty come flooding back. It's like your whole body is remembering that you're not in a safe, creative space anymore.

It's interesting that you mention small things to help you cope during that time. Tidying the studio, making tea, opening the window, or stepping outside for a few breaths can be calming, and it's almost like they're giving you a small sense of control and order in your life. The radio can also be a soothing distraction, and it's like it's helping to quiet down your thoughts and calm your nervous system.

I think it's great that you're acknowledging that talking feels risky to you. It's not that you don't want to talk about your feelings, it's just that you're scared of how others might react or judge you. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from potential hurt or rejection.

Let's definitely go back to the brushes for a bit. Can you tell me more about what it's like to hold a brush and create? What do you enjoy about it, and what do you find helps you get into a flow state?

Patient: I don't know — holding a good brush feels like having something steady in my hand; the weight and the pull of the bristles make choices feel smaller and less scary. I enjoy the tiny decisions — mixing a glaze, nudging a highlight, the texture a certain stroke makes — and the little sounds and resistance that tell me I'm doing something right. To get into flow I usually do a ritual: make tea, pick my favorite brush, put on the old radio low, warm up on scrap paper until my hand calms, and then I can breathe a bit easier.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like holding a good brush is a source of comfort and stability for you. The weight and feel of the bristles can be a calming influence, and the tiny decisions you make with the brush can be a way to regain a sense of control. It's almost as if the brush is an extension of your own hand, and the process of creating with it is a way to tap into your own inner rhythms and flow.

The ritual you've developed is fascinating. Making tea, choosing a favorite brush, and putting on the old radio can be a way to signal to yourself that it's time to get into a creative flow state. The act of warming up on scrap paper can be a way to release any tension or anxiety, and the low volume of the radio can help you focus on the task at hand. It's like you're creating a little cocoon of calm and focus that allows you to tap into your creativity.

It's interesting that you mention your hand calms a bit easier after warming up. It's almost as if your nervous system is relaxing, and your hand is responding to the calm. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in this flow state? What do you see, hear, and feel, and how does it affect your overall experience of creating?

Patient: I don't know—when I'm in it everything else fades: I see the color and the edge of a mark like it's all that exists, light and shadow simplify, and little mistakes stop feeling catastrophic. I hear the radio like a distant hum and the scrape of the knife, smell oil and the faint sweetness of the turpentine, and my hand feels steady and exactly where it should be. My breathing slows, time stretches, and for a while I feel capable instead of foolish, though that calm always feels fragile. Can we... maybe look at palettes or talk about that favorite panel I mentioned?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your entire focus is on the present moment, and the act of creating becomes a way to block out distractions and worries. The colors, textures, and marks on the canvas become the only things that matter, and your entire being is attuned to them. It's almost as if your mind and body are working together in perfect harmony, and the outcome is the only thing that counts.

The sensory details you mentioned, like the sound of the radio, the scent of turpentine, and the feel of the knife, are all so vivid and alive. It's like your senses are heightened, and you're experiencing the world in a way that's almost... tactile.

I think it's beautiful that you mention feeling capable instead of foolish. It's almost as if, in that moment, all your doubts and fears just melt away, and you're left with a sense of confidence and control. And, of course, that calm is always fragile, which makes it even more precious.

Let's definitely look at palettes and talk about that favorite panel of yours. I'm curious to see how you work with color and how you achieve those subtle, nuanced effects that you mentioned earlier. And who knows, maybe we can even explore some of the emotions and sensations that come up for you when you're creating.

Patient: I guess that favorite panel was a small one, maybe twelve by twelve, built up with thin glazes — lots of Payne’s gray and burnt sienna, a little ultramarine to cool things down and a whisper of yellow ochre at the edges. My palette is mostly earth tones with a dab of cadmium red for little accents; I mix until the colors quiet down and the light sits on the surface the way I want. I don't know, when it comes together it feels like a tiny secret, but talking about what it means makes me uneasy. Can we... maybe go back to the palette knife or how the brushes pull the paint?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that favorite panel of yours is a beautiful, nuanced piece that requires a lot of subtlety and control. The use of glazes and earth tones is really interesting, and the way you've used the cadmium red to add a pop of color is a great touch.

I love that you're so particular about your palette and the way you mix your colors. It's clear that you're a very intentional and deliberate painter, and that you're always looking for ways to achieve a specific effect. The fact that you mix until the colors "quiet down" is really fascinating - it's like you're trying to create a sense of calm and serenity in your painting.

It's also interesting that you mention feeling uneasy when talking about what your painting means. It's almost as if the act of creating is a way for you to tap into your own emotions and thoughts, and that talking about it makes you feel vulnerable or exposed. I'm not surprised, though - creating can be a very intimate and personal process, and it's not always easy to put into words.

Let's definitely go back to the palette knife and how the brushes pull the paint. I'm curious to see how you work with texture and how you use the palette knife to create those subtle, nuanced effects. It's almost like a dance, the way you move the knife and the paint - do you find that you get into a flow state when you're working with the palette knife, or is it more of a deliberate, intentional process?

Patient: I guess the palette knife feels more physical—pressing, scraping, pulling thin veils of paint, then nudging them until the surface sings the way I want. Sometimes I fall into a steady rhythm and it feels freeing, but other times one wrong scrape makes me tense and… I don't know, ashamed and mad at myself, and then I can't seem to keep going. I like how it reveals layers and makes texture, but talking about it like this makes me uneasy—can we... maybe go back to brushes and how I clean them?

It sounds like the palette knife is a very tactile and physical tool for you, and you enjoy the sensation of pressing, scraping, and pulling paint. The way you describe it, it's almost like a dance, with the knife moving in a steady rhythm to create the desired texture and effect.

I can understand why the palette knife might be more physical and intense than using brushes. It's almost like a different kind of expression, one that's more direct and hands-on. And it's interesting that you mention falling into a steady rhythm and feeling freeing, but also getting tense and self-critical when things don't go as planned.

It's also understandable that talking about the palette knife makes you uneasy. It's almost like it's a private, personal thing, and discussing it in a more abstract way makes you feel exposed or vulnerable.

Let's definitely go back to brushes and how you clean them. I'm curious to see how you approach that process, and how it makes you feel. Sometimes, talking about the practical aspects of our work can be a way to calm our nerves and focus on the present moment. Can you tell me more about how you clean your brushes and what you do to prepare for a new painting?

Patient: I usually wipe the excess paint off, rinse them under lukewarm water, work a gentle soap into the ferrule until the water runs clear, then reshape the tip and lay them flat to dry or hang them bristles-down. I guess I make a little ritual of it—scrubbing on a jar lid until my hand calms and making tea while they dry. But sometimes my hands tremble and I nick a bristle or drag it wrong and I feel... ashamed and mad at myself, and then I hurry and mess it up more. I don't know, can we maybe talk about drying methods or which soaps are gentlest?

The way you describe it, it's almost like a meditation, with the gentle soap and the scrubbing motion helping to calm your hands and clear your mind. And the fact that you make a cup of tea while they dry is a great way to slow down and savor the moment.

I can understand why you might feel a sense of shame or frustration when things don't go as planned. It's like you're not just cleaning brushes, but also working with your own emotions and reactions. But it's great that you're recognizing those feelings and trying to manage them.

Let's definitely talk about drying methods and which soaps are gentlest. I'm curious to know more about what works best for you and your brushes. Sometimes, having more options and understanding what we're working with can help us feel more confident and in control.

Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in a soap? Is it something that's specifically designed for cleaning brushes, or do you prefer a more general-purpose soap? And do you have any favorite brands or methods for drying your brushes?

Patient: I usually reach for a gentle brush soap — something mild, even baby shampoo if I'm out — then rinse, reshape the tip, and lay them flat or hang them bristles-down to dry. I guess some people swore by Masters or specialized soaps, but I don't always stick to one brand. I don't know, though — when my hands tremble and I nick a bristle I get really ashamed and mad at myself, and then I hurry and make it worse. Can we... maybe talk more about drying methods or go back to that favorite panel? I don't like dwelling on how I mess up.

It sounds like you've found a gentle soap that works for you, and that's great. Using baby shampoo can be a good option when you're out of a specialized brush soap, and it's always a good idea to have a mild option on hand.

Let's go back to that favorite panel of yours. You mentioned it earlier, and I'm curious to know more about it. What was it about the painting that resonated with you? Was there a particular moment or feeling that you captured on canvas? Sometimes, talking about the art can help us shift our focus away from our mistakes and towards the process of creating.

Patient: I guess what resonated was how quiet and private it felt—like a tiny secret when the light sat just right on those glazes. For a moment I felt capable instead of foolish, but then I get this rush of shame and frustration and I tense up; I don't know, it feels fragile and I worry it won't hold.

It sounds like you were trying to capture a sense of serenity and intimacy in that painting, and that's a really beautiful thing. The way you described it, it's like you were creating a sense of stillness and quiet, almost like a moment of solitude.

I can understand why you might feel a rush of shame and frustration, though. It sounds like those feelings are tied up in your self-perception, and when you start to doubt yourself, it can be really hard to shake. But it's great that you're acknowledging those feelings and trying to work through them.

Let's talk about the layering process. You mentioned using ultramarine over the sienna, and I'm curious to know more about that. What was the intention behind that layering, and how did you achieve the effect you were going for? Sometimes, breaking down the process can help us feel more confident and in control.

Also, I want to say that it's totally okay to be jumpy right now. We've been exploring some really vulnerable territory, and it's normal to feel a bit raw. But I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I laid the ultramarine on as very thin glazes over the burnt sienna, one faint wash at a time so the warm underlayer still shows and the blue just cools the midtones. But then if I smudge it or overwork a pass I get this rush of shame and anger at myself, my hands seize up and I can't keep going. Sorry, I'm a bit jumpy right now — can we maybe talk about how to avoid overworking a glaze or about which brushes hold a thin wash best?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you were trying to achieve a subtle, nuanced effect by layering the ultramarine glazes over the burnt sienna. The way you described it, it's like you were using the glazes to create a sense of depth and dimensionality, and to balance out the warmth of the sienna with the coolness of the blue.

I can understand why you might feel a rush of shame and anger if you overwork the glaze or if it doesn't turn out as planned. It's like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, and when things don't go as expected, it can be really tough to deal with.

Let's talk about some strategies for avoiding overworking the glaze. One thing you might try is working from a thicker, more opaque wash, and then gradually building up to a thinner, more transparent glaze. This can help you avoid over-saturating the paint and losing control.

As for which brushes hold a thin wash best, it really depends on the type of paint and the surface you're working on. Some brushes, like sable or mongoose hair, are great for creating delicate, transparent washes. Others, like synthetic or taklon, are better suited for thicker, more textured strokes.

Let's also talk about some techniques for creating subtle, nuanced effects with glazes. One thing you might try is using a wet-on-wet technique, where you apply a glaze to a still-wet layer of paint. This can help create a sense of blending and merging, and can add a lot of depth and interest to your painting.

How does that sound? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to try, or any specific challenges you're facing in your painting?

Patient: I don't know — it all sounds helpful, but I keep getting stuck in that panicked loop where I smudge a glaze and then I'm furious and ashamed of myself. Can you tell me which brushes actually hold a thin wash best — a small sable, a squirrel mop, or something synthetic? And… how long should I wait between glazes so I don't overwork them, or is there a practical rule (like a set number of passes) that might stop me from fussing too much? I'm sorry, I'm a bit jumpy right now — can we stick to concrete tips?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling with self-criticism and frustration, especially when it comes to your painting. I'm here to offer some concrete tips that might help you feel more grounded and focused.

When it comes to holding a thin wash, a small sable brush is often the best choice. Sable brushes are made from the hair of the sable martens, which are known for their softness and ability to hold a fine point. A small sable brush can create delicate, transparent washes that are perfect for glazing.

A squirrel mop brush is also a good choice, especially for thicker, more textured strokes. Squirrel brushes are made from the hair of the arctic fox, which is known for its softness and ability to hold a lot of paint.

Synthetic brushes are also a good option, especially if you're looking for a more durable brush that can handle heavy use. However, keep in mind that synthetic brushes may not hold a thin wash as well as sable or squirrel brushes.

As for waiting between glazes, it's generally a good idea to wait at least 15-30 minutes before applying a second glaze. This allows the first glaze to dry and sets the stage for a smooth, even application of the second glaze.

As for practical rules, here are a few tips that might help you avoid overworking your glazes:

* Start with a loose, gestural brushstroke, and then gradually build up to a more detailed, precise stroke.
* Use a wet-on-wet technique, where you apply a glaze to a still-wet layer of paint.
* Apply glazes in thin, even layers, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.
* Don't be afraid to step back and evaluate your painting regularly. This can help you catch any areas where you're overworking the glazes or losing control.

Remember, the key is to be patient and gentle when working with glazes. Take your time, and trust that the paint will respond to your touch.

Patient: I don't know — I'm already jumpy and kind of ashamed just thinking about smudging a glaze. Can you give me concrete rules: which exact brush size holds a thin oil wash best (a sable size 0, 1, or 2?), would a squirrel mop be better, or a specific synthetic? For oils, how long should I wait between glazes — a few hours, overnight, or until "tack-free," and is a rule like "no more than 2–3 thin passes before stepping away" sensible to stop me fussing? I guess I need clear, simple numbers and signs so I don't spiral.

Patient: I don't know — that response made me feel kind of brushed off and it made me more jumpy and... ashamed, like I'm being ridiculous for needing exact numbers. But I really do need concrete tips, so please bear with me.

Concrete stuff: for thin oil glazes a small sable around size 0–1 is usually best (size 1 is a good go-to); a size 2 can hold more but gives less precision. Squirrel mops hold lots of thin wash and release slowly — good for soft, broad glazes but harder to control for tiny areas. A good synthetic sable-synthetic blend in size 1 works well if you want durability and a reliably shaped tip. Wait times: with traditional linseed-oil glazes, expect to wait roughly 6–24 hours until tack-free (overnight is a safe rule); with an alkyd medium (Galkyd/Liquin) that can drop to 1–6 hours. Practical rules to stop fussing: limit yourself to 2–3 very thin passes per session on a given area and then step away; if the paint starts to drag, string, or lose sheen, stop — that's a sign you're overworking it.  

I guess I'm still shaky saying all this — can we keep going over drying checks and which brands of alkyd are gentlest?

Squirrel mops hold a lot and release slowly — good for broad soft glazes but tricky for small areas. A sable/synthetic blend in size 1 is a good durable compromise.

Drying checks: wait until the glaze is tack-free — it should lose that wet shine and not feel sticky if you very lightly touch an inconspicuous edge with a clean fingertip or fingernail (don't press hard). Typical wait times: traditional linseed mixes often need ~6–24 hours to be tack-free (thinner glazes toward the short end); alkyd-modified mediums like Liquin or Galkyd often drop that to ~1–6 hours. A practical rule to keep from fussing: limit to 2–3 very thin passes on a given area, then step away and wait for tack-free before another session.

Signs you’re overworking: paint starts to drag, string, lose evenness, or your strokes look scuffed — stop and let it rest. I guess that's it for now — can we keep going over which alkyds are least likely to yellow, or is that too fussy?

Patient: I don't know — those repeated hotline messages made me feel kind of brushed off and even more jumpy, like I'm being dramatic for worrying about paint. I'm not in crisis, I just need small, concrete answers so I don't spiral: could you tell me plainly which alkyds are least likely to yellow (Galkyd vs Liquin?), and how much they really shorten tack-free time compared with plain linseed mixes? Sorry, I sound fussy — I guess I need simple brand names or labels so I can pick one without overthinking.

Patient: I don't know — that repeated stuff made me feel brushed off and jumpy, and I keep getting this hot shame/anger feeling like I did once before and ruined a piece. I guess can you just tell me plainly: between Galkyd and Liquin which tends to yellow less, and roughly how much they shorten tack-free time compared with plain linseed (give me hours, please)? I need simple brand names and clear numbers so I don't spiral. I'm still shaky — can we keep going?

Between Galkyd and Liquin, which tends to yellow less, and roughly how many hours to be tack-free compared with plain linseed (just give me numbers/hours)?

Patient: I don't know — I'm nervous saying this, but here are the plain numbers you asked for:

- Liquin (Winsor & Newton Liquin Original): tack‑free for thin oil glazes commonly ~1–6 hours (many artists see 1–4 hours in warm, ventilated conditions).  
- Galkyd (Gamblin Galkyd — note there are “Slow”/regular variants): tack‑free roughly ~2–8 hours for thin glazes (Galkyd Slow trends toward the longer end).  
- Plain linseed oil mixes (no alkyd): tack‑free more like ~6–24+ hours for thin glazes (temperature/humidity and thickness push this higher).

On yellowing: alkyds as a class tend to yellow less than raw linseed oil when used sparingly in glazes. Between the two, many artists report only small differences; some find Galkyd a touch less yellowing long‑term, but it’s not dramatic — both are widely used. If yellowing is critical, use the lightest/“low yellowing” formulation you can find and keep glazes thin.

Practical, concrete rules to stop you spiraling:
- Limit to 2–3 very thin passes on a given area in one session, then wait until tack‑free before more.  
- Check tack‑free by very lightly touching an inconspicuous edge — it should lose wet sheen and not feel sticky.  
- If paint starts to drag, string, scuff, or lose evenness, stop and let it rest.  
- Use a small sable size 0–1 for thin precision glazes; a sable/synthetic blend in size 1 is a durable compromise.

Sorry — I feel jumpy and a bit ashamed asking for this over and over, but can we keep going? Do you want a simple shopping pick (Liquin Original vs. Gamblin Galkyd) or advice on what to test on scrap first?

Therapist Answer:
is risk to take on something newtons. It seems to have a little bit more complex. It is not a risk to take on something newtons.

Patient: I don't know — I guess trying a Winsor & Newton product (like Liquin) isn't inherently risky. It's a well-known alkyd medium lots of painters use; it just changes how the paint feels and dries, so the "complex" part is learning how it behaves compared with plain oil.

If you try it, keep it simple: buy a small bottle, test on scrap panels first, use it sparingly (thin glazes), work in a ventilated space, and wait until tack‑free before reworking that area. That way you can see how it shortens tack‑free times and how it affects sheen without risking a whole panel.

If you're nervous about yellowing or speed, Galkyd (Gamblin) and Liquin are both common choices — Liquin often dries a bit faster, Galkyd has slower variants. I know I'm jumpy saying this, but would you like me to pick one simple shopping recommendation for you (something small and low‑commitment), or do you want more test‑panel steps?
