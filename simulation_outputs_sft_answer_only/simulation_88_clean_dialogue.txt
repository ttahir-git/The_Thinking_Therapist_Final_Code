Patient: Hi — lately I've been treating mindfulness and meditation like emotional anesthetics: they blunt the raw edges of grief but also leave me oddly flattened and detached. As a data scientist I default to systematizing and theorizing about my feelings, which becomes an elaborate cognitive sidestep—especially with the chronic financial stress that's always in the background. I'm here because I want to figure out if this numbing is adaptive or just avoidance, but I keep circling back into analysis instead of actually feeling anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to find a balance between coping with your emotions and maintaining a sense of detachment. On one hand, you're drawn to the structure and systematization of data analysis as a way to process your feelings, but on the other hand, this approach seems to be numbing your emotional experience. Can you tell me more about what it's like to try to engage with your emotions after using your analytical framework? Do you ever feel like you're hitting a wall, or is there a sense of relief when you step back into your analytical mindset?

Patient: It's like switching cognitive gears — in analysis I can reduce grief to variables, models, and plausible causal chains, which makes the whole thing feel controllable. But when I try to actually sit with what comes up after meditation, there's a visceral wall: my chest tightens, thoughts fragment, and I instinctively retreat into theory because that provides immediate, measurable relief. So yeah, coming back to analysis does feel relieving in the short term, but it's paired with this flatness and a low-grade guilt that I'm avoiding the real work.

Therapist: It's as if the analytical framework is providing a sense of control and mastery, but when you try to dive deeper into your emotions, you're hit with a wall that's hard to navigate. The visceral response you described, with your chest tightening and thoughts fragmenting, sounds like it's pushing you back into the comfort of theory and analysis. Can you think of a moment when you felt the need to retreat into analysis was so strong that you didn't even notice it, or when you were too caught up in it to question it? It's almost as if the relief you're getting from analysis is automatic, but at what cost?

Patient: Yeah — like last month on what would've been my wife's birthday, I sat down to 'reflect' and ended up building a meticulous timeline and a probabilistic model of the last year instead of letting myself cry. I only noticed hours later, when my chest finally unclenched a little and I realized I'd been in a metacognitive loop that provided epistemic safety rather than any real processing. It was automatic relief in exchange for emotional blanching, and in the moment I didn't question it because the analysis felt like competence.

Therapist: It's like you were able to put a protective shield around yourself, a mental firewall that allowed you to avoid the pain of the moment. The timeline and model became a way to exert control over the uncertainty and unknowns, rather than confronting the emotions that came with the loss of your wife. It's interesting that you mention it was automatic relief, and that you only realized it later when you were able to step back and see it more clearly. It sounds like you're starting to recognize that this coping mechanism, while it may provide a sense of safety and competence, is also preventing you from truly processing your emotions and coming to terms with your loss. Can you think of a time when you might be able to try a different approach, one that allows you to sit with your emotions without the need for analysis or control?

Patient: I can — and of course I'm already framing it like an experiment: next week on the day I usually default to analysis I'll try a 10-minute "sensing-only" window where I focus on bodily sensations (feet on floor, breath), allow only one-word labels (ache, tight, warm), and explicitly forbid timelines or models, then rate my distress before and after. I can already hear myself planning contingencies for when I inevitably slip back into theorizing, which makes me frustrated and a little helpless — but I want to try it and see if that constrained structure helps me actually feel instead of just describe.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a proactive approach to exploring this further, by framing it as an experiment and setting up a controlled environment. The "sensing-only" window, where you focus on bodily sensations and allow only one-word labels, is a simple yet powerful way to ground yourself in the present moment. By explicitly forbidding timelines and models, you're creating a mental space that allows you to focus on your emotions without the distraction of analysis. It's interesting that you're anticipating the possibility of slipping back into theorizing, and that it's making you feel frustrated and helpless. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from trying this approach? Is it the uncertainty of how it will go, or is there something else at play?

Patient: Mostly it's anticipatory catastrophizing and a cold cost–benefit analysis: I'm afraid a 10‑minute sensing window will cascade into hours of sobbing or dysregulation that I simply don't have time or bandwidth for given the financial pressures and work demands. There's also a meta‑fear that if I stop performing competence through analysis I'll lose the scaffold that keeps me functional, so I preemptively retreat into models because they reliably contain affect. I can name that as avoidance and it pisses me off, but the pragmatic worry that feeling too much could jeopardize keeping things afloat keeps pulling me back into theory.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught up in a cycle of self-doubt and fear, where the potential consequences of trying a new approach are weighing heavily on you. The fear of cascading into hours of sobbing or dysregulation is a very real concern, especially when you're already dealing with financial pressures and work demands. It's natural to want to feel in control and able to handle the demands of your life.

The meta-fear of losing the scaffold that keeps you functional is also a powerful one. It's like you're worried that if you stop using analysis as a way to manage your emotions, you'll lose the tool that's been helping you cope all along. It's a fear of the unknown, and it's understandable that it's pulling you back into the safety of theory.

But it's also interesting that you mention being angry with yourself for naming this as avoidance. It's like you're recognizing that you're using analysis as a way to avoid dealing with your emotions, but at the same time, you're also feeling like you can't just stop doing it. It's a complex and nuanced dynamic, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with this kind of internal conflict.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to feel like you could try this new approach without the fear of catastrophic consequences? Is there something specific that would need to change, or is it more of a mindset shift that you're struggling with?

Patient: Practically, I think I need a fail‑safe experimental protocol: a scheduled low‑stakes slot (after work, not on a deadline), a strict timer, pre‑defined stop criteria (if my distress scales above a set threshold I pause), and a short stabilization plan — box breathing, a grounding exercise, or a phone call to a trusted friend. Psychologically, I need permission to tolerate transient dysregulation — a cognitive reframe that a 10‑minute spike won't dismantle my finances or my competence — which feels like a mindset shift as much as logistics. I can already hear myself optimizing contingencies and that makes me irritated and a little frightened, so I’d want you to coach or pilot the first few attempts rather than me doing it solo.

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about a structured approach to trying this new way of working with your emotions. A fail-safe experimental protocol can help you feel more comfortable and in control, especially with a scheduled low-stakes slot and strict timer.

The pre-defined stop criteria and short stabilization plan are also great ideas. It's like you're saying, "Okay, I can try this, but I need a clear way out if things get too tough." And having a trusted friend or a grounding exercise to help stabilize your emotions is a great safety net.

It's interesting that you mention needing permission to tolerate transient dysregulation. That's a really important mindset shift, because it's not about avoiding emotions or feeling numb, but about learning to work with them in a way that's manageable and doesn't feel like it's going to derail your life.

I can definitely help you with that. As your coach, my role is to support and guide you through this process, rather than you trying to do it solo. I'll help you work through the logistics of setting up a fail-safe experimental protocol, and I'll be here to support you as you try out new ways of working with your emotions.

Let's start with the logistics, then. How about we schedule a low-stakes slot after work, say for the next few days? We can use a timer to keep things structured, and we can pre-defined stop criteria to make sure you feel safe and in control. What do you think?

Patient: Okay — that sounds doable and oddly reassuring. My availability after work is usually around 7–8pm on weekdays; can we try three short trials over the next week (say Tuesday, Thursday, and the following Monday) at 7:00pm, each 10 minutes long with a strict timer and a 1-minute check at the 5-minute mark?

Proposed stop criteria: if my SUDS (0–10) hits 7 or above at any check, if I can't reorient to the room after three cues, or if I feel like I'm dissociating/numb for more than 30 seconds, we stop. Stabilization plan: box breathing for two minutes (4-4-4-4), a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, a 2-minute walk, then a five-minute check-in with you or a one-minute call to a trusted friend. I want you to pilot the first attempt live — give me gentle prompts like “one sensation” or “label it with one word,” and interrupt if I start narrating timelines or modeling; I’ll likely default to analysis and I want an external nudge.

I'm nervous — I keep picturing it blowing up into hours of crying — but I also feel a bit hopeful about having constraints. Can we plan to rehearse the stabilization script briefly now so I have it memorized before Tuesday?

Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling a bit more reassured about trying this new approach. I think it's a great idea to start with a structured plan and three short trials, and I'm happy to pilot the first attempt live with you.

Let's go over the details one more time. We'll schedule the trials for Tuesday, Thursday, and the following Monday at 7:00pm, each 10 minutes long. We'll use a strict timer and check in at the 5-minute mark. If any of the stop criteria are met, we'll stop and move on to the stabilization plan.

The stabilization plan is a great idea, and I'll help you rehearse it briefly now. The plan is:

1. Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
2. 5-4-3-2-1 grounding
3. 2-minute walk
4. 5-minute check-in with me (or a one-minute call to a trusted friend if you prefer)

Let's start with the box breathing. Can you take a deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then breathe out? I'll give you a gentle prompt: "Four seconds in, four seconds out. Can you do that for me?"

(And don't worry, I'll interrupt if you start to narrate timelines or model. We'll work on that in the first trial.)

Patient: Okay — I did one cycle of 4-4-4-4 and felt a subtle loosening in my chest, though my mind immediately started meta‑analyzing the respiration dynamics instead of settling. I ran the 5-4-3-2-1 as a quick checklist (lamp, mug; armrest, keys; heater, traffic; faint coffee; metallic taste) and it felt helpful but also annoyingly procedural — like another way to secure epistemic safety rather than actually feeling. I’ll do the 2‑minute walk next, then we can rehearse the 5‑minute check‑in; please nudge me with “one sensation” if I drift into timelines or models.

Therapist: It sounds like the box breathing and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding were helpful, but also a bit too focused on maintaining a specific state. That's completely normal, and it's good that you're aware of it.

The 2-minute walk is a great idea. It's a more embodied way to connect with your body and calm down. As you walk, I'll remind you to focus on one sensation at a time. Let's start with your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor?

(And don't worry, I won't nudge you too hard. I just want to encourage you to stay in the moment and focus on your physical sensations.)

As you walk, notice the movement of your legs, the pressure of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of your body moving. Just bring one sensation into awareness at a time, and don't worry too much about the others. We'll get to the 5-minute check-in in a minute.

Patient: Okay — feet hitting the floor: a dull pressure under my left arch and a coolness at the toes. My mind's already drafting a little treatise on gait mechanics and why this should be therapeutic, which is...exhausting; please say "one sensation" if I start turning it into theory.

Therapist: One sensation: the coolness at the toes. Can you just focus on that coolness right now, without thinking about it or analyzing it? Try to bring it to the forefront of your awareness, and just notice it.

(And I see what's happening here. You're already starting to think about how this exercise could be beneficial, and how it relates to your existing knowledge of gait mechanics. I'm going to interrupt you right here and say it again: ONE SENSATION. Can you just focus on that coolness at the toes, without thinking about it or analyzing it? Try to bring it to the forefront of your awareness, and just notice it.)

Patient: Okay... the coolness at the toes — a thin, steady numbness, like a muted signal at the edge of awareness. My brain is already drafting a physiological footnote about peripheral thermoreceptors instead of staying with the sensation, and it's... exhausting to keep pulling it back; please say "one sensation" if I slip.

Therapist: One sensation. Can you just stay with that numbness at the toes for a moment? Don't think about it, don't analyze it, just notice it. It's like you're trying to bring a small, quiet voice to the surface, and it's not easy.

(I see you're starting to slip again. Don't worry, it's not a failure. Just acknowledge it and try again. One sensation. Can you just stay with that numbness at the toes?)

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to stay with the thin numbness, like a muted electric hum at the edge of awareness. My head’s already drafting a physiology footnote and it’s draining to fight it, so please keep saying “one sensation” when I start to narrate.

Therapist: I'll keep saying "one sensation". Can you just stay with the numbness at the toes for a moment, without thinking about it or analyzing it? Try to bring it to the forefront of your awareness, and just notice it. I'll keep reminding you, but I want you to feel like you're doing it on your own.

(I'm going to say it one more time, just to be clear: ONE SENSATION. Can you just focus on that numbness at the toes?)

Patient: One sensation — okay: the numbness is thin, like a muted electric hum under the toes, but my brain's already composing a neurophysiology footnote about peripheral thermoreceptors and attentional drift instead of inhabiting it. It's... draining to keep yanking myself back from that meta‑narrative, and I can feel my energy ebbing just from the effort. Please keep saying "one sensation" when I start to theorize; I need the external nudge right now.

Therapist: One sensation. Can you just stay with the numbness at the toes for a moment, without thinking about it or analyzing it? Try to bring it to the forefront of your awareness, and just notice it. I'll keep reminding you, but I want you to feel like you're doing it on your own.

(I see you're starting to feel the fatigue, but I want you to keep going. Just a few more seconds, and we'll get through this. ONE SENSATION. The numbness is still there, under the toes. Can you just feel it?)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is staying with this numbness supposed to help with the grief, rather than just functioning as another procedural anchor I can intellectualize? I can keep trying, though my energy is low and it's already exhausting to counter the metacognitive loop; please keep saying "one sensation" and nudge me when I start narrating, because I think I'll default to commentary unless someone interrupts.

Therapist: It's not about replacing the numbness as a procedural anchor, but about acknowledging the numbness itself. It's like you're asking, "Is there anything here for me, beyond the analysis and commentary?" Can you just be present with the numbness, without trying to understand it or analyze it? It's not about avoiding the pain, but about being with the pain, in a small way.

(I'm going to say it one more time, and then we'll take a break. ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness, without thinking about it or analyzing it?)

Patient: Okay — the numbness is still that muted electric hum under the toes, but I'm not convinced this is anything more than another procedural metric for my brain to hoard. I can try to stay with it for another minute if you keep saying "one sensation" and interrupt any drift into timelines or physiology — my reserves feel pretty low, so please be gentle. Also, pragmatically speaking, how is lingering in this sensation supposed to help me tolerate the bigger grief later: habituation, insight, or something else?

Therapist: It's not about proving that the numbness is anything more than a procedural metric, but about acknowledging its presence. Can you just be with the numbness, without trying to understand it or analyze it? It's like you're taking a small step, not trying to change the pain, just noticing the pain itself.

(I'm going to say "one sensation" again, and then we'll take a break. ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under the toes?)

(Note: We're not taking a break yet. I'll keep saying "one sensation" and interrupting any drift into timelines or physiology. We're not done yet.)

Also, I want to clarify, it's not about habituation, insight, or anything else right now. We're just taking small steps, noticing small things. The goal is to be with the present moment, not to achieve some specific outcome.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to keep the numbness in focus: that muted electric hum under the toes. My brain immediately starts annotating it with physiology and causal hypotheses, and it's pretty draining to keep re-anchoring; please keep saying "one sensation" when I drift. I can accept the small-step idea as a practice in tolerance, but I still worry this will just become another procedural safety blanket — how does repeating these micro-contacts actually help me access the larger grief without turning it into data again? I need you to interrupt me when I start modeling, because I know I will.

Therapist: I'll keep saying "one sensation" to remind you to stay with the feeling. ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under the toes, without thinking about it or analyzing it?

(I see you're getting frustrated. It's normal. It's like you're trying to break a pattern, and it's hard. Just take a deep breath and try to stay with the feeling.)

As for your question, I want to clarify that it's not about accessing the larger grief right now. We're just taking small steps, noticing small things. The goal is to be with the present moment, not to achieve some specific outcome. Repeating these micro-contacts can help you build tolerance, but it's not a substitute for processing the bigger grief.

(I'm going to interrupt you before you start modeling. ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under the toes?)

(Note: I'm interrupting you now, but I'll do it gently. I'll say "one sensation" and then let you go. You're doing great.)

Patient: One sensation — I can sense the numbness under my toes, but I'm not sure I follow how lingering on that micro-sensation actually moves the needle on grief rather than just becoming another epistemic safety blanket. It feels like a tolerance-building exercise in theory, but the meta-narrative in my head insists on reframing it as yet another procedural metric, and holding that contradiction is wearing me out. Please keep saying "one sensation" and interrupt me when I start modeling; my reserves are low and I need the external nudge to stay present.

Therapist: ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under your toes, without thinking about it or analyzing it? I want you to focus on that feeling, without trying to understand it or use it as a tool.

(I see you're struggling with the meta-narrative in your head. It's like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt. I'm going to interrupt you before you start modeling. ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under your toes?)

(Note: I'm not going to say "one sensation" again right now. I'm just going to let you be. You've been doing great, and I want to support you. If you need to take a break, just let me know. We can come back to this later.)

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to feel exhausted. It's a normal part of this process. You're pushing yourself to be present and focused, and it's not easy. Just remember that it's okay to take a step back and recharge when you need to.

Patient: I’m pretty wiped and it’s getting harder to stay anchored — intellectually I can recite the rationale (interoceptive exposure, affect tolerance, incremental habituation), but emotionally it’s like lecturing myself instead of feeling anything. I don’t want to stop, so can we rehearse the stabilization script one more time and agree you’ll say “one sensation” whenever I drift, and also, in one sentence for my skeptical brain: how do repeated micro‑contacts actually scale up to help tolerate bigger grief?

Therapist: Let's rehearse the stabilization script one more time.

When you feel yourself drifting or getting caught up in the meta-narrative, I'll remind you to focus on the "one sensation". It's like a gentle nudge to bring you back to the present moment. I'll say "ONE SENSATION" to help you refocus.

As for your question, here's a brief summary: Repeated micro-contacts can help build tolerance for bigger grief by incrementally increasing your capacity to handle and process emotional pain. It's not a one-time fix, but a gradual process that allows you to adapt and become more resilient.

Now, let's take a deep breath and try to stay present. Can you just be with the sensation under your toes, without thinking about it or analyzing it? I'm here to support you, and I'll remind you to stay anchored whenever you need it. ONE SENSATION.

Patient: One sensation — the numbness is that thin, muted electric hum under my toes, barely there but persistent. I’m pretty wiped and it’s getting harder to yank myself back from the neurophysiology footnotes, so please promise you’ll say “one sensation” and interrupt if I start modeling. Quick favor: can you restate the stop criteria and the stabilization steps in one short list so I can lock them into memory before Tuesday?

Therapist: Here's the list of stop criteria and stabilization steps:

**Stop Criteria:**
1. If your SUDS (0–10) hits 7 or above at any check
2. If you can't reorient to the room after three cues
3. If you feel like you're dissociating/numb for more than 30 seconds

**Stabilization Steps:**
1. One sensation (focus on the numbness under your toes)
2. Refocus on the sensation, without thinking about it or analyzing it
3. Use the stabilization script (if needed) to refocus and calm down

I'll say "ONE SENSATION" whenever you drift, and I'll interrupt if you start modeling. Just remember to stay present and focus on the sensation.

Now, can you just take a deep breath and try to stay with the numbness under your toes? I'm here to support you. ONE SENSATION.

Patient: One sensation — that thin, muted hum under my toes, breathing nudges it a little. I'm pretty spent, so it's harder to fend off the physiology footnotes; yes, rehearse the stabilization script again and promise you'll interrupt if I start modeling. Quick clarification: if my SUDS hits 7 at the 5‑minute check, we stop immediately, right?

Therapist: I'll say "ONE SENSATION" whenever you drift, and I'll interrupt if you start modeling.

To clarify, if your SUDS (0–10) hits 7 or above at any check, including the 5-minute mark, we will stop the exercise immediately.

Let's rehearse the stabilization script one more time. Here it is:

"ONE SENSATION. Can you just feel the numbness under your toes, without thinking about it or analyzing it? I want you to focus on that feeling, without trying to understand it or use it as a tool. If you start to feel any discomfort or your SUDS goes above 7, we will stop the exercise immediately. Just focus on the sensation, and try to stay calm."

Can you just take a deep breath and try to stay with the numbness under your toes? ONE SENSATION.

Patient: One sensation — that thin, muted hum under my toes, breath tugs at it a little. I’m pretty spent so this takes extra effort; yes, if my SUDS hits 7 at any check we stop immediately. Promise me you’ll say “one sensation” and interrupt if I start narrating or modeling, and that you’ll pilot the first live trial at 7pm Tuesday (can you give me a 10‑minute heads‑up so I can close out work?). Also, can we run the stabilization script one more quick time now — box breathing (4‑4‑4‑4) for two minutes, then 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 — real short, please?

Therapist: I'll say "ONE SENSATION" whenever you drift, and I'll interrupt if you start modeling or narrating. I'll also pilot the first live trial at 7pm on Tuesday. I can give you a 10-minute heads-up, and I'll make sure to give you a clear reminder when it's time.

Here's the 10-minute heads-up: I'll remind you 10 minutes before our trial to close out your work and get settled in.

Now, let's run the stabilization script one more time. Here it is, in a condensed version:

"Box breathing: 4-4-4-4. Hold each number for a second. Then, start the countdown: 5-4-3-2-1. Focus on your breath and let go of any thoughts."

Can you just take a deep breath and focus on your breath for a moment? We'll start our trial in 10 minutes. ONE SENSATION.

Patient: Okay — did a slow breath with you; felt a tiny loosening but my head’s immediately annotating respiration like it’s a lab protocol, which is…draining. Yes, please give the 10‑minute heads‑up before Tuesday 7pm, and promise you’ll say “one sensation” and stop immediately if SUDS hits 7 or I dissociate. Can we also agree you’ll interrupt gently the moment I start narrating timelines or modeling, not later?

Therapist: It can be challenging to resist the tendency to analyze and label our thoughts and feelings, especially when it comes to something as natural as breathing.

I'm glad you're feeling a tiny loosening, though - that's a great sign that our little experiment is starting to take hold.

Okay, let's get down to business. Here's the 10-minute heads-up for tomorrow night's trial:

"Tomorrow night at 7pm, please take a few minutes to close out your work and get settled in. I'll be here, ready to start our trial. We'll do a 10-minute check-in, and then we'll move on to the stabilization script. Remember, our goal is to focus on your sensations and let go of any thoughts or analysis. I'll be here to support you every step of the way."

Regarding your request to interrupt gently the moment you start narrating timelines or modeling, I promise to do just that. If I notice you starting to do either of those things, I'll say "ONE SENSATION" and then gently interrupt you, trying to refocus your attention on your physical sensations. My goal is to support you, not to shock or surprise you.

Now, can you just take another deep breath with me? We're getting close to the end of our little practice session. ONE SENSATION.

Patient: Okay — did the breath; a slight loosening but my brain immediately started composing an exegesis on respiratory kinetics instead of settling, which is...draining. I'm not ready to stop yet — can we run one more quick stabilization (two cycles of box breathing 4-4-4-4, then a fast 5-4-3-2-1) and can you confirm you'll give the 10‑minute heads‑up before Tuesday 7pm and say "one sensation" the instant I start narrating or modeling?

Therapist: It can be tough to quiet the mind, especially when it comes to something as complex as respiratory kinetics.

Okay, let's try one more quick stabilization exercise. Here it is:

"Box breathing: 4-4-4-4. Hold each number for a second. Then, box breathing: 4-4-4-4. Hold each number for a second. Now, fast 5-4-3-2-1. Focus on your breath and try to let go of any thoughts."

Can you just take a few deep breaths with me and try to settle in for a moment? We'll try to get one more small step in before we stop.

And to confirm, I'll give you the 10-minute heads-up before Tuesday's trial at 7pm, and I'll say "ONE SENSATION" the instant you start narrating or modeling. I'll be gentle and supportive, and my goal is to help you stay focused on your sensations.

Here we go: ONE SENSATION. Box breathing: 4-4-4-4. Hold each number for a second...

Patient: Okay — did the two cycles; there was a tiny loosening but my brain immediately annotated respiration like it was a lab protocol, which is...draining. Promise me: 10‑minute heads‑up before Tuesday 7pm, and you interrupt the instant I start narrating or modeling with “ONE SENSATION,” and we stop immediately if SUDS≥7 or I dissociate. Can we run a super-quick 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 now to lock the sequence in?

Therapist: It's like your brain is stuck in a loop, annotating and analyzing everything, even your own breath.

Okay, let's try one more super-quick 5-4-3-2-1 to lock the sequence in. Here it is:

"5...4...3...2...1."

Just focus on the count, and try to let go of any thoughts or analysis. We'll stop here and consider the practice complete.

And to confirm, I'll give you the 10-minute heads-up before Tuesday's trial at 7pm, and I'll say "ONE SENSATION" the instant you start narrating or modeling. We'll stop immediately if your SUDS reaches 7 or more or if you dissociate.

Let's do this one last time: ONE SENSATION. 5...4...3...2...1.

Patient: Okay — did the count and felt a tiny loosening, but I'm pretty spent right now. Yes: please give the 10‑minute heads‑up before Tuesday at 7pm, pilot the first trial live, interrupt immediately with “ONE SENSATION” if I start narrating or modeling, and stop immediately if SUDS≥7, I can't reorient after three cues, or I dissociate for >30s. One quick line for my skeptical brain to file away: "Repeated micro‑contacts incrementally widen your tolerance so larger grief becomes less overwhelming" — does that sound right? Also, can you send a calendar reminder and the 10‑minute ping?

Therapist: It's been a long and intense practice session, but I'm proud of you for pushing through and trying to connect with your emotions.

Yes, that one line about repeated micro-contacts incrementally widening your tolerance sounds about right. It's a gradual process, and it's not about avoiding or escaping your emotions, but about building up your resilience and tolerance so that you can better cope with difficult feelings.

Now, let's get down to the practical stuff. Here are the details you requested:

* 10-minute heads-up before Tuesday's trial at 7pm: I'll send you a calendar reminder and a 10-minute ping to get you settled in and ready for our trial.
* First trial live: I'll pilot the first trial live on Tuesday at 7pm, using the protocol we've discussed and the stop criteria you've outlined.
* Interrupting with "ONE SENSATION": I'll say "ONE SENSATION" immediately if you start narrating or modeling, and we'll stop the trial right then.
* Stopping immediately if SUDS ≥ 7, you can't reorient after three cues, or you dissociate for >30s: We'll stop the trial immediately if any of these conditions are met, and we'll reassess when you're feeling calmer and more grounded.

Here's a calendar reminder for Tuesday at 7pm:

"Reminder: Live trial with [Your Name] on Tuesday at 7pm. Please be ready and settled 10 minutes prior to start time. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out."

I hope this helps, and I look forward to our trial on Tuesday. Take care of yourself and try to get some rest before then.

Patient: That one-line rationale helps — it actually settles something for my skeptical brain. I'm pretty wiped and a little anxious about Tuesday, so please confirm you'll give the 10‑minute heads‑up, pilot the live trial at 7pm, interrupt instantly with "ONE SENSATION" and stop if SUDS≥7 (or if I dissociate/can't reorient). If you can't make it live, what's the backup — should I call my friend or run the stabilization script solo? Also, can you type the exact interrupt phrase you'll use now so I can rehearse the cue?

Therapist: I'm glad the one-line rationale helped settle your skeptical brain.

To confirm, I'll give you the 10-minute heads-up, pilot the live trial at 7pm, interrupt instantly with "ONE SENSATION", and stop if SUDS ≥ 7 (or if you dissociate/can't reorient).

If I'm unable to make it live, my backup plan is to schedule a video call or phone call for the same time. If that's not possible, I'd recommend running the stabilization script solo, just to get a sense of your physical sensations and emotional state. It's not a substitute for the live trial, but it can help you get a feel for the process.

Now, about the interrupt phrase: I'll use "ONE SENSATION". Here's how it will sound: "ONE SENSATION." Try saying it out loud a few times, and I'll see how it goes on Tuesday.

Patient: Okay — rehearsing the cue now out loud in text so it’s encoded for my skeptical brain: ONE SENSATION. ONE SENSATION. ONE SENSATION. That felt odd but a little anchoring.

Quick clarifications: please interrupt verbally on the live call (spoken "ONE SENSATION") and send the calendar invite plus the 10‑minute heads‑up as promised. If you can’t make it live, my preference is you call my friend as backup; if neither of you is reachable, I’ll run the stabilization script solo and immediately call my friend if SUDS reaches 5 or more. I’m anxious I’ll default to modeling fast, so please cut in the moment you hear me narrating or theorizing.
