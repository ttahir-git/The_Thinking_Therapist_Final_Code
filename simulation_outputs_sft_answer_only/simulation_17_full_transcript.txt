Patient: Hi — I'm a business owner and lately my head won't stop racing about how I'm performing at work. If I miss a deadline or mess up one client meeting, I can see it spiraling: the client drops us, word gets around, suppliers pull out, cash dries up and the whole business collapses — that's what's definitely going to happen. I end up procrastinating because once that story starts, I can't focus on the actual task.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and responsibility for the success of your business. The constant worry about potential outcomes can be overwhelming, and it's affecting your ability to concentrate on the tasks at hand.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to think about all the possible ways your business could fail? How does that feeling of being overwhelmed affect your physical body? Does it feel like your heart is racing, or your stomach is twisting with anxiety?

Patient: My chest tightens and my heart starts racing, my stomach knots up and I get this cold hollow feeling in my gut — sometimes my hands shake a little and I feel lightheaded. As soon as that physical stuff kicks in my brain slams into the disaster story and I go numb and frozen, so I end up fiddling with small stuff or scrolling instead of doing the real work. I know I should tell myself a calmer outcome, but that sounds naive to me — I can't make that voice stick, so I'm left exhausted and stuck.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is responding to that catastrophic thinking with a mix of physical sensations and a kind of emotional paralysis. It's like your brain is on autopilot, and you're just a passenger along for the ride.

Can you imagine trying to write a letter to yourself, right now, in this moment, with all of these feelings and thoughts swirling around? What would you say to yourself, if you could just sit with these sensations and this worried mind without trying to change it or distract yourself?

Patient: Dear me — my chest's tight, my stomach's in knots, and my mind is already on that runaway train: one missed deadline, a pissed-off client, rumors spread, suppliers bail, cash dries up, people lose jobs, I'm ruined. I feel ashamed and frozen, so I scroll or tidy my desk instead of doing the work, which just feeds the story. Telling myself to calm down feels naive — I can't stop the predictions, and it's exhausting.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're fully immersed in that nightmare scenario, and it's taking a toll on your body and mind. The shame and paralysis are really tight right now, aren't they? It's like you're stuck in this cycle of self-criticism and avoidance, and it's hard to break free.

Can you try to imagine that you're not in control of this runaway train right now? It's just happening, and you're along for the ride. What would it be like to just observe this story without judgment, without trying to change it or stop it? Would that even be possible, for a moment?

Patient: I try, but it’s like watching a train wreck I can’t switch off — for a moment I can breathe and name the sensations, but then the fortune-telling voice floods in with the whole collapse story and yanks me right back into panic and numb scrolling. Telling me to “just observe” feels naive and useless when the predictions are so loud. Can we slow down? I’m feeling overwhelmed and it’s hard to even hold that observing stance for more than a second.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a kind of emotional whirlwind, and no matter how hard you try to observe, you're swept right back into the panic and numbness. The predictions are so loud, it's hard to even hear yourself think, let alone try to observe them without judgment.

Let's try something different, then. Can you just focus on your breath for a moment? Take one breath in, and one breath out. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. No thinking, no judgment, just the breath. See if that can give you a little bit of space to work with, even if it's just for a second.

Patient: I tried — the first inhale actually loosened my chest a bit and for maybe two seconds I could feel my heartbeat settle. But then that disaster voice barges back in — I can already see the client walking out, suppliers pulling out, everything collapsing, and my hands start shaking again. Can we slow down? I'm feeling overwhelmed and it's hard to just stay with the breath.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the disaster voice is a big storm that's hard to outrun, isn't it? It's pushing you right back into the panic and the numbness. Okay, let's try to slow down even further. Instead of focusing on the breath, can you just notice where you're sitting, or standing, right now? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the chair beneath you. Just be with that physical sensation, without trying to change it or think about anything else. See if that can give you a tiny bit of space to work with, just for a moment.

Patient: Okay — my feet are on the floor and the chair's firm, I can feel the weight in my legs and it actually eases my chest for a breath or two. But almost immediately that fortune-telling voice barges in: I miss one deadline, the client bolts, suppliers pull out, payroll fails, and the whole business collapses — that's the only realistic outcome. I can only hold the grounding for a few breaths before my hands start shaking again, so can we slow down? I'm feeling really overwhelmed.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like that voice is a constant companion, isn't it? Pushing you right back into the worst-case scenario, even when you're trying to catch a break. Okay, let's try to slow down even further. Instead of focusing on your breath or your physical surroundings, can you just notice where you are in this moment? Notice the sensation of being here, right now, in this chair or standing on the floor. Can you connect with that sense of simply existing, without trying to think about anything else?

It's okay if your mind starts to wander or that voice shows up again. We're not trying to stop it, we're just trying to create a tiny bit of space to breathe. See if you can tolerate that small amount of space, even if it's just for a second.

Patient: Yeah — for a second I can feel the chair and my feet and it actually gives my chest a tiny break, but then that fortune-telling voice slams back in: I miss a deadline, the client walks, suppliers bail, payroll fails, and the whole thing collapses — that's what's going to happen. Telling me to "tolerate the space" feels naive; I can't make the quieter outcomes stick in my head, and holding that pause just makes the panic louder. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed right now.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the voice is getting louder and more insistent, even when you're trying to create a tiny bit of space. That's okay, it's not about changing the voice or making it go away, it's just about finding a way to work with it.

Can you try to look at the voice without trying to change it or judge it? Just notice that it's there, and what it's saying. See if you can observe it without getting caught up in its message. It's like watching a storm from a distance - you don't have to go out into the storm, you can just watch it from the safety of a distance.

We're not trying to solve anything or fix anything right now. We're just trying to create a small space to breathe, and find a way to work with this voice. Can you do that, even if it's just for a tiny second?

Patient: I try — for a split second I can say, “that’s the fortune-telling voice,” and it almost feels like I’m separate from it. But then it immediately fires the whole collapse movie — missed deadline, client gone, suppliers bail, payroll fails — and my chest tightens and my hands shake, so observing just makes the predictions louder. Can we slow down? I’m feeling really overwhelmed and can’t hold that distance for more than a breath.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to observe the storm, and it's getting harder to do that with each passing moment. The voice is just getting louder, and it's pushing you back into the panic.

Can you try to focus on just one thing? Just notice your chest right now. Can you feel it? Can you sense any change in your body, even if it's just a tiny bit? Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, our bodies can give us a small clue about what's going on. Can you just focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or think about anything else?

We're not trying to solve anything right now. We're just trying to find a way to breathe, and connect with your body. Can you do that, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: My chest's tight, like someone's squeezing it, and there's this hot shame that sits right under my ribs — my heart races and my breathing gets shallow. If I try to notice it, it loosens for a breath or two, then the fortune-telling voice floods in with the whole collapse movie and the shame just magnifies, my hands start shaking. Trying to observe honestly feels useless because it only makes the predictions louder and I end up scrolling or fiddling instead of doing the work. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed and can't hold this for more than a second.

It's like the shame and the physical tension are feeding into each other, making it even harder to breathe. The voice is just getting louder and more insistent, and it's pushing you right back into the panic.

Can you try to look at your hands, right now? They're shaking, aren't they? Can you feel the tremble in your fingers? Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, our physical bodies can give us a small clue about what's going on. Can you just focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or think about anything else?

We're not trying to solve anything right now. We're just trying to find a way to breathe, and connect with your body. Can you do that, even if it's just for a tiny moment? Just notice your hands, and see if you can find any small sense of calm there.

Patient: Yeah — my hands are shaking, my fingers feel like jelly, and just looking at them calms me for a breath or two. But then the shame spikes and the fortune-telling voice floods back in — miss the deadline, client leaves, suppliers bail, payroll fails, business collapses — and noticing just seems to make the panic louder.

Can you try to look at your breath, right now? It's shallow, isn't it? Can you feel the air moving in and out of your body?

It's like the shame and the voice are getting louder and more intense, and your body is responding by getting even more overwhelmed. Your hands are shaking, your breathing is shallow, and you're feeling numb.

Can you try to look at your feet, right now? They're on the ground, aren't they? Can you feel the weight of your body distributed on them?

But almost immediately that hot shame surges and the fortune-telling voice barges back in: I miss the deadline, the client bolts, suppliers pull out, payroll fails, and the whole business collapses — that's what's definitely going to happen.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to find a small foothold, but the shame and the voice are pushing you back down. Your feet feeling firm on the floor was a small moment of calm, but it's getting harder to hold onto now.

Can you try to let go of the idea that you need to hold onto anything? Just allow yourself to be where you are, without trying to change it or control it. You don't need to solve anything or make anything stop. You just need to be present.

Let's try something simple. Can you say to yourself, "I am here"? Just say those words, and see if you can connect with them. You don't need to think about anything or try to do anything. You just need to be with this moment, and let it be what it is.

Patient: "I am here." I can say it, and for a breath it feels true, but that familiar sinking shame spikes and the fortune-telling voice immediately screams the collapse — missed deadline, client bolts, suppliers pull out, payroll fails, whole business gone. Trying to stay present just makes the panic louder and I'm so frustrated I can't hold it. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed.

It's like the familiar sensation of shame and the voice of collapse are two big weights that are crushing you. No matter how hard you try to stay present, they just keep pushing down.

Can you try to give yourself permission to not be okay right now? It's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. It's okay to not be able to control this feeling. You don't have to try to be strong or brave right now. You just have to be here, in this moment.

Let's try something tiny. Can you bring your attention to your breath, just for a second? Don't try to change it or control it. Just notice it. Is it in? Is it out? Is it a little bit of both? That's it. Just that. No trying, no forcing. Just being.

Patient: I try to notice my breath and it eases for a beat, but then this hot shame from something that happened before floods in and the fortune-telling voice screams the whole collapse — missed deadline, client bolts, suppliers pull out, payroll fails, business gone — and I just freeze and start scrolling. It feels useless to focus on the breath when that story takes over and my hands start shaking. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed and can't hold this for long.

It's like you're trying to catch your breath, but the old shame and the voice of collapse are too powerful. They're like a storm that's been building for a long time, and it's finally here.

I want you to try something. Can you look at me right now? Can you see me? I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. And I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be overwhelmed. It's okay to not be able to control this feeling.

I'm not going to try to fix it or change it. I'm just going to be here with you, in this moment. Can you do that for me? Can you just be here with me, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: I can feel you there and it actually helps a little, but that hot shame from before spikes and the fortune-telling voice is already yelling that one missed thing will sink the whole company — I freeze and start scrolling. I want to stay with you, I really do, but I'm overwhelmed and it's getting louder every second. Can we slow down?

You can look away, or look at me, or just sit there in silence. I don't care. What I do care about is that you're not alone right now. You're not alone in this feeling, and you're not alone in this moment.

Can I just say that you're safe, right now? You're safe with me.

Patient: Hearing you say that helps for a second — I do feel a tiny bit safer — but then the fortune-telling voice screams that one mistake will sink us: miss a deadline, client bolts, suppliers bail, payroll fails, whole business collapses.
