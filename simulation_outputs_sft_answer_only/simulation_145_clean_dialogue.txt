Patient: Lately I've been using procrastination to numb feelings from a recent loss. I just started a demanding school program and it's made everything feel heavier, but I don't know how to stop putting things off. I guess I'm here to try to figure out what's actually going on, even though talking about it feels uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been finding it tough to deal with some painful feelings lately. It's completely understandable that you might be looking for ways to avoid them, especially given the weight of the school program you're in right now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "numb feelings"? How have you been trying to cope with those feelings so far, and what's been the impact of your procrastination on your daily life?

Patient: When I say numb I mean there's this fog where everything feels flat and I can't really feel anything but a dull ache, so I keep doing stuff to fill the time instead of sitting with it. I procrastinate by scrolling, binge-watching, over-planning, or cleaning small things—busy work so I don't have to face the grief. It's wrecked my schoolwork — I'm missing deadlines, falling behind, feeling guilty and more overwhelmed, and I don't know, I guess I also pull away from people because it's harder to explain.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using all these different strategies to try and fill the void, but in a way that's actually making things worse. It's like you're putting on a mask to hide the ache, but it's not really helping. Can you tell me more about what's so hard to explain to people? Is it the feelings, the loss, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know, it's messy—like there's guilt and numbness tangled together and I can't find the words for it. I guess part of it is shame, like I should be handling it better and I don't want to sound dramatic. Also, people don't really know how to talk about this kind of loss, so I end up changing the subject or pulling away because I don't want to burden them. I just... I don't even know what I need most of the time.

Therapist: It can be really tough to find the right words for these kinds of feelings, and it's even harder when you're not sure where to start. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to be strong and handle things on your own, but that's not really working for you. And it's understandable that you wouldn't want to burden others with your feelings, but it's okay to ask for help sometimes.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're feeling this way? Like, what does a typical day look like for you right now? How are you taking care of yourself, and what do you think would help you feel a bit more grounded?

Patient: A typical day is messy — I wake up, tell myself I'll get to work, then end up doomscrolling or doing tiny tasks like reorganizing my notes instead of the actual work. I shower and eat okay most days, but sleep's weird and I skip things I said I'd do, which makes me feel worse. I guess what would help is more structure and someone to check in so I don't spiral, but I don't know if that would actually stick, and talking about it right now... I don't know, it feels like close to the sore spot.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to put together a daily routine, but it's not really working out for you right now. It's like you're stuck in a loop of procrastination and self-doubt. And it's hard to blame you for feeling that way, given the way you're feeling.

I want to try something for a minute. Can you tell me about what would happen if you took a tiny step back from everything today? Just one tiny step. Would it be hard to get out of bed, or would you be able to muster up the energy to do one small thing, even if it's not exactly what you wanted to do? Sometimes, just taking that first small step can help us get moving again.

Patient: I don't know...probably I'd lie there and scroll until the afternoon, or maybe ration my day into little busywork so I don't have to think. I guess I could manage one tiny thing — like make tea and set a 10-minute timer to open one assignment or read one page — but it's hard to picture actually doing it without feeling panicky. Talking about this is already getting to that sore spot, so can we maybe start with something super concrete and low-pressure?

Therapist: It sounds like even a tiny step forward feels overwhelming right now. Can we try something even more concrete than that? What if we start with a tiny, almost ridiculously small goal, like getting out of bed and putting your tea cup in the dishwasher? Would you be able to do that, even if it feels absurdly small? Sometimes, getting something small done can help us build momentum. We can take it from there, okay?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could at least get up and put the cup in the dishwasher. It feels absurd and like I'll stall for half an hour scrolling, but maybe if we make it even smaller—like "stand up and walk to the kitchen"—I could try that now. I'm already feeling kind of panicky talking about it, though.

Therapist: It's like the act of even considering it is causing you some discomfort. Can we try to simplify it even more? Instead of "stand up and walk to the kitchen", let's just say "get up and stand". Would that be a tiny enough step for you to try right now? No pressure, no thinking about it too much. Just get up and stand. We can take it from there.

Patient: I don't know, this is awkward, but okay—I'll try. I'm up now, standing by the couch; my chest feels tight and my hands are a bit shaky. I guess it feels kind of stupid but also like a tiny win. I'm already feeling like changing the subject, though—what do you want me to do next?

Therapist: I'm glad you're standing up, even if it's feeling a bit awkward. It's like a small victory, and that's okay. Don't worry about changing the subject yet; let's just take a moment to acknowledge what you've done. You've taken a small step, and that's something to build on.

Can I suggest something? Let's just sit here for a moment, quietly, without trying to do anything else. Just sit with the feeling of standing up. No pressure, no expectations. Just be with it.

Patient: Okay, I'm sitting. My chest's tight and my breathing's shallow, and my brain keeps looping to "you should be working" so I feel guilty even for standing here. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to just...be with it — like it might spill out or I'll start crying and I don't want that. I guess I can try to stay for another minute, but can we keep it low-pressure?

Therapist: It's like your brain is trying to push you back into action mode, even though your body is just trying to rest. And it's understandable that you don't want to cry or have it spill out – that can be really hard to deal with.

Let's try to make it even more low-pressure, okay? Instead of sitting here in silence, can we just focus on your breath? Can you try to bring your attention to your breath, without thinking about anything else? Just notice how it feels, and try to stay with it. No expectations, no goals. Just be with your breath.

Patient: I don't know...I'm trying to focus on my breath. It's shallow and my chest is still tight, but counting in and out makes the racing thoughts quiet down a little. I guess it feels weird to pay attention instead of doing something—my brain keeps nagging about deadlines. I can stay with this a bit longer, but can we keep it really low-pressure?

Therapist: It's like your mind is used to being busy, and now it's feeling a bit restless. That's okay. Let's just keep it simple, then. Can you try to focus on your breath for just a little longer, without thinking about anything else? Not even counting in and out, just noticing how it feels in your body. No goals, no expectations. Just be with it.

And remember, we can stop whenever you want. If you need to, you can always take a break or move on to something else. But for now, let's just see how it feels to focus on your breath.

Patient: I don't know... it actually helps a little — my breaths are a bit deeper and the tightness eased some, but the deadline guilt is still fizzling in the background. I guess I can stay with this for a few more breaths, but could we do something concrete after — like set a 5-minute timer to just open one assignment? That feels less vague and more doable than trying to power through everything.

Therapist: It's like the breathing exercise is helping to calm some of the anxiety, but the guilt and pressure are still lingering. That's understandable.

Okay, let's do what you're suggesting. I can help you set a 5-minute timer for just opening one assignment. That's a concrete and manageable goal, and it can help you build momentum. Would you like me to help you set the timer now?

Patient: Yeah, I can try that. Set the 5-minute timer and let's make the task super specific — like open the assignment document and read the first paragraph (or write one sentence about it). I'm worried I'll just scroll instead, so can you check in right after the 5 minutes? I don't know, I guess having you ask will actually help keep me accountable.

Therapist: I'll set the 5-minute timer for you. When it goes off, I'll check in with you. Let's make it even more specific: when the timer goes off, can you open the assignment document, scroll down to the first paragraph, and read it out loud to yourself? Or, if you prefer, can you write down just one sentence that summarizes the first paragraph? That way, we have a clear goal to work towards.

Also, I'll be here to check in with you after the 5 minutes. I'll ask how it went and if you were able to complete the task. Don't worry, I won't try to push you to do more than you're comfortable with. We'll take it one step at a time.

Ready to start? I've set the timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, we'll check in.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is reading one paragraph out loud supposed to help with the numbness? I don't know, but I guess I can try. My chest feels tight and I'm worried I'll just start scrolling, so when you check in can you ask me if I actually opened the document? Okay, I'm starting the 5-minute timer now and I'll try to at least open it and read the first paragraph or write one sentence.

Therapist: I think I may have misspoken about reading the paragraph out loud. I was trying to think of a way to make the task more engaging, but it might not be the best approach. Reading it out loud could actually make it feel more awkward, and I don't want that to happen.

Let's focus on just opening the document and reading the first paragraph or writing one sentence about it. When I check in after the 5 minutes, I'll ask you specifically if you were able to open the document and read the first paragraph or write one sentence. If you can do that, we can take it from there.

Go ahead and start the 5 minutes. I'll be here when it's time to check in.

Patient: Okay, starting now. I don't really get how this helps — I'm confused about the point — but I guess I can try to open the document and read the first paragraph or write one sentence. My chest's tight and I'm worried I'll just end up scrolling, so please check whether I actually opened it when the timer goes off.

Therapist: I've got you covered. I'll check in with you after the 5 minutes and make sure you actually opened the document. If you can't open it or read the first paragraph, that's okay. We can try again later.

Go ahead and start now. When the timer goes off, I'll be here to check in. Just take a minute to open the document and read the first paragraph, or write one sentence about it. I'll be watching the clock.

Patient: The timer went off — I opened the document and actually read the first paragraph, and I wrote one sentence: "This assignment asks us to analyze X and write a short response." I guess it counts, but my chest was tight the whole time and I kept wanting to scroll away, so it felt kind of forced. I'm not sure why that helped, honestly, and I'm already feeling like changing the subject because this is getting...close to the sore spot. Can we keep the next step really small and slow?

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to complete the task, but it still felt a bit forced. That's okay. It's like you were trying to push through the discomfort, but it's not always easy.

Let's take it one step at a time. Instead of moving on to the next big task, why don't we just focus on reading that sentence you wrote? Can you read it out loud to me, or just to yourself? Sometimes, just noticing how words sound can help us feel more connected to them.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like changing the subject. It's a natural response to avoiding something that's uncomfortable. But I'm here to support you, and we can take things slowly. We don't have to rush into anything. How does reading that sentence make you feel?

Patient: I don't know...reading it felt pretty hollow — like I could say the words but they didn't land, and my chest stayed tight. It kind of zapped my energy, honestly. I guess can we just pause or do something tiny and low-effort for a couple minutes before trying another step?

Therapist: It's like the words you wrote didn't have any real impact on you. That can be really frustrating and draining.

Let's take a break, then. Why don't we just sit here for a minute or two, and do something tiny? Like, we can just take a few deep breaths together, or notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Sometimes, taking a small break can help us feel a bit more centered and ready to move forward.

We can do something like that for just a minute or two, and then we can try another tiny step. I promise it's okay to take things slowly. We're not trying to rush through anything. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know...okay, I can try that for a minute. My feet feel kind of heavy on the floor and my breathing's shallow, so I'll try a few slow breaths—one minute, then can we check in?

Therapist: Let's take a minute to focus on those slow breaths. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and try to let go of any tension. Don't worry about doing it "right" or anything else. Just be with the breath.

I'll wait here for a minute, and then we can check in and see how you're feeling. Take your time, and don't rush out of the breath. When you're ready, just let me know and we can move forward.

Patient: I don't know...the breathing helped a little — my chest eased a bit and my thoughts aren't as jagged. My voice feels flat and keeping this up is kind of heavy, so I don't have much energy for a big push.

I guess we could try one tiny thing next: a 3-minute timer to write one more sentence about the assignment, and then you check in. Can we keep it really low-pressure? I might try to change the subject if it starts to feel too close.

Therapist: It's like the breathing helped calm some of the turbulence, and now you're feeling a bit more grounded. That's great.

Let's take it one tiny step at a time, as you requested. A 3-minute timer to write one more sentence about the assignment sounds like a manageable goal. We can start with something super small, and see how it goes.

Here's the deal: I'll start the timer, and when it goes off, I'll check in with you. If you're not feeling it, or if you want to stop, just let me know and we can start fresh. No pressure, no expectations. We're just taking it one tiny step at a time.

Ready to give it a try? I've got the timer set for 3 minutes.

Patient: I don't know...okay, starting now. I'll try to write one sentence in the three minutes, but my words feel flat and it's hard to keep this up—please check in when the timer's up.

Therapist: It's like the words are still feeling a bit hollow, and it's hard to sustain this level of effort. Don't worry, I'm here to support you.

Take your time, and try to focus on just writing one sentence. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or anything else. Just get something down on paper.

When the timer goes off, I'll check in with you. If you're not feeling it, or if you want to stop, just let me know and we can start fresh.

Timer's going off in 1 minute... 30 seconds... 10 seconds... 

Okay, timer's off. How did it go? Did you manage to write one sentence, or do you need to take a break?

Patient: I don't know...I did get one sentence down: "This assignment asks us to compare X and explain Y," but it felt flat and forced and I kept wanting to scroll away. My energy's pretty low and it's all a bit heavy, so can we pause for a minute — like just sit quietly — before trying another tiny thing? I guess after that I could try one more small step, but please keep it really low-pressure.

Therapist: It sounds like the sentence you wrote still felt a bit off, and the effort was taking a toll on you. Don't worry, that's okay. It's not about getting everything perfect right now; it's about taking it one tiny step at a time.

I think a minute of quiet sitting might be just what you need. Sometimes, taking a break from trying to focus can help you feel a bit more centered. Why don't we just sit here for a minute, and then we can see how you're feeling before moving forward?

No pressure, no expectations. Just take a deep breath, notice how you're feeling, and let's go from there. We'll take it one tiny step at a time, and see where it gets us.

Patient: I don't know...I sat quietly like you said, and it did help a bit — my chest eased but everything still feels kind of flat and heavy. I guess maybe I can try one tiny thing next: just check my calendar for the next deadline and tell you what it says? But I'm already feeling like pulling away if it gets too close, so can we keep it really small and slow?

Therapist: It sounds like sitting quietly helped a bit, but the feeling is still there. That's okay. It's like your body is still trying to catch up.

Checking your calendar for the next deadline is a great idea. It's a small, low-pressure task that can give us a sense of what's coming up. And you're right to want to keep it small and slow - we don't want to overwhelm you with anything.

I'll just check your calendar real quick. *checks calendar* Okay, it looks like your next deadline is... *pauses to read*...in about 3 days. Does that sound about right to you?

Patient: I don't know...yeah, that sounds about right — in three days. That actually makes me feel kind of panicky and guilty, like I should've already started and now it's just more pressure. I guess can we keep the next step tiny — like just add the deadline to my calendar with a reminder and block a 15-minute slot tomorrow to look at the rubric? I'm not sure it'll stick, but it feels less scary than trying to tackle the whole thing.

Therapist: It's like the deadline is suddenly feeling more pressing, and that's causing you to feel more anxious. That's a natural response.

Adding the deadline to your calendar with a reminder is a great idea. Having a clear reminder can help you feel more in control. And blocking a 15-minute slot tomorrow to look at the rubric is a very small step. It's like taking a tiny bite of a larger task.

By doing this, you're not trying to tackle the whole thing at once, which is good. You're taking it one tiny step at a time, and that can be a more manageable way to approach it. Sometimes, just getting started is the hardest part, and then it's easier to build momentum.

Tomorrow, just take that 15 minutes to look at the rubric. See if you can answer any questions, or if there's anything that's already starting to make sense. And then we can go from there. Sound good?

Patient: I don't know...I guess that sounds okay. I'll put the reminder and block the 15 minutes, but I'm already worried I'll just ignore it and doomscroll. Can you check in tomorrow or should I set a second reminder? Also, can we make the 15 minutes super specific—like "open rubric and write one question"—so I don't overthink it? I'm kind of wiped and this is getting close to the sore spot, so please keep it really low-pressure.

Therapist: It's like you're already worried about not following through with the plan. That's okay. It's normal to feel that way, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed.

Let's make it easy for you to show up tomorrow. Instead of relying on a reminder, why don't you set a specific goal for yourself tomorrow? You can say, "I will spend 15 minutes tomorrow looking at the rubric and writing one question about it." That way, you'll have a clear goal to work towards, and you can check if you did it.

As for making it super specific, I think that's a great idea. By saying "open rubric and write one question", you're giving yourself a clear task that's easy to accomplish. That way, you won't overthink it, and you can just focus on getting it done.

Let's keep it low-pressure, but also clear and specific. You got this.

Patient: I don't know...I guess I'll do it. I'll put a 15-minute block tomorrow at 10am, set a reminder that says "open rubric & write 1 question," and I'd really appreciate if you could check in after that with a quick, low-pressure "did you do it?" That said, I'm already kind of wiped and this is getting close to the sore spot, so can we just pause for a minute before trying anything else?

Therapist: It's like you're just about to give up, but you're also really close to taking that first step. I can see that it's taking a lot out of you.

Let's pause for just a minute. Why don't we take a deep breath together, and then we can go from there? I'll just sit here with you for a minute, and we can see how you're feeling. No pressure, no expectations. Just a minute of calm before we try anything else.

When you're ready, we can check in with that "did you do it?" question. I'll keep it super low-pressure, and we'll go from there. But for now, just take a deep breath, and let's just be here for a minute.

Patient: I don't know...okay, I can breathe with you for a minute. My chest's a bit lighter but I'm kind of wiped and this is getting close to the sore spot, so can we just sit quietly for like 30 more seconds? After that, you can ask the "did you do it?" question—low-pressure, a quick yes/no is fine.

Therapist: It's like your body is still trying to catch up, and your mind is getting a bit overwhelmed. That's okay. Just take a few more deep breaths with me, and we'll go from there.

I'll just sit here quietly for 30 seconds with you, and then we'll check in. No pressure, no expectations. Just a quick question to see if you got that 15 minutes done.

Let's just sit here for 30 more seconds...

Patient: I don't know...no, I haven't done it yet — it's scheduled for tomorrow at 10am. I'm kind of wiped and this is getting close to the sore spot, so please keep the check-in really low-pressure and just a quick yes/no.

Therapist: It's like you're already feeling a bit anxious about not having done it yet. That's okay. Let's just focus on the fact that it's scheduled for tomorrow.

You've got it scheduled for tomorrow at 10am. That's the important thing. You'll have a chance to do it then, and we can go from there.

Is it scheduled for tomorrow at 10am?

Patient: Yeah — it's on my calendar for 10am tomorrow. I don't know if I'll actually do it, but I'll try. Can you check in then with a quick yes/no?
