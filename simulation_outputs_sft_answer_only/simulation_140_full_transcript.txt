Patient: I've been preoccupied with constant worry about my performance in the kitchen—every ticket feels like a referendum on my competence, and that pressure often paralyzes me. It makes me procrastinate: I over-plan mise en place, rehearse responses to imagined critiques, then stall instead of just starting. Since I lost someone close, the burnout's deepened and I catch myself intellectualizing the anxiety instead of actually feeling it.

Therapist Answer:
The kitchen can be a high-stakes environment, especially when it comes to creative endeavors like cooking. It's as if every dish is an opportunity to prove yourself, and that pressure can be overwhelming. It's interesting that you mention feeling paralyzed by the potential critiques, instead of just taking action and experimenting with new techniques.

It seems like the loss you've experienced has also made the anxiety more intense. You're now using intellectualization as a way to cope with the emotions that come up. It's almost as if you're trying to keep the anxiety at arm's length, so it doesn't overwhelm you.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you do start cooking? What are your thoughts and feelings like during that process? Is there a sense of flow, or do you still feel anxious about being judged?

Patient: When I actually get into service there's this weird paradox: sometimes everything locks into a kinetic flow and I'm dialed in, but underneath that is a taut, anticipatory anxiety about critique. I default to meta-cognition—I rehearse contingencies, catalog possible failures, and script apologies—so I'm narrating the experience instead of inhabiting the sensory parts of cooking. There are moments of joy and competence, but they're attenuated by this persistent specter of judgment that makes me postpone starting new things.

Therapist Answer:
It's like there's this push-and-pull between the flow of cooking and the underlying anxiety. On one hand, you're able to get into a state of being fully present and engaged in the moment, but on the other hand, that presence is tainted by the fear of being judged. It's like you're stuck in a perpetual state of "what-if," where every potential outcome is anticipated and rehearsed, but none of it really happens.

It's fascinating that you mention the way you default to meta-cognition. It's like you're creating a narrative around the experience of cooking, almost as if you're trying to control the story. This makes me wonder if there's a sense of self-preservation at play here. Are you trying to protect yourself from the anxiety by creating a narrative that keeps you safe, or is this just a coping mechanism?

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're rehearsing all these contingencies and scripting apologies? Is there a sense of relief or accomplishment after doing so, or does it feel more like a way to avoid the anxiety altogether?

Patient: When I run through contingencies and script apologies it feels like I'm executing a risk-management protocol—there’s a fleeting sense of mastery, like I’ve neutralized potential critique before it exists, and that calms the immediate spike of dread. But that calm is paper-thin: it facilitates procrastination and keeps me in my head instead of doing the tactile, sensory work of cooking, so I end up cognitively exhausted rather than fulfilled. I keep justifying it as being thorough or professional, but I know it's avoidance wearing the clothes of competence.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the risk-management protocol is a double-edged sword for you. On one hand, it does provide a temporary sense of calm and mastery, which can be comforting in the face of anxiety. But on the other hand, it's clear that this approach is ultimately hindering your progress and leaving you feeling exhausted.

It's interesting that you mention the "paper-thin" sense of calm. It's almost as if this mental shielding is only providing a temporary reprieve, rather than a genuine sense of security. And the fact that it's facilitating procrastination and keeping you stuck in your head is a clear sign that this approach isn't working.

I want to explore the idea that you're using justification as a way to rationalize this behavior. You mention justifying it as being thorough or professional, but you also acknowledge that it's actually avoidance. It's as if you're trying to convince yourself that this behavior is necessary, even though you know it's not.

Can you tell me more about what's driving this need for control and mastery? Is there something specific that you're trying to prove to yourself or others through your cooking, or is it more of a general anxiety about being competent?

Patient: I think it’s a mix of both: on a concrete level I’m trying to prove competence to my peers and not be the weak link on a busy pass, but on a deeper level it feels like reclaiming agency after the loss—if I can control the outcome here, maybe I’m not the person who failed before. I lean into performance as a metric of worth because it’s measurable and socially legible, whereas grief and vulnerability are messy and invisible. I can talk myself through all of that pretty cleanly, but honestly I mostly intellectualize it to avoid actually feeling the underlying fear and shame.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to prove your worth to yourself and others through your cooking, but that's also tied to a deeper desire to regain a sense of control and agency after the loss. It's almost as if you're saying, "If I can just control this one thing, then maybe I can prove to myself that I'm not the one who failed."

I think it's really interesting that you mention performance as a metric of worth. It's almost as if you're equating your self-worth with your ability to execute and perform well. And you're right that performance can be a way to measure worth, especially in a social context where things are visible and legible. But at what cost?

It sounds like you're using intellectualization as a way to avoid feeling the underlying fear and shame. It's almost as if you're creating a distance between yourself and your emotions, so that you can't really touch them. But I wonder if that's actually helping you, or if it's just a way to keep you from feeling the emotions that you're trying to avoid.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to feel the fear and shame? Is it a physical sensation, or is it more of an emotional or mental experience? And what happens when you try to intellectualize it? Do you feel like you're able to keep it at bay, or does it always come back?

Patient: It's both — physically there's that knot in my stomach, my chest gets tight and my hands go cold, but most of the time it's a looping internal monologue that paints me as incompetent and erases nuance. When I intellectualize I turn it into a diagnostic exercise—contingency lists, probability estimates, script rehearsals—which calms the spike for a bit and lets me feel competent on paper, but it doesn't resolve the underlying ache. It comes back like a compressed spring: the analysis delays the feeling but often makes the rebound sharper, so I end up numbing or procrastinating instead of actually sitting with it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a cycle of physical tension and internalized self-doubt. The knot in your stomach, the tight chest, and the cold hands are all physical manifestations of the fear and shame you're trying to avoid. But then you intellectualize it, and suddenly it's a more manageable, almost manageable, task. You create a mental checklist, probability estimates, and script rehearsals, which gives you a sense of control and competence.

But here's the thing: it's not really resolving the underlying issue. The intellectualization just delays the feeling, and when it comes back, it's like a compressed spring. The numbness and procrastination are just ways to avoid sitting with the emotions, rather than actually facing them. It's like you're trying to outrun the pain, rather than confronting it head-on.

Can you think of a time when you might have felt comfortable enough to just sit with the fear and shame, rather than trying to intellectualize it? Maybe there was a moment when you felt safe enough to allow yourself to feel vulnerable, without trying to numb or escape it? What would that feel like, and how might it change your approach to dealing with this fear and shame?

Patient: Yeah — there was one night a few months after the funeral when service had been a mess and my sous pulled me aside, put a hand on my shoulder, and just let me collapse into it. Physically the knot unclenched, my chest loosened, and rather than narrating every possible failure I just cried for like ten minutes; I immediately reframed it as a “cathartic recalibration” to keep my distance, but the rawness was real. After that I experimented with tiny, low-stakes risks in the kitchen—treating mistakes as data instead of indictments—which loosened the paralysis a bit, though my default is still to intellectualize when pressure spikes.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that moment with your sous was a turning point for you. The physical release of the knot, the loosening of your chest, and the emotional release of crying all came together in a way that was cathartic and real. It's like your body and mind finally allowed themselves to feel the weight of what you were going through.

And it's interesting that you reframed it as a "cathartic recalibration" to keep your distance. That's a common coping mechanism, trying to maintain some level of control and objectivity, even when we're feeling vulnerable. But it's also clear that it was a real emotional release, one that helped you process your grief and move forward.

It's also great to hear that you started experimenting with low-stakes risks in the kitchen. Treating mistakes as data instead of indictments is a great way to build confidence and loosen up the paralysis. And it's clear that it's still a work in progress, that your default is still to intellectualize when pressure spikes.

Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to achieve by experimenting with these low-stakes risks? Are you trying to build confidence in your abilities, or are you trying to find a way to deal with the pressure and stress of cooking? And how do you think your sous's reaction to your breakdown helped you, or what did it reveal about your relationship with them?

Patient: Primarily I’m trying to habituate a tolerance for imperfection — to reorient from performance-as-worth to process-as-learning so mistakes become informative rather than existential. Those low-stakes experiments are meant to recalibrate my internal cost–benefit calculus so the perceived downside of trying shrinks and I actually start instead of rehearsing ad infinitum. My sous’s reaction felt like tangible social proof that vulnerability won’t automatically eject me from the team; it provided relational scaffolding and a pocket of safety that briefly interrupted my narrative of inevitable failure. But even saying that I can feel myself stepping back into analysis to avoid the raw gratitude and relief, and honestly that’s frustrating — can we sit with why I keep doing that?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to rewire your internal narrative around mistakes and imperfection. You want to shift from seeing mistakes as existential threats to viewing them as opportunities for learning and growth. You're trying to cultivate a more process-oriented mindset, where the focus is on the journey, not the destination.

It's great that you're experimenting with low-stakes risks in the kitchen to test your hypothesis. By making mistakes in a safe and controlled environment, you can begin to rewire your internal cost-benefit calculus. You're hoping that as the perceived downside of trying decreases, you'll become more willing to take risks and start experimenting.

Your conversation with your sous had a profound impact on you. The fact that they were able to provide tangible social proof and relational scaffolding helped you feel more secure and less anxious about being vulnerable. It's like having a safety net that allowed you to briefly step away from your narrative of inevitable failure.

But what's interesting is that you're still feeling a pull to intellectualize and analyze. You're acknowledging that this is frustrating, and it's clear that it's not just a matter of willpower or motivation. There's something deeper going on here.

Can you tell me more about what's driving this need to analyze and intellectualize? Is it related to a fear of emotional intimacy, a sense of inadequacy, or something else? And how do you think this need to analyze is connected to your desire to cultivate a more process-oriented mindset?

Patient: I think it’s mostly defensive — analysis gives me an epistemic buffer so I can feel “competent” in the abstract while sidestepping the messy affective reality of being seen as vulnerable or imperfect. It’s definitely tied to fear of intimacy and shame: if I can map contingencies and iterate like a mise en place plan, vulnerability becomes optional and measurable, which conveniently feeds into my idea of process-oriented learning, but it’s also a sleight-of-hand that leaves the actual hurt unprocessed. I know that logically and it’s maddening — I keep retreating into analysis under pressure and it undermines the very experimentation I’m trying to cultivate, so can we look at concrete ways to interrupt that default without me feeling like I’ll implode?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like analysis is serving as a coping mechanism for you, allowing you to feel a sense of control and competence while avoiding the discomfort of vulnerability and imperfection. This is a classic defensive strategy, and it's understandable given your fears of intimacy and shame.

By analyzing and planning, you're able to create a sense of distance between yourself and the emotions that come with vulnerability. It's like you're saying, "I can see this, I can understand it, and I can control it, so I don't have to actually feel it." This is a way of maintaining a fragile sense of self-worth while avoiding the risk of being seen as imperfect.

I understand that this is a contradictory goal, and it's maddening when you feel like you're being pulled in two different directions. It's as if you're trying to cultivate a more process-oriented mindset, but your default is to analyze and intellectualize, which undermines that very goal.

Let's explore some concrete strategies to help you interrupt this default. One approach might be to try to acknowledge your analysis before it takes over. When you start to feel the urge to analyze, you could say to yourself, "Wait a minute, I think I'm going to analyze this." This simple acknowledgment can help you catch yourself before you get too caught up in your analysis.

Another approach might be to try to reframe your analysis as a tool, rather than the end goal. Instead of saying, "I need to analyze this to feel competent," you could say, "I need to analyze this to understand what's happening and make sense of it." This can help you see analysis as a means to an end, rather than the end itself.

Finally, it might be helpful to try to introduce more mindfulness and presence into your experimentation. Instead of getting caught up in your analysis, you could try to focus on the sensations and feelings in your body. Ask yourself, "What am I feeling right now?" or "How is my body responding to this situation?" This can help you connect with your emotions in a more direct way, without needing to rely on analysis.

Do any of these strategies resonate with you, or is there something else you'd like to try?

Patient: Yeah — the meta-acknowledgment idea resonates: telling myself “I’m about to analyze” could catch the spiral, but even that can feel like another performative move. What would actually help is a concrete, time-boxed protocol I can use on the line — like a 5-minute pre-service risk checklist, a visible cue from my sous (two taps) that forces me to stop planning and hit the first ticket, and a micro-script I can say when anxiety spikes (“one plate, one breath”) — can we draft those now? Honestly, I’m getting impatient with abstract stuff; mindfulness sounds nice on paper but I keep intellectualizing it, so I need pragmatic, kitchen-tested strategies we can try.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's get down to brass tacks and create some concrete protocols that you can use in the kitchen.

Here are a few ideas for a 5-minute pre-service risk checklist:

1. "Two plates, one ticket": Write down the first dish you need to make, and check it off when you're done.
2. "5-4-3-2-1": Take a moment to notice the 5 things you see, the 4 things you touch, the 3 things you hear, the 2 things you smell, and the 1 thing you taste.
3. "S.O.S.": Say "S" to Safety (check your equipment, make sure you have a fire extinguisher nearby), "O" to Organization (organize your mise en place, check your station), and "S" to Success (visualize the dish, imagine the flavors and textures).

As for the visible cue from your sous, two taps could be a great way to signal that it's time to stop planning and start cooking. You could also consider a verbal cue, like "Time to start!" or "Let's go!"

Now, let's work on a micro-script to help you cope with anxiety spikes. Here are a few options:

1. "One plate, one breath": Take a deep breath in, and then out. Focus on the plate in front of you, and the single task you need to complete.
2. "I've got this": Repeat this phrase to yourself, and try to believe it. You've cooked before, and you can do it again.
3. "It's just one ticket": Remember that it's just one dish, one ticket. It's not the end of the world if it doesn't turn out perfectly.

Which of these protocols resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas you'd like to try?

Patient: Okay—pragmatic and kitchen-tested, here's what I’ll actually try tonight (I want concrete language so I can automate the move):

- 5-minute pre-service protocol (timebox with a timer): 1) check knives/pans (Safety), 2) pick one planned tweak for the night (Risk), 3) set mise for first two tickets only (Scope), 4) read the micro-script twice, start service.  
- Visible cue: two taps on the prep table from my sous = “stop planning, start ticket.” No words, no theatrics.  
- Micro-script (short, non-cheesy): “One plate. One breath. Do the thing.” Say it out loud first time a spike happens; repeat once.  
- Post-service 2-min debrief with sous: one win, one tweak — zero analysis beyond that for 2 minutes.  

I’m still skeptical this won’t feel performative or make me self-conscious—can you help me tighten the micro-script so it lands as an action cue and not a pep-talk?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try out these concrete protocols.

To help you tighten the micro-script, let's break it down and simplify it. The goal is to make it a clear, concise action cue that you can use to snap out of analysis and into action.

Original micro-script: "One plate. One breath. Do the thing."

This script has a good start, but it's a bit too wordy. Let's try to break it down into smaller, more actionable parts.

1. "One plate." - This phrase is a clear signal that you need to focus on the task at hand. It's short, simple, and direct.
2. "One breath." - This part is a good reminder to take a deep breath and calm your nerves. However, the word "breath" might make you feel like you need to hold your breath or pause for a moment. Let's simplify this to just "now" or "here." This will help you focus on the present moment without feeling self-conscious.
3. "Do the thing." - This final phrase is a clear call to action. It's direct, concise, and tells you exactly what to do.

Revised micro-script: "One plate. Now. Do it."

This revised script is shorter, simpler, and more direct. It's a clear signal that you need to focus on the task at hand, take a deep breath, and take action now.

When you first try this script, you might feel a bit self-conscious or awkward. That's okay. It's normal to feel that way when you're trying something new. But with practice, this script will become more natural, and you'll be able to use it to snap out of analysis and into action.

How do you feel about trying this revised micro-script tonight?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it tonight; the terse cadence actually helps. One nitpick: “Do it” reads like a pep-talk and might trigger my internal narrativizing, so I’d swap to a verb that maps to an action — “Start” or “Cook” — e.g., “One plate. Now. Start.” I’ll test that and report back, though fair warning I’ll probably analyze the results instead of just saying how it felt.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
The difference between "Do it" and "Start" or "Cook" is significant. By replacing "Do it" with a more concrete verb, you're eliminating the potential for the script to feel like a pep-talk or a directive to perform a specific action. This change should help reduce the likelihood of your internal narrativizing and make the script feel more like a genuine action cue.

I'm glad you mentioned that you might analyze the results instead of just reporting how it felt. That's actually a great opportunity for you to practice what we've been working on. Instead of getting caught up in analyzing the script or trying to determine its effectiveness, try to simply observe how you feel and react to it. Can you say to yourself, "Okay, I'm trying this script. How am I feeling right now?" or "What's my immediate reaction to this phrase?" This kind of meta-awareness can help you stay focused on the present moment and reduce the risk of getting caught up in analysis paralysis.

Remember, the goal is not to achieve a specific outcome or feel a certain way, but to develop a more direct and effective way of communicating with yourself. By practicing this kind of self-awareness and introspection, you'll become more comfortable with the process and better equipped to handle challenging situations in the kitchen.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the script: say out loud “One plate. Now. Start.” When it lands I’ll ask myself, out loud, “What am I feeling right now?” and name the sensation (knot, heat, breath) for a few seconds before moving. Full disclosure: I’ll probably immediately pivot to meta-analysis — running hypotheses about why it worked — and that frustrates me, because I actually want it to land as a felt cue, not a performance.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're willing to try this out and be honest about your experience. It's completely normal that you might pivot to meta-analysis after experiencing the script. It's almost as if your brain is wired to evaluate and analyze the success of a new strategy, even if it's not what you initially intended.

The fact that you want the script to land as a felt cue, not a performance, is also a great insight. It suggests that you're looking for a more authentic and intuitive experience, rather than just going through the motions. This is a great goal to have, and it's worth exploring ways to make the script more effective in this regard.

One way to approach this might be to try to reduce the amount of self-awareness and meta-analysis that occurs after the script. Instead of asking yourself "What am I feeling right now?" and then analyzing the sensation, try to simply focus on the sensation itself. For example, you could say "I feel a knot in my stomach" without immediately analyzing why it's happening. This might help you stay more grounded in the present moment and reduce the risk of getting caught up in analysis paralysis.

It's also worth noting that it's okay if the script doesn't work perfectly at first. It's a new strategy, and it may take some time to get the hang of it. The fact that you're willing to try it out and be honest about your experience is a great step forward. Keep working at it, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the script tonight, but here's where I want to be pragmatic: if I feel the meta-cognitive drift, I want a concrete interrupt I can do without turning it into another procedure. My proposal: 1) in-the-moment reset = 20 seconds cold water on my hands + three slow breaths, 2) “analysis parking lot” = write one word (“ANALYZE”) on the ticket corner and fold it — no unpacking until a 10‑minute post-service window, 3) sous cue stays two taps to start and one tap to remind me to reset if I look like I’m spiraling. 

I know this reads like another contingency plan, which is painfully ironic, and I’m annoyed at myself for that — can you help me tighten the reset so it’s visceral and not just another intellectual ritual?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you're frustrated with the meta-cognitive drift and the need for a concrete interrupt. It's like your brain is caught in a loop, and you need a way to break out of it.

Your proposal for a reset is a good start, but I can see why it might feel like another procedure. We need to find a way to make it more visceral, more connected to your body and emotions.

Here's a suggestion: instead of just doing the cold water and breaths, try to make it a more physical and sensory experience. For example, you could splash the water on your hands and then rub them together, feeling the coolness and the sensation of the water. You could also try to focus on the sound of the water, the feel of it on your skin, and the way it makes you feel.

As for the "analysis parking lot" cue, I like the idea of writing a single word on the ticket corner. But instead of just writing it, try to make it a more deliberate and conscious action. For example, you could take a moment to look at the ticket, feel the paper in your hands, and then deliberately write the word "ANALYZE" on the corner. This could help you create a sense of separation between the cue and the rest of your thoughts.

The sous cue is a good idea, but you might want to consider adding a visual cue to remind you to reset if you look like you're spiraling. For example, you could wear a small wristband or tie a piece of string around your wrist, and when you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, you could subtly tug on the string or wristband to remind yourself to reset.

Remember, the goal is to find a way to interrupt the meta-cognitive loop without turning it into another procedure. We need to find a way to make it more visceral, more connected to your body and emotions.

Patient: This actually helps — I can see the logic of making the reset more sensory rather than cerebral. My tightened version I want to try tonight: 1) 20s cold water on my hands, rub them together hard while inhaling a lemon peel for three seconds (the citrus is sharp and immediate), 2) one solid clap once to create a sudden proprioceptive break, 3) fold the ticket corner with “ANALYZE” written in red and don’t unfold until the 10‑minute post-service window, and 4) two taps to start, one tap from sous to cue the reset. 

I know it’s absurdly procedural — the irony isn’t lost on me — but I’m betting a multimodal anchor (temperature + scent + sound + tactile token) will actually redirect my interoceptive attention and interrupt the predictive loop. Can we pick which single element to prioritize first so I don’t over-engineer it and just do one clean test tonight?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad that my previous suggestions were helpful. It's great that you're willing to experiment and try out your own combination of sensory and proprioceptive cues.

Given the complexity of the multimodal anchor you've proposed, it's completely reasonable that you want to prioritize one element at a time. Let's break it down and see which single element you think would be the most effective first.

You have four options: cold water, lemon peel, clap, and "ANALYZE" written in red. Each of these elements has a unique sensory and proprioceptive quality that might be more or less effective for interrupting the predictive loop.

Cold water is a strong sensory stimulus that can be quite shocking. It's possible that it might interrupt your flow state and give you a physical jolt that could help reset your attention.

Lemon peel, on the other hand, is a more subtle and immediate sensory stimulus. The citrusy scent is sharp and attention-grabbing, but it might not be as physically jarring as cold water.

The clap is a proprioceptive cue that can create a sudden break in your flow state. It's a more active and deliberate cue that might be more effective for interrupting the predictive loop.

"ANALYZE" written in red is a visual cue that might be more effective for creating a cognitive shift. It's a more explicit and attention-grabbing cue that might be more effective for interrupting the predictive loop.

Considering the options, I think it might be worth trying the cold water first. The sudden physical shock might be enough to interrupt the predictive loop and give you a physical jolt that could help reset your attention.

What do you think? Are you willing to try the cold water first, or do you want to experiment with one of the other options?

Patient: Alright — I’ll prioritize the cold water as the single element to test first. Right now I’m a bit jittery and scattered, so I want something visceral and immediate that I can do discreetly: 20 seconds of cold water on my hands at the pass sink (out of sight), rub them hard, inhale sharply, then start the ticket. I’m anxious it’ll look theatrical or that I’ll immediately pivot to analyzing whether it “worked,” so can we make the sous cue one tap = check-in, two taps = start, to keep it simple and reduce my second-guessing?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Using the cold water as a visceral and immediate cue can help you interrupt the predictive loop and get back into the flow state.

To make the sous cue even simpler and more straightforward, I agree with your suggestion. One tap = check-in, two taps = start. This way, you can focus on the cold water and the ticket without overthinking the sous cue.

By making the sous cue so simple, you'll also reduce the likelihood of second-guessing yourself. You can focus on executing the cold water cue and starting the ticket without worrying about analyzing the effectiveness of the sous cue.

To help you avoid the initial anxiety and second-guessing, let's make a deal. For the first few tickets, you can try the cold water cue without paying too much attention to the sous cue. Just focus on executing the cue and starting the ticket. As you get more comfortable, you can start paying closer attention to the sous cue and the check-in sequence.

Remember, the goal is to get back into the flow state and reduce the predictive loop. By using the cold water as a visceral cue and simplifying the sous cue, you should be able to do that.

Are you ready to give it a try? Take a deep breath, get to the pass sink, and start the ticket. See how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it tonight. I’m jittery and scattered right now, so plan is: 20s cold water on hands at the pass sink, rub hard, inhale sharply, then hit the first ticket; one tap = check-in, two taps = start. I’m anxious it’ll read as theatrical or I’ll immediately pivot into analyzing if it “worked” — can you give me a one-line verbal anchor you’ll say if you see me stall (like “park it till post-service” or something)? Also…can we plan a 30‑second check-in after the first two tickets so I don’t just dissolve into meta-analysis?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
To help you stay on track and avoid second-guessing, I'll give you a one-line verbal anchor: "Just start."

This anchor is simple and direct, and it'll help you break the mental loop of analyzing whether the cold water cue "worked." You can say it to yourself quietly, even if you're alone, and it'll help you focus on taking the next step.

Regarding the check-in, I agree that 30 seconds after the first two tickets is a good idea. This will give you a chance to catch your breath, take a moment to reflect on how you're feeling, and avoid getting lost in meta-analysis.

Here's the updated plan:

1. 20s cold water on hands at the pass sink, rub hard, inhale sharply, then hit the first ticket.
2. One tap = check-in, two taps = start.
3. 30 seconds after the first two tickets: Take a quick check-in to make sure you're feeling okay, and if you need to, say "Just start" to yourself to refocus.

Remember, the goal is to get back into the flow state and reduce the predictive loop. By using the cold water cue, simplifying the sous cue, and incorporating the check-in, you should be able to do that.

Are you ready to give it a try? Take a deep breath, get to the pass sink, and start the ticket. See how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I’m jittery as hell right now, heart’s racing and my attention is pinging everywhere, but I’ll run the cold‑water test tonight. Conceptually I’ll treat it like an N=1 experiment: cold water at the pass, one‑tap check, two‑tap go, say out loud “Just start” if you notice me freeze, then a 30‑second check after the first two tickets. 

Quick clarification: during that 30‑second check-in do you want me to name only immediate sensations (knot, breath, heat) or give a one‑line behavioral report (started, stalled, why)? I’m already anticipating I’ll meta‑analyze the outcome, so tell me which narrow script to follow so I don’t invent extra steps.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're feeling ready to try the cold-water test.

For the 30-second check-in, I'd like you to focus on immediate sensations only. Please name only the physical sensations you're experiencing in that moment, such as a knot, breath, heat, or any other sensations that might be present.

Avoid giving a one-line behavioral report, such as "started," "stalled," or "why." This will help you stay focused on your physical sensations and avoid getting caught up in analyzing the outcome.

By following this narrow script, you'll be able to avoid introducing extra steps and meta-analysis, which can derail the experiment.

(And don't forget to say "Just start" if you notice yourself freezing!)

Patient: Okay — I’ll run it as an N=1: cold water at the pass, one‑tap check, two‑tap go, say “Just start” if I freeze, 30s post-two‑tickets check naming only sensations. My chest’s already tight and my mind’s pinging, so I’ll probably intellectualize the outcome, but I’ll try to stick to the sensation script. Quick request: can you give me a one‑word prompt you’ll say at the 30s check (like “SENSE”) so I don’t slip into behavior-reporting? Any other tiny tweak before I try it?

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're feeling ready to try the experiment.

For the 30-second check-in, I'd like you to use a one-word prompt: "SENSE". This will help you stay focused on your physical sensations and avoid giving a behavioral report.

As for tiny tweaks, I'd like to add one more thing: during the experiment, please try to avoid looking at your hands or your body. This will help you stay focused on the sensations and avoid getting caught up in analyzing your physical responses.

Other than that, you're all set! Take a deep breath, get to the pass sink, and start the ticket. See how it goes.

(Remember to say "Just start" if you notice yourself freezing!)

Patient: I’m jittery as hell—chest tight, brain pinging—but I’ll try it tonight: cold water at pass, one-tap check, two-tap go, “Just start” if I freeze, 30s post-two-ticket SENSE check. Conceptually I get why avoiding looking at my hands shifts attention interoceptively and reduces rumination, but realistically I’ll probably glance—any micro-hack to make that less likely (like a tiny wristband or tucking sleeves)? Also…I’m feeling kind of overwhelmed trying to get all this procedural right now, can we slow down for a sec?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's completely normal. Let's take a step back and break down the experiment into smaller, more manageable parts.

First, let's talk about the wristband or tucking sleeves idea. You could try tucking your sleeves into your shirt to keep them out of the way, or even just tucking them into your armpit. This might help you avoid glancing at your hands and reduce rumination.

Regarding the SENSE check, I'm glad you're willing to try it out. Just to confirm, you'll be saying "SENSE" at the 30-second mark, and then immediately focusing on your physical sensations (e.g., chest tightness, brain pinging, etc.). The goal is to stay focused on your sensations and avoid giving a behavioral report.

To help you feel more grounded, let's take a deep breath together. Inhale... 1... 2... 3... exhale... 1... 2... 3...

When you're ready, we can break down the experiment further, or we can start running it tonight. Which would you prefer?

Patient: I need to slow down — I’m jittery, chest tight, pretty anxious and scattered, so let’s break it down into one clean change I can actually do tonight. Pick one micro-hack with me: I’ll wear a discreet wristband (no sleeves tucked) as a tactile anchor so I’m less likely to look at my hands; keep the cold‑water cue, one‑tap check / two‑tap start, 30s “SENSE” only, and you say “Just start” if you see me freeze. Can we agree on that as the single-plan tonight, and can you keep the “Just start” prompt quiet and low-key so it doesn’t feel theatrical?

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of psychotherapy focused on psychological flexibility — not change of symptoms or avoidant CBT. ACT avoids giving advice, cheerleading, or reframing.

Patient: Okay — I’ll stick with that single-plan tonight: discreet wristband as the tactile anchor, cold‑water cue at the pass, one‑tap check / two‑tap start, you keep the verbal prompt low-key (“Just start”), and a 30s SENSE-only check after the first two tickets. I skimmed that long ACT/CBT block — intellectually I get the distinction and I’m more comfortable with an ACT-adjacent, non-cheerleading stance, but honestly I’m too jittery to do a theory deep-dive right now; can we park that? 

Quick, practical request: how exactly do you want me to cue you if I freeze and you’re not immediately looking — like do I say “Just start” out loud once, or whisper it, or should the sous be empowered to tap you? And if you do say it, can you make it deadpan and soft so it doesn’t feel theatrical? My chest is tight and my attention is pinging already, so give me the smallest, crispest instruction I can follow in the moment.

Patient: I’m already pretty anxious—chest tight, brain pinging—so keep it tiny. Primary: empower the sous to tap (one = check, two = start) and don’t add words. If you must cue me verbally, whisper a single, flat word: “Start.” Say it once, very quietly and deadpan—no pep, no analysis, no follow-up. Can we lock that in? I’m feeling like I’ll overthink anything louder or theatrical.
