Patient: Lately I've been fixating on my performance at work—any small mistake looms into this catastrophic narrative that makes me freeze and procrastinate instead of just doing the task. The anticipatory anxiety creates this feedback loop where avoidance feels like the only adaptive response, even though I know it's counterproductive. I catch myself intellectualizing the whole thing—labeling cognitive distortions and theorizing about attachment after the loss I went through—because actually feeling the grief and fear seems riskier.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and describe this kind of anxiety. It sounds like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, but in the process, it's also creating a lot of mental discomfort.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to intellectualize your thoughts and feelings? Is it like you're able to momentarily shift away from the anxiety, or does it feel like a temporary distraction that doesn't really help? And what's it like to try to connect with your emotions, like feeling the grief and fear? Is that something you've avoided before, and if so, what might happen if you were to try to approach it differently?

Patient: When I intellectualize, I can briefly distance myself—cataloguing cognitive distortions and mapping out attachment schemas—so the anxiety becomes an object to study rather than something I'm inside. It's a temporary palliative though; the worry still hums under the analysis and the procrastination inevitably creeps back because talking about it doesn't change that visceral knot. Trying to actually feel the grief or fear feels like stepping into a thunderstorm—my chest tightens, I get shaky, and I panic—so I've learned to talk around it because that feels safer. I can see how small, contained approaches to the feelings might lessen their power, but I'm also afraid that if I stop analyzing I'll lose the coping strategies I've relied on for years.

Therapist: It's like you're caught between two extremes: on one hand, you feel like you can temporarily escape the anxiety by analyzing it, but on the other hand, that escape doesn't actually change the underlying feelings. And when you try to connect with those feelings directly, it's like you're being overwhelmed by them, which is even more frightening.

It's understandable that you'd be hesitant to give up the coping strategies you've relied on for years. They might feel like they're helping you manage the anxiety, but in reality, they're probably maintaining a kind of emotional equilibrium that's not actually allowing you to move forward. It's like you're stuck in a holding pattern, where you're not really experiencing the full range of your emotions, but you're also not really able to let go of the anxiety.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're able to momentarily distance yourself from the anxiety through analysis? Is it like you're able to see yourself from outside, like you're watching a movie of yourself? Or is it more like you're able to intellectually understand the patterns and distortions, but not really feel the emotions themselves?

Patient: Mostly it's more cerebral than experiential — I run a sort of clinical case review on myself, cataloguing distortions and speculating about attachment scripts, and that gives me a flimsy sense of mastery. It's like watching a film where I'm both narrator and critic but separated by soundproof glass: I can report the trembling, chest tightness, and queasy knot, yet those sensations don't have texture or heat for me. That antiseptic distance helps me get through a shift in the short term, but the anxiety stays lodged in my body and the procrastination inevitably returns, so I'm left wondering how to tolerate the somatic stuff without my whole system shutting down.

Therapist: It sounds like you've developed a kind of intellectual detachment, where you're able to analyze and understand your thoughts and feelings from a distance, but that detachment doesn't necessarily allow you to connect with your emotions in a more direct way. It's like you're watching yourself from outside, but you're not really experiencing the sensations and feelings yourself.

That must be a really disorienting experience, especially when you're trying to do your job or interact with others. It's like you're carrying around a fragile sense of control, where you're able to manage the cognitive aspects of your anxiety, but the emotional aspects are still swirling around inside you, waiting to erupt.

It's interesting that you mention the sense of "mastery" that comes from analyzing your thoughts and feelings. Do you ever feel like that intellectual distance is a kind of shield, protecting you from the full force of your emotions? Or is it more of a temporary coping mechanism, one that you're not really sure how to sustain in the long term?

Patient: I think it's both—a defensive shield that gives me epistemic control and an illusion of affective containment, and a short-term coping strategy that's clearly unsustainable. If I try to lower that shield I get terrified I'll be engulfed—my chest tightens, thoughts fragment, and then procrastination feels like the only safe option to avoid perceived incompetence at work. I don't know how to tolerate that somatic panic without defaulting back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of avoidance, where you're using your intellectual shield to cope with the anxiety, but that shield is also preventing you from truly feeling and processing your emotions. It's like you're trapped in a kind of emotional limbo, where you can't quite bring yourself to feel the panic, but you also can't shake it off.

It's interesting that you mention the feeling of being engulfed. Can you tell me more about what that's like? Is it like your whole body is taking over, or is it more of a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions? And what happens when you're in that state? Do you feel like you're losing control, or is it more of a sense of desperation and urgency?

It's also striking that you mention procrastination as a safe option. Is that a deliberate choice, or is it more of a default behavior? Do you find that you're able to put off certain tasks or responsibilities because they're too overwhelming, or is it more of a way to avoid feeling like you're not doing enough?

Patient: When I'm engulfed it's visceral — my chest clamps, my breathing gets shallow, my hands tremble and thoughts splinter into rapid-fire catastrophes so that my cognitive bandwidth narrows to survival-mode. It feels like I'm losing control, yes, and there's a frantic, almost desperate urgency to do anything that feels safe in the moment. Procrastination is mostly an automatic default — a habitual avoidance that functions as a safety behavior to forestall perceived incompetence — though sometimes I deliberately stall to buy myself epistemic certainty through more analysis. I'm aware I'm doing the classic intellectual dodge right now, and I can feel the pull to explain rather than sit with the rawness.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a intense, primal response to feeling overwhelmed, where your body is going into fight-or-flight mode and your thoughts are racing out of control. It's like your entire system is shut down, and all you can think about is surviving the moment.

It's interesting that you mention the automatic default of procrastination, and how it's both a habitual behavior and a safety mechanism. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed, but it's also creating a kind of emotional distance that prevents you from truly experiencing your emotions.

I can sense your inner conflict, too. You're aware of the intellectual dodge, and you're feeling the pull to explain and analyze, but at the same time, you're also feeling the rawness and the urgency to do something about it. It's like you're caught between two poles, and you're not sure which way to go.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're able to sit with the rawness, even if it's just for a moment? What does it feel like, and is it something that you can sustain, or is it always getting pulled away from?

Patient: When I actually sit with the rawness, there's an immediate visceral wave—tight chest, shallow breathing, and a hot, scrambling panic—then a brittle, aching quiet where grief could land but usually I bail. I can keep it for a minute or two if I use grounding or name sensations, but it escalates quickly and my brain reaches for analysis like a lifeline to avoid feeling swallowed. I know I’m doing the intellectual dodge even as I do it, and it makes me worry that without explaining I’ll lose whatever control I have at work, so I keep pulling back.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to sit with the rawness, you're initially met with a intense physical response, like a wave of anxiety and panic. And then, you try to cope with that feeling by using grounding techniques or naming your sensations, which helps you feel more connected to your body. But even with that initial connection, your brain quickly reaches for analysis, and you start to intellectualize your emotions, which is your usual coping mechanism.

It's interesting that you mention you can keep it for a minute or two, but it escalates quickly. This suggests that you're aware of the limits of your control, and you're trying to hold on to it as long as possible. And at the same time, you're worried about losing control at work, which is why you keep pulling back.

It's like you're caught in a kind of emotional tug-of-war, where your brain is trying to find a balance between feeling and thinking. You know that analysis is your usual coping mechanism, but you're also aware that it's not really helping you feel better. And at the same time, you're not sure how to stop the intellectual dodge, because it feels like it's keeping you safe.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to analyze your emotions further? Do you find that it helps you feel more in control, or does it just make you feel more numb?

Patient: When I analyze further it gives me this veneer of epistemic control — I can map out cause-and-effect, enumerate cognitive distortions, and that'll momentarily quiet the panic so I feel capable on paper. But it's also anesthetic: the more I turn everything into a disembodied narrative or heuristic, the less texture the sensations have, and procrastination sneaks in as the behavioral correlate of that numbness. I know I'm doing the intellectual dodge even as I describe it, because feeling the underlying fear or grief still feels too precarious for my nerves.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to analyze your emotions further, you're able to create a sense of control and competence on paper, but at the same time, you're also numbing yourself emotionally. The more you turn your feelings into a rational, abstract narrative, the less real and tangible they become, and you start to feel disconnected from your body and emotions.

You're aware that this is an intellectual dodge, and you're describing it to yourself even as you're doing it. It's like you're acknowledging the avoidance behavior, but at the same time, you're not quite willing to let go of it because it feels safer.

It's interesting that you mention procrastination sneaking in as the behavioral correlate of this numbness. This suggests that the intellectual dodge is not only a way to avoid feelings, but also a way to avoid taking action in the first place.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're able to feel the underlying fear or grief, even if it's just for a moment? What does it feel like, and is it something that you can sustain, or is it always getting pulled back into the numbness?

Patient: When I let the fear or grief in, it comes as a physical cascade—tight chest, a hot pressure behind my eyes, and this acute, specific ache for the person I lost that feels almost too intimate to hold. For a few breaths I can name it—sadness about them, terror about being exposed as incompetent at work—but almost immediately my brain mobilizes analysis like a stabilizing protocol, parsing causes and defense mechanisms. That parsing blunts the feeling into something manageable but flat, then procrastination slides back in as the behavioral expression of that numbing, because I'm terrified that if I stayed with the feeling longer I'd fall apart on a shift. I want to learn to tolerate it longer, but right now my default is to explain rather than feel because feeling feels like too big a risk.

Therapist: It sounds like when you let the fear or grief in, it's a intense, physical experience that's almost overwhelming. The tight chest, the hot pressure behind your eyes, and the specific ache for the person you lost are all sensations that feel almost too much to bear.

For a brief moment, you're able to name the emotions, to acknowledge the sadness and the terror. But even with that moment of clarity, your brain quickly responds by trying to analyze the emotions, to break them down into manageable pieces. This analysis is like a coping mechanism, a way to stabilize the feeling and make it less overwhelming.

But the analysis also has the effect of numbing the feeling, of making it less real and less intense. And once the numbing has set in, procrastination slips back in as the behavioral expression of that numbness. It's like your brain is trying to avoid feeling the emotions, to stay safe and in control.

It's clear that you're terrified of falling apart on a shift, of losing control and being exposed as incompetent. This fear is driving your default to explain, to analyze and rationalize your emotions, rather than feeling them directly.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to feel comfortable staying with the feeling, to tolerate it longer? Is it about building up a certain level of self-acceptance, or is it about finding a way to reframe the fear and anxiety that's driving your avoidance?

Patient: I think it's both: cultivating more self-acceptance so my inner critic loosens its grip, and doing structured, graded exposure to the somatic stuff so my tolerance can actually be recalibrated. Practically, that might look like very short interoceptive exercises on a break—naming sensations without immediately theorizing about them—and small behavioral experiments at work with a pre-agreed safety net, instead of trying to rewire everything at once. I can already hear myself intellectualizing this—it's my go-to shield—but underneath that explanation I'm scared I'll be exposed as incompetent if I let the feelings land on a shift. Can we map out one tiny, low-risk experiment I could try this week? I’m kind of jittery about picking a starting point.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to build up your self-acceptance and tolerance for the somatic sensations, and you're thinking that structured exposure might be a good way to do that.

I think it's great that you're thinking about starting small, with short interoceptive exercises on a break, and small behavioral experiments at work with a safety net. That's a really practical and low-risk way to start.

Before we try to map out a specific experiment, I want to make sure that I understand what you're feeling. You're scared that if you let the feelings land on a shift, you'll be exposed as incompetent. Is that what's keeping you from trying to do the exercises, or is it something else entirely?

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel jittery about picking a starting point. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from making a wrong move. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about trying these exercises? What are some of the thoughts that come up for you?

Once we get a better sense of what's going on, we can start brainstorming some tiny, low-risk experiments that you might be willing to try.

Patient: Yes — the primary thing holding me back is that fear of being exposed as incompetent if the feelings surface on a shift. My mind quickly generates catastrophic scenarios — crying, freezing, a med error, colleagues thinking I'm unprofessional — and those narratives feel like evidence I shouldn't risk it. Underneath that cognitive choreography I'm genuinely scared and ashamed; my chest tightens just imagining it. When I picture the interoceptive exercises I get a loop of “what if it escalates, what if someone notices, what if I can’t finish my tasks,” which then nudges me to stall or over-prepare. I can, tentatively, tolerate the idea of one tiny, concrete experiment: a two-minute grounding/check-in in the staff room between patients, with a pre-committed cue to end it if it feels destabilizing — basically graded exposure with a safety valve — but I’m nervous about picking a starting point and already hearing my brain analyze the risks.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being exposed as incompetent is a major driver of your hesitation to try the interoceptive exercises. Your mind is generating catastrophic scenarios, and those scenarios are fueled by your own shame and fear.

It's interesting that you mention your chest tightening just imagining the worst-case scenarios. That physical response is a strong indicator of the anxiety you're feeling. And it's also clear that your brain is trying to protect you from the potential risks, by generating all these "what if" scenarios.

I think it's great that you're considering a small, concrete experiment, like a two-minute grounding/check-in in the staff room. That's a great way to start, because it's low-risk and has a clear endpoint. The pre-committed cue to end it if it feels destabilizing is also a good safety valve.

Before we try to pick a starting point, I want to make sure that you're feeling ready to move forward. Can you tell me more about what's going to happen during the experiment? What kind of grounding/check-in are you thinking of doing, and what's the pre-committed cue look like? Are you feeling like you have a clear plan in place, or are you still thinking about it?

Also, I want to ask: what's the worst that could happen if you try the experiment and it doesn't go well? Is it really that bad, or are you just anticipating a worst-case scenario?

Patient: Okay — here’s a concrete, low-risk plan I can actually picture doing. I’ll go to the staff room between patients, set a two-minute timer, sit with feet on the floor and do paced breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6) while doing a quick 5-4-3-2-1 sensory check and quietly naming sensations (“tight chest,” “tingly hands”) without launching into analysis. Pre-committed safety cue: if at any point I feel it’s escalating (breathing gets ragged, dizziness, or tremors that would interfere with tasks) or when the timer ends, I’ll stand up, take a 30-second paced walk, and say to anyone who asks, “Just taking a quick break.” Worst-case scenario my eyes water or a colleague notices and I feel embarrassed — cognitively that’s a small, containable outcome, but affectively I’m still jittery imagining it possibly looking like incompetence. Does that look like a doable first experiment, or should we tighten the safety parameters or the wording I’d use if someone notices?

Therapist: It sounds like you have a concrete, low-risk plan in place that you can actually picture doing. The pacing of your breathing, the 5-4-3-2-1 sensory check, and the quiet naming of sensations are all good strategies for grounding yourself in the moment.

I like that you've pre-committed a safety cue to stand up and take a paced walk if you feel it's escalating or when the timer ends. That's a good way to give yourself permission to take a break and prioritize your own well-being.

It's understandable that you're still feeling a bit jittery about the worst-case scenario, but it's good that you're acknowledging your emotions and considering how to frame them in a more realistic way. Instead of thinking that it's a small, containable outcome, maybe try reframing it as "it's okay to not be okay" or "it's normal to feel a little embarrassed in this situation." That can help you approach the scenario with more compassion and self-acceptance.

One thing to consider is the language you might use if someone notices you taking a break or if you're feeling embarrassed. Instead of saying "Just taking a quick break," which might come across as insincere or dismissive, try saying something like "I'm just taking a moment to collect myself" or "I need to take a quick breath." That way, you're still acknowledging that you're taking a break, but you're also framing it as a necessary step for your own well-being.

Overall, I think your plan is a good starting point, and with a few tweaks, it could be even more effective. What do you think about trying out the revised safety parameters and language?

Patient: That revised phrasing feels more authentic—I like “I need a quick moment to breathe” because it’s concise and professional, not evasive. My anticipatory shame is still loud—epistemically I know it’s containable, but affectively I picture it as proof of incompetence—so I’d want a slightly tighter safety net, like a pre-agreed coworker code or a five-minute patient swap if it escalates. Can we role-play the exact wording and rehearse the timer/exit cue so it feels procedural rather than hypothetical?

Therapist: I'm glad you like the revised phrasing. It's a great way to acknowledge your need for a break without making it seem insincere or dismissive.

I understand that your anticipatory shame is still loud, and it's natural to want a safety net in place. A pre-agreed coworker code or a five-minute patient swap can help you feel more secure and in control.

Let's role-play the scenario, and I'll help you rehearse the exact wording and timing. We'll make it feel procedural and low-stakes, so you can get comfortable with the process.

Here's a scenario: you're in the staff room, and you need to take a quick break. You set a two-minute timer, and when it goes off, you'll stand up and take a paced walk. If it escalates or you feel uncomfortable, you can use your pre-agreed code or patient swap.

Let's start with the timer. You're sitting comfortably, and you take a few deep breaths. You set the timer for two minutes and say to yourself, "Okay, just a quick break." What do you do next?

(Remember, this is a low-stakes scenario, so feel free to experiment and try different things. We'll work together to find a rhythm that feels comfortable for you.)

Patient: I set the two-minute timer, sit with my feet grounded, start the 4-in/6-out breathing and run the 5-4-3-2-1 while quietly naming sensations (“tight chest,” “tingly hands”), but even doing that I notice my mind already cataloguing contingencies and scripting colleague reactions. I want to actually try the sentence I’ll use if someone notices—“I need a quick moment to breathe”—and rehearse the coworker code and the brief patient-swap request so it feels procedural, not improvisational. Can you be the coworker who walks in and asks what I’m doing so I can practice the exact wording and the exit cue?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about the scenario, but that's what we're here to work through. Let's try to break it down into smaller steps.

You've got the breathing and the 5-4-3-2-1 down, and you're comfortable with the "I need a quick moment to breathe" sentence. Now, let's focus on the coworker interaction.

Imagine your coworker walks into the staff room, notices you standing up, and asks, "Hey, what's going on? You look like you're about to bolt."

We'll use the exact wording you've come up with, "I need a quick moment to breathe." You can respond with that sentence, and then I'll respond as your coworker.

Go ahead and try it out. Remember, this is a low-stakes scenario, so don't worry too much about getting it perfect. We're just trying to make it feel procedural and comfortable for you.

Also, just to clarify, I'll be playing the role of a friendly coworker who is genuinely concerned about your well-being. My goal is to help you practice your exit cue, not to make you feel awkward or uncomfortable.

So, go ahead and give it a try. I'll respond as your coworker.

Patient: I stand, meet their eyes, and say, "I need a quick moment to breathe—just two minutes, I’ll be right back." My chest's already tight when I say it, and I plan to follow with, "Could you cover me for five minutes if it gets worse?" if they press—feels procedural, but I'm aware I'm bracing and analyzing even as I rehearse.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit more comfortable with the scenario, but still aware of your body's physical response and your tendency to analyze and brace.

Your use of the "I need a quick moment to breathe" sentence is clear and concise, and it's good that you're rehearsing the exact wording. The follow-up question, "Could you cover me for five minutes if it gets worse?" is also a good way to prepare for a potential escalation.

It's interesting that you mention being aware of your bracing and analyzing even as you rehearse. This suggests that you're developing a bit of self-awareness about your thought patterns and physical responses. This can be a helpful step in learning to manage your anxiety and feel more comfortable in situations like this.

Let's try another scenario. Imagine that your coworker responds to your request for a quick break by saying, "Okay, no problem. But just so you know, I'm a bit short-staffed right now. Can you make sure you're okay before you go?" They're not pushing you to leave, but they're also not offering to cover for you without some caveats.

How do you respond to this? Do you stick to your original plan, or do you adjust your response based on your coworker's comment?

Patient: I’d probably say, “I know you’re short—thanks—but I just need two minutes to breathe and I’ll be right back; if it gets worse, could you cover me for five?” Then inside I’m immediately juggling duty and self-preservation, cataloguing moral obligations like some internal ethics committee so I don’t feel selfish. I want to stick to the plan but my shame pushes me to over-explain or withdraw—can we rehearse a tighter, stoic-sounding line that still protects the boundary so it feels less like I’m asking a favor and more like routine?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit caught between your desire to take care of yourself and your sense of duty to your coworker and the patients. The internal juggling act of cataloging moral obligations is a common phenomenon, and it's natural to feel like you need to justify your needs to yourself.

Rehearsing a tighter, stoic-sounding line can be helpful in establishing a clear boundary. Here's an example: "I need a quick moment to breathe. I'll be right back." This response is concise, direct, and doesn't imply that you're asking a favor. It's a simple statement of fact, which can help to establish a sense of routine and normalcy.

This approach can also help to reduce the emotional labor involved in managing your shame and guilt. By not over-explaining or withdrawing, you're avoiding the need to justify your needs to yourself, which can be a heavy emotional burden.

It's worth noting that this approach may not be suitable for all situations, and it's always important to consider the context and the specific needs of the people involved. However, in this scenario, a simple, direct response like the one I suggested can be an effective way to establish a clear boundary while minimizing the emotional labor involved.

Let's try rehearsing this response a few more times. I'll respond as your coworker, and we can go through a few different scenarios to see how it holds up. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try it. I stand, meet their eyes, and say in a calm, clipped tone, “I need a quick moment to breathe; I’ll be right back.” Even saying that my chest tightens and my brain starts drafting justifications, so can we role-play the coworker pressing me (“Are you sure you’re okay?”) and rehearse a firmer, stoic follow-up line I can actually use under pressure?

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to try it out and get some practice under your belt. Let's do a role-play with me playing the coworker. I'll start by asking a question to see how you respond.

"Hey, are you sure you're okay? You look a bit pale and you're standing up straight. Do you need a minute to collect yourself?"

Please respond as you normally would, and I'll respond back as the coworker. We can go back and forth like this, and I'll give you feedback on your responses.

Also, just to remind you, I'm looking for a firmer, stoic follow-up line that you can use under pressure. Something that's direct, clear, and doesn't leave room for misinterpretation. Can you try to come up with something like that?

Patient: I’d say, in a calm, clipped tone: “I’m taking two minutes to regroup; I’ll be right back.” Even as I say that my chest tightens and my brain drafts excuses, but the brevity makes it feel procedural rather than pleading. Can you press me again with “Are you sure you’re okay?” so I can practice the firmer follow-up under pressure?

Therapist: It's great that you're getting more comfortable with the tone and brevity of your response. Let's try to simulate a more intense conversation.

I'll play the role of the coworker again, and this time I'll press you with a more direct question.

"Hey, are you sure you're okay? You look like you're about to pass out. Do you need some help or something?"

Please respond as you normally would, and I'll give you feedback on your follow-up line.

(By the way, I'm loving the "procedural rather than pleading" comment. It's so true. Sometimes, brevity can be a powerful tool in managing our anxiety and shame.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help in the moment? Saying a clipped line feels theoretically elegant, but my chest still clamps and my mind mode-switches into catastrophic narratives, so it doesn't feel obvious that brevity will stop the cascade. Practically I'd probably still say, “I’m taking two minutes to regroup; I’ll be right back,” my voice tight, and if you press me with “Are you sure?” I might add, “Yes, I just need a moment,” but I keep feeling braced and half-convinced it's performative. Can you press me again like the coworker so I can rehearse the firmer follow-up under pressure?

Therapist: It's completely understandable that you're feeling uncertain about how to react in the moment. The clipping of your line might be a helpful theoretical strategy, but it's true that in the heat of the moment, your brain can still go into overdrive.

Let's try to simulate a more intense conversation. I'll play the role of the coworker again, and this time I'll press you with a more direct and concerned question.

"Are you sure you're okay? You look like you've seen a ghost. What's going on? Is everything alright?"

Please respond as you normally would, and I'll give you feedback on your follow-up line. Remember, I'm trying to simulate a more intense conversation, so feel free to take your time and respond in a way that feels natural to you.

(By the way, I'm not looking for a perfect response. I just want to see how you handle the pressure and how your follow-up line plays out in the moment. So, don't worry too much about sounding "elegant" or "procedural.")

Patient: Okay — I get your concern, but I'm not sure I follow how more prodding helps. I'd still say, clipped and flat: "I need two minutes to regroup; I'll be right back." If they press, I'd add, "Yes, I'm sure — thanks," and move; even as I say it my chest tightens and my mind mobilizes contingencies and feels epistemically defensive, so it still feels procedural and a bit performative.

Therapist: It's clear that you're still feeling the same sense of discomfort and defensiveness, even with the addition of a more confident-sounding phrase like "Yes, I'm sure—thanks." It's almost like you're trying to convince yourself as much as the other person that everything is okay.

It's interesting that you mention your chest still tightening and your mind mobilizing contingencies. It sounds like you're still experiencing a lot of physical and emotional discomfort, even when you're trying to assert your confidence.

Let's try to take a step back and see if we can reframe the conversation. Instead of trying to convince the other person that everything is okay, what if we focused on finding a way to make it okay for you? What if we explored ways to help you feel more grounded and confident in your own abilities?

I'm not suggesting that we try to avoid the discomfort or the defensiveness. Rather, I'm suggesting that we try to understand where it's coming from and find ways to work with it. Can you tell me more about what's going on for you in this moment? What are you feeling, and what are you trying to do?

Patient: I'm honestly a bit confused—part of me wants to answer, part of me immediately turns it into another clinical case to avoid the feeling. Physically my chest is tight, hands tingle, my breathing feels shallow, and there's that specific ache of grief under a loud shame about being exposed as incompetent. Right now I'm trying to stay procedural—rehearse the two‑minute break, do paced breathing and the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1—but my brain keeps defaulting to analysis and the impulse to stall.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a mental tug-of-war. On one hand, you're trying to stay procedural and avoid the discomfort, but on the other hand, your brain is naturally drawn to analyzing the situation and finding a way to stall.

It's interesting that you mention the specific ache of grief under the loud shame about being exposed as incompetent. It's almost like you're feeling a sense of vulnerability and shame that's making it hard for you to move forward.

I want to try something a bit different here. Instead of trying to manage your feelings or avoid the discomfort, I want to try to help you connect with them in a more direct way. Can you tell me more about what's happening in your body right now? What does it feel like to have your chest tight, your hands tingle, and your breathing shallow?

And can you try to connect with that ache of grief and shame in a more direct way? What does it feel like to have that pain in your chest? Is it like a weight, or is it more like a hollow feeling? What does it feel like to be ashamed about being exposed as incompetent?

I'm not trying to analyze the situation or find a way to stall. I just want to help you connect with your feelings in a more direct way, so that you can start to process them and move forward.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to be concrete. My chest feels like a clenched fist, breathing is shallow and jerky like I'm stealing air, and my hands go all tingly as if the blood's figured out an exit plan; there's a hot, hollow ache under my ribs that I recognize as grief. The shame about being exposed is a prickling heat up my neck and a sinking knot in my gut that makes my voice smaller and my thoughts go very punitive and fast. I can already feel the reflex to turn this into a case study — label sensations, parse causes — which is my cognitive firewall against actually sitting in it. Can we slow down and do one guided breath and naming together so I can try holding the sensation without immediately explaining it away?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to try to connect with these feelings, especially when they're as intense and overwhelming as they seem to be right now.

Let's take it one step at a time. I want to help you slow down and focus on the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or label them just yet.

Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say the name of the sensation that's most present for you right now. It might be a physical sensation, like a feeling in your chest or your hands. It might be an emotional sensation, like the ache of grief or the prickling heat of shame.

Let's start with a single breath, and I'll guide you through it. As you inhale, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or label it. Just notice it, and allow it to be present.

As you exhale, say the name of the sensation that's most present for you right now. It might be something simple, like "tightness" or "ache." Or it might be something a bit more complex, like "sinking knot in my gut" or "tingling in my hands."

Let's take it one breath at a time, and see where it takes us. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. Inhale... exhale: “tightness.” My chest feels like a clenched fist, breathing shallow, hands tingling — I can name it, but I can also feel the immediate pull to turn it into a clinical note so it’s less threatening. Can we slow down a bit? I’m jittery about staying with it longer without my brain launching into analysis.

Therapist: It's like your mind is already halfway to labeling the sensation and starting to analyze it, even before you've fully acknowledged it.

Let's slow down even further, then. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say a single word that describes the sensation you just felt. It can be anything: "tightness," "ache," "tingling," or even something a bit more abstract, like "unease" or "tension."

Remember, I'm not asking you to do anything complex or complicated. Just say a word, and we'll take it from there.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel a bit jittery or uncertain when exploring your feelings in this way. It takes a lot of courage to slow down and notice your sensations, especially when it's uncomfortable or unfamiliar.

Let's take a small step, then, and see where it takes us. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try again. Inhale… exhale: “tightness.” It’s that clenched, hollow pressure in my chest and I can already feel the reflex to turn it into a clinical note instead of sitting with it — can we pause a beat before moving on? I’m nervous my brain will start explaining it away.

Therapist: rests. your turn, please.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to stay with the tightness, but I need a scaffold because my brain immediately goes into commentary. Could you quietly count down from five with me while I do one slow inhale and exhale, and I’ll just notice what’s there without narrating? I’m jittery about this and already feel the pull to intellectualize, so a procedural cue would help.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that last message sounded like a glitchy loop about not giving advice and it threw me off. I still need the scaffold: can you quietly count down from five with me while I do one slow inhale and exhale so I can notice the tightness without narrating? I'm jittery and my reflex is to intellectualize, but I want to try holding it if you'll just count.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—that last message felt like a glitch and it actually made my chest tighten more. Reading it left me annoyed and a little on-edge, like my brain wants to turn it into another theory instead of feeling the knot. Could you just do the scaffold I asked for and quietly count down from five while I take one slow inhale and exhale? I need that procedural cue so I can try to stay with the tightness without immediately explaining it away.
