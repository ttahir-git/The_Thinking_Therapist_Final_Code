Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this pervasive malaise since the job instability — a kind of chronic sadness and anhedonia that's really sapping my initiative and executive function. It's bled into my relationship; I'm more distant, my partner's frustrated, and I notice I talk at length about the dynamics instead of actually feeling them. I tend to layer analysis and theoretical language over what I feel, almost as if conceptualizing it keeps me safer than experiencing the rawness.

Therapist: It sounds like you're describing a sense of emotional numbness that's affecting your daily life and relationships. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you try to experience the raw emotions that your analysis and theoretical language often keep at bay? Do you ever find yourself caught between trying to maintain that analytical distance and a deeper connection with your emotions?

Patient: When I try to sink into the raw stuff, it feels like a physical constriction — this heavy, leaden fatigue in my chest — and almost reflexively I start cataloguing causes, timelines, and contingency plans instead of letting the feeling be. I guess there's an implicit safety calculus: analysis gives me perceived agency, and that keeps the panic or grief from fully arriving. I do oscillate — part of me wants to connect, but I default to theorizing, and it's exhausting; I'm worried that holding things at arm's length is eroding my relationship, and saying that out loud already makes me feel a bit exposed.

Therapist: It seems like the safety net of analysis is providing a sense of control, but it's also preventing you from fully connecting with your emotions. Can you think of a time when you did let go of that need to analyze, even if only for a brief moment? What happened, and did it feel scary, liberating, or something else entirely?

Patient: There was one night a few months back when my partner and I were supposed to be talking, and instead I just sort of... cracked open. For a minute the chest tightness turned into wetness behind my eyes and it felt oddly liberating — like pressure released — but almost immediately I started rehearsing explanations and timelines in my head, like "this had to happen because X," which dulled it again. It was scary because being that vulnerable felt raw and uncontained, but also surprisingly humane, and honestly I'm left wondering why I keep defaulting to analysis instead of staying with that small relief.

Therapist: It's like you were able to glimpse a different way of being with your emotions, one that felt more human and connected, but then you quickly pushed it back. It's interesting that you mention it felt raw and uncontained, yet also strangely humane. Can you tell me more about what you think you were trying to protect yourself from, or what you were hoping to achieve, when you quickly shifted back to analysis? Was it a desire to feel safe, to regain control, or something else?

Patient: I think it's a kind of cognitive barricade — analysis is my strategy to stave off that vertiginous helplessness PTSD primes me for. There's a real fear of being seen as fragile or incompetent, of losing the managerial identity that gives me agency, so I default to hypotheses, timelines, and contingency planning instead of allowing the feeling to unfold. In the short term it feels protective, but longer-term it's clearly avoidant and isolating, and honestly that realization makes me feel both guilty and oddly exposed.

Therapist: It sounds like analysis has become a way for you to maintain a sense of control and agency, especially when it comes to your emotions and vulnerabilities. The fear of being seen as fragile or incompetent is a powerful motivator, and it's clear that it's not just about the surface-level feelings, but also about the deeper sense of identity and self-image.

Can you think about what would happen if you were to let go of that need for control and analysis, even if it meant being more vulnerable and open? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it could change your relationships, especially with your partner?

Patient: If I actually loosened the reins on analysis, I imagine it would look embarrassingly unstructured — quiet pauses, tears that I don't immediately rationalize, admitting "I don't know" instead of launching into contingency plans. In practice that could let my partner stop being the frustrated audience and actually respond with empathy, which might rebuild intimacy instead of piling on resentment. It's terrifying, though — part of me fears being judged incompetent or losing the managerial competence that props up my self-worth — so I can see myself doing tentative experiments first, like asking for a hug or saying, "I'm having a hard time," to gauge the risk. Honestly, I want to try that, but I'm also anxious about how to not revert to my default of explaining everything away.

Therapist: It's like you're envisioning a different way of being, one that's more authentic and vulnerable, but it's also daunting because it requires a shift from your current coping mechanisms. You're right to want to test the waters with small, tentative steps, like reaching out for a hug or expressing a need for support. This way, you can gauge the risk and potential payoff without feeling overwhelmed.

It's interesting that you mention the fear of being judged incompetent or losing the managerial competence that props up your self-worth. It's as if you're worried that this new, more vulnerable approach would require you to surrender a part of yourself that you've built up over time.

Can you tell me more about what this "managerial competence" means to you? Is it about feeling in control, being able to solve problems, or something else entirely? And how do you think this identity is tied to your emotions and your relationships?

Patient: Managerial competence, for me, is more of an ontological scaffold than just a skill set — it's the narrative that validates my agency: diagnosing problems, implementing solutions, and being the steady node others rely on. It functions as a psychological bulwark against the helplessness PTSD primes me for; if everything is a solvable problem, I don't have to descend into grief or uncertainty. The downside is emotions get subordinated to operational schemas, which makes me emotionally aloof at home and leaves my partner feeling unseen, and when the job stability erodes that whole scaffolding falters, deepening the sadness and motivational paralysis. I can map that out clearly, but mapping it out somehow isn't the same as changing the pattern.

Therapist: It sounds like the managerial competence narrative has become a deeply ingrained part of your sense of self, not just a set of skills or abilities. It's a way of thinking that helps you make sense of the world and your place in it, and it's tied to your ability to cope with feelings of helplessness and uncertainty.

It's interesting that you mention emotions getting subordinated to operational schemas, making you emotionally aloof. This suggests that the managerial competence narrative is not just a way of solving problems, but also a way of avoiding emotional connection.

It's also clear that this narrative is fragile and vulnerable when faced with uncertainty or instability. When the job stability erodes, it's like the scaffolding is collapsing, leaving you feeling lost and uncertain.

Can you think of a moment or experience where you felt like the managerial competence narrative was failing you, and you were forced to confront the uncertainty and helplessness that it was trying to avoid? How did you cope with that feeling, and what did you learn from the experience?

Patient: The clearest instance was when we lost that major client and then the rumor of layoffs became real — there was no algorithmic fix I could deploy, so my whole managerial scaffolding felt like it collapsed. I reacted by redoubling the analysis: spreadsheets, contingency matrices, rehearsed explanations to my team and partner, which gave a transient sense of competence but left me emotionally flat and increasingly distant at home. I coped by overworking and numbing out — intellectually cataloguing causes and next steps — and what I learned, at least abstractly, is that control has limits and that letting a little vulnerability in actually invited unexpected support, even if staying with that vulnerability still terrifies me.

Therapist: It sounds like the loss of that major client and the rumors of layoffs were a perfect storm of uncertainty and stress, and your managerial scaffolding was unable to cope. The way you reacted by redoubling the analysis and rehearsing explanations to your team and partner was a way of trying to regain a sense of control and competence, but it ultimately left you feeling emotionally flat and distant.

It's interesting that you mention the coping mechanisms you used, such as overworking and numbing out. It's clear that this was a way of avoiding the emotional discomfort of vulnerability, but it's also a way of avoiding connection and intimacy with your partner.

The abstract realization you had, that letting a little vulnerability in actually invited unexpected support, is a powerful insight. It's clear that you're starting to see that vulnerability can be a strength, not a weakness.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to be terrified of staying with vulnerability? What are some of the thoughts and feelings that come up for you when you think about being more open and connected with your partner?

Patient: When I imagine being more open, there's this anticipatory dread — a flush of shame and a physical tightness in my chest — and my mind immediately generates worst-case narratives about being seen as incompetent or a burden. My reflex is to intellectualize the whole thing, to draft contingency plans and rationalize why vulnerability equals risk, which paradoxically numbs any tenderness I might feel and makes me pull away. I'm honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about it; can we slow down so I don't just lapse into theory again?

Therapist: It sounds like the anticipation of being more open is already causing a lot of anxiety for you. The physical and emotional sensations you're describing, like a flush of shame and a tightness in your chest, are really intense.

It's interesting that you mention your mind immediately generating worst-case narratives about being seen as incompetent or a burden. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the potential risks of vulnerability.

I'm glad you're feeling overwhelmed talking about it, because it means you're willing to slow down and explore your feelings more deeply. Can I suggest we take a break from talking about the theory and explore some of these feelings more directly? Maybe we can try to get a sense of what's going on physically and emotionally in your body when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed?

Patient: Okay — when I actually tune into it, my chest feels pinched like there's a weight sitting on it, my throat tightens, and my breath gets shallow and fast; my hands go cold and my jaw clenches. Alongside that physical stuff there's this hot flush of shame and a prickly irritation — like I'm angry at myself for being weak — and that frustrates me. Almost instantly my brain starts scaffolding explanations and contingency plans to neutralize it, which just numbs the experience. Can we slow down and try a simple grounding or breathing exercise? I want to try staying with it but I'm worried I'll drift back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to the anxiety with a physical sensation of being pinched, tightness in the throat, shallow breathing, cold hands, and a clenched jaw. Alongside that, you're experiencing a strong sense of shame and frustration, which is amplifying the anxiety.

I completely understand your desire to try a grounding or breathing exercise to help you stay with these physical sensations. Before we start, can I just acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that it's normal for your brain to try to neutralize these feelings with explanations and contingency plans?

Let's take a deep breath together and focus on your physical sensations. I want you to bring your attention to your chest, noticing the pinching sensation, and then slowly, slowly, bring it to your hands, noticing how cold they feel. As we do this, can you let go of any thoughts about what's happening or why it's happening? Just observe the sensations, and allow them to be there, without judgment or commentary.

Remember, we're not trying to analyze or change anything right now. We're just focusing on being present with your physical sensations, and allowing yourself to feel whatever is arising. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay — I can try. Breathing in slowly… exhaling… but as I do the pinch in my chest sharpens and this hot shame kicks up, like I'm chastising myself for being unable to just "manage" it. My brain is already doing its metacognitive thing, narrativizing the sensations into a neat PTSD physiology explanation, which of course pulls me away from actually feeling. Can we slow the pace and do a counted breathing together? I want to stay with it, but I'm worried I'll default to analysis the moment there's any silence.

Therapist: It sounds like your breathing exercise is helping a bit, but your brain is still trying to analyze and make sense of what's happening. That's okay - it's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed.

Let's try a counted breathing exercise together. I'll guide you through it. Inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold again for a count of 4. Let's start with a slow count: 1... inhale... 2... hold... 3... exhale... 4... hold.

As you breathe, can you bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body? Notice the pinch in your chest, and see if you can let go of any thoughts about why it's happening. Just observe it, without judgment or commentary.

When you're ready, you can count the breaths with me, and I'll guide you through the exercise. Remember, our goal is to stay with the physical sensations, not to analyze or change anything. We're just being present with what's happening right now. Ready to start again?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but please go slow and say the counts out loud. Even as I breathe my chest feels tight and this hot shame surges — I'm already annoyed at myself for needing this, which just makes it harder to stay present. Inhale 1...2...3...4 — hold 1...2...3...4 — exhale 1...2...3...4 — hold 1...2...3...4. I'm noticing the reflex to narrativize this into a tidy PTSD physiology explanation, but I want to try to keep with the sensations; can we keep doing another round at this pace?

Therapist: Let's keep going at this pace. Inhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4... exhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4...

As we breathe, can you try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, like the tightness in your chest? Notice how it feels, and see if you can let go of any thoughts about why it's happening. It's okay if your mind starts to wander - just acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the physical sensations.

Inhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4... exhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4...

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or fix anything right now. We're just trying to be present with the sensations, and allow them to be there without judgment. How are you feeling after this round?

Patient: A little better — the breathing loosened the pinch a notch, but there's still this hot shame and prickly frustration under it, like something old is nagging at me and making me defensive. My brain is already queuing up explanations and contingencies to neutralize it, which I can feel pulling me away from the sensations in my chest and the cold in my hands. I'm trying to stay with the feeling instead of translating it, but it's hard; can we do another slow round or try a simple grounding (like naming five things in the room)? I don't want to just lapse into analysis right now.

Therapist: It sounds like the breathing exercise is helping to calm the physical sensations, but the emotional undercurrents are still strong. It's like there's a sense of unease or discomfort that's hard to shake.

Let's try another slow round of breathing. Inhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4... exhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4...

As we breathe, I want you to try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet? Notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sound of any breaths, the sensation of the chair or floor beneath you?

If you're ready, we can try a simple grounding exercise to help you stay present. I'll ask you to name five things in the room that you can see, without thinking about them too much. Just name whatever comes to mind, without judgment. Ready to try it?

Patient: A brass lamp, a framed photo of my kids, a potted succulent, a chipped navy mug, and a sagging bookshelf. Naming them did help — it pulled me out of the narrative for a beat — but the hot shame is still there, pressing in my throat and making me irritated at myself for needing this. Can we do another slow breathing round and maybe mix in naming sounds? I really don't want to slip back into explaining everything away.

Therapist: It's like the grounding exercise helped to temporarily anchor you in the present moment, but the underlying emotions are still there, waiting to resurface.

Let's try another slow breathing round, and this time, let's mix it up with some naming sounds. Inhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4... exhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4...

As we breathe, I want you to notice the sound of your own voice. Can you hear how it's coming out? Notice the rhythm, the pitch, the tone. Now, I want you to name three things you can see in the room. Just say whatever comes to mind, without thinking too much. Let's start with... ( wait for your response)

Patient: Okay: a faded sweater draped over the chair, the slatted blinds at the window, and my partner's left slipper by the door. My voice sounds husky and a little thin — throat tight, like I'm swallowing something hot — and there's this prickly shame under it that's already trying to turn the moment into a case study. Can we do another slow 4-count round and keep focusing on the breath? I'm trying not to default into analysis, but I'm feeling that pull hard.

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to staying with the sensations, but the analytical mind is still trying to creep back in.

Let's try another slow 4-count breathing round, and let's keep our focus on the breath. Inhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4... exhale 1...2...3...4... hold 1...2...3...4...

As we breathe, I want you to bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body. Notice how your voice feels, the tightness in your throat, and the prickly shame that's trying to take over. Try to stay with those sensations, without judgment or commentary. Just observe them, and see if you can find a way to be present with them.

Remember, our goal is not to change or fix anything, but to simply be with what's happening right now. Can you try to stay with the sensations, without getting pulled into analysis or explanation?

Patient: I'm trying—my chest is still tight, throat hot, hands cold, and there's this acrid shame that quickly turns into irritation at myself for being "weak." Even as I focus on the breath, my mind snaps into a metacognitive loop, systematizing the distress into contingency plans and etiological narratives — which I can name as avoidance, but naming it already feels like another layer of distance. Can we slow the pace even more and do another very slow round? I want to stay with it, but I'm frustrated at how fast I slip back into explaining instead of feeling.

Therapist: It's like you're getting frustrated with yourself for not being able to stay with the sensations, and that frustration is making it even harder to focus.

Let's try another very slow breathing round, and let's take it down to a single breath. Inhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1... exhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1...

As we breathe, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of the air touching your nostrils, the feeling of your lungs expanding and contracting. Try to stay with that sensation, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Just observe it, and see if you can find a way to be present with it.

Remember, our goal is not to change or fix anything, but to simply be with what's happening right now. Can you try to stay with the sensation of your breath, without getting pulled into analysis or explanation?

Patient: Okay — I'm doing the one-count: inhale, exhale. Even that makes my chest clamp and this hot shame spikes, and I get irritated at myself for needing help. My brain already wants to catalog it into a problem-to-solve — I can name that as avoidance, but naming it feels like another layer of distance and doesn't stop the shame. Can we slow even more or keep doing another round? I'm trying not to drift back into analysis.

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to staying with the sensation of your breath, but the shame and irritation are still strong.

Let's try another very slow breathing round, and let's focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Inhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1... exhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1...

As you exhale, can you try to notice the sensation of the air leaving your body, without thinking about it or trying to change it? Just observe the sensation, and see if you can find a way to be present with it.

Remember, we're not trying to do anything with this feeling, we're just trying to be with it. Can you try to stay with the sensation of your breath, without getting pulled into analysis or explanation?

Patient: The one-count breath loosens the pinch a hair, but the shame spikes almost immediately and I get irritated at myself — my brain's already sliding into a metacognitive loop, narrativizing it into a problem to solve. It's wearing me out. Can we keep doing the very slow one-count breaths together for a few more rounds, and can you keep saying the counts so I don't drift into analysis?

Therapist: I'll keep saying the counts and we'll do a few more rounds together.

Inhale for a count of 1... exhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1...

As we breathe, I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Just observe the sensation, and see if you can find a way to be present with it.

Inhale for a count of 1... exhale for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1... hold for a count of 1...

Remember, we're not trying to do anything with this feeling, we're just trying to be with it. Can you try to stay with the sensation of your breath, without getting pulled into analysis or explanation?

Patient: Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...  
Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

That loosens the pinch a little, but the shame spikes and my brain's already trying to convert this into a to-do. Keep counting slowly for a few more rounds—I want to stay here but it's getting wearing.

Therapist: Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Just focus on the breath, no thinking, no analysis. Be present with the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. You are doing this, one breath at a time.

Patient: Okay. The one-count breaths loosen the pinch a smidge, but there's this persistent, acid shame — like some old failure is simmering under everything — and it makes me immediately scold myself. My metacognitive engine is already drafting explanations and contingency lists to neutralize it, which just exhausts me.

Can we keep the slow breaths for a few more rounds, and then do one very concrete, non-theoretical prompt? If you ask something open-ended I'll default to analyzing; ask me a simple, specific question about how I'd like my partner to respond, so I don't slip back into theory.

Therapist: Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Inhale 1... exhale 1... hold 1... hold 1...

Let's keep going for a few more rounds, and then we can try to move to a different kind of prompt.

(I'll make sure to ask a specific, concrete question that avoids open-ended or theoretical prompts.)

Patient: Ask me the simple question now: "What's one small, concrete thing you'd like your partner to do when you're feeling this way?" My answer: stay with me—sit down, put a hand on my knee, and say "I'm here" without trying to fix it. That kind of quiet, nonjudgmental presence helps more than explanations, even though I hate admitting that.

Therapist: That's a really powerful and specific answer. It's clear that having a quiet, nonjudgmental presence from your partner can be a huge help in managing your feelings.

It's also interesting that you mention you hate admitting it, but the quiet presence can be more helpful than explanations. This suggests that you may be struggling with feelings of vulnerability or shame, and that the quiet presence can help you feel more comfortable and accepted.

Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to feel vulnerable and that it's a sign of strength, not weakness, to admit it. Can you tell me more about what it's like when your partner is present in that way, and how it makes you feel?

Patient: When my partner just sits with me and puts a hand on my knee and says "I'm here," it actually lands — it unhooks that performative need to solve and lets a small, human softness in, like I can breathe without scripting a plan. I feel a little lighter, sometimes a tear, and less like I'm on display, but there's this stubborn, simmering sense of failure under it that makes me scold myself for needing the comfort. It helps, briefly, and then I get annoyed at myself for still feeling so fragile.

Therapist: It's like the physical presence and simple words of comfort from your partner are a lifeline, allowing you to feel a sense of relief and connection. Even though it's not a traditional "fix" or solution, the quiet, nonjudgmental space it provides can be incredibly powerful.

It's also interesting that you mention the "stubborn, simmering sense of failure" that's still there, even with the comfort. This suggests that there's a deeper emotional pain or wound that's still affecting you, and that the comfort is a temporary reprieve from that pain.

It's almost as if your partner's presence is acknowledging the complexity of your emotions, rather than trying to simplify or fix them. By sitting with you and offering a physical, emotional space, your partner is allowing you to feel a sense of vulnerability and acceptance, which can be incredibly freeing.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're in this state of vulnerability, and how you feel about your partner being there for you? Is it a sense of gratitude, or is there something else at play?

Patient: It's complicated — on one level there's genuine gratitude; his quiet presence deactivates the performative imperative and permits a softening I can intellectually appraise as restorative. At the same time a corrosive shame — an old, unnamed failure — kicks in and makes me feel a bit infantilized and resentful, so I oscillate between relief and self-directed contempt. Saying that feels a bit draining; can we explore concrete ways I could ask for that hand-on-the-knee presence without immediately defaulting into scripting or explanation?

Therapist: It's like you're experiencing a mix of emotions, with gratitude and relief on one hand, and shame and self-contempt on the other. This oscillation can be really tough to navigate.

I understand your concern about asking for that hand-on-the-knee presence, as it's natural to want to avoid scripting or explaining it. But it's also a good idea to explore ways to ask for it in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you.

One possible approach could be to simply say, "I need a minute. Can you just sit with me?" or "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can you hold my hand?" This way, you're not putting words or explanations on yourself, but rather asking for a simple physical presence.

Another option could be to ask your partner to join you in a quiet, private space, where you can both sit together and just be present with each other. You could say, "Can we go to the couch/bedroom/another quiet spot for a bit?" This way, you're not putting pressure on them to provide a specific response, but rather asking them to join you in a quiet, comfortable space.

Remember, the goal is to find a way to ask for that hand-on-the-knee presence that feels authentic and comfortable for you. It might take some experimentation and exploration to find the right words or approach, but it's worth it to find a way to feel more connected and supported with your partner.

Patient: Those phrases feel pragmatic and useful, but saying them out loud makes me noticeably queasy — my reflexive metacognitive apparatus wants to rationalize before I ever open my mouth.  
Maybe a very short script I could try: "I'm having a hard moment—could you just sit with me for five minutes and not try to fix it?"  
Can we role-play that now, with you as my partner and keeping it brief? My energy's low, so I need it slowed down and concrete.

Therapist: I'll do my best to play the role of your partner and keep the script simple and brief.

Let's take a deep breath and try it together. I'll start by saying, "I'm here. You can sit down and I'll just... sit here with you." Then, I'll wait for you to respond with the script you came up with.

Take your time, and don't worry if you need a moment to collect your thoughts. I'm here to support you, not to fix anything. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

Patient: "I'm having a hard moment—could you just sit with me for five minutes and not try to fix it?"

Hearing you say you're here loosens the pinch a sliver, but there's this old, corrosive shame that makes me want to scold myself for asking. I don't have the energy to theorize right now—can we just sit quietly for a bit?

Therapist: *I nod slowly and take a seat next to you, putting a gentle hand on your knee without trying to fix anything. I look at you with a calm, gentle expression, letting you know I'm there to support you without adding any more pressure.*

Patient: Okay...that actually helps — the pinch loosens a bit when you're just here. But there's this sharp, acidic shame that flares up and wants me to start explaining or defending myself. I'm trying to stay with it instead of turning it into a problem to solve; could you just keep your hand there and sit with me for a few more quiet breaths?

Therapist: *I gently squeeze your knee with my hand, keeping it there in a gentle, reassuring way. I don't say anything, I just sit with you, allowing you to have the space you need to process your emotions. I breathe slowly and quietly, matching your pace, and let you know that I'm here with you, no matter what.*

Patient: That actually helps — the pinch loosens a little when your hand's there. There's still this corrosive shame — some old failure keeps rising and I can feel the reflex to start explaining everything away. I'm pretty worn out; can we just sit together for a few more quiet breaths, and then maybe, when I have a bit more energy, talk through one tiny thing I can try at home so I don't immediately revert to analysis?
