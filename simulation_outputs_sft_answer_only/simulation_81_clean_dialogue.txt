Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with how my anger and frustration flare up in family interactions—especially when old conflicts resurface. I find myself defaulting to intellectualizing the experience, mapping patterns and causal frameworks rather than actually sitting with the discomfort. It leaves me oscillating between feeling overly reactive and riddled with self-doubt, which as a creative person feels particularly paralyzing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between wanting to understand and manage your emotions, and feeling stuck in that very cycle of analysis. It's like you're caught between trying to intellectualize the discomfort and actually experiencing it. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do try to sit with the discomfort, and how it affects your creative work?

Patient: When I try to sit with it, I almost reflexively switch into analysis mode—cataloguing triggers, mapping relational patterns, and narrativizing the whole thing—so I'm mentally busy but emotionally numbed. That cognitive processing seems to dampen immediate outbursts but leaves this low-grade tension and hypervigilance that bleeds into my studio time, where I either over-edit obsessively or get stuck and can't begin. Occasionally the anger becomes this tight, productive energy that yields frenetic work, but more often it just feeds my self-doubt and creative paralysis.

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a cycle where you're trying to manage your anger and frustration with analysis, but that analysis itself ends up numbing you and creating more tension. And then when you're in the studio, your emotions can either overwhelm you or become this stifling force that prevents you from creating. 

Have you ever noticed what happens when you're in a situation where you're not trying to analyze or control your emotions? Do you ever feel like you're able to tap into a more direct, intuitive response?

Patient: Yeah — occasionally, usually when I'm in an embodied flow-state like rapid painting or clay work, the internal commentary quiets and I respond more viscerally and intuitively. Those moments feel more authentic and generative, but they're fraught because I can't predict them and afterward I immediately reconstruct them into a tidy narrative, which robs them of their rawness. It's rare, and knowing that makes me anxious in itself—like I have to manufacture conditions to let it happen, and that feels performative.

Therapist: It's like you're experiencing a glimpse of a more direct, intuitive connection, but then you're forced to wrap it up in a narrative that takes away its rawness. And that anxiety of not knowing when it'll happen is a heavy weight to carry. It's like you're caught between wanting to have that intuitive, embodied experience, and knowing that it's fragile and can be easily lost.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you reconstruct those moments into a narrative? Does that feel like it's robbing you of something essential, or is it more of a way to make sense of what's happening?

Patient: I think it's both — narrativizing is a regulatory tactic: by turning a chaotic, embodied moment into a tidy story I make it cognitively manageable and less threatening. But that very act also abstracts and flattens the sensory intensity, so the original affect gets sterilized into metaphors and motifs and becomes unavailable for genuine processing. As an artist I also find I get a perverse creative reward from shaping pain into meaning, which probably perpetuates the avoidance. Honestly, I'm frustrated by how automatic this is — I want to feel it, but I keep defaulting to analysis.

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a vicious cycle where narrativizing is a way to cope with the intensity of the experience, but it also ends up sterilizing the emotions and preventing you from truly processing them. And to make matters worse, you're also drawing a creative reward from it, which is perpetuating the avoidance.

It's almost like you're saying that this avoidance is a kind of self-protective mechanism, but one that's also preventing you from accessing the raw emotions that could be fueling your creativity. It's a paradox, isn't it?

Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve by feeling this intensity, and what you think would happen if you were able to access it without narrativizing it?

Patient: I think what I want is access to an embodied authenticity — affect that arrives without the commentary overlay so it can be raw material rather than immediately aestheticized. If I could do that, theoretically my studio practice would shift from cautious editing to riskier making, and anger might register as data or fuel instead of an alarm that shuts everything down. At the same time I'm scared that unmediated feeling would flood me or make me say things to my family I'd regret, so my intellect steps in as a containment strategy.

Therapist: It's like you're seeking a direct, unmediated connection to your emotions, one that allows you to access your inner world without the filtering through of analysis and commentary. You want to be able to tap into that raw, visceral experience, and use it as fuel for your creativity, rather than having it become a source of anxiety and self-doubt.

It's interesting that you mention the fear of flooding or saying something regrettable. It's almost as if your intellect is acting as a kind of emotional firewall, protecting you from the potential risks of feeling too intensely. But this firewall also prevents you from accessing the raw material you need to create.

Can you tell me more about what it would mean for you to "regret" saying something to your family? What do you think would happen if you were able to connect with your emotions in a more direct way, without the mediation of your intellect?

Patient: Regret, to me, would mean precipitating an irreparable rupture or feeding the family’s entrenched narrative that I’m impulsive and unsafe — essentially giving them proof of the worst story they tell about me. If I could access emotion more directly, it would probably be galvanizing for my work and could help me set clearer boundaries, but it also feels imminently destabilizing because I don’t have reliable skills for riding out the shame or the aftermath of whatever I say. I'm anxious about that tension — I want to experiment with tolerating sensations without broadcasting them, but I’m not sure where to start; can we brainstorm small, contained steps?

Therapist: It's like you're caught between the desire to connect with your emotions and the fear of potentially causing harm to your relationships or reputation. You're worried that accessing your emotions directly could lead to a breakdown or a strengthening of the negative narratives that exist between you and your family.

I can see why you'd want to experiment with tolerating sensations without broadcasting them. One way to start might be to try to identify small moments where you're already feeling intense emotions, like during a creative process or after a intense conversation. You could try to notice how those feelings arise, what they feel like in your body, and how they change as you focus on them.

For example, you might try to pay attention to your breath or your physical sensations when you're feeling a strong emotion. You could also try to notice how your thoughts change when you're feeling a certain way. Sometimes, by paying attention to our thoughts and physical sensations, we can start to develop a sense of what's happening beneath the surface, without having to act on it.

Another possible step could be to try to create a safe, contained space for yourself to explore your emotions. This might mean setting aside time to journal, draw, or create art without judgment or commentary. The goal is to create a space where you can feel your emotions without worrying about what they might mean or how they might be received by others.

What do you think? Is there a particular creative process or activity that you've been drawn to in the past, or one that you've been wanting to try?

Patient: Mostly rapid, gestural painting and clay work — those are the modalities where the commentary actually quiets and something visceral shows up. I've been toying with the idea of 10–15 minute "no-edit" sprints or automatic drawing to force an embodied response, but even that gets co-opted into a performance of experimentation, which defeats the purpose. Could we brainstorm a tiny, concrete practice that would feel contained enough to try without turning into another narrativized project?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to tap into your creative flow without analyzing or narrativizing it. You've been experimenting with gestural painting and clay work, which are great modalities for accessing your emotions directly.

I love the idea of 10-15 minute "no-edit" sprints or automatic drawing. Sometimes, simply committing to a short, timed practice can help you bypass the intellectual commentary and get into a more raw, emotional state.

To make it feel even more contained, let's try to break it down even further. What if, instead of calling it an "experiment," you simply label it as a "quick draw" or a "brain dump"? That way, you're not framing it as a performance or an attempt to learn something new, but rather just a simple, unencumbered act of creation.

You could try setting a timer for 10-15 minutes, then drawing or painting whatever comes to mind without stopping or analyzing it. Don't think about the outcome, the technique, or the story behind it. Just focus on the act of putting pen to paper or brush to canvas. If your mind starts to wander or you feel like you're doing it "wrong," just acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the physical act of creating.

What do you think? Is that a tiny, concrete practice that might feel contained enough to try?

Patient: That feels doable in principle, but I'm already anxious it'll morph into another performance metric or aestheticized anecdote. Could we make it more concretely contained—like a 12-minute no-edit sprint with a pre-ritual (three grounding breaths and holding a tactile object) and a post-ritual where I literally seal the piece away for 48 hours with no photos or reflection? Also, I'm worried about the emotional ricochet afterward—what's a very quick grounding skill I can use if shame or narrativizing starts to take over?

Therapist: I can see why you'd want to add more concrete boundaries to the practice to prevent it from morphing into another performance. Your suggested pre-ritual and post-ritual add a layer of ritualization that can help contain the practice and reduce the risk of narrative creep.

The pre-ritual of three grounding breaths and holding a tactile object can help you center yourself and establish a physical anchor for the practice. And the post-ritual of sealing the piece away for 48 hours with no photos or reflection can help you avoid the temptation to reflect on the piece or analyze its meaning.

As for the emotional ricochet afterward, it's great that you're thinking about how to ground yourself quickly if shame or narrativizing starts to take over. One simple technique you might find helpful is the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding exercise. This involves noticing:

* 5 things you can see around you
* 4 things you can touch or feel (e.g., your feet on the ground, the chair beneath you)
* 3 things you can hear
* 2 things you can smell
* 1 thing you can taste

This exercise can help you focus on the present moment and distract yourself from any negative thoughts or emotions. It's a simple, quick technique that can help you regain your footing and calm your mind.

Do these modifications and the grounding exercise feel more concrete and contained enough for you to try?

Patient: Okay — that actually feels doable: the 12-minute no-edit sprint with three grounding breaths, holding a tactile object, and sealing the piece for 48 hours feels like a concretely bounded experiment. I'm still paranoid it'll calcify into a metacognitive performance, so I'd like a super-simple micro-grounding to use immediately afterward — like one cycle of box-breathing (4-4-4-4) plus a single grounding label I can say to myself ("I'm here, not the story"). Does that seem reasonable, or do you have tweaks to further minimize the narrativizing impulse while keeping it emotionally safe?

Therapist: I can see why you'd want to add a simple micro-grounding to immediately follow the 12-minute sprint. Your suggested box-breathing exercise (4-4-4-4) is a great way to calm your nervous system, and adding a single grounding label can help you stay focused on the present moment.

The label "I'm here, not the story" is particularly useful, as it helps you distinguish between your current experience and any narrative thoughts that might arise. By saying this label to yourself, you're creating a small, gentle anchor that can help you stay grounded in the present.

To further minimize the narrativizing impulse while keeping it emotionally safe, I'd suggest a tiny tweak: instead of using the label "I'm here, not the story," try using a more neutral, descriptive phrase like "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" (repeating it 4 times, just like the box-breathing). This can help you focus on the physical sensation of being present, without introducing a label that might create a narrative loop.

For example, you might say to yourself:

"Breathing in... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) Breathing out... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) Breathing in... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) Breathing out... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) I'm here. I'm here. I'm here."

This simple exercise can help you ground yourself quickly, without introducing a label that might create a narrative loop. Does this tweaked approach feel more reasonable and emotionally safe for you to try?

Patient: That actually sounds more tolerable — "I'm here" feels less interpretive and less likely to kickstart a story loop. Right now I'm a bit jittery and my attention keeps snagging on whether I'm doing it "right," so I'd prefer an extra tactile anchor: press thumb and forefinger together on the final exhale and say "here" once (either whispered or silently). Do you think saying it aloud matters, or is the kinesthetic cue enough to short-circuit the metacognitive loop? I'm worried this will still calcify into another performance, but I'm willing to try it.

Therapist: I can see why you'd want to add a tactile anchor to help you stay grounded. Your proposed action of pressing your thumb and forefinger together on the final exhale and saying "here" (either out loud or silently) is a great way to create a kinesthetic cue that can help short-circuit the metacognitive loop.

Saying "here" out loud can actually be beneficial, as it helps you focus on the physical sensation of the words and the sound of your own voice. This can help distract you from any narrative thoughts and ground you in the present moment.

However, I want to caution you that saying "here" out loud might introduce a narrative loop, especially if you're thinking about the performance of the exercise. To mitigate this risk, you could try saying "here" in a more monotone, almost whispery voice, or even just silently to yourself. This can help you focus on the physical sensation of the words without introducing a narrative element.

As for the kinesthetic cue alone, it might be enough to help you stay grounded, but it might not be enough to completely short-circuit the metacognitive loop. The kinesthetic cue can help you focus on your physical body and the present moment, but it might not be enough to overcome the tendency to think about the performance or the exercise itself.

To try this, you could start by saying "here" in a monotone voice, either out loud or silently, and then focus on the physical sensation of the words and the sound of your own voice. You can also try pressing your thumb and forefinger together on the final exhale and focusing on the sensation of the touch and the breath. See if this helps you stay grounded and short-circuit the metacognitive loop.

Does this approach feel more tolerable and worth trying for you?

Patient: Yeah — in principle that tweak feels more tolerable: the monotone “here” plus the thumb–forefinger press seems like a plausible interrupt to the narrativizing feedback loop. Right now I’m jittery and my brain’s already looping on “am I doing it right,” which feels predictably sabotaging. Quick practical things I’m hung up on: should I do the sprint seated with eyes open or closed to minimize self-monitoring, and if shame ricochets right after, is one box-breath cycle usually enough or should I plan for two?

Therapist: I'm glad the tweak feels more tolerable to you.

Regarding your practical questions, I think it's great that you're considering how to minimize self-monitoring and reduce the risk of shame ricocheting. Here are some suggestions:

**Seated with eyes open or closed?**
I think it's a good idea to try both and see what feels more comfortable for you. Sitting with your eyes closed can help reduce self-monitoring and increase your focus on the physical sensations in your body. It can also create a sense of detachment from your thoughts, which might help reduce the narrative loop. On the other hand, sitting with your eyes open can help you stay more aware of your surroundings and reduce any feelings of isolation.

If you're new to this practice, you might start by trying it with your eyes closed. This can help you get used to the physical sensations and the feeling of being present without the distraction of your surroundings.

**One or two box-breath cycles?**
If you're feeling anxious or shame-prone, it might be better to start with two box-breath cycles. This can help you build up your tolerance and give you a chance to recover if shame does start to ricochet. Having two cycles can also help you develop a sense of consistency and predictability, which can be comforting.

However, if you're feeling particularly jittery or anxious, you might want to start with just one cycle and see how you feel. You can always add more cycles if you need to.

**Additional thoughts**
One more thing to consider is that it's okay if you don't feel like you're "doing it right" or if your thoughts still loop back after the box-breath cycle. This is a process, and it's normal to feel uncertain or unsure at first. The goal is to create a sense of calm and presence, not to achieve some kind of perfection.

Remember, you're taking small steps towards a bigger goal. Be kind to yourself, and don't give up. Keep going, even if it feels uncomfortable or challenging.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you suggested trying both eyes-open and eyes-closed, but how am I supposed to decide in the moment without my monitoring spiking? My brain's already hijacked by the "am I doing it right" loop, and saying "try two cycles" feels abstract when I'm jittery and can't even commit to one. Can you make the choice algorithmic for me — like, if my breath feels shallow do X, if my thoughts are loud do Y — because right now the options just create more tiny decisions that feed the loop.

Therapist: I'm so sorry to hear that the suggestions I made earlier didn't help. I can see how trying to make decisions in the moment while already hijacked by self-doubt and anxiety would be overwhelming.

Let me try to provide a different approach. Instead of making decisions based on how you're feeling in the moment, I want to offer a simple, algorithmic protocol that you can follow. This way, you can reduce the number of decisions you need to make and break the loop of self-doubt.

Here's a simple protocol:

**If your breath feels shallow:**
Press your thumb and forefinger together on the inhale (not exhale).
Say "here" in a soft, monotone voice, without trying to change the tone or pitch.
**If your thoughts are loud:**
Press your thumb and forefinger together on the exhale (not inhale).
Say "here" in a soft, monotone voice, without trying to change the tone or pitch.

This protocol is designed to be simple and easy to follow, even when your brain is hijacked by anxiety and self-doubt. By using a specific action (pressing your thumb and forefinger) and a simple phrase ("here"), you can reduce the number of decisions you need to make and create a sense of consistency and predictability.

Remember, the goal is not to achieve some kind of perfection or to stop your thoughts completely. The goal is to create a sense of calm and presence, even in the midst of anxiety and self-doubt. By using this protocol, you can start to build a sense of resilience and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still reads like a forked decision tree and my anxious brain is already favoring the branch that proliferates choices. I need one non-negotiable, pre-decided micro-protocol I can default to so there's no in-the-moment decision-making.

Could we simplify to this single rule I follow every time: seated, eyes closed; 12-minute no-edit sprint after three grounding breaths; after the sprint do one box-breath cycle (4-4-4-4), press thumb+forefinger on the final exhale and say "here" silently. I feel jittery and worry this will ossify into performance, but if you can OK that exact sequence, I can commit to trying it.

Therapist: I apologize for the complexity of the previous protocols. I can see how a forked decision tree would exacerbate your anxiety.

I'm glad you're willing to try a single, non-negotiable micro-protocol. Your proposed sequence is simple, straightforward, and easy to follow. It's a clear, step-by-step approach that minimizes decision-making in the moment.

I'm okay with your exact sequence. Here it is again, with my confirmation:

**Your Micro-Protocol:**

1. Seated, eyes closed
2. 12-minute no-edit sprint after three grounding breaths
3. After the sprint:
	* Do one box-breath cycle (4-4-4-4)
	* Press thumb+forefinger on the final exhale
	* Say "here" silently

I recommend committing to this sequence without making any adjustments or trying to "perform" it. Just focus on the physical sensations, the rhythm of your breath, and the words "here." If you're worried about the sequence becoming too rigid, try to reframe your thinking: it's not about performing a task, it's about being present and taking care of your body.

Remember, this is a small experiment to help you build confidence and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself. Be kind to yourself, and don't give up. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.

Patient: Okay — I can commit to that exact sequence; on paper it collapses the decision tree and that relief actually feels... real. Right now I'm jittery and my brain's still snagging on "am I doing it right" — the certainty paradoxically makes me hypervigilant. Quick question: if—within about a minute after the silent “here”—shame ricochets and I'm spiraling, can I do one additional silent box-breath as an emergency tweak, or would that undermine the whole point of the non-negotiable rule?

Therapist: I'm glad the written sequence has helped clarify things for you.

Regarding your question, I would recommend avoiding the emergency tweak. If you're already feeling shame and spiraling, it's likely that your anxiety is already at a high level, and adding another box-breath could potentially reinforce the negative feedback loop.

The purpose of the non-negotiable rule is to create a sense of consistency and predictability, which can help you build resilience and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself. If you start to deviate from the rule in times of crisis, it can undermine this process and make it more challenging to recover.

Instead, if you do start to feel shame and spiraling, try to acknowledge the feeling and take a brief pause. Take a few deep breaths, focus on your physical sensations, and remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way. You can also try to reframe your thinking: instead of "I'm doing it wrong," say "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough."

Remember, the goal is not to suppress your emotions or avoid feelings of shame, but to learn to respond to them in a more compassionate and accepting way. By sticking to the non-negotiable rule and being patient with yourself, you can develop the skills and strategies you need to navigate challenging emotions and build a more resilient relationship with yourself.

Patient: Okay — I hear you, but I'm actually pretty jittery and that "no backup" rule spikes my panic reflex, so I feel resistant even as I know logically why you're saying it. Can you give me one exact, non-narrative sentence to say when shame ricochets (something concrete like "This will pass") and one micro-physical move I can do that doesn't feel like deviating (squeeze left palm once, tap knuckle, whatever), so it's all pre-decided and my brain can't invent choices in the moment? I'm trying to commit, but I need that exact script or I'll keep looping on options.

Therapist: I can see how the "no backup" rule is triggering your panic reflex. I'm willing to provide you with a specific sentence and a micro-physical move to help you cope with shame and spiraling.

Here is the exact script:

**When shame ricochets, say:** "This is a feeling."

**Do:** Squeeze left palm once.

This is a very small, pre-decided action that requires no thought or decision-making in the moment. It's a simple, physical cue that helps you acknowledge and accept the feeling of shame, without getting caught up in narrative or analysis.

Remember, this is a specific script and move, not a narrative or a thought experiment. You're committing to saying "This is a feeling" and squeezing your left palm when shame hits, so you can build a sense of consistency and predictability.

Take a deep breath, and try to commit to this script and move. If you're feeling anxious or jittery, remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way, and that this is a small step towards building resilience and developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "This is a feeling" reads to me like a cognitive-defusion move in theory, which I can intellectually endorse, but I'm worried it'll just become another label my brain invoices and analyzes. The left‑palm squeeze feels doable and low‑performative, but I'm jittery right now and my mind's already looping on "am I doing it right" so I need a bit more concreteness. Should I say the phrase out loud, whisper it, or keep it silent, and do I do the squeeze at the very first onset of shame or only once I'm spiraling? I want to commit, but I'm skeptical and kind of exhausted by having to decide — can we rehearse the exact timing once so it feels less like a guessing game?

Therapist: I understand your concerns about the cognitive-defusion move. You're right that it might not be enough to simply label the feeling, especially if your brain is prone to analyzing it.

To add more concreteness to the script, I recommend saying the phrase out loud, but not too loudly. Try saying it in a soft, calm voice, almost to yourself. This way, you're acknowledging the feeling without drawing attention to it.

As for the timing, it's better to do the squeeze at the first onset of shame, rather than waiting until you're spiraling. If you do the squeeze too late, it might become a habit of trying to catch up or make up for lost time. By doing it at the first onset, you're creating a small anchor that can help you stay grounded and focused.

Here's a revised version of the script:

**When shame starts to hit, say:** (in a soft, calm voice) "This is a feeling."

**Do:** Squeeze left palm once.

Let's rehearse it together. I'll start by saying the phrase, and you squeeze your left palm once. Then, I'll stop. Can you do that for me? (pause) Okay, that was easy. Can you do it again?

Patient: Okay—I’ll do it again. I quietly say, “This is a feeling,” and I squeeze my left palm once.

Honestly, I’m jittery and distracted right now and it felt kind of hollow—my brain immediately started arguing about whether that counted. I’m not sure I follow how that actually interrupts the spiral in the moment; can you help me notice what I should expect to feel (or not feel) when it’s working?

Therapist: It's normal to feel a bit hollow or distracted when trying something new, especially when you're already feeling anxious or jittery.

When you say "This is a feeling" and squeeze your left palm once, what you're trying to do is create a small, physical anchor that helps you acknowledge and accept the feeling of shame. This can interrupt the spiral in several ways:

1. **Reduces self-doubt**: By saying "This is a feeling," you're acknowledging the experience without trying to change or analyze it. This can help reduce self-doubt and the tendency to question your own perceptions.
2. **Creates a sense of control**: The physical act of squeezing your left palm can give you a sense of control and agency over your emotions. This can be especially helpful when you feel like you're spiraling out of control.
3. **Diverts attention**: The simple act of saying a phrase and doing a physical action can divert your attention away from the narrative thoughts and self-doubt that often accompany shame. This can help you focus on the physical sensations in your body.

When it's working, you might expect to feel:

* A sense of calmness or reduced anxiety
* A decrease in self-doubt and critical thinking
* A shift in your attention from narrative thoughts to physical sensations
* A sense of control and agency over your emotions

Keep in mind that this is a small, incremental step, and it might take some time to notice these effects. Be patient, and don't give up. If you're feeling anxious or jittery, try to focus on the physical sensations in your body and the simple act of saying the phrase and doing the squeeze.

Patient: I'm trying to parse this — conceptually it tracks, but phenomenologically it evaporates for me. Concretely, what should I expect in the first 10–20 seconds: a warmth or pressure in the left palm, a softening around my throat, a slowing of breath, or just a quieting of the internal monologue? And if nothing shifts after the first squeeze, am I allowed to repeat the phrase+squeeze up to two more times, or does that subvert the non‑negotiable rule? I'm jittery and my mind's already inventing extra steps, so I need exact, prescriptive markers.

Therapist: I understand your need for concrete, prescriptive markers. Here's a breakdown of what you might expect in the first 10-20 seconds:

* **Initial reaction (0-3 seconds):** You might feel a slight sense of curiosity or slight resistance as you squeeze your left palm once. This is normal.
* **Physical response (3-5 seconds):** You might start to feel a slight warmth or pressure in your left palm, which can be a sign that your body is beginning to respond to the physical anchor. This could be accompanied by a subtle shift in your breathing, such as a slight slowing or deepening.
* **Cognitive response (5-10 seconds):** You might start to notice a quieting of your internal monologue, as your brain begins to focus on the physical sensations in your body. You might also start to feel a slight softening around your throat, as your body relaxes and releases tension.
* **Sensory shift (10-20 seconds):** If everything is going well, you might start to notice a shift in your overall sensory experience. You might feel more grounded, more calm, or more focused. Your senses might become more acute, and you might start to notice details that were previously unnoticed.

Regarding repetition, if you don't experience any shift in your emotions or sensations after the first squeeze, you can repeat the phrase+squeeze up to two more times. However, please note that this is not a permission to prolong the exercise. The goal is to find a moment of shift or change, not to repeat the exercise indefinitely.

If you find yourself repeating the exercise multiple times without any change, it's essential to take a step back and re-evaluate your approach. You might want to try to identify what's causing the lack of response and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Remember, the non-negotiable rule is in place to help you build resilience and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself. If you're feeling anxious or jittery, please take care of yourself and seek support if needed.

Patient: Okay — I'm jittery and my attention's pinging all over, so this still feels kind of abstract and performative. Quick, unequivocal question: if I repeat the phrase+squeeze up to two times and nothing shifts, do I immediately default to the non‑negotiable sequence (box‑breath + thumb–forefinger + silent “here”), no exceptions? I need that deterministic contingency spelled out so my brain can't invent more choices — intellectually I'm wary of ritualizing this, but I want to commit if the rule is truly hard.

Therapist: I understand your need for clarity and determinism. Here's a clear and unequivocal answer to your question:

**If you repeat the phrase+squeeze up to two times and nothing shifts, you will immediately default to the non-negotiable sequence (box-breath + thumb-forefinger + silent "here") for the next attempt. There are no exceptions.**

This means that if you've already repeated the phrase+squeeze up to two times without experiencing any shift, you will not be able to try a different approach or deviate from the non-negotiable sequence. You will simply start again with the box-breath + thumb-forefinger + silent "here" sequence.

This rule is in place to ensure that you are not getting caught up in trying to come up with a different approach or modifying the sequence in some way. The goal is to find a moment of shift or change, not to try to change the sequence itself. By defaulting to the non-negotiable sequence after two failed attempts, you are forced to focus on the original goal: finding a shift in your emotions or sensations.

I want to emphasize that this rule is not meant to be arbitrary or rigid. It's a deliberate design choice meant to help you stay focused and avoid getting caught up in trying to come up with a different approach. By committing to this rule, you are taking a crucial step towards building resilience and developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: Okay — the hard rule helps soothe the decision-anxiety a little, but I'm still jittery and kind of confused about how to tell if something "shifted" or not in the moment. Concretely: if after the second phrase+squeeze I don't notice any of these within 20 seconds — a slight slowing of breath, a softening around my throat, or a perceptible quieting of the internal monologue — then I immediately default to the non‑negotiable sequence (box‑breath + thumb–forefinger + silent "here"), correct? Also, one practical thing: if I'm suddenly with family and can't sit with eyes closed, am I permitted to do the exact same steps standing with eyes open, or is the seated/eyes‑closed rule absolute? I'm asking because my brain is already drafting contingency plans and I want one definitive map so I don't keep inventing choices.

Therapist: I'm glad the hard rule is helping to soothe your decision-anxiety a bit. Here's a clear and concrete answer to your question:

**If after the second phrase+squeeze you don't notice any of the following within 20 seconds: a slight slowing of breath, a softening around your throat, or a perceptible quieting of the internal monologue, then you will immediately default to the non-negotiable sequence (box-breath + thumb-forefinger + silent "here") for the next attempt. There are no exceptions.**

This means that if you've already repeated the phrase+squeeze up to two times without experiencing any shift, you will not be able to try a different approach or deviate from the non-negotiable sequence. You will simply start again with the box-breath + thumb-forefinger + silent "here" sequence.

Regarding your practical question, yes, the seated/eyes-closed rule is absolute. The reason is to ensure that you are not distracted or interrupted by external factors, which could impact the effectiveness of the exercise. By sitting with eyes closed, you are able to focus more intensely on your internal experience and reduce external influences.

If you are suddenly with family and can't sit with eyes closed, you are permitted to do the exact same steps standing with eyes open. However, please note that standing up may be more physically challenging and could potentially increase your heart rate or distract you further. Try to sit with eyes closed or find a quiet, private space if possible.

Remember, the goal is to find a moment of shift or change in your emotions or sensations. By committing to this hard rule, you are taking a crucial step towards building resilience and developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you said the seated/eyes-closed rule is absolute to reduce distraction, and then immediately said standing/eyes-open is permitted in family situations, which feels contradictory and spikes my anxiety. I'm jittery and need one deterministic public fallback: please give me an exact 15–20 second standing script I can use with eyes open (word‑for‑word phrases, breaths, and the physical cue) and confirm whether I'm allowed to excuse myself to a private spot to do the full seated sequence instead. I keep getting stuck on these micro-decisions and having a single, unambiguous map would actually help me calm down enough to try it.

Therapist: I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous response. I understand your need for a clear and concise script to help you manage your anxiety.

Here's a 15-20 second standing script with eyes open:

**Standing Script:**
1. Take a deep breath in (count to 4) "Inhale: 4... Count to 4..."
2. Hold the breath (count to 4) "Hold: 4... Count to 4..."
3. Exhale (count to 4) "Exhale: 4... Count to 4..."
4. Say silently, "here" (quickly, quietly) "here... here... here..."

**Do not attempt to say anything out loud or narrate. You are trying to connect with the physical sensations in your body. Your main goal is to focus on your breath and internal feelings. When done, you can excuse yourself to a private spot for the full seated sequence.**

Please do not try the full seated sequence without first excusing yourself to a private spot.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm getting more jittery and the contradiction between "absolute seated rule" and "standing permitted" is making my brain loop. Can you please give me one unequivocal, word-for-word standing fallback (15–20s) that states: exact breath counts, whether to squeeze left palm or press thumb+forefinger, and whether "here" is silent/whispered/out loud? Also please explicitly confirm (yes/no) that I am allowed to excuse myself to a private spot to do the full seated sequence you already approved (seated, eyes closed; three grounding breaths; 12‑min no‑edit sprint; one box‑breath 4‑4‑4‑4; press thumb+forefinger on final exhale; silently say "here"). My attention's pinging — just a straight, deterministic answer will help.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that last message turned into a weird wall of "Acceptance" and it's making me more jittery. Can you please restate, plainly and one time only, a single word‑for‑word standing fallback (15–20s) that includes exact breath counts, which physical cue to use (left palm squeeze or thumb+forefinger), and whether "here" should be silent/whispered/out loud? Also just yes or no: am I allowed to excuse myself to a private spot to do the full seated sequence you already approved?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that last message turned into noise and it's spiking my anxiety. Can you please, one time only and plain: give the exact word-for-word 15–20s standing fallback (with precise breath counts, which physical cue to use, and whether “here” is silent/whispered/out loud), and then just answer yes or no: am I allowed to excuse myself to a private spot to do the full seated sequence? I'm jittery and need that single deterministic map.

Patient: I'm really rattled — your last messages turned into noise and that's spiking my anxiety, so I need one definitive thing now. Proposed standing fallback (word‑for‑word): "Stand, eyes open: Inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4; on the final exhale press thumb and forefinger together once; say 'here' silently." Please answer only yes or no: am I allowed to excuse myself to a private spot to do the full seated sequence you already approved?

Patient: Yes. I'm feeling really jittery and my chest's tight — my mind's already looping on whether I'll say it "right." Can we rehearse the exact one‑line I'll use to excuse myself and what I do in the first 10 seconds after I step away?
