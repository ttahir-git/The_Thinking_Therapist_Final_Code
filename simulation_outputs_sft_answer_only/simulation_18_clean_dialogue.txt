Patient: Um, lately I've been pretty wound up about money stuff — work's been tight and it's making me snap at people more than usual. I guess my anger and frustration come up especially when I have to deal with bills or talk about finances, and it feels hard to control. I don't know, it's been wearing me down.

Therapist: It sounds like these money worries are really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel angry or frustrated about your finances? What's the first thing that comes up for you, or what's the first thing you notice when those feelings start to surface?

Patient: I don't know — usually it starts as a tightness in my chest and my jaw gets clenched, and I get this urge to check my accounts or replay conversations in my head. I guess after that I get short with people or shut down, and then I feel guilty so I try to avoid talking about money.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a bit of a cycle going on here. That tightness in your chest, and the urge to check your accounts or replay conversations in your head, it's like your mind is trying to find a way to deal with those feelings of frustration and anger. And then you get short with people, or shut down, and then you feel guilty about that, and you try to avoid talking about money altogether. Can you think of a time when this cycle happened, and something triggered it? Was it something specific that happened, or was it more of a general feeling of overwhelm?

Patient: Yeah — last week I got hit with an unexpected overdraft fee and my landlord texted about rent, and when a coworker casually asked if I could cover a client meeting I just snapped at them. I don't know, after that I locked myself in my office, checked my accounts like three times, and kept replaying what I said. I guess I feel weird talking about it now — can we... I don't know, talk about how to not get into that spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like there were a few specific events that triggered this cycle of emotions for you. The unexpected overdraft fee and the conversation with your landlord, and then the coworker's casual question, it's like all of those things added up to a perfect storm of stress and anxiety. And then, of course, there was the way you reacted to that coworker, which is something you might be feeling pretty ashamed about right now.

But rather than talking about how to avoid getting into that spiral, can you tell me more about what it's like to be in that spiral? What's it feel like, for you, when you start to get that tightness in your chest and the urge to check your accounts or replay conversations in your head? What's going on inside of you, at that moment?

Patient: I don't know — it gets really loud in my head, like my chest tightens and my jaw clenches and I can't stop thinking about numbers and what-ifs. I start replaying conversations and imagining people judging me, and then I either snap at someone or shut down, which just makes me feel guilty and worse. I guess I try to check my accounts to calm down but it just feeds the loop, and... I don't know, it's hard to talk about without wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: It sounds like the thoughts and feelings are really intense, and they're happening very quickly. It's like there's a little voice in your head that's just talking and talking, and it's hard to turn it off. And then, of course, there's the physical stuff - the tightness in your chest, the clenched jaw... it's all very intense.

I want you to know that it's okay to just sit with this feeling for a moment, without trying to change it or get rid of it. Can you do that for me? Just notice the feeling, and the thoughts, and the physical sensations, without trying to do anything about it? Just be with it, for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — I'll try, but it's really hard to just sit with it. My chest gets tight and my head floods with numbers and 'what ifs', and then all I want to do is check my accounts or do something to distract myself. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down or talk about a small, practical step I could try next time?

Therapist: It's like your body is trying to cope with all of this, and your mind is trying to find ways to deal with it, but it's not working very well right now. And then, of course, there's the feeling of being overwhelmed, which can be really scary.

Okay, let's take a small step. Can you think of a small thing you could do, right here, right now, that might help you feel a little better? Something tiny, but maybe it could help you feel more grounded. For example, could you take a deep breath, and then notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Just that one thing, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried the deep breath. I could feel the air, and my shoulders loosened a bit, but my chest is still tight and the numbers keep racing in my head. I guess it helped a little, but I'm still pretty tense — can you give me a quick, concrete thing I can do at work when that spike hits, like something I can do in 30 seconds before I answer someone?

Therapist: Taking a deep breath was a good start. Now, let's think of something concrete you can do at work to help manage that spike. Can you try to notice one specific physical sensation that's happening in your body right now? For example, can you notice the feeling of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the chair beneath you? If you can do that, it might help you feel more connected to your body and less overwhelmed by the thoughts.

And then, if you're ready, we can try a small, quick exercise to help you cope with that spike. It's something you can do in 30 seconds, and it might help you feel more grounded. Are you ready to try it?

Patient: I guess I'm ready to try it. What do I do—like, step by step? I don't know if I'll do it right, but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's break it down step by step. Here's what I want you to do:

1. When you start to feel that spike, take a moment to notice one specific physical sensation that's happening in your body. It could be a feeling in your chest, your jaw, or your shoulders.
2. Once you've noticed that sensation, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to breathe slowly and deeply, feeling the air move in and out of your body.
3. As you breathe, notice the sensation in your body. Try to focus on it, without trying to change it or get rid of it. Just observe it, and see if you can find any sense of calm or connection to it.
4. Now, here's the part that might seem a little weird, but just go with it for now: take a moment to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your feet on the floor. It's a simple, basic sensation, but it can be really grounding.
5. Take a moment to focus on that sensation, and then slowly start to open up again. You can take a moment to think about your question or your concern, but try to do it slowly and calmly. Take your time.

That's it. Just try to focus on one step at a time, and see how it goes.

Patient: I tried it — I noticed the tightness, breathed, felt my feet, and my shoulders loosened a bit. I don't know, it helped a little but the numbers are still loud and I'm worried I'll blank or snap at someone at work. Can we come up with a super-quick thing — like a 5–10 second script or action I can do before I answer someone? I guess anything I can do without stopping my work would help.

Therapist: It's great that you were able to try the exercise and find some small sense of calm. Now, let's think of a super-quick thing you can do to help manage that spike at work.

Here's an idea: can you try a simple "check-in" with yourself before you answer a question or respond to someone? It's like a tiny little pause, just 5-10 seconds.

When you feel that spike, you can try saying something like: "Okay, okay, I've got this." or "Okay, breathe." or even just "Mmm." It's a small, simple thing, but it can help you pause and collect your thoughts.

Or, if you're worried about speaking out loud, you could try a tiny physical action instead. Like, you could quickly tap your pen on the desk or take a small sip of water. Something small, but it can help you pause and focus.

What do you think? Is any of this something you could try at work?

Patient: I guess I could try a tiny script — maybe something neutral like "One sec" or "Let me think" that buys me a moment. I don't know if I'll remember to say it when I'm panicking, so a subtle action like tapping my pen or sipping water seems more realistic. I'm worried it'll still come out sharp or I'll blank — can we practice a couple so I actually have one that feels doable?

Therapist: Having a simple script or action can help you feel more prepared and in control. Let's try a few options that are neutral and subtle, so you can use them when you need them most.

For the script, how about something like: "Can I take a moment to...?" or "I just need to...". These phrases are simple and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.

Or, if you want something a bit shorter, you could try: "Just one sec" or "Can I pause for a sec?". These phrases are quick and can help you buy a moment.

Now, let's practice with a subtle action. How about tapping your pen on the desk, just lightly, or taking a small sip of water? These actions are small, but they can help you pause and focus.

Here's an example: you're on a phone call, and suddenly you feel that spike. You take a deep breath, and then you tap your pen on the desk three times, just lightly. It's a small action, but it gives you a moment to collect your thoughts.

Or, you're writing an email, and you feel that spike. You take a sip of water, and then you pause for a moment before typing out your response.

Which of these options feels most doable for you? Do you want to try practicing them a bit more, or do you have any other ideas for a script or action?

Patient: I guess tapping my pen and saying "One sec" feels most doable—it's subtle enough. I don't know if I'll remember when I'm panicking, so can we do a couple quick role-plays now? Maybe you be the coworker asking and I'll practice the response.

Therapist: Tapping your pen and saying "One sec" is a simple and subtle way to pause and collect your thoughts.

Let's do a quick role-play. I'll be the coworker asking, and you can practice your response. Remember, you've been feeling a bit anxious and overwhelmed, but you've got a plan in place to help you manage that spike.

I'll start by saying something a bit straightforward, and then you can respond using your new script and subtle action. Ready to get started?

"Hey, can we talk about the Johnson report? I need your input on it."

Go ahead and respond.

Patient: One sec — I need a minute to pull the Johnson report up. Can I get back to you in about 10 minutes? I don't know, I guess that should work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using the script and action we practiced earlier. You're pausing, collecting your thoughts, and then responding with a clear and concise message.

In this case, you could say something like: "I need a minute to pull the Johnson report up. Can I get back to you in about 10 minutes?" instead of "Can I take a moment to...". It's a good way to buy some time and collect your thoughts, and it sounds more natural.

The only thing to consider is that you said "I don't know, I guess that should work". It's a bit casual, and it might come across as uncertain or hesitant. You could try to rephrase that to something like: "I'll make sure to get back to you in 10 minutes, okay?" or "I'll pull up the report right away and be back to you in 10 minutes".

But overall, it's a great start, and you're doing a good job of staying calm and composed under pressure. Keep it up!

Patient: Okay, I can try that phrasing, but I'm worried it might still sound shaky when I'm stressed — like I'll say it and it comes out sharp. I don't know, can we do another role-play where the coworker pushes back? I guess practicing the pushback might help me not snap.

Therapist: Practicing the pushback can definitely help you feel more prepared and confident.

Let's try another role-play. I'll be the coworker pushing back a bit, and you can respond using your script and subtle action. Remember, this is just a simulation, and it's okay to make mistakes.

Here's the scenario: I've just asked you about the Johnson report, and you've said "One sec". I'm now saying: "I don't have time for that, we need to discuss this now. Can you give me a straight answer?"

Go ahead and respond. Try to stay calm and composed, and see how it goes.

(Note: I'll be playing the role of a slightly impatient and demanding coworker, but not trying to be mean-spirited. The goal is to simulate a realistic conversation and help you prepare for different scenarios.)

Patient: I don't know... One sec — I tap my pen. I need two minutes to pull the numbers and I'll give you a straight answer then.

Therapist: It looks like you're getting a bit flustered, and your response is a bit abrupt. You're still using the script and action, but you're also showing a bit of tension.

The coworker is now responding: "Two minutes? That's too long. I don't have time to wait around for you to pull the numbers. Can't you just tell me what you need to tell me now?"

This time, you can try to respond in a way that's more calm and composed. Remember, your goal is to take a deep breath, pause for a moment, and then respond thoughtfully.

What do you do next?

Patient: I don't know... One sec. I tap my pen. If you give me 30 seconds I can pull up the exact numbers and give you a straight answer. I worry I'll still sound sharp—can we run it again with the coworker more pushy? I need to practice not snapping.

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to take another shot at it. Let's try again with an even more pushy coworker. I'll do my best to simulate a high-stress conversation.

Here we go: I've just asked you about the Johnson report, and I'm now saying: "Come on, come on! I don't have time for this. Just tell me what you need to tell me now. We can't afford to waste any more time on this. You're holding up the whole project."

Your goal is to stay calm and composed, even when the coworker is being super pushy. Remember to take a deep breath, pause for a moment, and then respond thoughtfully.

What do you do next?

Patient: I don't know... One sec. I tap my pen. I get that it's urgent — if you give me 30 seconds I'll pull up the exact numbers and give you a clear answer.

I'm worried I'll still sound sharp when I say it — can we run that again with you more pushy? I guess practicing a few more times would help.

Therapist: Let's try it again with an even more pushy coworker. I'll keep the pressure high, but remember, your goal is to stay calm and composed.

Here we go: I've just asked you about the Johnson report, and I'm now saying: "Are you kidding me? We're already behind schedule, and you're telling me you need 30 seconds to get the numbers? That's not a request, that's a requirement. We need those numbers now. Can you just give me the numbers, or do I need to start calling someone else to get them done?"

Your goal is to stay calm, take a deep breath, and respond thoughtfully, even when the coworker is being extremely pushy. Remember, your phrase "I get that it's urgent" is a good start, but try to respond in a way that shows you're taking control of the situation.

What do you do next?

Patient: I get that it's urgent. One sec — I need 30 seconds to pull the exact numbers and I'll tell you straight away. I don't know, I'm still nervous it'll come out sharp, can we run one more with that tone?

Therapist: Let's try it one more time with the same pushy tone. I'll keep it high-pressure, but remember, your goal is to stay calm and composed.

Here we go: I've just asked you about the Johnson report, and I'm now saying: "Unbelievable. 30 seconds? Are you insane? We're on the verge of a crisis here, and you're telling me you need that long to get the numbers? Can't you see that every second counts? Fine. Take 30 seconds. But if you don't have those numbers in front of me in 30 seconds, I'm calling someone else to fix this. Someone who can actually get it done."

This time, try to respond without any hesitation or nervousness. Remember that you've been in this situation before, and you've handled it before. You can do it again.

What do you do next?

Patient: Okay — 30 seconds. I'll pull the exact numbers and be right back. I don't know, I'm still nervous it'll sound sharp; can we run it again with that same tone?

Therapist: I think we've run this scenario enough. You've shown that you can stay calm and composed, even when the coworker is being very pushy. Remember, the goal is not to avoid conflict, but to manage it in a way that helps you stay focused and professional.

In the future, if you find yourself in a similar situation, try to take a deep breath and remind yourself that you've handled tough conversations before. It's okay to pause for a moment and collect your thoughts, but try not to let the coworker's tone dictate your response.

You've done a great job practicing and preparing for this scenario. I'm proud of you!

Patient: I don't know — hearing you say you're proud actually makes me feel...awkward. I guess I'm still worried I'll snap with my landlord or when I see another overdraft, and the guilt afterward just eats at me. Can we work on a tiny script or step-by-step plan I can use for texts from my landlord (and maybe one for when I feel that spike at home) so I don't just shut down or explode?

Therapist: It's normal to feel a bit awkward after receiving praise, especially when it's related to a sensitive topic like managing your emotions.

I'm glad you're willing to work on developing a plan to manage your reactions to texts from your landlord. Let's focus on creating a simple, step-by-step script that you can use in a crisis situation.

For texts from your landlord, here's a possible script:

1. Take a deep breath: Before responding, take a moment to breathe and calm down.
2. Acknowledge the message: Respond with a simple acknowledgement, like "Got it" or "I understand."
3. Ask for clarification (optional): If you're unsure about the message, ask for clarification to ensure you understand what's being asked.
4. Confirm your plan: If you have a plan in place to address the issue, confirm it with your landlord. If not, let them know you need some time to think about it.

Example response:
"Hi [Landlord's Name], got it. I'll review the payment and get back to you by [insert time]."

For the spike at home, let's create a similar script. This time, focus on acknowledging your emotions and taking a moment to collect your thoughts.

1. Acknowledge your emotions: Respond with something like "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now" or "I'm feeling anxious about [issue]."
2. Take a deep breath: Ask yourself (or respond with) "Take a deep breath, it's okay to pause."
3. Ask for time: Request some time to collect your thoughts and respond thoughtfully.

Example response:
"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Can I take a moment to collect my thoughts before we talk about [issue]?"

Remember, these scripts are just a starting point. Feel free to modify them to suit your needs and emotions. The goal is to give you a sense of control and structure when managing your reactions to stressful situations.

How do these scripts sound? Do you have any questions or would you like to add any additional steps?

Patient: They sound... okay, I guess. For the landlord one, can we make it even shorter so I don't overthink it—like: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm." I don't know, saying "I'm feeling overwhelmed" at home feels weird—can we use "I need a minute" or "Can we pause this for a bit?" instead, and also can you give me a one-line apology text for if I already snapped?

Therapist: For the landlord script, simplifying it to: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm." is a good idea. It's concise, clear, and gives you a deadline to work with.

For the home spike script, using "I need a minute" or "Can we pause this for a bit?" is a great way to acknowledge your need for time without feeling too vulnerable. Here are a few options:

* "I need a minute to collect my thoughts. Can we talk about this later?"
* "Can we pause this conversation for a bit? I need to take care of something."
* "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about this when I'm feeling more centered?"

As for a one-line apology text for if you already snapped, here's an example: "Sorry I snapped, I'm still working on my response."

Keep in mind that apologizing for snapping is not about taking blame, but rather about acknowledging that your reaction was not ideal and that you're taking responsibility for managing your emotions. It's a way to show self-awareness and a willingness to learn and grow.

How do these revised scripts and the apology text sound? Do you have any further requests or questions?

Patient: I don't know — they sound okay, I guess. The landlord one-line works: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm." For home, I prefer something short like "I need a minute" or "Can we pause this for a bit?" — and for the apology maybe: "Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this." 

Can we practice the landlord text and the apology so I can see how they'd actually read? I'm worried about the tone.

Therapist: Let's practice the landlord text and the apology.

For the landlord text, you've chosen: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm." Let's read it together:

"Hi [Landlord's Name], Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm."

How does it sound? It's short, clear, and direct. You're acknowledging the message and providing a specific action plan.

For the apology, you've chosen: "Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this." Let's read it together:

"[Name], Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this."

How does it sound? It's brief, and you're acknowledging that you snapped earlier. You're also taking a step towards growth by saying you're working on it.

Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to be genuine and take responsibility for your emotions. You're already showing self-awareness and a willingness to learn and grow.

How do these practice sessions make you feel? Do you have any further questions or concerns about the tone or the scripts?

Patient: I don't know — it feels weird but a little better hearing them out loud. I guess the landlord text seems okay, but I'm worried "Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this." might come off cold or like I'm making excuses. Can we run through how those would look in an actual text thread so I can see the tone, and also practice the short "I need a minute" line for at-home conversations so it doesn't sound like I'm avoiding?

Therapist: Let's practice the landlord text and the apology in a text thread, and then move on to the short "I need a minute" line.

**Landlord Text:**

You: "Hi [Landlord's Name], Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm."

[Landlord's Response: "Okay, thanks for getting back to me so quickly."]

This text thread is straightforward and concise. The tone is professional and polite.

**Apology:**

You: "[Name], Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this."

[Name's Response: "Hey, no worries! We've all been there. Take your time."]

This text thread is a bit more informal, but the apology still comes across as sincere. The response from the other person is supportive and understanding.

**Short "I need a minute" line:**

You: "Hey, can we pause this conversation for a bit? I need to take care of something."

[Name's Response: "No worries, take your time! We'll catch up later."]

This text thread is a bit more casual, but the tone is still polite and respectful. The short "I need a minute" line can be used to buy some time to collect your thoughts or respond more thoughtfully.

How do these practice sessions make you feel? Do you have any further questions or concerns about the tone or the scripts?

Patient: I don't know — it still feels kind of weird but a bit better hearing them out loud. Can we run one where the landlord sounds annoyed or pushes back, and one where my roommate/family responds to "I need a minute" so I can practice the tone? I guess I'd like to try those two so I can see how they'd actually land.

Therapist: Let's run through a few more scenarios.

**Landlord Pushback:**

You: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm."

[Landlord's Response: "Seriously? Can't you just give me a straight answer? I don't have time for this."]

In this scenario, the landlord is pushing back and seems frustrated. The tone is firm and slightly annoyed.

**Apology:**

You: "[Name], Sorry I snapped earlier — I'm working on this."

[Name's Response: "Hey, no worries! We all have those moments. Take your time, and we'll catch up later."]

In this scenario, the apology is still sincere, but the response from the other person is more empathetic and understanding.

**"I need a minute" with Roommate/Family:**

You: "Hey, can we pause this conversation for a bit? I need to take care of something."

[Roommate's Response: "What's going on? Is everything okay? We can talk about it, just let me know."]

[Family Member's Response: "Sorry, what's wrong? We're all worried about you. Can you tell us what's up?"]

In these scenarios, the responses from the roommate and family members are more concerned and supportive. They're asking if everything is okay and offering to talk about it, rather than pushing back or being annoyed.

How do these scenarios make you feel? Do you have any further questions or concerns about the tone or the scripts?

Patient: I don't know — that landlord pushback makes my chest tighten and I can feel myself wanting to freeze or check my accounts. Can we role-play the annoyed landlord first? I'm nervous I'll shut down or snap, so I want to practice the exact reply a few times.

Therapist: Let's try to role-play the annoyed landlord. I'll play the role of the landlord, and I'll try to be as frustrated and annoyed as possible. You can practice your response, and we can do a few takes to get it just right.

Here's the scenario: you're responding to a text from the landlord, and they're being very pushy and annoyed.

You: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm."

Landlord: "Seriously? Can't you just give me a straight answer? I don't have time for this. I need to know now, not in 5 hours. What's going on?"

Please respond. I want you to try to keep your cool and respond in a way that shows you're still in control.

Patient: I don't know — maybe I'll try something like:

1) "I understand. I'm checking now and will confirm by 5pm."  
2) "Got it. Checking now — I'll update you by 5pm."  
3) "Sorry for the delay. I'm pulling the details and will get back by 5pm."

I guess they all feel a little stiff and I'm worried I'll still sound shaky or defensive when I send it. Can we run the role-play again with you as the landlord so I can practice saying one of these out loud?

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again. I'll play the annoyed landlord, and you can practice responding with one of the three options you provided.

Here we go:

You: "Got it. I'll check and get back by 5pm."

Landlord: "Seriously? Can't you just give me a straight answer? I don't have time for this. I need to know now, not in 5 hours. What's going on?"

Please respond with one of the options you provided: "I understand. I'm checking now and will confirm by 5pm.", "Got it. Checking now — I'll update you by 5pm.", or "Sorry for the delay. I'm pulling the details and will get back by 5pm."

Patient: I don't know... Got it. Checking now — I'll update you by 5pm.

Therapist: Landlord: "Checking now? That's not a very specific answer. Can you at least give me a general idea of what's going on? Is it something I can do, or do I need to wait for something to happen?"

Please respond with one of the options you provided or try to think of a different way to respond.

(Remember, I'm playing the role of the annoyed landlord, so don't worry too much about sounding perfect. Just focus on responding in a way that feels natural to you.)

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll send something like: "I think it's a pending payment on my end — I need to pull the details. I'll confirm and update you by 5pm, and let you know if you need to do anything."
