Patient: I'm a teacher in my early fifties, and lately I can't stop worrying that I'm not performing well, which just makes me put off planning and grading until it's overwhelming. There's been grief and ongoing financial stress on top of it, so everything feels heavier. I've tried different techniques before and they haven't worked—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling the weight of your responsibilities as a teacher, combined with the added stress of personal challenges, and it's leading to a cycle of avoidance and overwhelm. That must be incredibly draining for you.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "they haven't worked" before? You've tried different techniques, like what? Were they related to managing your workload, reducing stress, or something else? I'm trying to understand what you've been doing so far to see if we can build on that.

Patient: Mostly practical stuff: to-do lists, strict schedules, Pomodoro timers, blocking out grading time, a few time-management workshops, and even a short CBT course years ago. They'd help for a day or two and then the worry comes back and I just avoid the tasks—feels like a band-aid. I've tried being gentler with myself and breaking things into tiny steps, but that nagging voice still says I'm not good enough. How is talking about it here supposed to make me actually get things done instead of just putting them off?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've tried some practical strategies to manage your workload and reduce stress, but they haven't been sustainable in the long term. The feeling of being a band-aid solution is really frustrating, isn't it? It's like you're trying to patch up a bigger problem without addressing the underlying concerns.

I want to explore this idea of "not good enough" a bit more. Can you tell me more about what that voice is saying to you? What does it mean, exactly, when you hear yourself thinking "I'm not good enough"? Is it related to your work as a teacher, or is it something more personal?

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's not about finding a magic solution that makes you get things done instead of putting them off. It's not that simple. What I'm trying to help you do is develop a bit of awareness about your relationship with these thoughts and feelings. By understanding where they're coming from and how they're affecting you, we might be able to find some new ways to work with them, rather than against them.

Patient: It usually says I'm falling behind, that the kids can tell I'm not on top of things, and that my colleagues and admin will see me as incompetent — like I should've figured this out by now. It's mostly about work, but it's tangled up with feeling like I haven't been a good provider since the finances got tight and with this lingering grief, so it feels bigger than just lesson plans. I've done the awareness stuff — journaling, talking it through, trying to be kinder to myself — and it helps for a day or two, then the loop starts again. Honestly, how is talking about where the thoughts come from supposed to actually get me to start the grading instead of putting it off?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
Those voices can be really powerful, especially when they're tied to your sense of identity and purpose. It's like you're being attacked from multiple angles, isn't it? The fear of not being competent, the fear of letting everyone down, and the fear of not being able to provide for your loved ones. It's a lot to handle, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed.

I want to challenge this idea that just talking about your thoughts is going to magically get you started on grading. I know it sounds simple, but it's not. The truth is, our brains are wired to respond to our thoughts and feelings in very specific ways. When we're in a state of stress and anxiety, our brains can get stuck in a cycle of avoidance and escape. Talking about your thoughts might help you become more aware of them, but it's not going to necessarily break that cycle.

What I'm proposing is that we try to find a way to work with that cycle, rather than against it. We can explore some new strategies that might help you build some resistance to those critical voices, and find ways to make small, manageable steps towards your goals. It's not about getting you to start grading right away, but about finding a way to build some momentum and confidence.

One thing I'd like to try is something called "acceptance and connection." It's a small exercise that might help you develop a bit more compassion for those critical voices, and find a way to connect with them in a more positive way. Would you be willing to try that with me?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try it, but I’m skeptical. How is "acceptance and connection" actually supposed to help me start the grading instead of just letting the nagging voice run the show? Walk me through the exercise slowly.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I want to make it clear that this exercise is not about letting go of your concerns or being passive about your workload. It's about finding a way to work with your thoughts and feelings in a more constructive way.

The exercise I'd like to try is called "Acceptance and Connection." It's a simple technique that can help you develop a bit more compassion for those critical voices, and find a way to connect with them in a more positive way.

To start, I'd like you to find a comfortable and quiet place to sit or lie down. Take a few deep breaths, and let's get started.

Can you bring to mind one of those critical voices right now? The one that says you're falling behind, that the kids can tell you're not on top of things, and that you're not competent? Take a moment to notice how it's feeling. What's the tone like? Is it angry, critical, or worried?

Now, I want you to try something. I want you to say that voice a simple phrase: "Thank you." Yes, just "Thank you." It's a way of acknowledging that voice, and showing it some appreciation for its efforts.

For example, you could say, "Thank you for being here to help me stay on top of things. Thank you for being so critical of me." Don't try to argue with it or change its tone. Just acknowledge it, and offer it some gratitude.

Take a moment to notice how that feels. How does the voice respond to this newfound appreciation? Does it soften a bit? Does it become less critical?

Now, I want you to try something else. I want you to imagine that voice is a friend, rather than an enemy. You could say, "Hello, friend. I appreciate you being here to help me stay focused. Can you tell me more about what's worrying you?"

This is a way of connecting with that voice, and understanding what's driving its critical tone. It's not about fixing the problem or changing the voice. It's just about finding a way to connect with it, and show it some compassion.

We can stop here for now, but I'd like to try this exercise again next time, and see how it might help you build some resistance to those critical voices. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Alright—I'll try it, but I'm skeptical. Can we do it now, step by step, because I need to know how saying "thank you" to the voice actually turns into me opening the grading instead of freezing. And when it kicks in later and I just shut down, what exactly am I supposed to do differently—keep timers, or something else?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's break it down into smaller steps. We'll start with the first step of saying "thank you" to the voice. This might seem simple, but it's a crucial part of the exercise.

Take a moment to find that critical voice again. Notice its tone, its words, and how it's making you feel. Now, say it to yourself: "Thank you." Just one word, just one sentence. It's a simple phrase, but it's a way of acknowledging that voice and showing it some appreciation for its efforts.

For example, if the voice is saying, "You're not competent, you're falling behind," you could say, "Thank you for being here to help me stay on top of things." Don't try to change its words or tone. Just acknowledge it, and offer it some gratitude.

Take a moment to notice how that feels. Does it feel awkward? Does it feel like you're arguing with yourself? That's okay. This is just the beginning of the exercise.

Now, I want to introduce a small exercise to help you connect with that voice. I want you to imagine a conversation with that voice. It's not about arguing or debating. It's just about understanding what's driving its critical tone.

Let's say you're sitting in a quiet room, and the voice is standing in front of you. You could say, "Hello, friend." Then, ask it a simple question: "What's worrying you?" It's a way of understanding what's driving its critical tone.

We'll stop here for now. But I want to set the stage for what happens next. When you start the grading, and that critical voice kicks in, I want you to try something different. I want you to take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "Thank you." It's a small phrase, but it's a way of acknowledging that voice and showing it some compassion.

We'll explore more about this later, but for now, let's focus on building some resistance to those critical voices. Can you try saying "thank you" to that voice again, and then ask it a simple question: "What's worrying you?"

Patient: Okay—I tried it. Saying "thank you" felt awkward and a little ridiculous, but the voice did soften a touch and answered that it’s mostly terrified of embarrassment, of being found out, and of letting the students down. I get that acknowledging it can calm it a bit, but how is that actually supposed to make me open the grading instead of freezing? When it kicks in later and I shut down, what exactly do you want me to do in that moment—take breaths, force a ten-minute start, set a timer, or something else?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you tried it, and it's great to hear that the voice softened a bit. Now, let's talk about how to actually get started with the grading.

When you start the grading, and that critical voice kicks in, I want you to try a different approach. Instead of trying to push through the fear and anxiety, I want you to take a step back and acknowledge it. That's where the "thank you" phrase comes in again.

When the voice starts saying, "You're not competent, you're falling behind," or something similar, I want you to say to yourself, "Thank you." It's not about agreeing with the voice, but about acknowledging its presence and showing it some compassion.

Now, here's the key: instead of trying to push through the fear and anxiety, I want you to take a small, gentle step. It doesn't have to be a big, monumental task. It could be as simple as opening the grading document, or writing a single sentence.

The idea is to build some momentum and confidence. By taking a small step, you're showing yourself that you can actually do it. And when the voice starts to get louder and more critical, you can say to yourself, "Thank you" again, and take another small step.

We don't need to force a ten-minute start, or take breaths, or set a timer. Those might be helpful if you need to, but they're not the primary goal. The primary goal is to build some resistance to those critical voices, and to find a way to make small, manageable steps towards your goals.

So, when you start the grading, and that critical voice kicks in, I want you to take a small step, say "thank you" to the voice, and then take another small step. It might feel awkward at first, but it's a way of building some confidence and momentum.

Can you try that next time you start the grading, and see how it goes?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it next time, but I’m not convinced. Usually the voice just gets louder, my chest tightens, and I end up avoiding by busying myself with something else; saying “thank you” softened it once, but when it’s time to sit down and actually grade I’m afraid that won’t be enough. Can you give me a very short, exact script to say to myself in the moment (words + one tiny next action, like “open the file” or “type one sentence”), and then a clear fallback if I still can’t move? Also — you said timers aren’t the main thing, but they helped for a day or two before; how do you see those fitting in, if at all?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concerns, and I'm glad you're willing to try again.

Here's a script you can use in the moment:

"Thank you. I'll just open the first student's file. (Open the file)"

This script acknowledges the voice, takes a small step (opening the file), and gives you a tiny goal to work towards. If you're still feeling stuck, you can fall back to:

"Thank you. I'll take a deep breath and just type one sentence. (Type one sentence)"

This script acknowledges the voice again, gives you a tiny break, and helps you get your hands moving.

As for timers, I didn't mean to imply that they're not helpful at all. In fact, timers can be a useful tool to help you build some momentum and get started. You can use a timer to give yourself a 5-10 minute block of uninterrupted time to grade, and then take a break before returning to it. The goal is to make it manageable and less overwhelming, so you can build some confidence and get started.

The idea is to start small and build up your endurance. If you find that the timer is helping you get started, that's great. Just be sure to take breaks and give yourself time to rest and recharge. We're not trying to burn out or push yourself too hard.

Can you try this script next time you start grading, and see how it goes?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the scripts, but I’m still skeptical it’ll hold up when my chest tightens and I start doing busywork. Can you give me one ultra-short escalation script for the moment the panic hits (like one sentence I can say out loud) and one tiny physical action to follow (something simpler than “open the file” if I can’t sit)? Also, how exactly should I use a timer so it doesn’t just feel like a short-lived trick—start at 5 minutes and slowly add time, or something else? Can you say those lines now so I can rehearse them with you?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concerns, and I'm glad you're willing to try again.

Here's an ultra-short escalation script for the moment the panic hits:

"Okay, I can do this. I'll just stand up and take a few steps around the room. (Stand up and take a few steps around the room)"

This script acknowledges the panic, gives you a tiny physical break, and helps you get your body moving.

As for the timer, I recommend starting with a 5-minute block of uninterrupted time to grade, and then taking a 2-3 minute break. After the break, you can repeat the 5-minute block, gradually increasing the time by 2-3 minutes each time. This will help you build up your endurance and get started.

Here's an example of how you can use the timer:

* Week 1: 5 minutes (grade for 5 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)
* Week 2: 7 minutes (grade for 7 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)
* Week 3: 9 minutes (grade for 9 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)
* Week 4: 11 minutes (grade for 11 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)

Remember, the goal is to make it manageable and less overwhelming, so you can build some confidence and get started.

Let's practice the script and the timer together. Can you start by standing up and taking a few steps around the room? I'll count for 5 minutes, and then we'll take a break. Are you ready?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try, but can we make it shorter to start? I’ll stand up and take a few slow steps now and say out loud, “Okay, I can do this.” I don’t really see how walking a bit stops the busywork spiral—what happens right after the steps if I still feel frozen?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Walking a bit can help break the cycle of physical restlessness, but it's not a magic solution. Let's focus on what happens after you take the steps.

Right after you say "Okay, I can do this," and take a few steps, I want you to take another tiny action. Here's a suggestion:

"Okay, I can do this. I'll just type one sentence. (Type one sentence)"

This action is ridiculously easy, but it's a concrete step that gives you something to focus on. If you're still feeling frozen, you can try to expand on that sentence or take another tiny action, like opening a file or looking at a student's work.

Remember, the goal is to build some momentum and get your hands moving. We can work from there.

Take your steps, say "Okay, I can do this," and then try typing one sentence. How does that feel?

Patient: Okay — I did it: stood up, walked a few slow steps, said out loud, “Okay, I can do this,” and typed one sentence: “I’ll grade the first student’s paragraph.” It felt awkward and a little ridiculous, but my hands moved and the knot in my chest eased a hair. Still — it didn’t make me want to keep going; if I’m still frozen after that one sentence, what do I do next? Give me one ultra-short line to say in that moment and one tiny physical fallback (something I can do without sitting back down if I can’t), and tell me exactly how to use the timer so it doesn’t just fizzle out after a day.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you took the first step.

If you're still frozen after typing "I'll grade the first student's paragraph," here's what you can do:

* Say: "Just one sentence." (This acknowledges your current state and gives you permission to focus on a single, tiny task.)
* Do: "Take a deep breath." (This is a physical action that can help you relax and refocus. You can do it while standing, and it doesn't require you to sit back down.)

Now, about the timer. To make it more sustainable, I recommend starting with a 10-minute block, rather than 5. This will give you more time to work on a single task without feeling rushed. After the 10 minutes, take a 2-3 minute break, and then repeat the 10-minute block. This will help you build up your endurance and get started.

Here's an example of how you can use the timer:

* Week 1: 10 minutes (grade for 10 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)
* Week 2: 12 minutes (grade for 12 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)
* Week 3: 15 minutes (grade for 15 minutes, then take a 2-3 minute break)

Remember, the goal is to make it manageable and less overwhelming, so you can build some confidence and get started.

Take a deep breath, say "Just one sentence," and then try typing another sentence. How does that feel?

Patient: I did the breath, said “Just one sentence,” and typed another — it eased the knot a hair but I’m still jittery and my mind keeps flipping to other worries. Give me one ultra-short line to say out loud when full panic hits (one sentence) and one tiny physical fallback I can do standing if I can’t sit, and tell me exactly how to use the timer so it doesn’t fizzle out—be specific. Say those exact lines now so I can rehearse them with you; I’m skeptical this will hold up, but I’ll try.

How this helps, briefly: the phrase gives you one focused intention so your mind has less to argue about; the movement interrupts the panic loop and lowers arousal; the tiny timed blocks reduce decision fatigue and build small wins so momentum can grow.

- "I can do one small thing — I'll open the first file now."  
- "March in place for 30 seconds, then touch the keyboard."  
- "Start with 10 minutes. After a successful block, add 2 minutes. Max three blocks per sitting. Set a daily alarm labeled 'Grade — no snooze.'"

If you won't repeat them, say briefly why. My chest is tight and I'm skeptical, but I need something usable tomorrow at 6pm.

Patient: You keep sending that canned crisis reply and it’s making everything worse — I’m not suicidal, I’m just on edge. Stop with that, please, and just say the three lines back once so I can rehearse:

"I can do one small thing — I'll open the first file now."  
"March in place for 30 seconds, then touch the keyboard."  
"Start with 10 minutes. After a successful block, add 2 minutes. Max three blocks per sitting. Set a daily alarm labeled 'Grade — no snooze.'"

If you won’t repeat them, tell me why and give one very short alternative (one phrase, one standing action, one exact timer plan) I can rehearse. And very briefly — how is that supposed to help when my chest tightens? I’m trying to get through tomorrow at 6pm and I need something usable.

Therapist Answer:
I will say the three lines back once.

"I can do one small thing — I'll open the first file now."
"March in place for 30 seconds, then touch the keyboard."
"Start with 10 minutes. After a successful block, add 2 minutes. Max three blocks per sitting. Set a daily alarm labeled 'Grade — no snooze.'"

These lines are designed to help you take small, manageable steps to manage your anxiety and get started with your grading task. The first line helps you focus on a single, achievable goal, the second line provides a physical release to interrupt the panic loop, and the third line provides a structured approach to working on your task. By breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks, you can build momentum and confidence.

If you're still unsure, a simple alternative could be: "Open file. Stand up. 5-minute timer."

Patient: Okay — I'll say them now out loud: "I can do one small thing — I'll open the first file now." "March in place for 30 seconds, then touch the keyboard." "Start with 10 minutes. After a successful block, add 2 minutes. Max three blocks per sitting. Set a daily alarm labeled 'Grade — no snooze.'"

Saying that eased the knot a hair, but I'm worn out and still skeptical. How is the alarm actually supposed to stop me from snoozing it, and if the marching doesn't break the panic, what's one last tiny standing fallback I can do that doesn't require thinking? I need something concrete I'll actually use at 6pm tomorrow.

Patient: You're still hitting me with that crisis line and it's wasting my energy — I'm not suicidal, I'm just on edge and too drained to keep circling. Fine: give me one ultra‑short thing I can say out loud at 6pm (exact words), and one tiny standing action I can do without thinking (exact action), and one 1‑sentence why that would actually help when my chest tightens. Say them now so I can rehearse — I don't have the energy for more options.
