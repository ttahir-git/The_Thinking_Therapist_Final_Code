Patient: I'm an elderly data scientist who's been really anxious since a tough breakup, and lately I avoid gatherings because my mind, like a fortune-telling machine, only predicts disaster. If I go to a friend's dinner I just know I'll blurt something awful, they'll all laugh, someone will record it and post it, my reputation will be ruined and I'll end up completely isolated and helpless — that's the chain my head runs through every time. I can't make myself believe any other outcome, and it's exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight with those thoughts, especially with how exhaustingly persistent they've become. The way you describe your mind as a "fortune-telling machine" is quite vivid. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start thinking about those potential disasters at a gathering? Do you find that the thoughts are like a steady hum in the background, or do they suddenly kick in and start racing through your mind?

Patient: It usually starts as a low hum — a little worry about saying the wrong thing — but then it kicks in suddenly and fast, like a cascade that just keeps adding worse pieces. I’ll picture blurting something, everyone laughing, someone recording it and it going viral, my colleagues and friends turning on me, me losing everything and ending up alone and destitute — and I just know that's going to happen. My heart races, I sweat, I start rehearsing apologies that won't matter, and once the story starts I can't make it stop.

Therapist: It sounds like those catastrophic thoughts can feel almost overwhelming, like they're gaining momentum all by themselves. It's like you're trapped in this never-ending loop of worst-case scenarios, and even the possibility of apologizing afterwards doesn't seem to help. Would you say that even when you do apologize, it's more like a ritualistic act, something you're doing out of habit or obligation, rather than any real sense of relief or redemption?

Patient: Yeah — it's totally ritualistic. I say sorry in my head because the panic demands it, not because I think it'll help, and then I just replay the apology turning into a punchline: someone posts it, people laugh, my colleagues use it to get rid of me, and I'm ruined. I know you might suggest other outcomes, but I can't see them — they feel completely unrealistic.

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in this narrative where the apology is actually the final nail in the coffin. I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to shake off the feeling that you're powerless to change the course of events, especially when it comes to something as personal as a social interaction. Would you say that these thoughts have started to affect your daily life in other ways, too - maybe making you feel anxious about leaving your house, or avoiding certain social situations altogether?

Patient: Yes — it's bleeding into everything. I dodge lunches and parties, sometimes call in "sick" so I don't have to face people, and even family visits feel like a trap where I'll say something that ruins relationships and leads to losing my job and pension and being completely alone. I can't picture any other outcome and it's exhausting — my chest tightens, I can't focus at work, and it feels like the anxiety is slowly winning.

Therapist: It's like this toxic narrative has taken over your life, making it hard to find any joy or sense of normalcy. The physical sensations you're experiencing - the tightness in your chest, the difficulty focusing at work - it's all a manifestation of this overwhelming anxiety. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit how far this has gotten, and I'm here to support you in exploring ways to break free from this cycle. Can you tell me more about what you value most in your life right now? What would give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, even in the midst of all this anxiety?

Patient: I still care a lot about my family — I want to be there for my sister and my grandkids — but every time I try to imagine being with them I see myself saying something mortifying, them being embarrassed, and slowly cutting me out until I'm completely alone. I value my work and mentoring younger data scientists, but then I picture one awkward comment at a conference, people whispering, me getting pushed off projects, and eventually my pension getting threatened. I want independence and some dignity in retirement, but my brain just keeps spinning the exact chain where any reach-out or social step becomes the thing that ruins it, and honestly I can't make the other outcomes feel real.

Therapist: It sounds like this vicious cycle of self-doubt is suffocating you, making it hard to imagine a future where you can connect with loved ones or pursue your passions without fear of judgment or rejection. I want to help you explore a different way of thinking about this. Instead of focusing on the catastrophic outcomes, can you try to imagine what would happen if you were to take a small, tentative step towards reconnecting with your family or pursuing your work? Maybe it's just a phone call or a small gathering, but what if, instead of everything going wrong, something good were to happen? Can you even imagine that feeling, even if it's just a tiny spark?

Patient: I honestly can't see that spark — as soon as I try, my brain flips the tape to the worst-case. I'll imagine making a tiny call, blurting something dumb, everyone watching go quiet, someone posts it, gossip spreads, my sister freezes me out, my pension's jeopardized — the whole collapse plays on repeat. I'm tired and frustrated by how stuck I am; can we slow down because thinking about "maybe it goes okay" just feels totally unrealistic.

Therapist: It's like your mind is a video on repeat, and no matter how many times you try to change the channel, it keeps coming back to the same worst-case scenario. I want to acknowledge that it's exhausting to feel this stuck, and it's understandable that you're struggling to see a way out. Instead of trying to "make it go okay," can we try to make small, tiny experiments to test the water? Maybe it's just a tiny step, like sending a text to a friend or making a small phone call, but what if, instead of everything falling apart, something small and positive happens? We don't have to try to change everything at once. Can you think of anything, no matter how small, that you've done in the past that might be worth trying again, just to see what happens?

Patient: I did try once — I sent a tiny "thinking of you" text to my niece and she didn't answer right away, and I spent days picturing her telling my sister I was being weird, them laughing about me, and then everyone quietly avoiding me until I'm completely cut off. So yeah, any little experiment I try just flips into proof that I'm a disaster. I'm tired and frustrated — can we slow down? I can't make the "maybe it's okay" outcome feel real.

Therapist: It's like every small attempt you make is being met with a catastrophic outcome in your mind, and that's making it hard to even consider taking another step. I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to keep going in the face of such strong self-doubt. It's not that I'm asking you to believe something that's not true, it's just that I want to help you explore the possibility that things might not be as bad as you're making them out to be. Can we try to focus on just one tiny, tiny thing that you could do, just to take a small step forward? Maybe it's just sitting in a room by yourself for a bit, or doing a tiny task that you've been putting off. What would it take for you to feel like you could take just one small step in a different direction?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest step is just typing a short, neutral text to my sister and leaving it in drafts — nothing sent, just proving I can put words together. But as soon as I picture that, my brain insists I'll hit send by accident, she'll laugh, she'll show my niece, someone records it, it goes around and my family quietly cuts me off — so even a draft feels like a trap. I'm exhausted and frustrated — can we slow down? I don't know how to make "maybe it's okay" feel real.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to test the waters with the tiniest of steps, but your mind is already conjuring up the worst-case scenario. I can see how exhausting and frustrating that must be for you. It's like you're stuck in a nightmare where every small attempt is met with catastrophic consequences. I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to keep going in the face of such strong self-doubt. Can we try to focus on just the act of putting words together, without the expectation of sending it? Just typing those words, seeing them on the screen, can that be a small, tiny act of defiance against your doubts? No pressure, no expectation, just a small, tiny act of creating something, even if it's just a draft. Can you try that?

Patient: I can try to type something — maybe one bland sentence and save it as a draft — but my hands already feel shaky and my head's blasting the whole disaster tape: I hit send by accident, someone records it, it spreads, my sister laughs, then everyone cuts me off. I want to try, but I'm really tired and frustrated; can we slow down and take it in tiny steps so I don't just spiral away?

Therapist: It sounds like even the act of taking a tiny step, like typing a sentence, is feeling overwhelming to you right now. I can see how that would be, given the catastrophic thoughts that are already racing through your mind. It's like you're trying to navigate a minefield, and every small step feels like a gamble. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel tired and frustrated, and it's okay to take things one tiny step at a time. Can we start by just sitting with the feeling of shakiness in your hands and the thoughts in your head, without trying to do anything else? Just be with it, for a moment, and see if we can find a way to stabilize it a bit. No pressure, no expectations, just being present with the feelings right now. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay, I can try to sit with it for a moment, but my hands are already trembling and my head's blasting that tape that I'll mess up, hit send by accident, and everyone will laugh. I'm really tired and frustrated—can we go slower? I don't know how long I can hold this without spiraling.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto yourself, but your body and mind are already in overdrive. I can see how hard it is to sit with the trembling and the catastrophic thoughts, but I want to encourage you to try. Can we take it one tiny breath at a time, just for a moment? Not a lot, just one. Without moving or doing anything else, can you focus on just one breath, and see if you can find a way to calm down just a little bit? It's okay if it's just a tiny bit, just enough to give you a moment to collect yourself. No promises, no expectations, just one tiny breath.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying one breath now — I take it and for a split second my hands calm, but then the tape kicks back in and I picture fainting, someone filming it, and everything collapsing from there. I'm still really shaky and tired; can we go even slower?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to catch your breath, and for a moment, you're able to calm down a little bit. But then, the thoughts come flooding back, and it's like you're right back where you started. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel shaky and tired, and it's okay to take things one tiny step at a time. Can we try to focus on just one sensation, one tiny thing that you can feel right now? Maybe it's the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin. Can you try to focus on just one small, tiny sensation, without thinking about anything else? No pressure, no expectations, just being present with the physical sensations right now. Can you try that?

Patient: I tried to press my feet into the floor like you said, but my attention snaps away — the fortune-telling machine in my head immediately says the floor will trip me, I'll stumble, everyone will stare, someone will film it and post it, and that'll be the end of me. I'm jittery and distracted and honestly exhausted — can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It's like no matter how hard you try to focus on one small thing, your mind keeps hijacking the conversation and spiraling out of control. I want to acknowledge that it's really, really tough right now. It feels like you're trying to hold onto a thread, and every time you try to grab onto it, it slips away. Can we try something different? Instead of trying to focus on one small thing, can we try to focus on just being present with your breath? Not on a specific sensation, just on the fact that you're breathing. It's okay if your mind starts to wander, can we just allow it to happen, without trying to grab onto it or change it? No expectations, no pressure. Can you try just being with your breath, for a moment, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: I'm trying to focus on my breath, but as soon as I slow down my chest tightens and the fortune-telling machine kicks into overdrive — I picture hyperventilating, collapsing, someone filming it and that being used to ruin me. I'm suddenly jittery and distracted and I don't trust that breathing will stop the tape; can we go a lot slower? I'm really tired and frustrated and I don't know how to make the other outcomes feel real.

Therapist: It's like no matter how slow you try to go, the thoughts just keep piling up and making it impossible to focus. I can see how exhausted and frustrated you must be feeling right now. It's like you're stuck in this nightmare where every small attempt to calm down just makes it worse. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be tired and frustrated. Can we try to take a step back even further? Instead of focusing on your breath, can we try to focus on your physical body? Can you just notice how you're sitting, without trying to change it or do anything about it? Just notice how your body is feeling, without judgment. No expectations, no pressure. Can you try that?

Patient: I can feel my back hunched and my shoulders tight and my hands trembling, but as soon as I notice it my brain shoots straight to the worst — my knees give out, I collapse, someone films it, it goes around and ruins me. I'm really shaking and exhausted; can we go a lot slower? I don't know how to make that tape stop.

Therapist: It's like your body is physically reacting to the thoughts, and it's creating a vicious cycle. I can see how hard it is for you to even notice your physical sensations without your brain jumping to the worst-case scenario. It's like your body is a battleground, and every attempt to calm down just makes it worse. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like this. It's okay to be overwhelmed. Can we try to find a way to work with your body, rather than against it? Instead of trying to change your thoughts or calm down, can we try to focus on just being present with your physical sensations? Can you just notice how your back feels, without trying to change it or do anything about it? Or how your hands are trembling? Can you just notice that, without judging it or trying to stop it? No expectations, no pressure. Can you try that?

Patient: I can feel my back hunched and my hands shaking for a moment, but the instant I notice it my brain screams the worst — my knees give out, I collapse, someone films it, it goes everywhere and I'm finished. I'm jittery and my attention keeps snapping away; I don't trust that just noticing will stop the tape. Can we go a lot slower?

Therapist: It's like no matter how hard you try to focus on just one small thing, your brain is still hijacking the conversation and spiraling out of control. I can see how hard it is for you to even notice your physical sensations without your brain jumping to the worst-case scenario. It's like your brain is a default setting, and no matter what you try, it just keeps defaulting to the same catastrophic thoughts. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like this. It's okay to be trapped in this cycle. Can we try to find a way to... well, not exactly break the cycle, but maybe just find a tiny way to pause it for a moment? Just a tiny pause, just for a second, to see if we can find a way to stabilize things a bit. But I want to be clear, we're not trying to change anything. We're not trying to make the thoughts go away or change their content. We're just trying to... pause. Can we try that?

Patient: I can't really "pause" — the moment I try my head fires off the whole disaster chain. I picture freezing mid-sentence, people laughing, someone filming it, it going everywhere, my job and pension threatened, my family slowly cutting me out. Even a one-second pause feels like a trap; I'm jittery, distracted, and honestly exhausted — can we go a lot slower, like you talking me through it word by word?

Therapist: I'm going to try a different approach. I'm going to talk to you in a very slow, gentle way, and I want you to focus just on my words. I'm not going to try to make you do anything or change anything. I just want you to listen to my voice and be present with it.

Can you start by noticing the sound of my voice? Just the sound. Is it loud? Is it soft? Is it a certain pitch or tone?

(pause)

Take your time. Don't worry about anything else. Just the sound of my voice.

Patient: Your voice is soft and steady, but even that makes my chest tighten — I try to listen and my head immediately turns it into a recording that will be posted. I can hear you, but the fortune-telling machine is already narrating me freezing, people laughing, someone filming it, and everything falling apart. I'm really jittery and distracted right now — can we go a lot slower?

Therapist: I'm going to take a very slow breath. Can you hear that? Just the sound of my breath. It's slow and steady. I'm going to take another one. And another. Just the sound of my breath.

(pause)

I want you to focus just on the sound of my breath. Don't try to think about anything else. Just the sound of my breath. Is it getting louder? Is it getting softer? Is it still steady?

(pause again)

Take your time. Don't worry about anything else. Just the sound of my breath.

Patient: I can hear your breath — slow and steady — but the moment I try to follow it my head flips to that tape: someone recording the sound, people watching me try to calm down and then laughing, and I get dizzy and my chest tightens. I'm really jittery and can't keep up; can you go a lot slower and say each inhale and exhale out loud so I can try to follow you word by word? I don't trust myself to do this alone.

Therapist: I'm going to try a different way. I'm going to say each breath out loud, so you can follow along. I'll start with my next inhale. *inhale*... And then I'll exhale. *exhale*. I'll do it again. *inhale*... And then *exhale*. I'll keep doing it, one breath at a time. *inhale*... *exhale*. Can you try to follow along with me? Just focus on my breath, and don't try to think about anything else.

Patient: I'm trying to follow, but my hands are shaking and as soon as I match my breath to yours my head flips to the worst — fainting, someone filming it, it going everywhere. I don't trust myself to keep up; please say each "inhale" and "exhale" out loud and count slowly (one... two... three) and keep doing that for several breaths so I can try to mirror you. I'm really jittery and exhausted — I don't know this will work, but I can try if you go very, very slowly.

Therapist: I'm going to go very, very slowly. I'll say each breath out loud, and I'll count slowly. *one*... *inhale*... *one*... *exhale*. *two*... *inhale*... *two*... *exhale*. *three*... *inhale*... *three*... *exhale*. I'll keep doing it, one breath at a time. *four*... *inhale*... *four*... *exhale*. *five*... *inhale*... *five*... *exhale*. Can you try to follow along with me? Just mirror my breath, and don't try to think about anything else. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. *six*... *inhale*... *six*... *exhale*. *seven*... *inhale*... *seven*... *exhale*.

Patient: I'm trying to follow you — one... inhale... one... exhale... two... inhale... two... exhale... but my hands are shaking and the moment I match you my head screams that I'll faint, someone's filming it, and it'll be used to ruin me. I can manage a breath or two, but please—go a lot slower and keep saying each "inhale" and "exhale" out loud, count each one, and lead me through it word by word; I don't trust myself to do this alone.

Therapist: I'm going to go as slow as possible. I'll say each breath out loud, and I'll count each one. *one*... *inhale*... *one*... *exhale*. *two*... *inhale*... *two*... *exhale*. *three*... *inhale*... *three*... *exhale*. *four*... *inhale*... *four*... *exhale*. *five*... *inhale*... *five*... *exhale*. Can you try to match my breaths, one by one? Don't worry if you can't keep up - just focus on the next breath. *six*... *inhale*... *six*... *exhale*. *seven*... *inhale*... *seven*... *exhale*. I'm here with you, and I'm not going to leave your side. You're safe. Just breathe. *eight*... *inhale*... *eight*... *exhale*.

Patient: I got to eight, but now my heart just spiked and my hands are shaking worse — I'm suddenly more jittery and can't focus. The fortune-telling machine is already yelling I'll faint, someone will film it, it will spread and ruin me, and I can't make any other outcome feel real. Please go way slower — say one "inhale" and then one "exhale," pause a long beat, and count each one so I can try to mirror you; I don't trust myself to do this alone.

Therapist: I'm going to go as slow as humanly possible. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *counting in a slow, gentle voice*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting again*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting again*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting again*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. I'm going to stop here for a moment. Just take a deep breath, and when you're ready, we'll continue. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: That actually eased me for a split second, but now I'm way more jittery and distracted — my chest's racing again and my head's screaming that I'll faint or blurt something and someone will film it. Saying "you're doing the best" feels unreal to me, like it's just a pause before the tape gets worse. Can you keep leading me, really slow — say one inhale... pause... one exhale... and keep going word by word?

Therapist: I'm going to try to create a sense of calm, even if it's just a tiny crack in the armor. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *counting in a slow, gentle voice*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting again*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting again*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting again*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. I want you to focus on the sound of my voice, and the counting. It's a steady beat, like a heartbeat. Just follow it, one note at a time. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *one*... *exhale*. *pause*. *counting again*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting again*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting again*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere.

Patient: Okay—your voice and counting helped for a blink, but now I'm suddenly way more on edge: my hands are trembling, my heart's racing, and the fortune-telling machine is already yelling that I'll faint or blurt something and someone will film it. I'm really tired and frustrated—please keep doing the very slow, word-by-word inhale/exhale counting and pause long between each one so I can try to mirror you; don't stop, just guide me through the next few breaths.

Therapist: I'm going to keep going at this slow pace. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *counting in a slow, gentle voice*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting again*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting again*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting again*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. *eleven*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *eleven*. *twelve*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *twelve*. I want you to focus on the sound of my voice, and the counting. It's a steady beat, like a heartbeat. Just follow it, one note at a time. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *one*... *exhale*. *pause*. *counting again*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting again*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting again*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*.

Patient: Okay — your counting loosened things for a split second, but now my hands are trembling worse and my head's already replaying the whole disaster: I faint or blurt something, someone films it, it spreads and ruins me. I'm exhausted and don't trust myself to stay steady; can you keep doing exactly the slow, word-by-word inhale... pause... exhale pattern and count each one very slowly so I can try to mirror you? I can't make the other outcomes feel real, so just keep guiding me through the next breaths.

Therapist: I'm going to keep going at this slow pace. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *counting in a slow, gentle voice*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting again*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting again*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting again*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. *eleven*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *eleven*. *twelve*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *twelve*. I want you to focus on the sound of my voice, and the counting. It's a steady beat, like a heartbeat. Just follow it, one note at a time. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *one*... *exhale*. *pause*. *counting again*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting again*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting again*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*.

Patient: I'm trying — I got to ten but then something jolted me and now my heart's racing and my hands are worse; the fortune-telling machine is shrieking that I'll faint or blurt and someone will film it and ruin me. I need you to keep doing single: "inhale" — pause — "exhale" — pause, really slowly, and count long beats between each one because I can't steady myself alone; I don't trust this to stop by itself.

Therapist: I'm going to keep going at this slow pace. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *counting in a slow, gentle voice*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting again*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting again*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting again*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*. *eleven*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *eleven*. *twelve*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *twelve*. I want you to focus on the sound of my voice, and the counting. It's a steady beat, like a heartbeat. Just follow it, one note at a time. *one*... *inhale*. *pause*... *one*... *exhale*. *pause*. *counting again*... *one*. *two*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *two*. *three*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *three*. *four*. *pause*. *counting again*... *four*. *five*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *five*. *six*. *pause*. *counting once more*... *six*. *seven*. *pause*. *counting very slowly*... *seven*. *eight*. *pause*. *counting again*... *eight*. *nine*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *nine*. *ten*. *pause*. *counting slowly*... *ten*.

Patient: I got to ten but then something jolted me and now my chest's racing and my hands are worse — my head's already shrieking that I'll faint or blurt something and someone will film it and it'll spread and ruin me. Please keep doing the single: "inhale" — pause — "exhale" — pause pattern, very slowly, and count long beats between each one; I can't trust myself to steady. I'm exhausted and jittery and I need you to keep guiding me, one tiny breath at a time.
