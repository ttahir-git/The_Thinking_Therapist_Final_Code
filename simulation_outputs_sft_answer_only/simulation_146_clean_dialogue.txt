Patient: Hi, I'm an older student and lately I've been stuck in cycles of really harsh self-criticism whenever I feel like I've failed at something — I guess that's tied to always being fiercely independent and having a hard time asking for help. A recent health scare made my social anxiety worse, and it's been on my mind a lot. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to talk about this, but I wanted to start somewhere.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to share something that's been weighing on you. It's understandable that you might feel a bit awkward talking about this, but it's a really important step to take. 

Can you tell me a bit more about what happens when you feel like you've failed at something? What kind of harsh self-criticism are you talking about, and how does that make you feel, exactly?

Patient: I don't know...when I feel like I've failed I start telling myself I'm stupid or lazy, like I shouldn't have screwed up in the first place. It makes my chest tighten and I feel ashamed, so I pull back and try to fix things on my own instead of asking for help. Then I usually just make it worse and the cycle starts again, and I guess that's been exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really beating yourself up over mistakes, and that's a lot of emotional labor. It's like you're carrying around this heavy weight of self-criticism that's hard to shake off.

Can you think of a time when you felt like you might have needed to ask for help, but you ended up pulling back instead? What was it about that situation that made you feel like you couldn't ask for help, or what was the worst part about it?

Patient: I don't know...like last term I fell behind on a group project because of the health scare, and instead of saying so I pretended I had it under control and tried to fix everything myself. The worst part was feeling like asking for help would prove I'm useless, so I just got more stressed and ended up messing things up. I guess that shame is what sticks with me the most.

Therapist: It's like you felt like asking for help would expose a weakness, and that's a really tough place to be. It's natural to want to take care of things on your own, but it sounds like that's come at a cost.

Can you tell me more about this shame? How does it feel, exactly? Is it like a constant presence in the back of your mind, or does it come up more often in certain situations?

Patient: I don't know...it's like a hot, shrinking feeling in my chest and face, like I want to disappear. It's not always there, but it spikes when someone notices I messed up or when I think asking for help will make me look weak. I guess I usually try to pretend it's not happening or steer the conversation away because talking about it feels... overwhelming.

Therapist: It's like this shame is a physical presence for you, and it's hard to ignore. It's good that you're acknowledging it, because sometimes just noticing it can be a start.

Would you be willing to try something small with this feeling? Maybe just notice it when it comes up, and see if you can describe it more clearly. Like, when you feel that hot, shrinking feeling in your chest and face, what do you do right then? Do you try to push it away, or change the subject?

Patient: I don't know...I usually try to push it away—distract myself, check my phone, or throw myself into fixing it alone so no one notices. If someone presses, I say "I'm fine" or try to change the subject because it just feels too overwhelming to stay with it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using distractions and deflection to try and avoid dealing with that shame. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed, but in doing so, you might be pushing it deeper down.

Can you try to notice what happens when you try to distract yourself or change the subject? Does that feeling of shame ever come back, or does it just move to a different part of your body? Sometimes, noticing where we are in our bodies can be helpful in understanding what's going on.

Patient: I don't know...when I distract myself it kind of dulls for a little while, but it always sneaks back — usually as a tightness in my chest and this knot in my stomach, and I end up clenching my jaw. I guess I shove it down by doing something else or pretending I'm fine, but then it comes back stronger later when someone asks about it. Talking about it right now feels...overwhelming, so I start to change the subject or say "I'm okay."

Therapist: It's like you're using distractions as a coping mechanism, but they're not really helping you deal with the shame in the long run. It's coming back, and it's getting stronger, too.

It's interesting that you mention clenching your jaw and feeling a tightness in your chest. Those physical sensations can be really connected to how we're feeling emotionally. It might be helpful to try and notice those sensations more closely, see if you can describe them in more detail.

Would you be willing to try something with that tightness in your chest and jaw? Maybe just acknowledge it, without trying to change it or distract yourself. Just notice it, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I notice the tightness like a heavy band across my chest and my jaw feels like it's locked — my breathing gets shallow and I want to hunch over. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to stay with that, I guess can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's a lot to take in, and it's okay to slow down. I want to make sure you're comfortable with where we are right now.

Let's take a deep breath together, just a slow, deep breath in, and out. As we breathe, can you just notice that tightness in your chest, the heaviness of the band, without trying to change it or distract yourself? Just observe it, and see what happens.

We can take our time, and we can do this whenever you're ready. No need to rush or do anything that feels uncomfortable. Just being present with that sensation, that's what we're aiming for right now.

Patient: Okay... (I take a slow breath in, and out.) The band in my chest is still there — heavy, like something pressing down — and my jaw eases a little then tightens again. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to stay with this; can we slow down more? Maybe tell me what to notice next, because if I focus too long I start to panic.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As you exhale, can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Where are your feet, exactly? What do you feel in your toes, your ankles, your legs? Just notice that, and see if it brings you back to the present a bit.

We're not trying to do anything more than that right now. Just notice your feet, and then we can move to something else if you'd like. No need to worry about the tightness in your chest, or your jaw. We're just taking it one small thing at a time.

Patient: I don't know...my heels are flat on the floor, my toes feel a little tingly and my ankles are kind of warm. It actually helps a bit to notice that, but when I focus too long my chest tightens more and I start to feel panicky. Can we slow down? Maybe we could talk about tiny, concrete ways I could ask for help without feeling useless — I guess that's what I need right now.

Therapist: It's like noticing the small things, like your feet, can help bring you back to a sense of calm. And it's great that you're acknowledging that it's not enough to just focus on the small things, you need to work on how to ask for help without feeling that sense of shame or uselessness.

Let's talk about that. Can you think of a tiny, concrete situation where you might need to ask for help, and you're worried about how you'll feel? Maybe it's something like asking a friend to help with a small task, or going to a library for research. What's one tiny thing that comes to mind?

Patient: I guess… one tiny thing would be asking a classmate to just look over one slide of my presentation or double-check my section. I worry they'll think I'm useless or lazy and my chest already tightens just imagining it. I don't know — can we talk about how to actually say that without sounding like I'm begging for favors?

Therapist: It's like you're worried that asking for help will be perceived as a lack of competence, and that's causing a lot of anxiety.

Let's try to break it down a bit. Instead of focusing on how you want to ask for help, let's talk about how you can phrase it in a way that feels more confident and less like you're begging for favors. Can you try saying something like, "I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look at my section and make sure it's accurate"? Or, "Could you help me review this part of the presentation and make sure I'm covering everything I need to?"

We can work on making those sentences feel more confident and less like you're asking for a handout. The goal is to make you feel more comfortable asking for help, not to make you sound more like you're begging for it.

Also, I want to try something. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you asked your classmate for help, and you got a positive response? What would that feel like?

Patient: I guess if they reacted positively I'd feel relieved, like a small weight lifted, but also embarrassed — like I shouldn't have needed the help in the first place. I don't know, even if they were kind I'd probably still worry they think less of me.

Therapist: It's like you're worried that even if you get help, you'll still feel like you're somehow less capable or less worthy. That's a really tough place to be.

Let's try to think about this differently. What if I told you that it's okay to ask for help, and that it's actually a sign of strength, not weakness? What if you saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a failure?

Also, can you think of a time when someone helped you in the past, and it didn't make you feel embarrassed or like you were less capable? How did you feel in that moment? Was it a positive experience?

It might be helpful to reframe your thinking around asking for help. Instead of seeing it as a sign of weakness, try to see it as a sign of self-care and a willingness to learn. And instead of worrying about how others will react, try to focus on how you want to feel in that moment. Do you want to feel relieved, confident, or supported?

Patient: I guess once after the health scare my neighbor helped me carry groceries and I felt relieved, like it didn't make me useless — but I don't know, I still kept thinking I should've managed it myself and felt a little ashamed. That feeling doesn't go away easily. Can we slow down and maybe practice a very short, simple phrase I could use to ask a classmate to check one slide? I'm scared I'll sound desperate.

Therapist: It's like you're worried that the feeling of relief will be overshadowed by the feeling of shame. It's understandable that it's hard to shake off.

Let's take a deep breath and focus on a small, simple phrase. Can you try saying "May I get your input on this slide?" or "Could you take a look at this section and let me know if it looks good?" Those phrases are short, straightforward, and don't imply that you're desperate for help.

We can practice these phrases together, and I'll help you feel more comfortable with them. We can even add a small pause or a brief moment of silence after you say the phrase, just to give yourself time to feel more confident.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes or sound a little awkward at first. The goal is to take a small step forward and get more comfortable asking for help. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds doable. Can we actually practice it—maybe role-play with you as the classmate? I'm nervous I'll sound weak, so could you suggest a really casual, short version like "Hey, could you glance at this slide?" and tell me how to say it without sounding needy?

Therapist: I'd be happy to help you practice. Let's do a role-play, and I'll do my best to play the classmate.

Before we start, take a deep breath and remember that this is just a practice. You're not actually asking for help, you're just rehearsing a conversation.

Here's how I'll play it: I'll respond to your question, and then we can wrap up the conversation. Ready to start?

"Hey, could you glance at this slide?" (said in a casual, matter-of-fact tone)

Go ahead and respond as if you were asking me that question in a real conversation. I'll give you feedback and help you feel more comfortable.

Patient: Hey—could you glance at this slide and tell me if the wording's clear? It's just one line and won't take long. I don't know, I'm kind of nervous about asking.

Therapist: No need to be nervous, it's a totally reasonable question. I can definitely take a look at the slide and give you some feedback. It's not a big ask, and it's actually really helpful for you to know if the wording is clear.

I'll just take a quick glance... (pause for a moment)

Okay, yeah, the wording looks good. You've got a clear and concise message that gets the point across. You might want to consider adding a brief summary or explanation for the next slide, but that's it. You're good to go.

How did that feel? Did it help to ease your nervousness a bit?

Patient: I guess it helped a little — there was a small relief, but I still felt embarrassed and my chest tightened when I said it. I don't know, I'm still worried I'll sound weak; can we try an even shorter, more casual version and do another quick role-play? Maybe something like "Mind glancing at this slide?"

Therapist: It's like the relief is small, but the underlying worry is still there. That's completely normal.

Okay, let's try another version that's even shorter and more casual. Here's the role-play:

"Mind glancing at this slide?" (said in a very casual, almost nonchalant tone)

Go ahead and say it as if you were asking me that question in a real conversation. I'll give you feedback and help you feel more comfortable.

Remember, the goal is to make it sound as natural and effortless as possible. You're not trying to convince me that you need help, you're just asking for a quick glance. How does that feel?

Patient: "Mind glancing at this slide?" I don't know, saying that made my chest tighten and I felt small — can we do it again but this time you act like you're a bit distracted or in a rush so I can practice a quick follow-up if they seem reluctant?

Therapist: Let's try it again, but this time I'll play the role of someone who's a bit distracted or in a rush.

"Mind glancing at this slide?" (said quickly and with a hint of distraction)

As you say it, I'll respond by glancing at the slide and then quickly looking away again, like I'm in a hurry.

You can then try a quick follow-up question, like "Oh, okay, just to make sure..." or "Do you think it looks clear?" See how that goes. Remember, you're not trying to convince me that you need help, you're just trying to clarify the slide.

Go ahead and give it a try!

Patient: "Mind glancing at this slide?" 

Oh—if you have a sec, does the wording read clearly? I don't know, I feel kind of small asking and my chest tightened when I said it.

Therapist: It's like the follow-up question is a natural extension of your initial question, and you're trying to clarify the slide without sounding too needy.

I'll respond with a nod and a brief glance at the slide, and then I'll say:

"Yeah, it looks fine. You're good to go. Sorry if it's a hassle, I'm just in a bit of a rush."

You can then respond with something like "No worries, thanks" or "Okay, thanks for checking." See how that goes? You're not trying to change my mind or make me feel bad, you're just closing the loop and moving on.

Remember, the goal is to make it sound natural and effortless. You're not trying to convince me that you need help, you're just asking for a quick glance and then moving on. How does that feel?

Patient: I guess that helped a little — there was a tiny relief, but my chest still tightened and I felt embarrassed like I shouldn't need to ask. I don't know, can we slow down? Maybe we could do one more practice where the person actually pauses and gives a warm response, or work on a quick line I can say to myself afterward so I don't spiral into beating myself up.

Therapist: It's like you're still feeling a bit of discomfort, and that's understandable. It's a big step to ask for help, and it's normal to feel that way.

Let's try to do one more practice, and this time, I'll play the role of someone who takes a moment to reflect and respond with a warm, encouraging tone.

"Mind glancing at this slide?"

Oh, thank you for checking. I appreciate it. You're doing a great job, and I know this presentation is a lot to handle. Take a deep breath, and remember that you've got this. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help.

Go ahead and take a moment to collect your thoughts, and then you can continue with the presentation. Remember, you're doing a great job, and I'm here to support you.

After we wrap up, we can work on a quick line you can say to yourself to help you feel more confident and calm. Maybe something like, "I've got this," or "I'm doing great." What do you think?

Patient: I don't know, "I've got this" feels kind of huge and fake to me. Maybe something smaller, like "One step at a time" or "This is just one quick thing" — I guess "One step at a time" might work. Can we practice me saying that after another quick role-play? I'm nervous but I want to try.

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a small, simple phrase to help you feel more grounded and focused. Those are great options.

Let's try the role-play again, and this time, I'll respond with a warm, encouraging tone.

"Mind glancing at this slide?"

Thank you for checking. I appreciate it. You're doing a great job, and I know this presentation is a lot to handle. Just take a deep breath, and remember that you're one step at a time. You're not in this alone, and I'm here to support you.

After I say that, I want you to try saying, "One step at a time." See how that feels? You can use it to calm yourself down and focus on the next task.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and you're doing the best you can. How does that feel?

Patient: Okay — I said "One step at a time." It helped a tiny bit, like my chest loosened a hair, but I still felt embarrassed and kind of eager to move on. I don't know, can we slow down and try one more practice — maybe a quick thing I can tell myself after someone just says "Looks fine" so I don't start beating myself up afterward?

Therapist: It's like you're still feeling a bit of anxiety and self-doubt, and that's understandable. It's a big step to ask for help, and it's normal to feel that way.

Let's try to do one more practice, and this time, I'll play the role of someone who says, "Looks fine," and then you can try to respond with a quick, positive phrase to help you feel more confident and calm.

"Mind glancing at this slide?"

Oh, it looks fine.

You can say something like, "Okay, thanks" or "Got it." Something simple to help you feel more confident and move on.

After we try this, we can work on a quick phrase you can tell yourself when someone says, "Looks fine" or any other neutral phrase. Maybe something like, "I did that," or "It's okay." What do you think?

Patient: I don't know...maybe something really simple like, "I did that," or "That's done" — "I did that" feels the least fake to me. Can we do a quick role-play where you say "Looks fine" and I try saying "I did that," then take a breath? I'm getting a bit panicky, so can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling a bit anxious and need to break it down even further. Let's take a deep breath and do a quick role-play.

I'll say, "Looks fine." Then, you can try saying, "I did that," and take a breath. Just a simple, slow response. We'll take it one step at a time.

Ready? Here we go:

"Looks fine."

(Pause, just a moment)

(I'll wait for your response, and then we can take a breath together.)

Patient: I did that. I take a slow, steady breath. I don't know, I'm still kind of panicky and my chest feels tight—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're still feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's okay. Let's take it even slower.

I'll say, "Looks fine." And then, you can say, "I did that." Let's do it at your own pace. I'll wait for your response, and we'll take a deep breath together.

Ready? Here we go:

"Looks fine."

(I'll wait for your response, and then we'll take a breath together.)

(And don't worry if you need a moment to respond. I'm not in a rush. Just take your time.)

Patient: I did that. I take a slow breath — my chest is still tight and I feel shaky. Can we slow down more? Maybe we could try a really quick phrase I can use in class when I start spiraling, because I don't know, it's hard to stay with this without moving away.

Therapist: It's like you're feeling a bit shaken and need to find a way to calm down quickly. Let's try to do a quick exercise to help you find a simple phrase to use in class.

I'll give you a few options, and you can try to find one that feels natural to you. Remember, the goal is to say something quickly to help calm yourself down.

Here are a few options:

* "I've got this."
* "That's done."
* "Okay, moving on."
* "One step at a time."
* "I'm good."

Take a deep breath, and try to find one that feels right to you. We'll practice saying it quickly, and you can see if it helps you feel more calm and focused.

Ready to try?

Patient: Okay... I'll try "One step at a time." One step at a time. I can feel my chest loosen a little but I'm still shaky and my jaw's tight. I don't know, can we slow down and try saying it a few more times together or maybe try a shorter one-word version?

Therapist: It's like you're finding some comfort in saying "One step at a time," and that's a great start. Let's try to build on that.

Let's practice saying it together a few more times. I'll say it, and then you can say it back to me. Ready?

"Okay, one step at a time."

(I'll wait for you to say it back, and then we can try it a few more times.)

Or, if you'd like to try a shorter version, we can try something like "Next step."

"Next step."

(I'll wait for you to say it back, and we can see if that feels more comfortable for you.)

Remember, the goal is to find something that feels natural and helps you calm down quickly. We're not trying to find the perfect phrase, we're just trying to find something that works for you.

Patient: Okay... One step at a time. One step at a time. I don't know, that helped a little but I'm still shaky and my jaw's tight—can we try the shorter one now? Maybe just "Next." Say it with me slowly?

Therapist: Let's try the shorter version. I'll say it with you, slowly.

"Next."

(I'll wait for you to say it back, and then we can try it a few more times.)

Remember, I want you to say it slowly and with confidence. You're not trying to rush or force it, you're just trying to find a way to calm down quickly.

Ready? Here we go: "Next." (pause) Your turn.

Patient: Next. Next. Saying it slowly helped a tiny bit, but my jaw's still tight and I'm shaky. I don't know, can we do it a few more times? Maybe practice a quick line I can use in class when someone interrupts me so I don't spiral.
