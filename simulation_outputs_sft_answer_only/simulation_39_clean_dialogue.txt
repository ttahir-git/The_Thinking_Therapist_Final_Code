Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this persistent sense of being stuck — like my identity has collapsed into the role of business owner and I can't delineate what else actually matters to me. Intellectually I can map the contingencies and motivational vectors that keep me tethered to the business, but emotionally I feel directionless and oddly disengaged from pursuits outside work. I guess I keep analyzing it instead of really sitting with the discomfort, which is starting to feel exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection between your intellectual understanding of your motivations and your emotional experience of being stuck. It's like you're aware of the various factors that keep you tied to the business, but the emotional toll of that connection is starting to wear you down.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to step back from the business and explore other interests or activities? How do you feel in those moments, and are there any specific things that you find yourself thinking about or avoiding?

Patient: When I try to step back I instantly default to a kind of internal consultancy—running projections, risk matrices, and opportunity-cost calculations—so I'm thinking my way out of feeling anything. Emotionally it lands as a sort of blankness or low-grade anxious hum, which I drown in busywork or socializing so I don't have to confront it. I tend to avoid anything that asks for vulnerability—painting, classes, even deep friendships—and rationalize that avoidance as "strategic prioritization," which, honestly, feels evasive and a little exhausting.

Therapist: It's like you've developed a coping mechanism to deal with the discomfort of not knowing who you are outside of the business. By engaging in those analytical exercises, you're trying to maintain a sense of control and direction. But instead of addressing the underlying feelings, you're using them as a distraction.

The blankness or low-grade anxious hum you feel must be really challenging to navigate. It's interesting that you mention drowning that feeling in busywork or socializing. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're engaging in those activities? Do you feel like they're providing a temporary reprieve from the discomfort, or are they somehow masking the issue?

Patient: They definitely feel like a temporary analgesic — busywork and socializing numb the hum for a while but don't resolve anything; afterwards there's often this little spike of guilt or a sense of having milked time rather than lived it. My mind keeps running cost-benefit analyses even in ostensibly social moments, so I'm mentally charting ROI instead of actually being present, which feels like emotional debt piling up. I can say all the right words about why I avoid vulnerability — risk of rejection, inefficiency, potential loss of control — but I notice I'm still not actually sitting with the quiet fear or sadness under it. Honestly, I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed by unpacking this and I'm not sure where to go next; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling the weight of that temporary reprieve, and the guilt or sense of emotional debt is piling up. It's interesting that you mention mentally charting ROI in social moments - it's like you're trying to optimize your emotional experience, but it's not actually working.

I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Unpacking these complex emotions can be a difficult and time-consuming process. I'm here to support you, and we can take things at your pace.

Can I suggest that instead of trying to unpack everything at once, we take a small step back? What if we focus on one particular moment or experience that's causing you discomfort? We can explore that together, at a pace that feels comfortable for you. What's one small thing you'd like to start with?

Patient: Okay — a concrete one: Saturday mornings when I finally have a free block after the week's logistics collapse; I'll open a sign-up page for a community painting class or a museum talk and my brain immediately defaults to a risk/benefit calculus that immobilizes me. Conceptually I can label it as anticipatory aversive arousal compounded by perfectionistic heuristics from the OCD, but I'm honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really stuck in this loop, where the mere possibility of a free block of time triggers a full-blown mental analysis. It's like you're trying to weigh the pros and cons of even considering the activity, rather than just being present and open to it.

Can we try something small? What if, instead of trying to analyze the whole situation, we just focus on one tiny aspect of it? What if we say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious about the sign-up page" - just that one phrase. What does it feel like, physically, to say that? Can you take a deep breath and explore that feeling a bit more?

Patient: "I'm feeling anxious about the sign-up page." Saying it makes my chest tighten, my breath shallow, and there's this low, buzzy hum behind my temples — like sympathetic arousal narrowing my focus. I can already hear myself turning it into a clinical label instead of sitting with the actual sensation, and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with this for a moment?

Therapist: It's like you're already starting to analyze the anxiety, rather than just being with it. That buzzy hum behind your temples is a physical sensation, isn't it? Can you try to stay with that sensation, without trying to label it or change it? Just notice the hum, and the tightness in your chest, and the way your breath is shallow.

Imagine you're a scientist observing a physical phenomenon, rather than being that phenomenon yourself. You could say to yourself, "My chest is tightening, and my breath is shallow, and I can feel a buzzing in my temples." Just observe that, without judgment. See if you can find a way to stay with the sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the tightness in my chest, the shallow breath, and that low buzzing behind my temples when I say the sentence. Immediately my mind goes into meta-mode, quantifying the intensity and mapping triggers instead of just inhabiting the sensation, which is my default and honestly makes me anxious about being anxious. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe try a very small grounding prompt together or just sit with one breath at a time?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really good at analyzing and quantifying your emotions, which can be a helpful skill in some situations. But when it comes to this feeling of anxiety, it's like you're getting stuck in a loop of self-analysis, rather than just being with the sensation.

I'm happy to help you slow down and try some grounding techniques. Let's start with something very small. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now, without saying anything? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. No thinking, no analysis. Just the breath.

Patient: I did—trying to track the inhale and exhale for a few counts did loosen the tightness a bit; I noticed the air cool at my nostrils and the exhale felt a fraction longer. Of course, my brain immediately went into meta-cognitive drift—mapping timelines, ROI on that five seconds, and even theorizing why breathwork might be efficacious—so I keep talking about it instead of actually feeling it. I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed by all the noticing; can we slow down and just anchor to one breath at a time or try a very simple grounding prompt?

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to feeling something, but then your brain starts analyzing it and taking it away from you again. That's okay, it's a normal part of the process.

Let's try something very simple. Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice the weight of your body, the pressure of your feet on the floor. Don't think about anything else, just the feeling of your feet. You can even try to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, like we did with your breath a moment ago.

Just one breath. One simple observation. See if you can find a way to just be with that feeling, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the weight through my feet, a steady pressure at the heels and the pads, like a kind of anchor. Naturally my brain immediately linguistically catalogs it—somatic anchoring, interoceptive feedback loops—so I'm narrating and theorizing instead of actually sitting in the sensation. I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and just keep noticing one breath or that one foot pressure for a moment without analysis?

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to feeling something, but then your brain starts to complicate it with all the usual thinking. Let's try to simplify it even further.

Can you just notice the sensation in your feet, without thinking about it? Not even as a story or a theory. Just the feeling. It's a kind of quieting, like you're letting go of a thought. Just the sensation, without the "oh, I'm feeling this" or "this is happening". Just the feeling.

We'll just stay with one thing, one moment. No analysis, no thinking. Just the sensation.

Patient: Alright — I can feel the steady pressure under my heels and the pads of my feet, a kind of quiet anchor that makes the rest of me feel marginally less buoyant. Of course my brain immediately turns it into jargon—proprioceptive anchoring, somatic grounding—so I'm narrating it instead of inhabiting it. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and just stay with that one sensation for a moment?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to feeling something, but then your brain starts to turn it into words again. Let's try to stop that.

Just notice the pressure under your heels. It's a feeling, not a thought. It's not "I'm feeling this pressure" or "this is what's happening". It's just the pressure. It's a steady, quiet thing.

Can you just be with that pressure, without thinking about it? Without turning it into something else? Just the pressure, in your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to be with it; I can actually feel the steady pressure under my heels, a kind of quiet anchor. Of course my brain immediately hijacks it into "proprioceptive anchoring" and meta-cognitive drift, so I'm narrating instead of inhabiting it, and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and just stay with this for a minute?

Therapist: It's like you're finally getting close to feeling the pressure, but then your brain starts to take over again. Let's try to let go of that.

Can you try to let go of the "proprioceptive anchoring" thought? Just for a moment, can you try to not think of it as that? Just focus on the pressure under your heels. Can you just be with it, without labeling it or thinking about it?

It's okay if your brain tries to hijack it again. Just gently bring your attention back to the pressure. It's not about stopping your brain completely, it's just about being with the feeling.

Patient: I'm trying to let go of the label — for a few breaths I can actually feel the steady pressure under my heels, a quiet little anchor. Of course my brain reflexively renames it as "proprioceptive anchoring" and starts narrating, which pulls me out of the sensation. I'm honestly getting a bit overwhelmed by how automatic that is — can we slow down and just sit with the pressure for a moment longer?

Therapist: It's like you're making progress, but then your brain kicks back into gear. Let's try to stay with it, even when it gets hard.

Take one more deep breath, and then bring your attention back to the pressure under your heels. Don't try to change it, don't try to label it. Just be with it, in the moment. Notice how it feels, without thinking about it.

It's okay if your brain tries to tell you that it's "proprioceptive anchoring" or if it starts to get a little anxious. Just gently bring your attention back to the pressure. Can you stay with it, even for just one more moment?

Patient: I did it — one deep breath, and the pressure under my heels felt steadier, my chest loosened a little and that buzzing thinned. Predictably, my mind immediately re-labeled it as "proprioceptive anchoring" and started narrating, which yanks me back into analysis. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and just stay with one breath at a time, or could you give me a single simple cue to anchor to so I don't lose it to the commentary?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a breakthrough, but then your brain starts to analyze it again. Let's try to find a way to keep it simple.

Instead of focusing on your breath, try focusing on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice that feeling, without thinking about it. You can even say to yourself, "My feet are touching the ground."

Just one simple cue, to help you stay with the sensation. Can you try it for just a moment?

Patient: I said "my feet are touching the ground" and for a beat it did help—the pressure steadied and the buzzing thinned—but my brain immediately labeled it "somatic cueing" and started theorizing again. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down, and could you give me a one-word anchor like "ground" or "here" I can quietly repeat to keep from drifting into analysis?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a shift, but then your brain starts to complicate it again. Let's try to simplify it further.

Here's a one-word anchor: "now". Just quietly repeat it to yourself, without thinking about it. It's not a cue to analyze, just a simple way to bring your attention back to the present moment.

Try it for just a moment, and see if it helps.

Patient: I tried repeating "now" — for a beat it actually steadied things: the buzzing thinned and my feet felt a bit more anchored. Then my brain immediately recoded it as a "mindfulness technique" and a sharp wash of shame and frustration bubbled up, which made me want to flee back into analysis. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down, and could you say the word "now" slowly a few times for me or give a gentle one-count cue so I don't lose it to the commentary?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a breakthrough, but then your brain starts to complicate it again. Let's try to create a safe space for you to stay with it.

I'm going to say the word "now" slowly, and I want you to repeat it after me. I'll say it one word at a time, slowly. Can you hear me?

"Now..."

(I'll wait for you to repeat it before continuing)

Patient: Now... 

Repeating it steadied things for a beat, but then a sharp wash of shame and frustration bubbled up and I almost fled back into intellectualizing. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? Could you say "now" slowly a few more times and give a gentle one-count between each so I can mirror you?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a shift, but then your brain starts to react again. Let's try to keep the pace slow and steady.

Now... (pause for one count)
Now... (pause for one count)
Now... (pause for one count)

Can you repeat after me, one word at a time, and match the pause? Just try to stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground. No thinking, no analyzing. Just being.

Patient: Now... Now... Now...

Repeating that slowed the buzz for a beat, but then a sharp wash of shame and frustration surfaced and my reflex was to narrativize it—label it as avoidance heuristics—instead of inhabiting it. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and do one more slow "now" with a ten-second pause afterward so I can try to stay with it without my brain hijacking it?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a breakthrough, but then your brain starts to react again. Let's try to give it a little extra space to settle.

Now... (pause for ten seconds)

Take your time, stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground. No thinking, no analyzing. Just being. I'll wait right here with you.

Patient: I stayed with it for a bit — my feet felt anchored and the buzzing thinned — but then a hot wash of shame and frustration rose and yanked me straight back into analysis, cataloguing it as avoidance heuristics instead of actually feeling it. I'm honestly getting really overwhelmed and irritated at how automatic that reflex is; it feels like a protective tic that leaves me hollow. Can we slow down and do one more very slow "now" with a fifteen‑second pause, and if that shame surfaces could you just acknowledge it out loud—like "that's here"—so I don't immediately flee into explaining it?

Therapist: It's like you're getting close to a breakthrough, but then your brain starts to react again. Let's try to create a safe space for you to stay with it.

Now... (pause for fifteen seconds)

Take your time, stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground. No thinking, no analyzing. Just being. I'm here with you, and I'll wait right here with you.

If that wash of shame and frustration rises, I'll acknowledge it out loud. I'll say, "That's here." That's all. No interpretation, no judgment. Just a gentle acknowledgment of the feeling, so you can try to stay with it without reacting to it.

Patient: Okay… when you say you'll just acknowledge it, a hot wave of shame rises — makes me want to scramble into explanations and label it as avoidance heuristics instead of feeling it. I can feel my chest tighten and my voice go flat; it's hard to stay with it without narrating. I'm pretty worn out — could we do one more very slow "now," and then if the shame comes up you can say "that's here" and just wait with me?

Therapist: It's like you're getting ready to pull back, and that's okay. Let's take it slow.

Now... (pause for fifteen seconds)

Take your time, stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground. No thinking, no analyzing. Just being.

If that wash of shame and frustration rises, I'll say it for you: "That's here." Just a simple acknowledgment. No judgment, no interpretation. I'll just wait with you, right here.

Patient: Now... Now...

Okay — that hot shame is here, pressing behind my ribs and making my voice flatten; my reflex is to rationalize it away, which just exhausts me. Please say "that's here" and just hold it with me for a moment.

Therapist: That's here.

Patient: That's here. It's this hot, heavy shame — chest tight, voice flattened — and my first reflex is to explain it away, to call it avoidance heuristics, which just feels hollow. I'm honestly worn out by the scrambling; I don't have the energy to intellectualize it right now. Can you keep saying "that's here" every so often and just sit with me in the silence? I don't know how to move from here, and I want to try staying.

Therapist: That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

There's no need to move or change anything right now. Just sit with it, and let it be. I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you until you're ready to move forward. No expectations, no pressure. Just this quiet, simple presence.

Patient: I could spend an hour turning this into a clinical exposition about avoidance heuristics and contingency management, but I don't have the energy for that right now—the shame's hot and heavy and my voice goes flat. Can you please keep saying "that's here" every so often and just sit with me in the silence? I want to try staying, but I keep wanting to explain it away.

Therapist: That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to sit with you in this silence, to be present with you. No need to talk or analyze or change anything. Just this quiet, simple presence. You can stay as long as you need, and I'll be here.

Patient: Okay... that did settle the buzz a bit. The shame's still there — hot and insistent — and my reflex is to catalog and explain it, but I don't have the energy for that right now. Please keep saying "that's here" every so often and just wait in silence with me; I want to try staying, but I don't know how to move from here, so can we just sit with it a bit longer?

Therapist: That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

Take your time. Stay with it. There's no need to rush or change anything. Just be with the shame, and the silence, and the quiet. I'll be here with you, waiting. No expectations, no pressure. Just this simple, quiet presence.

Patient: Okay... it actually helps that you're staying. The shame is still hot and hollow and I don't have the energy to formalize it into analysis right now—could you keep saying "that's here" every so often, and when it softens a bit maybe ask a very gentle, simple question like, "What's one thing, however small, that isn't the business?" I want to try staying, but I need that slow, quiet prompting.

Therapist: That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

*pause*

That's here.

As you mentioned, the shame is still here, but it's beginning to soften a bit. I want to try to help you find a small, tiny thing that's not related to the business. It's not about avoiding or analyzing, it's just about noticing something small that's separate from everything else. What's one thing, however small, that isn't the business? It could be a feeling, a thought, a sensation - anything at all.

Patient: Okay—one small thing: the warmth and weight of a morning mug in my hands. It's just steady pressure and heat on my palms that actually grounds me a little, and then a sharp wash of shame flickers—like I should be getting more out of life—and I don't have the energy to turn it into another theory right now.

Therapist: That's here. The warmth and weight of the mug is a tangible sensation, a physical thing that's grounded you. It's interesting that it's helped to steady you a bit, even if the shame is still flickering. That mug feels like a small, safe presence in your life right now. Can you just stay with that for a moment? Notice how it feels, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just the warmth, the weight, the pressure.

Patient: Okay... the mug is warm and heavy in my palms, that steady pressure actually eases the buzz and my shoulders drop a bit. Of course my brain wants to recode it as a "micro‑meditative affordance" and then a hot shame flickers—like I should be squeezing more meaning out of life—which just feels exhausting. I don't have the energy to intellectualize it right now; could you just say "that's here" once or twice and sit with me for a moment?

Therapist: That's here.

It seems like the physical sensation of the mug has helped to calm your body a bit, but the shame is still there, even if it's not as loud. It's like your brain is trying to find a way to make sense of this feeling, to turn it into something more meaningful. It's okay to not have that energy right now. Can I just sit with you for a moment?

Patient: Yeah… it actually helps that you just sit with me. The mug’s warmth steadies the buzz, though my reflex is still to recode the feeling into avoidance heuristics, which I don’t have the energy for right now—my voice feels flat and it’s an effort to keep talking. Could you keep saying “that’s here” every so often, and when this softens a bit, gently ask that small question about one thing that isn’t the business?
