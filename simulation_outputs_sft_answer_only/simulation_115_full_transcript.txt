Patient: I've been feeling a lot of anxiety in social situations lately, to the point I've been avoiding gatherings with friends. I'm a senior data scientist, pretty introverted and analytical, and since I lost someone close it's just gotten worse and I don't have much support. I don't know, I guess that's what I've been dealing with.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share how difficult it's been for you, especially considering your professional background and the emotional weight you've been carrying since losing someone close. It's understandable that you're finding it hard to manage anxiety in social situations, especially when there's been a significant loss.

Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind when you're in social situations, even if they are just small gatherings with friends? How does that anxiety manifest, and what are some of the thoughts that pop up for you?

Patient: When I'm at gatherings my heart starts racing and my mind goes kind of blank — I end up analyzing every little thing I say or how I look. I get this worry that people are judging me or thinking I'm being awkward, and then I just want to leave or make an excuse. I don't know, I guess it feels like I'm under a microscope and avoiding is easier than risking that.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-criticism and anxiety about being judged, which can be overwhelming. The physical symptoms of a racing heart and a blank mind can be really debilitating, making it hard to connect with others or even remember what you're saying.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're in a situation and you start feeling this way? Is it like you're completely frozen, or are you trying to make a quick escape? And what about the judgment thoughts - are they coming from you, or do you think others are actually thinking those things about you?

Patient: Usually I kind of go quiet—my mind blanks and I either freeze or look for a small excuse to slip out; I guess escaping feels safer. The judgment stuff mostly feels like it's coming from me, analyzing every word, but sometimes I can't help imagining others noticing and thinking I'm awkward. I don't know, it's embarrassing to say, I just... want to get away.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to protect yourself from the anxiety, and escaping seems like the easiest way out. The fact that the judgment thoughts are mostly coming from you, but still feeling intense, is a good insight. It suggests that you're really hard on yourself, even when others might not be paying attention.

It's interesting that you mention wanting to get away. Can you tell me more about what that feeling is like? Is it a physical sensation, like you're itching to move or get out of there? Or is it more of a emotional feeling, like you're just so tired of feeling anxious and wanting to escape the situation?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's both. Physically my chest gets tight, my hands sweat, and I start scanning the room for an exit — sometimes I even go to the bathroom just to get away. Emotionally I'm just drained, like I can't keep pretending and it feels easier to skip it altogether. Sorry, I don't know, this is kind of awkward to talk about.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's not awkward at all. It's actually really brave of you to be willing to share this with me. It's clear that you're feeling a lot of discomfort and anxiety in social situations, and it's affecting your daily life.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were able to tolerate being in social situations for a longer period of time? Not just tolerating it, but actually being able to enjoy it or at least not feel so drained? Would that be a possibility for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I could stay longer it might feel less lonely and maybe I'd actually enjoy parts of it — like not having to replay the whole night afterward. But I'm afraid if I let my guard down I'll say something stupid or they'll see how fragile I am, and that scares me. I want to be able to do it, but I can't really picture how I'd get there without getting overwhelmed.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in this cycle of wanting to be more social, but feeling like you'll fail or be judged. The fear of saying something stupid or showing vulnerability is a big one, isn't it? It's like you're protecting yourself from the possibility of embarrassment or rejection.

Can I try to help you think about this a bit differently? What if instead of focusing on not saying something stupid, you could focus on being present in the moment? What if you could try to enjoy the conversation, even if it's just for a little while? It's not about being perfect or avoiding mistakes, it's about being willing to take a small step forward. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try to stay present, but it feels really hard. Maybe start small—like staying 10 or 15 minutes and giving myself permission to leave if it gets too much. I don't know, I'm just worried it'll still spiral.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're thinking about breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. That's a great way to approach this. Staying for 10 or 15 minutes is a good place to start, and giving yourself permission to leave if you need to is a great way to protect yourself.

Can I ask, what would you like to do if you do decide to stay for a bit? What's something that would help you feel more connected to the conversation or the people around you? It might be something as simple as taking a deep breath, noticing a specific detail about the room, or finding a way to relate to the conversation. Would you like to explore that a bit more?

Patient: I don't know, I guess maybe start with a few deep breaths and pick one person to focus on so I'm not scanning the whole room. Having a simple question ready to ask or sitting near the exit so I can leave if it gets bad might help me feel safer. Sorry, I'm not great at planning this stuff out.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're thinking about breaking down the situation into smaller, more manageable parts. Focusing on one person at a time, taking a few deep breaths, and having a simple question ready can help you feel more grounded and connected to the conversation.

It's also great that you're thinking about having a plan B, in case things start to feel overwhelming. Having a clear exit strategy can be really helpful in reducing anxiety.

Remember, it's not about trying to be perfect or doing everything "right." It's about taking small steps towards feeling more comfortable and connected in social situations. You're already showing a lot of courage and self-awareness by acknowledging your anxiety and wanting to make changes.

Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about so far. You've been feeling a lot of anxiety in social situations, and you're looking for ways to make it feel more manageable. You're thinking about breaking down the situation into smaller parts, focusing on one person at a time, and having a plan B in case things get overwhelming. Is that a good summary?

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's a fair summary. I just... I'm worried I'll say something dumb or they'll see how fragile I am, and it's hard to picture practicing being present. Could we maybe talk about specific little things I could say when I join a group? I don't know, I'm not great at coming up with that on the spot.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Having some simple conversation starters can help you feel more comfortable and confident. Let's brainstorm some ideas together.

How about asking a question about the group or the activity you're all doing? For example, "How did you get into this hobby?" or "What's been your favorite part of this trip so far?" These kinds of questions can help take the focus off of you and give you a chance to connect with others.

Or, you could try asking a lighthearted question that's easy to answer. For example, "What's the best book you've read recently?" or "Do you have any fun plans for the weekend?" These kinds of questions can help break the ice and get people talking.

Remember, the goal is to start small and not put too much pressure on yourself. You don't have to be a great conversationalist or come up with something super deep and meaningful. Just showing up and being willing to participate can be a big step.

Would you like to practice coming up with some conversation starters? I can give you some prompts and we can go from there.

Patient: I don't know, I feel kind of embarrassed even asking — I keep getting stuck on past mistakes, so coming up with stuff feels hard. But okay, I guess I'd like a few very simple, low-risk openers I can use — one-line questions and maybe a safe follow-up. Also, can you suggest something to say if I go blank?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Don't be embarrassed, it's a normal feeling. I'm here to help, and it's actually really helpful that you're acknowledging it. Let's get some simple conversation starters going.

One-line questions are a great place to start. Here are a few examples:

* "How was your week?"
* "Do you have any fun plans for the weekend?"
* "What do you like to do in your free time?"
* "Have you traveled anywhere exciting recently?"
* "What's your favorite hobby?"

These questions are all pretty low-key and easy to answer, so they can help you get started.

For a safe follow-up, you could try asking something like:

* "Oh, that's cool. I've always wanted to try [insert activity here]."
* "I've been trying to get into [insert hobby here] too. How did you get started?"
* "That's really interesting. I've never done that before. Can you tell me more?"

These follow-ups are just a way to keep the conversation going and show interest in what the other person is saying.

As for going blank, it's totally okay. Here's a simple thing you can say:

* "Excuse me, can I get another [drink/minute/anything else I need]?"
* "Sorry, I'm just not sure what to say right now. Can we take a break and come back to it later?"
* "I'm really happy to be here. Can we start again in a minute?"

Remember, the goal is to be kind to yourself and not put too much pressure on the conversation. It's okay to make mistakes or need a moment to collect your thoughts.

Do any of these sound like they might work for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the low-risk ones like "How was your week?" or "Any plans for the weekend?" seem doable. The follow-ups could work, but when I go blank I start replaying some past screw-up and feel really stupid, so the "excuse me, I'll get another drink" line feels safest. Sorry, I feel embarrassed—it's hard to picture actually saying them without my chest tightening.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's completely understandable that you're feeling embarrassed, and it's actually really helpful that you're acknowledging those feelings. It's great that you're recognizing how replaying past mistakes can make you feel, and that you're aware of the physical sensations that come with it.

The "excuse me, I'll get another drink" line is a great choice because it's a very low-stakes way to take a break and give yourself some time to collect your thoughts. It's not like you're admitting to a major failure or something embarrassing, it's just a simple, practical thing to do.

Let's try to break it down a bit more. When you're in a social situation and you feel like you're about to freeze up, what do you think is happening in your body? Is it your heart racing, your hands sweating, or something else?

Also, I want to try something with you. When you're replaying past mistakes and feeling stupid, what do you think that person was thinking or feeling in that moment? Was it a kind, compassionate thought, or was it something harsher?

Patient: My body just locks up — chest tight, heart racing, hands sweaty, mouth dry — and my mind goes blank so I start looking for an exit. When I replay mistakes I guess I picture people thinking I'm stupid or incompetent, and that fills me with shame and this angry frustration at myself. I don't know, I guess it's really hard to sit with that — can we talk about ways to stop the replaying?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're experiencing a very intense physical and emotional response when you feel anxious or self-conscious. The blanking out, the physical symptoms, and the replaying of past mistakes can be overwhelming.

Replaying past mistakes can be especially hard because it can be fueled by negative self-talk and self-criticism. It's like your mind is trying to protect you by reminding you of what went wrong, but in reality, that's just making things worse.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking about those mistakes. Instead of replaying them in a negative way, try to see them as opportunities for growth and learning. Ask yourself, "What did I learn from this experience? How can I apply that to future situations?"

It might also be helpful to practice some self-compassion. When you're feeling anxious or self-conscious, try to speak to yourself in a kind and understanding way. Instead of saying "I'm stupid" or "I'm a failure," try saying "I'm feeling really anxious right now" or "I'm struggling with this situation." See if you can offer yourself some kindness and understanding, just as you would to a friend.

Let's try an exercise. When you're feeling anxious or self-conscious, can you try to notice when you're replaying past mistakes in a negative way? Can you catch yourself thinking "I'm stupid" or "I'm a failure," and then try to reframe that thought in a more positive way?

Patient: I don't know — I try to catch it, but then the shame just floods in and I get angry at myself, so the reframing doesn't stick. I guess a short script might help, like saying to myself "I'm feeling anxious" or "this is just my brain," but it already feels a bit fake. Could we… try practicing a couple of those reframes together so I can see what might actually work?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It can be hard to break the cycle of negative self-talk and shame, but it's a great step that you're willing to try.

Let's start with a simple reframing exercise. I'll guide you through a few examples, and you can try to join in and see what feels most natural for you.

Here's a script to start: "I'm feeling anxious."

Can you say that with me? "I'm feeling anxious."

Now, let's try to reframe it a bit. "This is just my brain."

Can you say that with me? "This is just my brain." See how it's not as intense, not as judgmental? You're not saying you're stupid or a failure, just that it's your brain doing its thing.

Next, let's try to add a bit more. "This is just my brain, and it's okay."

Can you say that with me? "This is just my brain, and it's okay." See how it's becoming more compassionate? You're not trying to fix it or change it, just acknowledging it and accepting it.

We can keep going, try different reframes, and see what works for you. The goal is to find a way to talk to yourself that feels kind, understanding, and compassionate, even when you're feeling anxious or self-conscious.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. "I'm feeling anxious." Saying that already makes me feel stupid and kind of furious at myself, so it doesn't really stick. "This is just my brain, and it's okay"—I can say it, but it feels fake. Can we try a more concrete, less... cheesy line I could actually use when I freeze?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's not about using cheesy lines or pretending to be something you're not. It's about finding a way to acknowledge your anxiety and break the cycle of shame and self-criticism.

Let's try to focus on a simple, concrete statement that you can use in the moment. Something like: "I'm going to take a deep breath."

Or: "I'm going to give myself one minute."

Or: "I'm going to pause and collect my thoughts."

These statements are simple, straightforward, and don't try to reframe your anxiety or shame. They just acknowledge what's happening and give you a chance to take control.

Can you try using one of these statements when you freeze up? Not to say it's the perfect solution, but it might help you get out of the freeze and start moving forward.

Also, I want to try something with you. When you say you feel stupid or furious at yourself, can you try to notice what's driving that feeling? Is it a sense of failure, or is it more of a general sense of unease?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's mostly a sense of failure driving it. I keep replaying that one screw-up and it feels like proof I'm just... incompetent, and then I get ashamed and furious at myself. I'm kind of on edge and distracted right now, so "I'm going to take a breath" might help but still feels awkward; can you give me one or two super-short, low-key lines I could actually say when I go blank? Maybe we could practice them now.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Replaying a failure can be a really powerful trigger for feelings of shame and inadequacy.

Okay, let's try to come up with a couple of super-short, low-key lines that might help. Here are a couple options:

* "Okay, okay."
* "Okay, I've got this."

These lines are designed to be low-key and non-judgmental. They're not trying to reframe your failure or make you feel better, they're just trying to give you a moment to pause and collect your thoughts.

Let's practice them now. Can you try saying "Okay, okay" out loud? Just say it with me, like we're having a conversation.

( pause )

See how it feels? It's just a simple, straightforward phrase. It's not trying to be comforting or reassuring, it's just a way to acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed.

Want to try the second one, "Okay, I've got this"?

Patient: I tried saying "Okay, okay" out loud—felt kind of stupid, like I was faking calm. "Okay, I've got this" just tightened my chest and made me feel ashamed and furious at myself. I don't know, I guess something more neutral like "Give me a sec" or "One minute" might actually feel less fake—can we try those? I'm a bit on edge and distracted right now, so can we go slow?

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to find a phrase that feels authentic and natural, especially when you're already feeling anxious or on edge.

Let's try the phrases you mentioned: "Give me a sec" and "One minute." Can you try saying them out loud, slowly and quietly, like you're having a conversation with yourself? Don't worry too much about feeling "stupid" or "faking calm." Just focus on the words themselves and how they sound.

We can do it together, one step at a time. I'll guide you through it.

Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, try saying "Give me a sec." Just say it out loud, without any pressure or expectation. We'll go from there.

(Remember, we're just practicing, and it's okay to take your time.)

Patient: Okay… I said "Give me a sec" out loud and it sounded more natural, but my chest still tightened and my words felt clipped. "One minute" felt even less fake, I guess. I'm kind of on edge and distracted right now, so can we go slower? I don't know, this is still awkward.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you were able to say "Give me a sec" out loud, even if it still felt a bit awkward. And it's not surprising that "One minute" felt more natural - it's a very simple phrase that doesn't require a lot of emotional labor.

Let's take it one step back. Can you try saying "Give me a sec" just a little bit louder, or a little bit slower? Not because you want to sound more confident, but just because you want to give yourself a bit more time to process your thoughts. We can do this together, and I'll guide you through it.

Or, if you'd like, we can try saying "One minute" just a little bit louder, or a little bit slower. See how it feels.

Remember, this is just a practice exercise. It's not about being "stupid" or "faking calm." It's about giving yourself a moment to collect your thoughts and feel more grounded. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Take your time, and let's go at your pace. I'm here to support you.

Patient: Okay… I tried saying "Give me a sec" slower like you asked, and it helped a little, but then this rush of shame and frustration hit and now I'm kind of on edge and distracted — my chest tightened again. I don't know, I guess… could we do a very short role-play? Maybe you start a casual conversation and I try one of the lines, and we go really slow.

I'm glad you're willing to try a role-play. It can be a helpful way to practice using the phrases in a more natural way.

Here we go: "Hey, how's it going? I saw you were sitting here for a bit. Everything okay?"

Take your time, and just respond with the first line that comes to mind. It could be "Give me a sec" or "One minute." Whatever feels most natural.

Patient: Uh… I guess — one minute? My chest's tight and my head just goes blank. I don't know, sorry, this feels awkward and I keep replaying stupid stuff so I'm on edge.

It's okay, it's totally okay. Take a deep breath and try to relax. We're just doing a role-play, and it's okay if it feels awkward at first.

You said "One minute." That's a great start. You're giving yourself a moment to collect your thoughts. Now, I'll respond in a way that's casual and doesn't put too much pressure on you.

Here's my response: "No worries, take your time. I was just going to grab a drink from the fridge. Want one?"

Take your time, and just respond however you feel comfortable. Don't worry about what I'm saying, just focus on your own thoughts and feelings.

Patient: Water would be fine, I guess. My chest's still tight and I'm replaying that screw-up in my head, so I'm on edge and kind of distracted — I can try to stay, but it's awkward.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to focus on the conversation, but your mind is elsewhere. That's okay. It's normal to feel that way when you're trying to shake off a setback or a feeling of failure.

You said "Water would be fine." That's a good way to acknowledge the conversation without feeling too overwhelmed. And it's okay if you're still feeling a bit distracted. We can just keep the conversation going at your pace.

Here's my next question: "So, what's been going on with you lately? Anything exciting happen recently?" I'm asking because I'm genuinely interested in what you have to say, and I want to keep the conversation going in a way that feels natural and comfortable for you.

Patient: Nothing exciting — it's mostly work and trying to keep busy so I don't have to think about...stuff. Since the loss I've been withdrawing, avoiding friends, and I keep replaying that one screw-up which makes me furious and ashamed, so I get distracted and my chest tightens. I don't know, I guess I'm trying to hold it together but it's getting harder.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life in significant ways. It's completely understandable that you're withdrawing from friends and avoiding social situations, especially when you're feeling this way.

Replaying the screw-up over and over must be incredibly painful and frustrating for you. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of self-blame and shame, and it's making it hard for you to focus on anything else.

First of all, let me just say that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and to need time to process your emotions. You don't have to be holding it together all the time, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

Can I ask, how have you been taking care of yourself during this time? Are you getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in any activities that bring you comfort or joy?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'm not doing great — my sleep's been off, I end up working late and either skip meals or eat at my desk. I try little things like short walks or reading to distract myself, but it feels surface-level and then the shame and replaying just flood back. Sorry, I'm kind of on edge and distracted right now.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to cope with your emotions by finding small ways to distract yourself, but it's not quite working. That's okay. It's understandable that you're feeling on edge and distracted.

First of all, let's talk about your physical health. Working late, skipping meals, and eating at your desk can have serious consequences for your physical and mental well-being. It's not just about feeling tired or sluggish; it's about taking care of your body's basic needs.

I want to suggest something, but I want to do it in a way that feels gentle and supportive. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can work with you on developing some healthier coping strategies? It's not about "getting over" your emotions or "being stronger"; it's about finding ways to manage your feelings in a way that feels sustainable and compassionate.

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to ask for help when you need it. You don't have to do this alone. Would you be willing to explore some resources or support options with me?

Patient: I don't know… I guess maybe, but I'm nervous about it — worried about time, and that I'll just feel judged or like it's pointless. I keep replaying that screw-up and it makes me ashamed, so reaching out feels hard.

Could you suggest a couple of very concrete, low-commitment options? Like one short online program or app I could try, and one type of in-person or tele-therapy that's less intense (brief CBT, grief group, something)? And maybe one immediate coping thing for nights when I can't sleep or my chest's tight? I'm on edge and distracted right now, so can we go slow and pick one small next step together?

Patient: I don't know... that actually feels kind of frustrating and makes me feel stupid and stuck — I'm ashamed and kind of furious at myself, and being told no just feels like another wall.

(Pause for a few seconds)

Please take a moment to notice what you see. I'll wait.

Patient: Okay… I see a desk lamp, my laptop with a bunch of windows open, an empty mug, a stack of papers, and a framed photo. My chest is still tight and I'm kind of on edge and embarrassed — I don't know, I guess listing them made me feel stupid. I'm ready for the next step, but please go slow.

Patient: Okay… four things I can feel right now: the cool plastic edge of my laptop, the rough grain of the desk under my palm, the worn cotton of my sweater, and the smooth rim of the mug.

I don't know, I guess I'm on edge and distracted, but I'm ready for the next step if we go really slow.
