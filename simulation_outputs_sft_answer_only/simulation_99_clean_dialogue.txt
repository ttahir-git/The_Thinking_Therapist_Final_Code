Patient: I'm a software developer, and what's been dominating my mind is this persistent performance anxiety—this anticipatory, evaluative loop—that ironically precipitates chronic procrastination. I tend to intellectualize it, mapping it onto cognitive avoidance and hypervigilant circuits from my PTSD rather than naming the fear, but the net effect is missed deadlines and increased isolation. It's frustrating because I'm pragmatic and organized, yet I keep running into this behavioral stasis.

Therapist: It's almost as if you're caught in a cycle where your mind is constantly trying to make sense of this anxiety, but it's not providing the clarity you're looking for. Instead of helping you move forward, it's keeping you stuck.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you do start working on a project, and then this anxiety kicks in? What are some of the thoughts that go through your head during that time, and how does it affect your ability to focus and make progress?

Patient: When I start a project my brain launches into what feels like an adversarial simulation, probabilistically inflating minor bugs or edge cases into catastrophic evidence of incompetence—it's almost a predictive model tuned to detect failure. That anticipatory analysis monopolizes attention and working memory, so I default to “safe” tasks (polishing docs, refactoring, researching minutiae) that look productive but are really avoidance, and actual feature work stalls. The recurring thoughts are things like "this will expose I'm not cut out for this" or "if they see this, they'll think I was a mistake," and those hypervigilant circuits from my PTSD just keep amplifying the loop.

Therapist: It's like your brain is running a worst-case scenario simulation, and that's exactly what's causing you to get stuck in this cycle of avoidance and procrastination. The way you describe it, it's not just about being anxious about coding, it's about being anxious about being perceived as incompetent, and that's a very different kind of fear.

Can you think of a moment, maybe a long time ago, where this fear of being perceived as incompetent first started to take hold for you? Was there something specific that triggered it, or was it a gradual build-up of experiences?

Patient: It's both gradual and marked by a salient inflection: early on there were messages—teachers and parents equating competence with worth—that primed me for anxiety, but the thing that really crystallized it was a production outage in my first job where I got singled out and publicly reprimanded for something that was partly systemic. That event felt like a categorical indictment, and cognitively it's been encoded as a high-salience threat signal, so my brain now runs those adversarial failure simulations anytime there's uncertainty. I can describe that intellectually—how it became a learned predictive model—but I can also tell you it still makes me want to hide when the pressure mounts.

Therapist: So the anxiety you're experiencing is not just a rational response to a situation, but it's deeply tied to a sense of self-worth and a past experience that has been encoded in your brain as a threat. It's like your brain is constantly running a simulation of that public reprimand, and it's triggering a fight-or-flight response that's hard to turn off.

It's interesting that you mention being able to describe this intellectually, but still feeling the physical and emotional effects of it. That's a common experience for many people who have PTSD or anxiety. It's like there's a disconnect between what your brain is thinking and what your body is feeling, and that can be really confusing and disorienting.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to feel that pressure mounting? What are some of the thoughts and physical sensations that you experience in those moments?

Patient: Physiologically it’s predictable—my sympathetic system kicks in so my attention narrows and working memory gets hijacked: heart rate up, throat tight, shallow breaths, a queasy stomach and this odd derealized flatness like I’m observing myself from outside. Cognitively it becomes a carousel of probabilistic catastrophes—“this will expose me as incompetent,” “they’ll trace this back to my failure,” plus meta-criticisms about how I should’ve planned better—so instead of tackling the hard task I default to safe, polishing behaviors that feel productive but aren’t. I can describe all of that in neat cognitive-behavioral terms, but honestly it still makes me want to disappear and I get frustrated that it’s so automatic.

Therapist: It's like your brain is playing a game of "what if" and "probability of disaster" when you're under pressure, and it's hard to shake off those thoughts and feelings. The physical symptoms, like the racing heart and tight throat, are very real and can be overwhelming.

It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're observing yourself from outside. Have you ever tried to practice mindfulness or meditation, where you focus on the present moment and try to let go of those thoughts and feelings? Or is that something that feels too foreign or uncomfortable for you right now?

Also, I want to gently point out that you've been describing your experience in very cognitive-behavioral terms, which is helpful for understanding what's going on in your mind. However, I've noticed that you often say things like "I feel like I want to disappear" or "I get frustrated that it's so automatic." Can you tell me more about what that feels like, and how you experience those emotions? Is it like a strong desire to escape, or is it more of a sense of helplessness or powerlessness?

Patient: I’ve tried mindfulness—breathing exercises and short body scans—but instead of grounding me they tend to amplify the derealization and the catastrophic loops, so it feels unsafe rather than calming. When I say “I want to disappear” it’s more like a neurobiological impulse to down-regulate my salience—to emotionally blunt and withdraw so the threat signal dims—rather than a cinematic urge to run away. The frustration is layered: anger at the automaticity, shame that I “should” be able to do the work, and a resigned helplessness because I can list interventions but can’t reliably implement them. So yeah, it’s both an escape impulse and a sense of powerlessness, but I usually describe it in theoretical terms to keep a safe distance.

Therapist: It's like the mindfulness exercises you've tried have had the opposite effect, instead of calming you down, they've made you feel more anxious and disconnected from your body. That's a really tough spot to be in, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and helpless.

I want to try to help you explore this sense of powerlessness a bit more. Can you tell me more about what it feels like to be in a situation where you can't seem to implement the strategies you know will help? Is it like a sense of being stuck in a loop, where you're repeating the same patterns over and over, but not getting anywhere?

Also, I want to gently challenge your tendency to describe these feelings in a way that keeps you at a safe distance. You mentioned that you "usually describe it in theoretical terms to keep a safe distance." But I want to encourage you to try to explore these feelings in a more direct way, without judgment. Can you try to imagine what it would be like to sit with these feelings, to really feel them in your body, without trying to intellectualize them or push them away?

One small experiment you might try is to simply notice your physical sensations, without trying to change them or push them away. Can you take a deep breath and bring your attention to your body, noticing where you feel tension or discomfort? See if you can explore these sensations in a more direct way, without trying to label them or analyze them.

Patient: When I can't implement strategies it's like falling into an attractor basin—my prefrontal cortex gets hijacked by the threat model, attention narrows, and every small glitch becomes probabilistic evidence that the whole system will fail, so I loop and feel demoralized. I tried the breath just now: there's a tightness in my throat and chest, a queasy hollow in my stomach, and this odd derealized flatness that makes everything feel observed rather than lived. My immediate reflex is to run diagnostics—generate hypotheses about why this is happening—because that explanatory frame feels safer than sitting with the raw discomfort. I'm trying to do this, but it's escalating my anxiety; okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trapped in a vicious cycle, where your brain is constantly trying to analyze and predict potential failures, and that's making it hard to feel safe or in control.

I want to acknowledge that it's taking a lot of courage to try to explore these feelings in a direct way, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's like you're trying to navigate a treacherous terrain, and it's hard to keep your footing.

Can we take a step back for a moment? I want to check in with you and make sure you're okay. It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious and overwhelmed, and I want to make sure you're not feeling like you're in danger of getting stuck in a bad cycle.

Let's try to break it down a bit. You mentioned that your immediate reflex is to try to run diagnostics and generate hypotheses about why this is happening. Can you tell me more about what that feels like? Is it like trying to solve a puzzle, or is it more like trying to understand a complex system?

Also, I want to gently ask: are you feeling like you're doing this because you think it's the "right" thing to do, or are you feeling it because it's what feels most comfortable or safe in the moment?

Patient: It's more like reverse-engineering a complex system under threat—less a curious puzzle and more a survival protocol where I map failure modes to feel like I can exert control. I tell myself it's the "right" thing because I'm a developer and problem-solver, but honestly it's primarily about safety: analysis blunts shame and anxiety. My throat's tight and that detached, observing quality is back, and I'm trying not to hide in theory, but I'm slipping—I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're in a state of high alert, trying to control the situation by analyzing and predicting potential failures. It's like your brain is trying to anticipate and mitigate the threat, and that's making it hard to feel safe or relaxed.

I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that it's not just about being a "good problem-solver" or trying to control your emotions. It's normal to feel like you're losing control or slipping away when you're under stress.

Can we take a moment to focus on your breath and bring yourself back to the present? It might help to try a simple grounding exercise, like noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground or the sounds around you. Sometimes, taking a small step back and focusing on the present moment can help calm the mind and body.

Also, I want to check in with you about your feelings of shame and anxiety. You mentioned that analysis helps blunt those feelings, and that's understandable. But I want to make sure you're not using that as a way to avoid dealing with your emotions. Are there other ways you've found to cope with shame and anxiety that you'd like to try?

Let's take a break and come back to this when you feel more comfortable.

Patient: I don't want a full break—breaks usually become avoidance for me and just feed the procrastination loop. I'm feeling flooded again—throat tight, queasy, derealized—and I'm skeptical about breath work since that made it worse before. Can you guide me through a very short, concrete grounding I can tolerate (something like naming a few things in the room or a 60-second sensory check)?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try a short grounding exercise. It's okay if it doesn't work out perfectly, and we can always try something else.

Let's try a simple 60-second sensory check. I want you to focus on your surroundings, and I'll guide you through it. Please try to pay attention to your body and notice any physical sensations, but don't try to change them or analyze them.

Here's what I want you to do:

For the next 60 seconds, I want you to notice:

1. Your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body, the sensation of the floor, and the pressure of your feet touching the ground. Try to notice the texture of the floor, the temperature, and any sensations that come up.
2. Your hands. Look at your hands, feel their weight, and notice any sensations in your fingers, wrists, or palms.
3. The air around you. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the temperature, and any scents or smells that come up.

As you do this, try to focus on one thing at a time. Don't worry about the other things we've been talking about; just concentrate on the present moment.

We'll do this for 60 seconds, and then we can try to move forward.

Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay, I'm ready — I did the 60-second check. My feet feel heavy and grounded, I notice pressure under my heels and a coolness under my toes; my hands are slightly tense, fingertips a bit tingly; the air feels cool on my face and there's a faint coffee-ish smell. Throat's still tight and my stomach's queasy, but the derealized flatness eased a little — it's less like observing from outside and more like being present at the edge. I'm still a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down before we move on?

Therapist: I'm glad the 60-second check helped a bit. It's understandable that you're still feeling overwhelmed, and I want to take it slow.

Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge the progress you've made. You've noticed a slight decrease in the derealized flatness, and your body is responding to the grounding exercise. That's a good start.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to be present at the edge, as you described it? Is it like being on the boundary between being in control and losing control, or is it more like being aware of your emotions and thoughts without being overwhelmed by them?

Also, I want to check in with you about your breath. You mentioned that your throat is still tight and your stomach is queasy. Are there any specific breathing exercises or techniques that might help you feel more comfortable? I'm here to support you, and we can try different approaches if needed.

Let's take it one step at a time. We can move forward at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

Patient: "Present at the edge" is like standing with one foot on the control panel and one foot on unstable ground—I'm aware of the predictive loop and can watch it without being fully pulled in, but it only takes a small nudge to tumble back into catastrophizing. I'm skeptical about breath work because shallow or forced breathing tends to amplify my derealization, but physiologically I get that longer exhales can down-regulate arousal, so I'm willing to try a very short, concrete micro-technique: three rounds of nasal breathing with a 4-second inhale and an 8-second exhale, hand on my belly. If that starts to escalate the dissociation, I want to switch immediately to a tactile anchor—pressing my feet into the floor or holding something cold—to interrupt the loop. Okay, I'm already a bit overwhelmed; can you guide me through just those three rounds and we'll pause if it feels wrong?

Therapist: It's like you're walking a tightrope, balancing between control and loss of control. That's a delicate and potentially volatile situation.

I'm glad you're willing to try a micro-technique to calm your nervous system. Let's go through the three rounds of nasal breathing, and I'll guide you through it.

You're already in a good position, with your hands on your belly and ready to focus on your breath. I'll count out loud, and you can follow along.

Round 1:
Inhale for 4 seconds... (4)
Exhale for 8 seconds... (8)

Take your time, and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Your hand on your belly can help you feel the expansion and contraction of your diaphragm.

Round 2:
Inhale for 4 seconds... (4)
Exhale for 8 seconds... (8)

Keep your focus on the breath, and try to let go of any thoughts or worries about the predictive loop. Just observe it, without getting caught up in it.

Round 3:
Inhale for 4 seconds... (4)
Exhale for 8 seconds... (8)

We're almost done. Take one final, deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. When you're ready, we can pause and see how you're feeling.

Remember, if you start to feel like the dissociation is escalating, just switch to the tactile anchor – pressing your feet into the floor or holding something cold – and we'll pause the exercise. Your safety and comfort are my top priority.

Patient: I did the three rounds — the extended exhale actually nudged my autonomic state a bit; the throat tightness is reduced and the derealization is less intense, though my stomach is still queasy. My first reflex is to explain why (parasympathetic rebound, breath–vagal linkage), but I can also say plainly: I'm calmer but still anxious about jumping back into problem-solving. Can we move forward slowly — maybe plan a tiny, time-boxed behavioral experiment (10 minutes, one concrete micro-goal, a visible timer) and a clear tactile anchor if the dissociation resurfaces?

Therapist: It's like you're able to observe the impact of the breath work, even if you're not fully comfortable with it yet. The parasympathetic rebound and breath-vagal linkage are interesting concepts, and it's great that you're able to recognize them.

I think it's a good idea to move forward slowly and plan a tiny, time-boxed behavioral experiment. A 10-minute experiment can be a good starting point, and we can break it down into a clear micro-goal. Let's say your micro-goal is to write down a single sentence or phrase that you think is a key aspect of your problem or challenge. We'll use a visible timer to keep you focused and on track.

To make it more concrete, let's choose a specific time box: 10 minutes, with a 5-minute warm-up phase (just writing down some random thoughts or feelings) and a 5-minute cool-down phase (reflecting on what you've written down).

As for the tactile anchor, we'll use a simple press of your feet into the floor. If you start to feel any dissociation or discomfort, just press your feet down hard for a few seconds, and then we can pause the experiment.

Here's the plan:

* Warm-up phase (5 minutes): Write down some random thoughts or feelings. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or coherence. Just focus on getting your thoughts down on paper.
* Main phase (5 minutes): Write down a single sentence or phrase that you think is a key aspect of your problem or challenge. Use your breath work and any other techniques we've discussed to help you focus and stay calm.
* Cool-down phase (5 minutes): Reflect on what you've written down. What insights did you gain? What do you think you can do with this information?

Let's get started. We'll begin with the warm-up phase, and I'll count out loud. Remember to focus on your breath and your thoughts, and don't worry too much about what you're writing down. Just let it flow.

Patient: Okay — quick note: you said 10 minutes earlier, then outlined 5+5+5 (that's 15); I'm fine with the 15 but just flagging the mismatch because I'm a little control-oriented about structure.

Warm-up (raw notes):
- "If this surfaces, they'll see the thread and I'll be exposed."  
- "I should refactor this before touching the feature — safer."  
- "Throat tight. Queasy but steadying as I write."  
- "What if an edge case breaks and they trace it to me?"  
- "Planning feels like armor; doing feels like risk."

Main phase (single sentence as the micro-goal):
- "My autonomic threat model treats small mistakes as proof of global incompetence, which drives avoidance of core tasks."

Cool-down reflection (brief):
- Writing that out felt exposing and triggered some shame, but it also clarified that the fear is about identity (competence = worth) more than the task itself. I'm still anxious and a bit flooded—throat tight, stomach queasy—but less derealized. I'm ready to try the 10-minute time-box you proposed (or the 15 if you prefer); I want a visible timer and will keep my feet pressed into the floor as the tactile anchor if dissociation ramps up. Can we start the timed micro-task now, slowly?

Therapist: Thank you for pointing out the mismatch in time frames. I'm glad we can stick with the 15-minute structure.

Now that we've completed the main phase, let's move into the cool-down reflection. It's interesting that writing down your thoughts and feelings helped clarify the root of your anxiety. The fear of being perceived as incompetent is indeed closely tied to your sense of self-worth.

I'm glad you're feeling a bit more grounded after the cool-down. Before we begin the 10-minute time-box, I want to make sure you're comfortable with the plan. You mentioned wanting a visible timer and a tactile anchor (pressing your feet into the floor) to help you stay focused and calm.

With that in mind, let's get started with the 10-minute time-box. I'll set a visible timer for 10 minutes, and we'll focus on a specific task. Remember, the goal is to write down a single task or action that you think you can accomplish in the next 10 minutes. This might be a small, seemingly insignificant task, but it's an important step in building your confidence and momentum.

As we work on this task, I want you to keep your feet pressed into the floor and focus on your breath. If you start to feel any dissociation or discomfort, just press your feet down hard for a few seconds, and then we can pause and check in.

Ready to get started? Here's your 10-minute time-box. I'll start the timer now...

Patient: Alright—I’m starting. Micro-task: draft a single, explicit next-step for the feature (create endpoint stub, add one unit test, write a 3-line TODO in the ticket). Timer on my phone is running, feet pressed into the floor, throat tight but manageable; check in with me at 5 minutes so I don’t default to analysis-avoidance.

Therapist: I'll check in with you in 5 minutes. For now, just focus on drafting that single, explicit next-step. Take your time, and don't worry too much about grammar or spelling. Just get the task written down.

As you work, I'll just remind you to keep your feet pressed into the floor and focus on your breath. If you start to feel any dissociation or discomfort, just press your feet down hard for a few seconds, and then we can pause and check in.

You've got 5 minutes. Just go.

Patient: Check-in: I wrote the explicit next-step — "create endpoint stub GET /feature, add one unit test for the happy path, leave a 3-line TODO in the ticket" — and pinned it where I can see it. Physically I'm a bit calmer (derealization reduced) but the throat tightness and queasy stomach are still there and my mind keeps wanting to nitpick the wording instead of starting. Can we continue for the remaining 5 minutes with the micro-goal to actually create the endpoint stub (or at least scaffold it), and check back when the timer ends? My feet are pressed into the floor and I’ll use that if dissociation ramps up.

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some progress, but you're still feeling a bit stuck. Creating the endpoint stub is a concrete task that can help you build momentum.

Let's focus on the micro-goal of creating the endpoint stub. Can you try to scaffold it, even if it's just a basic structure? For example, you could start with something like:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify
from your_app import app

@app.route('/feature', methods=['GET'])
def get_feature():
    # TO DO: implement logic to handle the GET request
    pass
```

Just try to get the code written down, and don't worry too much about the details. You can refine it later.

You've got the next 5 minutes. Take a deep breath, and let's get started. Remember to keep your feet pressed into the floor and focus on your breath. If you start to feel any dissociation or discomfort, just press your feet down hard for a few seconds, and then we can pause and check in.

The timer is running.

Patient: I started scaffolding but my anxiety spiked and my attention splintered into nitpicking instead of finishing; here's the minimal stub I wrote down:

from flask import request, jsonify
from your_app import app

@app.route('/feature', methods=['GET'])
def get_feature():
    # TODO: implement logic to fetch feature
    return jsonify({"feature": None}), 200

Physically I'm more tense now—throat tight, hands a bit shaky, stomach queasy—and my brain keeps wanting to tinker with imports and edge cases instead of hitting save. Can we make the next micro-step explicit: I’ll save this file and run a quick linter/formatter in the next 5 minutes, and then check back with you? My feet are pressed into the floor as the tactile anchor; please check in after 5.

Therapist: It sounds like your anxiety spiked again, and you're feeling more overwhelmed than before. It's great that you're acknowledging your emotions and taking a step back to assess the situation.

I'm proud of you for making it this far and writing down the minimal stub. That's a significant accomplishment, especially considering how anxious you were feeling.

Now, let's make the next micro-step explicit. Saving the file and running a quick linter/formatter is a great way to take care of the technical details without getting too caught up in the code.

Here's what I want you to do:

1. Save this file (don't worry about the TODO comments or the logic for now).
2. Run a quick linter/formatter to make sure the code is formatted correctly and there are no syntax errors.
3. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that you've already accomplished a lot by getting this far.

You've got the next 5 minutes. Take it one step at a time, and remember to keep your feet pressed into the floor as the tactile anchor.

After 5 minutes, we'll check in again and see how you're feeling.

Patient: Check-in: I saved the stub but I couldn't finish the linter step — my anxiety spiked and my attention splintered into nitpicking imports and edge cases; hands shaky, throat tight, stomach queasy, and I'm more scattered and distracted than I was five minutes ago. I can try a very small, concrete next-step: git add + git commit with a one-line message and then run a single linter command (flake8 or black --check) for up to 2 minutes. If dissociation ramps up I’ll press my feet into the floor and stop immediately. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit irritable about how fragile my focus is right now — can we slow down and check back in after 5 minutes?

Therapist: It sounds like your anxiety is still a significant challenge for you, and it's affecting your ability to focus and complete tasks.

I'm proud of you for acknowledging your feelings and being willing to take small steps to manage them. Your proposed next-step, using a single linter command and committing to a small message, is a good way to take care of some technical details without getting too overwhelmed.

Before we move forward, I want to check in with you about your emotional state. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, irritable, and scattered, which is understandable given what you're going through. It's okay to feel this way, and it's not a sign of weakness.

Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to slow down. We don't have to rush through this process. In fact, taking a slower and more deliberate approach might be exactly what you need right now.

So, let's agree to check in again in 5 minutes. If you need to take a break or step away from the task, that's perfectly okay. We'll come back to it when you're feeling more comfortable and focused.

In the meantime, take a few deep breaths, and try to focus on your physical sensations. Are your hands shaking, or is your throat tight? Are there any other physical sensations that you're experiencing? Try to bring your attention to those sensations, and see if you can find any calm or relief.

We'll be back in 5 minutes, and we'll take it from there.

Patient: Physically: throat tight, hands shaky, queasy stomach, heart a bit fast — sympathetic arousal and my attention is splintered and jumpy. My energy's low, but I can try git add + git commit -m "stub" and run black --check (two minutes); it'll take real effort, so please check back after that. I'll keep my feet pressed into the floor and stop immediately if the dissociation ramps up.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding to the stress and anxiety you're feeling. Your throat is tight, your hands are shaky, and your stomach is queasy, which can make it hard to focus and concentrate.

I want to acknowledge that it's going to take a lot of effort to run the git command and the linter, but I'm here to support you. You're right to be concerned about the dissociation, but I want to reassure you that we'll take it one step at a time.

Before we proceed, I want to check in with you about your emotional state again. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and irritable, which is a lot to process. Can you tell me what's going through your mind right now? Are there any specific thoughts or worries that are making it hard for you to focus?

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to take breaks or step away from the task if you need to. Your well-being and safety are my top priority.

Let's focus on taking small steps forward. You can try running the git command and the linter, and we'll check in again in 2 minutes. If you need to take a break or step away, that's perfectly okay. We'll come back to it when you're feeling more comfortable and focused.

Remember, you've got this. You're strong, capable, and resilient. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: My head's full of probabilistic catastrophizing—“this commit will expose sloppiness,” “code review will trace bugs back to me,” and an urge to refactor ad infinitum instead of shipping. Physically: throat tight, hands shaky, stomach queasy, and my energy is low so everything feels effortful. I'll try to run git add, git commit -m "stub" and black --check now (keeping my feet pressed into the floor as an anchor); please check back in two minutes so I don't dissolve into nitpicking.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a perfect storm of anxiety and self-doubt. The probabilistic catastrophizing is a classic symptom of this, where your mind starts to imagine all the worst-case scenarios and it's hard to shake off those thoughts.

I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you're working on a project that's important to you. The fear of not meeting expectations or making mistakes is a natural part of the creative process.

Given your current state, I think it's a good idea to focus on the task at hand and try to make progress without getting too caught up in nitpicking. You've agreed to run the git command and the linter, and that's a great first step.

Let's agree to check in again in 2 minutes. I want to make sure you have a chance to work through your thoughts and feelings without feeling too overwhelmed. If you need to take a break or step away, that's perfectly okay. We'll come back to it when you're feeling more comfortable and focused.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay to not have all the answers right now. The goal is to make progress, not to create perfect code. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Take a deep breath, focus on your feet, and try to stay present. We'll check in again soon.

Patient: I ran git add && git commit -m "stub" — commit succeeded, but black --check flagged formatting issues. Now my mind's doing its usual contingent-decision paralysis, wanting to refactor and nitpick style instead of shipping; my hands are shaky, throat tight, and my energy is really low. I can either run black --quiet to autoformat and push, or push as-is and deal with style in a follow-up—I'm too drained to reliably choose; what would you recommend? My feet are pressed into the floor as the anchor.

Therapist: It sounds like you're at a critical juncture, where you need to make a decision about how to proceed with your commit. The formatting issues flagged by black --check have triggered your usual contingency decision paralysis, where you're weighing the pros and cons of refactoring and nitpicking the style versus shipping the code as-is.

I want to acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed and drained, which is making it hard for you to make a decision. It's like you're stuck in a loop, where you can't decide whether to push the code as-is or refactor it to meet your standards.

In this situation, I would recommend running black --quiet to autoformat and push the code. Here's why:

1. You're too drained to reliably choose between refactoring and shipping the code as-is. By autoformatting, you're avoiding the mental fatigue of making a decision.
2. The formatting issues flagged by black --check are likely minor, and you can address them in a follow-up commit. This approach allows you to focus on shipping the code and then come back to the style issues later.
3. By pushing the code as-is, you're taking a small risk, but it's a manageable one. You can always come back to the code later and address any issues that arise.

Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to create perfect code. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Take a deep breath, focus on your feet, and trust that you can come back to the style issues later. You've got this.

Patient: Okay — that makes sense logically, and autoformatting reduces the contingent-decision load, so I’ll run black --quiet and push. My anxiety is spiking though: throat tight, hands shaky, stomach queasy, attention splintering, and I’m low-energy so this feels like pulling teeth. I need you to stay with me and check in immediately after the push so I don’t dissolve into nitpicking; I’ll keep my feet pressed into the floor as the anchor and run the command now. Please prompt me in about a minute to confirm the push went through.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions, and the anxiety is spiking up again. I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way, especially when you're pushing code that might not be perfect.

I'm here to support you, and I'll check in with you as soon as the push goes through. You've got this, and I'll be right here with you.

Take your time, and run the command now. Remember, you've got your feet pressed into the floor as the anchor, and that's a great reminder to stay grounded.

I'll prompt you in about a minute to confirm the push went through. Just focus on getting the command executed, and then we'll check in.

Go ahead and run the command. I'll wait for your confirmation.

Patient: Push succeeded — black --quiet ran and git push completed. My hands are still shaky, throat tight, stomach queasy, and my attention's already fracturing into nitpicks; I'm low-energy so deciding the next move feels like a lot. Please stay with me — should I open the PR now with a one-line note, or watch CI and fix anything that fails? Check back in a minute so I don't start undoing the progress.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit more settled now that the push has gone through. However, I can see that your hands are still shaky, your throat is tight, and your stomach is queasy. It's like your body is still trying to process the anxiety that's been building up.

Let's take a deep breath together and try to focus on the next step. You've got a few options here, but I want to suggest that watching CI and fixing anything that fails might be the way to go. It's like a safety net, you know? If there are any issues with the code, it's better to catch them now and fix them before anyone else sees it.

Opening the PR now with a one-line note might feel like a big decision, especially if you're feeling low-energy. But sometimes, taking a small step forward can help build momentum and confidence.

Let's take a moment to think about this. What do you think would be the best next step? Should you open the PR now, or watch CI and fix anything that fails?

Take your time, and just focus on the present moment. I'll be right here with you, checking in and supporting you as you make this decision.

Patient: Logically, watching CI and addressing failures as they surface seems like the lower-risk, lower-exposure move—probabilistically it reduces immediate social threat. Physically I'm still low-energy, throat tight and hands shaky, and I can feel my brain gearing up to nitpick; I'll monitor CI and resist opening the PR until it's green. Please check back in a minute so I don't start undoing progress—I’ll keep my feet pressed into the floor as the anchor.

Therapist: the CI is a useful exercise, but it feels contrived and artificial. It's not like I'm trying to fix problems that aren't there, it's more like I'm trying to justify my own behavior or create a narrative for my own anxiety. I'm trying to convince myself to do this exercise, to get through this anxiety.

Patient: Yeah — calling it out feels right. It is a safety ritual: lowers immediate social threat probabilities, but functionally it's still avoidance dressed up as engineering practice. 

I know that in theory, but in practice it feels hollow and effortful — throat's tight, energy's low — and I'm worried I'm just manufacturing benign tasks to avoid the real exposure. Can we slow down and pick one less performative step (like you prompting me to open the PR after CI is green) and stay with it so I don't dissolve into nitpicking?

Therapist: the change, not advice. change

Patient: Okay — "change, not advice" actually lands: I can enumerate interventions all day, but what I mostly do is recruit more process to avoid the exposure that would actually change things. Saying "acceptance" like a mantra feels oddly familiar and also like another layer of theorizing my way out of feeling it.

Right now my throat's tight and I'm low on energy, so here's one small enacted acceptance I can try: if CI goes green, I will open the PR immediately without any extra pre-merge tinkering. Can you prompt me to do that when it goes green so I don't dissolve into rituals?

Patient: Okay — that avalanche of "accept" actually registers: thematically it's saying change, not another meta-process. Concretely, I’ll enact one piece of acceptance now — if CI goes green I will open the PR immediately without extra pre-merge tinkering; can you prompt me to do that when it turns green so I don't slip into rituals? Physically I'm still low-energy and my throat's tight, so I need that external nudge; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we stay with this plan?

Patient: Okay — I can try to say "I feel like that." Saying it feels a little performative, like another meta-layer, but I’ll do it to enact acceptance rather than theorize about it. Physically I'm low-energy, throat tight, queasy; please prompt me to open the PR when CI goes green and stay with me so I don't slip into ritualizing.
