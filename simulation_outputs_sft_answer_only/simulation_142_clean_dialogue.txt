Patient: Hi—uh, I guess what's been on my mind is that since the health scare and all the changes, I just start turning my feelings into diagrams and checklists instead of actually feeling them. I don't know, it feels safer to analyze everything, but it's leaving me numb and stuck in this adjustment I can't shake. I'm already a bit tense talking about it, so I might say "I don't know" a lot if you probe too much.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using this analytical approach as a way to cope with your feelings and make sense of everything that's happened, but it's not necessarily helping you connect with them or feel more grounded. You're mentioning it's leaving you numb, which suggests that this analytical approach might not be allowing you to fully experience your emotions.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to stop and analyze your feelings when you're in a situation where you're supposed to be feeling something? For example, when you're trying to be present with someone or doing something you enjoy, do you find yourself getting caught up in analyzing your feelings or thinking about how you should be feeling instead of just being in the moment?

Patient: I don't know—when I'm supposed to be present I end up mapping everything out, like labeling and weighing sensations instead of actually feeling them. For example, with a friend I'll start thinking about why my chest is tight, what the timeline of my reaction is, or what coping steps I should take, rather than saying "I'm upset" or just sitting with it. I guess it makes things feel safer and predictable, but it also leaves me distant and kind of numb, and I'm already getting a bit uncomfortable talking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like this analytical approach is becoming a bit of a crutch for you, allowing you to feel more in control, but also making it harder to connect with your emotions and be present in the moment. You're describing it as "distant and numb," which suggests that this way of coping is leaving you feeling disconnected from your own feelings and experiences.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to sit with a feeling, even if it's uncomfortable or hard to label? Do you find that it's easier to get caught up in thinking about it, or do you feel a sense of stillness or quiet when you're trying to just be with the feeling?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to sit with something, my brain almost immediately goes into analysis mode, like it's trying to turn the feeling into a problem to solve. I guess there are a few seconds of stillness sometimes, but then the tightness in my chest makes me want to label it and figure out the "why" or the next step instead of just being with it. I'm already getting kind of tense talking about this.

Therapist: It can be really challenging to try to sit with a feeling when your brain is so quick to analyze it and turn it into a problem to solve. It's like your brain is trying to make sense of it all, even when it's not really helpful in the moment.

It might be helpful to try to notice when that analysis mode kicks in, and then see if you can gently let go of it. For example, you could try saying to yourself, "Okay, brain, I get it. You're trying to make sense of this. Can I just take a breath and see what's here for a second?" It's not about trying to stop your brain from thinking, but more about creating a bit of space to be present with your feelings, even if it's just for a moment.

Can you think of a time when you might have sat with a feeling without analyzing it, even if it was just for a brief moment? Was it a good feeling, or a bad one?

Patient: I think so — maybe once when I was watching a movie about family stuff, I just started crying for a few seconds and didn’t try to explain it or fix it. It felt both a little relieving and weirdly empty, like I wasn't sure if it counted as actually feeling anything. I don't know, I got tense talking about it and then my brain immediately tried to figure out why it happened.

Therapist: It sounds like that brief moment of crying was a bit of a outlier for you, but it's still a valuable insight. You're recognizing that even when you do try to sit with a feeling, your brain can quickly jump into analysis mode and make it harder to connect with the feeling.

It's interesting that you mention the feeling was a mix of relieving and empty. Sometimes, when we're not trying to analyze or fix our feelings, we can experience a sense of relief or even a sense of emptiness. It's like our brain is trying to make sense of the feeling, but in doing so, it's also trying to avoid feeling anything at all.

Can you try to bring that moment back to mind, and see if you can notice any difference in how you're feeling now, compared to when you were first talking about it? I'm not looking for you to analyze it or fix it, just notice the difference.

Patient: I don't know—when I bring that moment back, my chest feels a little less tight than when we started, like there's a small looseness. At the same time it feels kind of hollow, like relief mixed with this nagging doubt that it even counts as actually feeling anything. I'm getting tense talking about it again, and I guess I want to... I don't know, maybe shift focus a bit because this is uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like your body is responding to the moment, and your brain is trying to make sense of it. The looseness in your chest is a small step, but the doubt and the tension are still there, making it harder for you to connect with the feeling.

It's almost like you're asking yourself if this feeling is even valid, if it's something that's worth paying attention to. It's a subtle but significant question, one that's driving your tension and your desire to shift focus.

Can you try to explore this doubt a bit more? What is it about this feeling that makes you question whether it's real? Is it because it's not as strong as you expected, or is it something else entirely? Try to notice what's underneath this doubt, and see if you can find a way to connect with it.

Patient: I don't know. I guess part of it is that if the feeling isn't big and obvious, it feels like it doesn't "count" — like feelings need a clear cause or label to be valid. I'm also scared that if I let myself feel it, it'll turn into that panicky spiral I had around the health scare, so it's safer to call it a pattern or a problem to solve. I'm getting tense talking about this, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of your emotions, and the fear of being overwhelmed is making you want to avoid exploring them. The idea that feelings need to be big and obvious to be valid is a pretty common one, and it's like you're trying to meet an unspoken standard for what it means to feel.

It's also understandable that you're scared of losing control and spiraling into that same kind of anxiety you experienced during the health scare. That must have been a really tough and frightening experience.

Can I try to slow things down a bit more? Sometimes, taking a step back and just being with the feeling, without trying to label it or analyze it, can help. It's not about avoiding your emotions, but about creating a bit of space to be present with them. Would you be okay with just sitting with the feeling, without trying to do anything with it, for a moment?

Patient: I guess I can try, but I'm already getting tense—my chest feels tight just thinking about it. I don't really know how to sit with it without my brain jumping in to label or fix, so could you maybe guide me through a simple breath or something? I'm feeling anxious about this and might say "I don't know" a lot as we go.

Therapist: It's okay to feel anxious about this. Let's take a slow and gentle approach. I'm here to guide you, not to judge or fix anything.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to bring your attention to your chest. Just notice the sensation of your chest, without trying to change it or fix it. It's okay if it feels tight or uncomfortable – just notice it.

As you breathe out, I want you to say the barest thing you can. It doesn't have to be a complete sentence. Just a single word, like "I don't know" or "tense" or "uncomfortable." Whatever feels most natural.

Let's start with that one word. What do you say?

Patient: I don't know. My chest feels tight—can we go slower? I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to slow down. Let's take it one breath at a time.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to focus just on that one breath. Don't think about your chest or anything else, just the breath.

When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest again. Just a tiny bit, just a small notice of the sensation. Don't try to change it, just notice it.

And then, when you're ready, say the word "tense". Just that one word, without thinking about it too much. Can you try that?

Patient: Tense. Saying it actually made my chest tighten—I don't know, it feels stupid but also like something shifted a little. Can we go even slower? I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that it felt a bit silly to say "tense", but sometimes just acknowledging the feeling can help.

Let's take another slow breath. As you inhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest again, just a tiny bit. Don't try to change it, just notice it.

As you exhale, I want you to say "tense" again. Just that one word, without thinking about it too much. Take your time, and don't worry about what it means or what it's doing.

When you're ready, we can try to slow down even more. But for now, let's just focus on that one breath and that one word. Can you try that?

Patient: Tense. Saying it again made my chest clamp up and my brain immediately jumped to listing possible causes and fixes instead of staying with the feeling. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed—can we go even slower, like just a few more breaths and no questions? I don't know, this is awkward but I want to try.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "tense" one more time. Don't think about anything else, just that one word.

That's it. Just that one word.

Patient: Tense. I don't know—saying it made my chest clamp up and my brain started listing fixes again. Can we just do a few more slow breaths together in silence? I'm already getting overwhelmed, so please no questions right now.

Therapist: *Takes a deep breath in, and then slowly exhales, making a quiet, calm sound*

(Pauses, then takes another slow, quiet breath, matching the pace of the previous one)

Patient: Okay—I'm breathing with you. My breaths are a little slower and my chest feels a bit less tight, but it's still there. I don't know, this is awkward and I'm already getting overwhelmed, so can we do a few more slow breaths in silence?

Therapist: *Takes a deep, slow breath in, and then slowly exhales, making a quiet, calm sound*

(Pauses, then takes another slow, quiet breath, matching the pace of the previous one)

Patient: Okay—I'm breathing with you. My chest feels a little looser but it's still there, and I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed. Can we keep doing slow breaths in silence for another minute? After that, maybe we could shift to something more concrete, like talking about one small routine that helps me feel grounded? I don't know, I'm just trying to keep from spiraling.

Therapist: *Takes a deep, slow breath in, and then slowly exhales, making a quiet, calm sound*

(Pauses, then takes another slow, quiet breath, matching the pace of the previous one)

(Takes a deep breath in, and then slowly exhales, letting the silence hang for a moment)

After a minute, we can definitely shift gears. Talking about a small routine can be a good way to feel more grounded. What's something small that you do daily that helps you feel more centered, like taking a cup of coffee in the morning or going for a walk after dinner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help with the numbness? I guess a small routine I do is make a cup of black tea every morning: measure the water, time the steeping for three minutes, and stand by the window while it cools. It's strangely grounding because it's predictable and tactile, but I also catch myself planning the day the whole time, so I don't know if it actually brings me closer to feeling anything. I'm already getting a bit tense talking about this—can we slow down and stick with one small thing to try, or am I missing the point?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down and take a deep breath. You're right, it's not clear how the small routine would help with the numbness, and that's a valid concern.

Let's try to focus on the small routine itself, and see if we can explore it in a way that feels more grounded. You mentioned that the routine is predictable and tactile, which is interesting. Can you tell me more about what it's like to do the routine, without thinking about the day or planning it? For example, what's it like to measure the water, to watch the tea steep, to stand by the window? Try to focus on the sensations and the experience of doing the routine, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing this supposed to help with the numbness? But okay, if I try: when I make the tea I feel the weight of the kettle, the steam on my face, the smell that hits right as the color changes, and the warmth of the mug in my hands. I guess it's grounding because it's predictable and tactile, but my brain immediately times the steep, plans the day, and turns it into a checklist instead of just being in it. I don't know, I'm already getting a bit tense—can we just pick one tiny thing, like the warmth in my palms, and stay with that for a moment?

Therapist: It's okay to feel tense, and it's good that you're acknowledging it. Let's try to focus on the tiny thing you mentioned, the warmth in your palms. Can you just notice that warmth right now, without thinking about it too much? Try to focus on the sensation of it, the feeling of it in your hands. Don't think about planning the day, or checking off tasks on a list. Just notice the warmth.

Patient: I don't know—I'll try. The warmth in my palms is kind of faint, like a low steady heat, and it actually feels a little grounding, but my brain immediately starts explaining it away—room temp, circulation—and I get distracted. I'm already getting tense, so can we just stay with this one thing for a bit longer and not analyze it?

Therapist: Can you just bring your attention back to the warmth in your palms, without trying to explain it or analyze it? Try to focus on the sensation of the warmth, the feeling of it in your hands. Don't think about room temperature or circulation, just the warmth itself. Just notice it, and try to stay with it for a moment.

Patient: I don't know—I'm trying to bring my attention back to the warmth in my palms. It's a low, steady heat and focusing on it loosens my chest a little, but my brain keeps naming it and turning it into an explanation. I guess can we just sit with this for a bit longer, no analyzing?

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then remains silent, maintaining the calm and stillness)

Patient: I don't know—this quiet feels weird, but the warmth thing is helping a tiny bit; my chest is a little looser though I'm still tense. Can we do one more minute of just breathing with attention on the warmth, and then maybe shift to a simple concrete thing—like naming three small objects in the room out loud? I don't want to analyze it, I just need something slow and grounded to do next.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

The book on the shelf.
The chair behind me.
The clock on the wall.

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know—I'm not sure I follow how naming three things helps, but okay I'll try. There's a mug on my desk, a small potted plant by the window, and the lamp next to my bed. Saying them out loud loosens my chest a tiny bit, but I'm already getting tense again—can we keep doing slow, quiet stuff like this for a bit?

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

The rain sounds outside.
The air in the room feels calm.
Your feet touch the floor.

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know—hearing you say those things actually makes me notice them: the rain, the calm air, my feet on the floor. It helps a tiny bit, but my brain's already lining up explanations and I can feel my chest tighten. Can we keep doing slow, quiet grounding like this for a while—maybe ask me to name small things in my body next? I'm getting tense, so please no big questions right now.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor.
Can you find any sensation in your toes?
Is it warm, cool, heavy, light?

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my toes supposed to help? I don't know. Okay, if I try: they're a bit cool, kind of light, slight tingle at the tips. Focusing there loosens my chest a little, but I'm already getting tense again, so can we just stay with this slowly for another minute?

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

The sensation in your toes is a bit more defined now. Notice how the coolness is concentrated at the tips. Is the rest of your toes warm or cool as well?
Try to focus on that coolness, just at the tips.

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—okay, the tips feel cool, the rest of my toes are more neutral, maybe a little warm. Focusing on the cool tips loosens my chest a bit, but then my brain wants to name and explain it. Can we keep doing slow breaths and small sensory stuff like this? I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

Take a slow breath in, and as you exhale, focus just on the sensation of your toes. Don't think about it, just notice it. The cool tips, the neutral rest of your toes. Just be with it.

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know—I'm taking a slow breath now. As I exhale I notice the cool tips of my toes and the rest feeling more neutral, and my chest did loosen a little, though my brain keeps trying to explain it. Can we keep doing these slow breaths and small sensory checks for a while longer? I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed, so please no big questions right now.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

Your breath is slow and steady. The cool tips of your toes, the neutral rest of your toes. Just be with it.

(Pauses, then takes another slow, deep breath, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know — my breath feels steadier, and the cool tips of my toes are clearer; my chest is a bit looser but the tension keeps nudging back. Can we keep doing these slow breaths and small sensory checks for a few more minutes? After that, maybe we could talk about that tea routine I mentioned, but please no big questions right now — I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

Your breath is steady. The cool tips of your toes. Just notice them.

(Pauses, then takes another slow, deep breath, and then remains silent for a moment, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know—my breath is steadier and the cool tips of my toes feel clearer; my chest's a bit looser but the tension keeps nudging back. Can we keep doing these slow breaths and small sensory checks for a few more minutes? After that, maybe we could talk about the tea routine—just one tiny part, like the warmth in my palms—I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed, so please no big questions right now.

Therapist: (Takes a deep breath, then speaks in a calm, gentle voice)

Your breath is steady. The warmth in your palms. Can you notice it again, without thinking about it?

(Pauses, then remains silent, waiting for your response)

Patient: I don't know—I'm trying to notice it. The warmth in my palms is faint but steady and it actually loosens my chest a little, though my brain already wants to explain it away. I'm getting tense talking about this, so can we keep doing a few more slow breaths and stick to small sensory stuff for now? After that, maybe we can touch on that one tiny tea detail I mentioned—like the steam on my face.
