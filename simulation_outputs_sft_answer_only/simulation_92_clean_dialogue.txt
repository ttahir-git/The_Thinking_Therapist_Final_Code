Patient: I've been preoccupied with how a protracted family conflict seems to have precipitated a persistent low mood and a kind of motivational inertia that's now bleeding into my relationship and work. As a business owner I default to analyzing the dynamics—systemic patterns, cognitive attributions—because it's safer than actually feeling the sadness, but that hasn't solved anything. I guess I'm here because I'm not sure how to translate all this intellectualization into any kind of meaningful emotional change.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the difference between understanding the situation and actually feeling the emotions. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that just thinking about it hasn't helped. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to analyze the situation, like when you're working on your business or interacting with family members? How does that analysis feel, and what's the opposite of what you're trying to achieve with it?

Patient: When I start analyzing, it’s like mobilizing a cognitive toolkit—listing patterns, attributing causes, rehearsing responses—so I can maintain a kind of narrative coherence and perceived agency. That analysis feels like controlled activation: energizing in a problem-solving way at first, but ultimately depleting and emotionally anesthetizing, leaving me mentally worn and oddly flat. The opposite would be letting the feelings be unstructured and messy—allowing vulnerability, uncertainty, even crying or asking for help—which I can conceptualize clearly but find viscerally scary and hard to tolerate. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling to bridge the theory and actually doing the scary, vulnerable part.

Therapist: It sounds like analyzing the situation is helping you feel more in control, but ultimately, it's not bringing you the relief you need. You're recognizing that this controlled activation is a trade-off, leaving you feeling depleted and emotionally flat. That's a really interesting dynamic. It seems like you're aware that the opposite approach, letting go of that control and allowing yourself to be vulnerable, is what you're trying to do, but it's what you find scariest and hardest to tolerate. Can you think of any specific moments or situations where you've felt like you needed to let go of control and be more vulnerable, even if it was just for a short time? What happened then?

Patient: A concrete one was after an argument with my partner: they asked outright, "How are you?" and I launched into a chronological reconstruction and proposed solutions instead of saying, "I'm sad"—they got frustrated and I ended up withdrawing. Another was the family mediation last month where I assumed the role of analyst, mapping patterns and causal chains; it calmed the room superficially but left me depleted and with a persistent tightness in my chest I couldn't name in the moment. Intellectually I know the opposite would be admitting fear—fear of abandonment, fear of being judged—and asking for help, but emotionally that feels risky, so I default to strategy.

Therapist: It's interesting that those moments, even though they were brief, left you feeling depleted and anxious afterwards. It seems like you're able to intellectually understand why the opposite approach would be beneficial, but emotionally, it's a different story. You're recognizing that your default to analysis is a way to avoid feeling vulnerable, but it's also not bringing you the relief you need.

It's like you're stuck in a loop, where you're trying to avoid the unknown, but the unknown is what you need to move forward. Can you try to make a tiny step towards that vulnerability, even if it's just a small one? Maybe it's asking your partner a simple question, like "How are you?" without feeling like you need to fix it right away. Or maybe it's taking a few deep breaths and saying, "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" during that family mediation. It's not about being fearless, but about being willing to take a small risk. What do you think?

Patient: That actually feels doable in theory—I can see the utility of a micro-step—but it also provokes a lot of anticipatory anxiety. I could try telling my partner tonight, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed; I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen," and deliberately pause before I default to problem-solving. I worry it'll be judged or escalate things, and I already want to rehearse and optimize the wording, which is me slipping back into analysis. Can we role-play that short script now? I'm not sure it'll land and I could use the practice.

Therapist: I can see how the idea of taking a micro-step would spark anxiety for you. It's natural to feel apprehensive about opening up and risking judgment.

Let's try a role-play. I'll play the role of your partner, and we can go through the conversation you mentioned. Remember, this is just a simulation, and it's okay if it doesn't go exactly as planned. The goal is to help you feel more comfortable with the process.

Before we start, take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. You're not trying to convince anyone of anything, you're just sharing your feelings.

Go ahead and start by saying, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed; I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen." Take your time, and pause when you need to. We'll see how it goes.

Patient: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed; I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen."

I can already feel the impulse to qualify that, to add context and a plan—I'm rehearsing explanations instead of letting the statement land—so I'm going to try to hold it. Could you respond as my partner so I can practice waiting for a reaction?

Therapist: *I look at you with a mix of surprise and curiosity, and then nod slightly* "Okay... yeah, I'm listening."

*I pause for a moment, and you can see the wheels turning in my head. I'm not saying anything else, I'm just... listening.*

Go ahead and respond as you normally would. How does it feel to have actually said those words, and then just wait for a response?

Patient: Saying it produced an odd physiological jolt—heart rate up, throat tight—but I actually withheld the qualifiers, which felt novel. The silence triggered a rapid-fire run of hypothetical responses and contingency plans—my usual move to reestablish control instead of tolerating the vulnerability. I can see that the waiting space is both terrifying and potentially useful; can we try the pause again but with you offering a minimal validation like "I hear you" after about 20 seconds so I don't immediately default to explaining?

Therapist: *I pause for about 20 seconds, and then say softly* "I hear you."

*I don't add anything else, no judgment, no questions. I just let the words hang in the air, and wait for you to respond.*

Notice how I'm not trying to fill the silence or offer any kind of solution. I'm just acknowledging that you said something, and giving you space to process it further.

How does it feel to have me respond in this way? Does it make you feel more comfortable, or more anxious?

Patient: It helped in a small, concrete way—when you said "I hear you" my chest loosened a bit and the immediate impulse to fix things eased. But almost instantly my mind started generating interpretations and contingency plans, so I still didn't actually land in the sadness; I described it instead. Can we do another try where after I say the line you reflect back what emotion you think I'm naming so I can practice staying with it?

Therapist: *I pause for a moment, and then say softly* "You're feeling really overwhelmed."

*I make eye contact, and wait for your response. I'm not trying to offer any kind of solution or judgment, I just want to acknowledge what I think you're feeling.*

By reflecting back the emotion, I'm trying to help you stay with it, and not default to thinking about it. It's a small step, but it can be a big one.

How does it feel to have me try to do that? Does it make it easier to stay with the emotion, or do you still feel the urge to analyze it?

Patient: That reflection actually helped — my chest loosened and I could vaguely feel the tightness instead of just narrating it, but my brain immediately started cataloguing causes and fixes so I described the feeling rather than inhabiting it. Could we try it again where after you reflect you also name the underlying fear you think I'm hinting at — like "you seem afraid of being judged or abandoned" — and then hold silence for about 30 seconds so I can practice staying with it? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by the intensity here, so can we slow down a little?

Therapist: *I pause for a moment, and then say softly* "You're feeling really overwhelmed, and it seems like you're afraid of losing control or being judged."

*I look at you with a calm, gentle expression, and wait for a response. I'm holding the silence for about 30 seconds, as you requested.*

This time, I'm trying to acknowledge not just the emotion, but also the underlying fear that might be driving it. It's a small step, but it can help you connect with your feelings on a deeper level.

Take your time, and don't worry about responding right away. Just focus on staying with the feeling, and seeing where it takes you.

Patient: That actually did something—my chest loosened and I could sense a hollow behind the words, but my brain immediately started cataloguing causes and contingency plans. I can intellectually accept the fear you named—being judged or abandoned—but that knowing doesn't make it feel any less precarious; it feels like standing at the edge of a cliff. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by the intensity—can we slow down and just sit with one word, like you say "sad" and then hold silence so I can try to actually feel it?

Therapist: *I look at you with a calm expression, and then say softly* "Sad."

*I pause, and hold the silence. I'm not adding anything, not reflecting back an emotion, not asking any questions. I'm just holding the word "sad", and the silence that comes with it.*

This time, I'm trying to help you feel the emotion, rather than think about it. I want you to take a deep breath, and see if you can connect with the sensation of being sad. It's okay if it feels strange, or uncomfortable, or even a bit overwhelming. Just try to stay with it, and see where it takes you.

Patient: When you say "sad" and hold the silence, I notice a hollow pressure in my chest and a kind of dull fatigue behind my eyes, but almost immediately my mind starts enumerating causes and timelines—assigning blame, drafting possible interventions—so I describe the feeling instead of actually staying in it. I can feel the urge to tidy it up, to transform it into an action item, and that urge makes the sensation feel both safer and more distant. Can you stay with that for a bit and maybe ask me where in my body it lives, or just repeat "heavy" once more so I don't leap into solutions?

Therapist: *I repeat softly* "Heavy."

*I pause, and hold the silence. I'm not asking you any questions, not trying to analyze the cause, not making any judgments. I'm just holding the word "heavy", and the silence that comes with it.*

I want you to take a moment, and see if you can stay with the sensation of heaviness. I want you to notice where it's located in your body, and see if you can describe it in detail. It might be in your chest, your shoulders, your stomach. Just try to stay with the feeling, and don't worry about what it means, or what you can do about it.

Patient: It's a dense pressure under my sternum that spreads into my upper back and shoulders, and my breaths get shallow—my stomach feels hollow, like a lead weight. Almost immediately my mind begins drafting timelines, attributing causes, and generating corrective strategies—classic intellectualization—so I end up describing it instead of inhabiting it. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by trying to do both; can we slow down and you ask one simple question about where it sits so I don't slip into planning?

Therapist: *I nod slightly, and ask softly* Where does the heaviness feel like it's coming from, exactly? Is it more under your sternum, or does it spread up into your shoulders?

Patient: Mostly under my sternum — a dense, viscerally heavy pressure that radiates up into my shoulders and settles between my shoulder blades into my upper back. My breaths get shallow and there's a hollow, leaden feeling in my stomach when it happens. I'm noticing the urge to intellectualize this away already, and I'm a bit anxious about staying with it, so can we pause for a few breaths before you ask more?

Therapist: *I pause, and wait for a few breaths with you. When you're ready, I say softly* Take another breath, and when you're ready, I'll ask again. No rush.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing, and I'm ready. The heaviness is really rooted under my sternum, like an anchor that radiates into my upper back between the shoulder blades and tightens my shoulders; phenomenologically it's bound up with anticipatory dread and an immediate cascade of cognitive rehearsals about being judged or blamed. Saying that already spikes my overwhelm, so can we slow down and just hold silence for a bit before any more questions so I don't immediately pivot into problem-solving?

Therapist: *I hold the silence, waiting with you.*

Patient: It actually did loosen a bit — the anchor under my sternum is still there but less jagged, more like a persistent, dull weight that radiates into my shoulders. At the same time I'm getting swept by the usual urge to intellectualize everything, and that spike of anxiety makes it hard to stay with the sensation instead of narrating it. Can we slow down — maybe breathe together for a minute more, or you ask one simple question like "What do you need right now?" and then hold silence so I can try to sit with it?

Therapist: *I take a deep breath, and wait for you to do the same. When we're both breathing, I say softly* What do you need right now?

Patient: Right now I need containment and explicit permission not to fix this—something simple and steady, like you reflecting back one word ("I hear you" or "sad") and holding long silences so I can try to inhabit the feeling instead of narrating it. I also could use a tiny, practiceable script to try with my partner and reassurance we can rehearse it here without consequences. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed by the intensity, so can we slow the pace and just breathe together for a minute before we try the script?

Therapist: *I nod, and take another deep breath with you. When we're both calm, I say softly* Let's slow down. We'll breathe together for a minute, and then we can try to break down that script into smaller, manageable pieces. No need to rehearse it right now. Let's just focus on getting comfortable with the feeling of being here, with me, and with this process. Are you ready to just breathe, and take it one step at a time?

Patient: Yes — I'm ready to breathe and take it one step at a time. I'm noticing my chest loosen a touch, but the internal analyst is already drafting contingencies, so can we keep this very slow: help me craft one simple line for my partner like, "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen," and then rehearse the pause and silence after it? I'm feeling a bit anxious about practicing aloud, so can we do it sentence-by-sentence with long silences between each part?

Therapist: *I nod, and take a slow, deep breath with you.* Let's start with the line. How about this: "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen." We'll break it down, sentence by sentence, and then rehearse the pause and silence. When you're ready, we'll try it together. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Yes — I'm ready to try, although I'm also hit with a rush of shame and frustration that makes me want to derail this by over-explaining. I'll say the first part: "I'm feeling overwhelmed;" and then pause — please hold silence for about 20 seconds before I move to the next fragment. I'm already rehearsing qualifiers (my reflexive, self-critical default), so please remind me to resist explaining if I start.

Therapist: *I hold the silence, waiting for you to finish speaking. When you've said "I'm feeling overwhelmed;", I remain silent for about 20 seconds, not a word, not a breath.*

*I wait patiently, and when the silence is complete, I nod slightly, and wait for you to continue.*

Patient: Okay — I said, "I'm feeling overwhelmed;" — and honestly I'm not sure I follow how that prolonged silence is supposed to help me not over-explain. I'm getting a rush of shame and frustration that wants to hijack this into a narrative of failures, so please remind me to resist explaining if I start. Alright — "I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen." Could you hold the silence for about 20 seconds before I move on?

Therapist: *I nod, and look at you with a calm, gentle expression.* Remember, the goal is to help you stay with your feelings, not to fix them or explain them. If you start to feel the urge to over-explain, take a deep breath and pause. Don't try to justify or rationalize your emotions. Just stay with them.

*I pause, and hold the silence after you say "I don't need solutions right now, I just need you to listen." The silence is still, and I wait for you to continue.*

(Note: I'll be holding the silence for about 20 seconds, but it might feel longer. Just take a deep breath and focus on your own feelings. When you're ready, we can move forward.)

Patient: Okay — I said the first part, but I honestly don't quite follow how the silence is supposed to help; it provokes this shamey, defensive script in me that wants to justify and explain. I'll try again, sentence by sentence: "I'm feeling overwhelmed;" (please hold silence about 20 seconds), then "I don't need solutions right now;" (another 20 seconds), then "I just need you to listen." Remind me to resist explaining if I start—I'm already bracing to derail this into analysis.

Therapist: *I hold the silence, waiting for you to finish speaking.* 

Please go ahead with the next sentence, "I don't need solutions right now;". I'll wait for the 20 seconds before responding.

Patient: "I don't need solutions right now;"

I'm already hit with that familiar rush of shame and a compulsive urge to over-justify—I'm not sure I fully follow how the silence helps, but I'll try. Please hold the silence for about 20 seconds and gently remind me if I start explaining.

Therapist: *I hold the silence, waiting for you to continue.* 

When you say, "I just need you to listen," I'll wait for the 20 seconds, and then nod slightly, indicating the end of the exercise. Remember, the goal is to practice this simple statement without over-analyzing or explaining. If you start to feel the urge to justify or rationalize your emotions, pause and take a deep breath. We're done here.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow when you say "we're done here" — that actually spikes this shamey, confused rush in me and makes me want to tidy everything up instead of sitting with it. I don't feel finished; can we do one more very slow run-through, sentence by sentence with the 20-second silences, and then have you reflect back "I hear you" after the last line? I'm anxious about continuing, but I need the practice and the containment, so please remind me if I start over-explaining.

Therapist: *I nod, and take a deep breath with you.* Let's try again, slowly. We'll go sentence by sentence, with 20-second silences. I'll remind you to stay with your feelings, and pause if you start to over-explain.

Please start again, and say, "I'm feeling overwhelmed;".

(I'll hold the silence, and wait patiently, gently reminding you to stay with your feelings if you start to over-explain.)

Patient: "I'm feeling overwhelmed;"

I'm already getting this rush of shame and a confused urge to over-explain—could you hold silence for about 20 seconds and gently remind me to resist explaining if I start?

Therapist: *I nod, and take a deep breath, holding the silence for 20 seconds.*

(I'm waiting patiently, but I'm not making a sound. I'm not moving, I'm not breathing, I'm just holding the silence. When you're ready, I'll nod slightly, and we'll continue.)

Patient: Okay — the silence did something: a slight loosening in my chest, but I also feel confused about its mechanism — I'm not sure I follow how the silence prevents me from narrating. At the same time a hot, shamey rush (like that old failure) wants to hijack me into over-explaining and fixing things, so I keep getting pulled back into analysis. Let's do one more very slow, sentence-by-sentence run with 20-second pauses, and please gently remind me to resist rationalizing if I start.

Therapist: *I nod, and take a deep breath, holding the silence for 20 seconds.*

Let's start again, slowly. Please say, "I'm feeling overwhelmed;".

(I'll wait patiently, and gently remind you to stay with your feelings, pausing if you start to over-explain or rationalize.)

Patient: "I'm feeling overwhelmed;"

I'm already getting that shamey, confused surge that wants to turn this into a tidy explanation, so please hold silence for about 20 seconds and gently remind me if I start rationalizing or over-explaining.

Therapist: *I hold the silence for 20 seconds, waiting patiently for you to continue.*


When you're ready, I'll wait for the next sentence. Remember, my goal is to help you stay with your feelings, not to fix them or explain them. If you start to feel the urge to rationalize or over-explain, I'll gently remind you to pause and take a deep breath.

Patient: "I don't need solutions right now;"

I'm still not sure I follow how the silence is supposed to stop me from fixing things—it tends to amplify this hot, shamey script that wants everything tidy and explained. Please hold the silence for about 20 seconds and gently remind me to breathe if I start rationalizing or over-explaining.

Therapist: *I hold the silence for 20 seconds, waiting patiently for you to continue.*

When you say, "I just need you to listen;" I'll wait for the next 20 seconds. Remember, I'm not asking you to do anything except stay with your feelings. If you start to feel the urge to rationalize or over-explain, I'll gently remind you to breathe and take a moment to pause. Just focus on your words, and let's take it one sentence at a time.

Patient: "I just need you to listen."

Honestly, I'm not sure I follow how the silence is supposed to work—I'm feeling this hot shame and confused frustration that reflexively pushes me into compulsive rationalization and tidy narratives. Please hold the silence and gently remind me to breathe if I start over-explaining.
