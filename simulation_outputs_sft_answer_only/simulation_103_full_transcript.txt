Patient: I've been stuck in these cycles of harsh self-criticism — any little mistake feels like proof I'm failing. I come from a really high-achieving family, and that pressure to succeed just amplifies my OCD and makes me doubt everything. I guess... I don't know, it's kind of awkward to say out loud, but that's what’s been on my mind.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It can be really tough to open up about this stuff, especially when it comes from a place of feeling like you're not good enough. It sounds like the weight of those high expectations has been really affecting you, and it's making it hard to catch a break when things don't go as planned.

Can you tell me more about what it's like when these cycles of self-criticism kick in? Is there a particular trigger that sets it off, or is it more of a general feeling that you're aware of?

Patient: I guess it usually kicks in after I make even a tiny mistake at work or when my family says something that sounds... judgmental. Then my head just spirals — replaying it, listing everything I've done wrong, checking and rechecking stuff, telling myself I'm not cut out for this. I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to say, but sometimes it's just this low-level dread like I'm waiting for someone to call me out.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain gets stuck in this loop of worst-case scenarios, and it's hard to escape. It's not just about the mistake itself, but about the way it makes you feel about yourself. The low-level dread you're talking about is really interesting - it's like you're always on edge, waiting for something to go wrong.

Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind when you're replaying that mistake or all the things you've done wrong? Is it like you're trying to convince yourself of something, or is it more like you're trying to make sense of it all?

Patient: I guess when I replay it I'm trying to make sense of what happened, but it pretty much flips into convincing myself I'm a failure. My head just lists every screw-up and I start checking and replaying things over and over until I feel sick. I don't know, it's awkward to say—can we maybe talk about ways to stop the spirals, or... how to deal with my family's comments instead?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to make sense of the situation, but instead, you're ending up with a really negative narrative about yourself. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling bad, but it's taking a really heavy toll.

Let's talk about the spirals. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start checking and replaying things over and over? Is it like you're trying to find a way to make it all go away, or is it more like you're trying to find a way to make yourself feel better?

Patient: I guess it's both — I check because part of me thinks if I fix every little thing the anxiety will go away, but it never does and just makes me spiral more. My head keeps replaying stuff like a loop and I get physically tense, nauseous even. I don't know, it's hard to sit with that without wanting to change the subject—can we also talk about how my family reacts when this happens?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in this cycle of checking and replaying, and it's not just about fixing the mistakes, but also about calming your own anxiety. And when it does happen, it's like your family's comments are just fuel for the fire. It's like they're saying, "We knew you weren't cut out for this," or something like that.

Can you tell me more about what your family's comments are like when you're in this spiral? Are they direct and critical, or more passive-aggressive? How do you feel when they say things like that?

Patient: They're both, I guess — sometimes they're blunt, like "Why did you mess that up?" and other times it's more passive-aggressive, like little comments about standards or expectations. When they say that I feel small and ashamed, like I'm failing them, and it just feeds the spiral until I'm nauseous and trying to hide. I don't know, it's getting kind of intense to talk about—can we focus on how I might respond when they do that?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like their comments are really triggering for you, and it's like they're hitting you right where you're already vulnerable. It's understandable that you'd feel small and ashamed, especially when it comes from people who are supposed to support and encourage you.

Let's take a step back and look at how you might respond when they do that. Can you think of a time when someone said something similar, and how you reacted to it? Maybe there was a moment when you felt like you could just walk away or change the subject. What was that like for you?

We're not trying to change how your family reacts, but rather how you might handle their comments when they're hurtful or triggering. Can you think of a small, low-stakes moment where you might be able to practice responding in a way that feels more grounded and less reactive?

Patient: I guess a low-stakes moment is at family brunch when my brother teases me about "overreacting" to something small. I usually freeze and laugh it off or say "whatever," then feel worse. Maybe I could try something like, "That really stings—I'm doing my best," or a short boundary like, "Please don't joke about that," but I don't know if I could actually say it without getting shaky. Can we... talk about some really simple, calm lines I could use that won't turn into an argument?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're already feeling a bit raw and vulnerable, and your brother's teasing is just another thing to deal with. Your goal is to keep it calm and simple, without escalating the situation.

Let's start with those lines you mentioned. Can you repeat them back to me, and we can try to break them down? What do you think might happen if you say something like, "That really stings—I'm doing my best"? Is it like a magic shield that protects you, or is it more like a way to deflect the teasing?

Also, what about the boundary you mentioned, "Please don't joke about that"? How does that feel to you? Is it something you'd be willing to try, or does it feel too direct or confrontational?

Patient: I guess I can try them: "That really stings — I'm doing my best," and "Please don't joke about that." Saying the first one feels like it might protect me a little, but I also worry it'll make me sound pathetic or invite more teasing. The second feels clearer but too blunt — I get shaky just thinking about saying it. Do you have any super short, calm options I could actually manage in the moment? I don't know, I'm kind of nervous about this.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to feel nervous about trying new things, especially when it comes to dealing with teasing or criticism.

Let's focus on some super short, calm options that might help. Can you try saying something like, "That's really hard for me"? It's just a simple acknowledgment of your feelings, without taking on a lot of emotional labor.

Another option might be, "I'm trying my best here." It's short, direct, and focuses on what you're doing, rather than how you feel.

If you're worried about sounding too defensive or pathetic, you could try, "That's not funny" – it's a simple statement that says you don't appreciate the joke. It's not a big commitment, and it can help you set a boundary.

Remember, the goal is to take a small step, not to try to change everything at once. Which of these options feels like it might be manageable for you in the moment?

Patient: I guess "I'm trying my best here" feels the most doable, but I can already feel my voice getting shaky just thinking about it. I don't know, "That's not funny" seems too blunt and might make things worse. Can we... actually practice saying the first one a couple times, or come up with an even shorter phrase I can use when I feel frozen?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice saying "I'm trying my best here" a few times, just to get a feel for it. I'll start, and then you can try it, and we can go back and forth.

"I'm trying my best here."

Go ahead and say it out loud, and then we can try it a few more times to get comfortable with it.

Also, I want to try to come up with an even shorter phrase for you. Can you think of something that might be one or two words, and still get the point across? For example, what if we try something like "I'm here"? It's short and simple, and it still conveys that you're trying to do your best.

Let's try it a few times, and see what feels more natural.

Patient: "I'm trying my best here."  
"I'm trying my best here."  
"I'm trying my best here." My voice is already shaky when I say that. I don't know, saying it out loud makes me feel kind of stupid and ashamed, like I'm admitting I can't handle things. The shorter one, "I'm here," feels too flat—"I'm here"—and I guess it wouldn't stop them. Can we actually do the practice where you say the teasing line and I try to respond? I feel like I might freeze, but I want to try.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the practice exercise. I'll say the teasing line, and you can try responding with "I'm trying my best here". Don't worry about sounding stupid or ashamed - just focus on responding.

Also, I want to remind you that I'll be playing the role of your brother, so I might try to make the teasing line a bit more convincing. Are you ready?

"Come on, you're really overreacting to this. It's just a little mistake."

Go ahead and try to respond with "I'm trying my best here". I'll give you feedback and support.

Patient: "I'm trying my best here." It comes out small and shaky. I feel stupid and ashamed for saying it, like I'm admitting I can't do anything right, and it makes me want to disappear. I don't know—can we try it again, maybe louder or more like my brother so I can practice not freezing?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel that way, especially when you're trying to respond to a teasing comment.

Let's try again, and I'll give you some feedback. This time, I'll play your brother's comment a bit louder and with more of a joking tone.

"Come on, you're really overreacting to this. It's just a little mistake. You're not going to mess up the whole family with one tiny thing, are you?"

When I said that, I want you to try responding with "I'm trying my best here". Try to say it a bit louder and with more conviction. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about being honest and trying to do your best.

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to take a deep breath before responding. You can say it again if you need to, and I'll give you feedback and support.

Go ahead and try again.

Patient: "I'm trying my best here." 

It comes out louder but still shaky, and I don't know—saying it makes me feel kind of awful, like I'm admitting I can't handle things. Can we try it again, maybe slower, or try a different short line?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're building up a bit of confidence, but still feeling a bit uncertain about how to respond.

Let's try again, and I'll slow down the pace a bit. I'll also try a different short line for you to respond to.

"Hey, that was a tough one. What did you do?"

Try responding with a simple "I'm trying my best here". Remember, it's just a quick response to acknowledge that you're doing your best.

If you need to, we can try another line, or I can give you some feedback on what's working and what's not.

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to take a deep breath before responding. You can say it again if you need to, and I'll give you feedback and support.

Go ahead and try again.

Patient: "I'm trying my best here."  

I guess it still feels small and shameful, like I'm admitting I'm not enough, and I don't know if that actually helps. Can we try a different short one—maybe "I'm doing my best"—or try it slower?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're still feeling a bit uncertain about how to respond, and the "I'm trying my best" line isn't quite working for you.

Let's try a different short line. I'll give you a few options, and you can choose the one that feels most natural to you.

Here are a few options:

* "I'll try that."
* "I'm going to do my best."
* "I'll figure it out."

Or, if you'd like to try it slower, I can ask you a question first, and you can respond with a simple "yes" or "no", and then we can build up to a more complete response.

For example, I could say:

"Is that a tough one?"

Or:

"Can you tell me a little more about what you're trying to do?"

Which of these options feels more natural to you, or do you have a different idea for how to start responding?

Patient: I guess "I'm going to do my best" feels a bit more natural — it's slightly firmer than "trying" but not aggressive. Saying it still makes my chest tighten and I feel stupid, though, so... I don't know, can we try the roleplay one more time?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling a bit more comfortable with the phrase "I'm going to do my best", but still feeling some uncertainty and self-consciousness.

Let's try the roleplay one more time. I'll play the teasing comment again, and you can respond with "I'm going to do my best".

"Come on, you're really not good at this. I mean, I'm trying to help, but it's like you're not even listening."

Go ahead and respond with "I'm going to do my best". Remember, I'm playing the role of your brother, and I might try to make the comment a bit more teasing or sarcastic. Try to stay focused on your response, and don't worry too much about how you're coming across.

Also, after we try this, I want to talk to you about something. It seems like you're feeling a bit more comfortable with the phrase "I'm going to do my best", but still feeling some self-consciousness about it. I want to talk to you about what might be going on underneath the surface, and see if we can't work on building your confidence even more. Sound good?

Patient: Okay… I guess that's fine. I don't know, when you start digging I get really shaky and this stupid shame rushes in like I messed everything up. Can we go slow and just look at one small thing I can actually handle?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of digging deeper, and that's okay. Let's take a step back and focus on just one small thing.

Can we try to look at the phrase "I'm going to do my best" just from a purely functional perspective? What does it mean, and how does it help you in a situation like the one we were just practicing?

In other words, let's try to break it down to its simplest components, and see if we can't understand it a bit better. No judgments, no digging for deeper meanings... just a straightforward look at how it works.

How does the phrase "I'm going to do my best" make you feel in a small, low-stakes situation?

Patient: I guess in a low-stakes moment it kind of grounds me — "I'm going to do my best" feels a bit firmer and less apologetic than "trying." But saying it still makes my chest tighten and my voice go small, like I'm admitting I'm not enough. I don't know… can we just pick one tiny, concrete thing I can try next time instead of digging into why it hurts so much?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling a bit more grounded by the phrase "I'm going to do my best", but still struggling with the physical and emotional sensations that come with it.

Let's try to focus on a tiny, concrete thing you can try next time. What if, in a situation like the one we were practicing earlier, you simply said "I'm going to do my best" without worrying too much about how you're coming across?

For example, if you're asked to explain something, you could try just saying "I'm going to do my best to explain it, and I'll try my best to make it clear." No promises, no guarantees... just a simple acknowledgment that you're going to do your best.

How does that sound? Is there a specific situation or scenario where you could try saying "I'm going to do my best" in a small, low-stakes way?

Patient: I guess I could try it at the next family brunch when my brother starts teasing me — just say, "I'm going to do my best," and then try to move on. Maybe I'll rehearse it a couple times before I go so my voice isn't as shaky. I don't know, I'm nervous about it but it feels like a tiny, manageable thing to try. Can we go slow with practicing that?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're feeling more willing to try it out, and I'm happy to help you practice in a low-pressure way.

Let's start with something even smaller than saying "I'm going to do my best" in a situation like the family brunch. Can you try just rehearsing the phrase "I'm going to do my best" out loud, without any context or anticipation? Just say it once, and then take a deep breath.

We can do it together, if that makes you feel more comfortable. I'll just repeat it back to you, and then you can try it again. Ready? "I'm going to do my best."

Patient: "I'm going to do my best."  

It comes out so small and my chest tightens—ugh, I can feel that shame creeping up. I don't know, can we try it again, slower? My voice keeps getting shaky and I want to get it right.

It's like your body is already responding to the phrase, even before you say it out loud.

Let's try it again, really slow. I'll take my time, and you can repeat it back to me. We'll go at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

Here's the phrase again: "I'm going to do my best." Take your time, and say it when you're ready. I'll wait for you.

Patient: "I'm going to do my best."  

It still comes out tiny and my chest just tightens — this stupid shame and frustration rushes in and I don't know, it makes me want to freeze.

It's like the phrase has become a kind of trigger for you, and it's causing a physical response that's hard to control.

Can you try something different? Instead of saying the phrase, can you try making the sound of the phrase? Just make the "I'm going to do my best" sound, without saying the words. It's just a sound, and it doesn't have to mean anything. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I guess... mmm—just a tiny, breathy sound, like I started to say it and then stopped. It makes my chest clamp up and that stupid shame rushes in, and I don't know, that's all I can do right now. Can we keep going slow?

Let's take a step back even further. Can you try just noticing how your body is feeling right now? Can you pay attention to the sensation in your chest, and the way your heart is beating? Sometimes, just becoming more aware of our physical sensations can help us feel a bit more grounded.

I'm not going to ask you to do anything else for now. Just take a deep breath, and notice how you're feeling.

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing, but my chest is still tight and my heart's kind of fluttery, like there's a knot in my stomach. I can feel that shame buzzing under my skin and I don't know, it makes me want to look away. Can we go really slow—like, just one small grounding thing to do right now, please?

Can you pay attention to the feeling of your feet touching the floor, and the weight of your body distributed on them? It's a very gentle, calming sensation, and it might help you feel a bit more grounded right now.

Patient: Okay… I can feel my heels and the balls of my feet pressing into the floor, like a tiny steady weight. My toes feel a bit tingly and it's slightly calming, but the chest tightness and that stupid shame are still there buzzing—I don't know, it helps a little.

It's a very gentle, soothing sensation, and it might help you feel a bit more centered right now.
