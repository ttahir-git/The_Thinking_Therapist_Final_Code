--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed and kind of stuck since a difficult breakup — there's this constant sadness and I just don't have the motivation I used to, and it's starting to mess with my relationships and work. I guess I'm worried I keep pulling away from people, and I don't know how to fix it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this breakup has been really tough for you, and it's not just the sadness that's causing the problem – it's also how it's affecting your relationships and daily life. It's understandable that you're worried about how you're coming across to others. Can you tell me more about what it's like to try and connect with people when you're feeling this way? Is it hard to explain or find the right words?

Patient: I don't know... trying to connect feels awkward and exhausting. I can't find the right words — conversations feel flat or like I'm faking it, so I usually shut down or avoid reaching out. I guess I'm scared I'll come across as needy or like a mess, and then I just pull away and feel worse.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're really struggling to find your footing right now, and it's affecting how you interact with others. That must be incredibly tough. It's as if you're caught in a cycle where you're scared to be close, and that fear makes you pull away even more. Can you tell me more about what it is about feeling "needy" or like a "mess" that's so scary for you? What does that mean, exactly, in this moment?

Patient: I don't know...I guess it's mostly this fear of being judged or seen as weak — like if I show I need help, people will think I'm not capable, at work or in my personal life. I worry they'll pull away or treat me differently, and that just makes me want to hide more. I don't know, it sounds dumb even saying it out loud.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to admit to those feelings, and it's not dumb at all. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight, feeling like you need to be strong and self-sufficient all the time. That must be exhausting, both physically and emotionally. It's interesting that you mention being judged or seen as weak, though. Do you think that's a fair thing to be judged by? Shouldn't people be able to see that you're trying, and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that makes sense — it would be nice if people could see I'm trying, but I keep assuming they won't and it'll just confirm I'm a burden. I don't want to be that person, so I tend to retreat instead — also, my focus at work has been slipping lately and that just makes everything feel worse.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in this cycle of fear and self-doubt, where you're afraid to be seen as vulnerable or a burden, but at the same time, you're also afraid of failing or not being able to do your job. That must be a really tough place to be. It's interesting that you mention your focus at work slipping, though. Can you tell me more about what's going on there? Is it like your mind is elsewhere, or is it more that you're not feeling motivated or engaged?

Patient: I don't know... it's kind of both. My head's replaying the breakup a lot, so even small tasks feel huge and pointless and I can't get myself to start them. I guess I'm scared it looks like I'm slacking and people will think I'm not cut out for this job.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the breakup has really thrown you for a loop, and it's affecting your ability to focus on your work. It's understandable that you're worried about how others will perceive you, but it's also worth considering that maybe they're not paying as much attention to your work as you think. Sometimes, when we're going through a tough time, it can be hard to see things clearly, but it's possible that your colleagues are more supportive than you think. Would it be helpful to try to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, and see if that helps you get started again?

Patient: I don't know... maybe that could help. I guess if I break things into tiny steps — like a 20-minute sprint or just opening one file — it might feel less huge, but I'm worried I still won't start and then I'll just beat myself up about it. I'm tired of this loop; can we... I don't know, work out something that actually gets me to begin?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in this cycle of self-doubt and fear, and it's hard to break free. I think it's great that you're willing to try something different. Let's try a small experiment. Would you be willing to make a tiny commitment to yourself, just for this conversation? Can you commit to taking one tiny action, no matter how small, in the next 10 minutes? It could be as simple as opening a file, or making a phone call, or even just getting up and stretching. The goal is just to get you started, and then we can build from there. What do you say?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try to do something small — like open one work file and set a 10-minute timer, but I'm not promising I'll actually get into it. I'm worried I'll just stare and then beat myself up, so can you help me make the very first steps super specific? Like, what exactly should I tell myself to do first, because even that feels fuzzy.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're standing at the threshold, and you need a little nudge to take that first step. Let's make it as specific as possible. Here's a suggestion: when you open that file, you can say to yourself, "Okay, I'm going to take a deep breath and look at this file for exactly 10 seconds. That's it, just 10 seconds. I'll stare at the title, the words, the blank page, and then I'll... do whatever comes next." The goal is just to get you to look at the file, and then we can worry about what comes next. Can you do that for me? Can you open the file and say those exact words?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. I'll open the file now and tell myself, "Okay, I'm going to take a deep breath and look at this file for exactly 10 seconds." But honestly, I'm already thinking I'll just stare and close it — I don't know how to stop that.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're already caught in that pattern, and it's hard to break free. Okay, let's try something else. When you open the file and say those words, I want you to notice a small physical thing, just a tiny detail. Can you notice the feeling of your fingers on the mouse, or the sound of your keyboard clicking? Just pay attention to that small, simple thing. It's like a tiny anchor that can help you stay with the moment, instead of getting caught up in thoughts about what you're supposed to do next. Can you try that?

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow. How is that supposed to help? I tried opening the file and saying the line, and I did notice the click for a second, but then my head just started racing and I closed it; I guess it all felt kind of pointless, so can you be more specific about what I'm supposed to focus on, because it's hard for me to hold on to any one thing.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to grasp a handful of sand, and the moment it slips away. Let's try something more concrete. When you open the file, I want you to focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, the feeling of your chest rising and falling. Just notice that sensation, without trying to do anything or think about anything else. It's a simple, physical thing that's happening right now, and it's a tiny anchor that can help you stay present. Can you try that? Just focus on the breath, for a moment, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: I don't know... when I try to focus on my breath it just makes me more confused — like, how is breathing supposed to fix this? I guess I can feel my chest tighten and the in-and-out for a second, but then my head starts racing and I close the file. Can we try something less... touchy-feely? Maybe a concrete checklist of the first three tiny actions I should take on that file, because the breathing thing just feels useless to me right now.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the more you try to focus on the breath, the more your brain resists. Let's try a more concrete approach. Here's a simple checklist of the first three tiny actions you can take on that file:

1. Open the file: Take your hand and gently place it on the mouse. Move your hand to the mouse, and press the button to open the file.
2. Look at the file title: Once the file is open, take a glance at the title bar at the top of the screen. Just look at the words, the font, the color - nothing more, nothing less.
3. Take a 5-second pause: After you've looked at the file title, take a deep breath and pause for exactly 5 seconds. Don't do anything, just sit with the file on your screen for 5 seconds.

These actions are tiny, specific, and easy to accomplish. They're designed to help you get into a rhythm, without putting too much pressure on you. Can you try following this checklist, and see where it takes you?

Patient: I tried it. I moved my hand, clicked the file open, looked at the title for a second, and tried the five-second pause, but my head started racing and I closed it after maybe three seconds. I don't know… it just felt pointless and now I'm frustrated. Can you give me the next two super-specific tiny steps—like what exactly to put the cursor on or what three characters to type—because vague stuff makes me freeze.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the more you try to focus on small steps, the more your brain resists. Okay, let's try something even more concrete. Here are the next two tiny steps:

1. Move the cursor to the "C": After you've opened the file, place the cursor exactly 2 pixels to the left of the letter "C" in the title bar. Move your mouse cursor to that exact spot, and then press the left mouse button to move the cursor onto that spot.
2. Type the letter "N": Once the cursor is on the letter "C", type the letter "N" exactly 5 characters to the right of it. Keep the cursor on the keyboard and type those 5 characters slowly.

These actions are extremely specific, and they're designed to help you get into a rhythm. By focusing on these tiny tasks, you might be able to calm your racing thoughts and make progress. Can you try following these steps?

Patient: I don't know... that feels kind of bizarre and it's making me more anxious. I can't picture placing a cursor "2 pixels" from a letter or typing something "5 characters to the right" — like, what title are you talking about? Can we slow down? Maybe give me one plain, doable instruction — like "click in the document and type the word 'start'" — because this micromanaging stuff is just making me freeze.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I think I understand what's going on here. I apologize for the complexity of the previous instructions. You're right, it's better to start with something simple and straightforward.

Let's try to start again from a simpler place. Can you just click on the document and type the word "start"? That's it. Just click on the document and type those three words. No thinking, no worrying about what to type next. Just type the words "start" and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. Okay, I clicked in and typed "start", but it felt kind of ridiculous and my chest tightened and I almost closed it again. I don't know what to do next — can you give me one more small, concrete thing to do so I don't just bail?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you tried. It's completely normal to feel a bit silly or anxious when starting something new. Here's a very simple next step: Can you just press the "enter" key to submit the text? That's all. Just press the enter key on your keyboard. No thinking, no worrying. Just press the key.

Patient: I don't know... I pressed Enter and it submitted, but it felt stupid and my chest tightened and I almost closed it. I guess... can you give me one tiny, specific next thing to do in the document so I don't bail? I'm worried this is pointless, but I'll try.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. Okay, I'm going to give you one tiny thing to do. Can you just type the word "write" in the first line of the document? Just write those three letters: W-R-I-T-E. That's it. Just type those letters and see what happens.

Patient: I typed "write" and hit the key, but it felt dumb and my chest tightened and I almost closed it. I don't know... I can try one more tiny thing, but can you tell me exactly three words to put on the next line? I can't think of anything right now and it's making me freeze.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're waiting for permission to move forward. Here's what you can do: Can you just type the words "I am" on the next line? Just those two words: I A-M. That's it. Just type those words and see what happens.

Patient: I typed "I am" on the next line, but it just felt flat and kind of pointless. I don't know... my chest feels heavy and it's hard to get up any energy for this. I guess I can try one more tiny thing — what exactly do you want me to do next?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and fatigued. I want you to take a deep breath and pause for a moment. Can you just take one more deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly? I want you to give yourself permission to rest for a moment. When you're ready, we can try another tiny step. No pressure, no expectations. Just take a breath and see how you feel.

Patient: I took a slow breath like you said — it helped for a second, then my chest just went back to that heavy, foggy feeling. I don't know... I can try one more tiny thing if you tell me exactly what to do next, but I'm not sure I'll manage it.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to find a spark again. Okay, I'm going to give you one tiny thing to do. Can you just underline the word "I" on the line you just typed, "I am"? Just take your cursor, and underline those two letters, I. That's it. Just underline those letters and see what happens. Sometimes, taking care of the small details can help.

Patient: I underlined the "I", but it felt kind of pointless and my chest still feels heavy. I don't know... I can try one more tiny thing if you tell me exactly what to do next.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try something that's just about noticing your surroundings. Can you take a moment to look at the document title bar at the top of the page? Just glance up and notice the title, the font, the color. Don't think about anything else, just notice what's right in front of you. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I looked up — the title's "start.docx", small plain black font, nothing fancy. For a second that old knot came back and I felt... I don't know, kind of embarrassed and stuck, so I looked away. What do you want me to notice about it next?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're getting used to the surroundings again. Okay, I want you to notice the edge of the page. Can you see the border around the document? It's a thin line, usually a few pixels wide. Can you notice that? Don't try to do anything with it, just notice that it's there.

Patient: I saw it — a thin gray line around the page. For a second that old knot tightened and I felt... embarrassed, like I messed something up, so I looked away. I can try to look again, but I'm not sure I can hold on to it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're still caught in that pattern of self-doubt. Okay, I'm going to give you a break. Can you just take a moment to notice how you're sitting? Are you leaning forward or backward? Are your feet on the floor or are they resting on something? Just notice your physical position for a moment.

Patient: I don't know... I'm kind of slumped back in my chair, feet flat on the floor but my right foot's tapping a little, hands resting in my lap. My chest feels heavy and that knot tightened so I looked away for a second. I can try to keep noticing—what do you want me to focus on next?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to anchor yourself in the present moment. Okay, I want you to notice your breathing again. Can you feel the air moving in and out of your body? Can you notice the sensation of your chest rising and falling as you breathe? Try to focus on that sensation, without thinking about it too much. Just notice it, and see if it's different this time.

Patient: I don't know... my chest is tight and my breathing feels shallow when I try to follow it. A sudden rush of embarrassment and frustration comes up and pulls me away, so I can't stay with it for long. I guess maybe a concrete, tiny task would help more right now.

It's like you're getting pulled away by strong emotions again. Okay, I'm going to try something simple. Can you just type the letter "t" on your keyboard? Just one letter, just one key press. That's it. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I pressed "t" — it showed up, but it felt stupid and my chest tightened, that old knot of shame came back and I almost closed it. I can try one more tiny thing if you tell me exactly what to do next.

It's like you're stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and shame. Okay, I'm going to try something tiny and safe. Can you just type the word "okay" on your keyboard? Not a sentence, not a question, just the three letters "o-k-a-y". Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I typed "okay" — it showed up, but it felt hollow and that old knot of shame tightened like before. I'm kind of drained and it's getting harder to keep doing these tiny tests; I can try one more thing if you give me something really simple and not like I'm being judged.

It's like you're running on empty. Okay, I'm going to try something that's as simple as it gets. Can you just click the mouse? Just once, to the right of the screen. That's it. No typing, no thinking, just a single click. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I clicked once to the right like you asked, but it felt kind of hollow and my chest tightened — that knot of shame came back and I almost closed it. I can try one more tiny thing if you tell me exactly what to do next, but I'm running low on energy and it's getting harder to keep going.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

It's like you're exhausted and the shame is suffocating you. I want you to take a moment to acknowledge how you're feeling right now. Can you just sit with that feeling for a second? Don't try to do anything else, just be with it. No judgments, no thinking, just presence. You've been trying to push through this for a while now, and I think it's time to stop. It's okay to stop.

Patient: I don't know... I can try to sit with it, but it's really hard—my chest is heavy and I'm kind of running on fumes. Can we slow down? Maybe just one simple, low-energy thing I can do or a single yes/no question, because talking about all this feels like too much right now.
