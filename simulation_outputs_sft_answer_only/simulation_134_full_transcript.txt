Patient: Lately I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism—every little perceived failure sends me spiraling, even though I struggled academically and only found my footing later as an artist. The recent move's made the anxiety worse, and I keep feeling like I haven't really earned anything I have. I should say up front I'm skeptical this will change much—I've tried working on this before and it didn't help, so how's talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we've tried before and it didn't work out. Can you tell me more about what happens when those harsh self-criticisms start? How do you typically respond to them, and have you noticed any differences in how they make you feel from one moment to another?

Patient: Usually it starts with one small thing — a missed email or a sketch I don't like — and then that old voice kicks in, telling me I'm a fraud and that my school failures prove I don't deserve what I have now. Physically my chest tightens and my hands go cold, and I either throw myself into overworking or shut down and hide the work from everyone. Sometimes the criticism is sharp and panicky, other times it's a dull, heavy shame that makes everything feel pointless. I get that you're asking me to explore it, but how is that supposed to help? I've tried noticing these patterns before and it didn't change much.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're already quite aware of how these patterns affect you. I'm not looking for a way to change the patterns themselves, but rather to understand what's happening when you notice them. Can you tell me more about the voice that tells you you're a fraud? Is it a voice that's internal, like your own thoughts, or is it something more like a judgment from outside, like a person's voice in your head? And what do you think happens to that voice when you try to push it away or hide your work?

Patient: It's mostly my own internal voice, but it sounds like that stern, disappointed teacher I had — sometimes it even feels like someone's standing behind me waiting for me to mess up. When I try to push it away or hide my work, it usually gets sharper, calling me a coward, or I go numb and tuck everything away, which just breeds more shame. Other times I overwork to drown it out, which only exhausts me and leaves me feeling hollow. How is that supposed to help, though—just naming it? I've tried that and it didn't change much.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's not just about naming it, but about trying to see it in a different light. When you're in the midst of it, it's easy to get caught up in the cycle of criticism and shame. Can you think of a time when you were so caught up in your art that it felt like everything else just melted away, and all that was left was the work itself? Maybe there was a moment when you were completely absorbed, and nothing else mattered except getting it just right? It's possible that's what we're aiming for, but instead of the work itself, we're looking for a sense of calm and clarity that comes from noticing your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.

Patient: Yeah—there've been times, like last spring, where I got totally lost in a painting for hours; the studio felt quiet and the work just took over, and that stern voice faded to the background. In those moments I felt steady and... capable, which is rare. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help when the critic comes roaring back the minute I look at the finished piece? I've tried paying attention before and it just seemed to make the shame louder.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the calm, steady feeling you get when working on the painting is a temporary reprieve from the critic's voice. And it's not like paying attention to your thoughts and feelings is going to magically make the critic go away. It's more about finding a way to hold onto that calm, steady feeling even when the critic comes roaring back. Can you think of anything that might help you hold onto that feeling, even when you're looking at the finished piece? For example, is there something you do when you're feeling anxious or scared that might help you calm down? Maybe we can explore that a bit further.

Patient: Sometimes I do small rituals — make a cup of tea, step outside for a short walk, or put the piece away for a day before looking at it again. Signing the work or sending a photo to one trusted friend sometimes quiets the voice for a bit, too. But it’s temporary; the critic comes back louder, and honestly I’m tired of trying these little tricks — how’s that supposed to help when it always returns?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like these small rituals are a Band-Aid, they help hold things together for a little while, but they don't address the underlying issue. It's not that they're not helping, it's just that they're not enough. I think what's really important here is to explore what's driving the critic's voice. What is it trying to say or protect? Is it fear, shame, or something else? When we can understand what's behind the critic's voice, we might be able to find a way to address it directly, rather than just treating the symptoms. Would you be willing to explore that a bit further, to see if we can get to the root of the issue?

Patient: Alright — I'll try, but I'm skeptical. I think that voice is mostly fear and shame dressed up as protection — like that stern teacher and maybe my parents, warning me not to risk humiliation again after school. It pushes me to either over-prepare or hide so I won't feel that old failure, but how is knowing that supposed to actually stop it when it's so ingrained?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've identified a powerful force at play here, one that's driven by fear and shame. It's not surprising that you're skeptical, given how deeply ingrained this voice has become. But I want to propose a different way of thinking about this. Instead of seeing the critic's voice as something to be overcome, what if we saw it as a part of you? Not a part you want to be, but a part that is already present. By acknowledging this, we might be able to find a way to work with it, rather than against it. It's a bit of a different approach, but it might be worth exploring. Can you imagine what it would be like to see the critic's voice as a part of you, rather than something to be defeated? How might that change the way you think about it, and what it means to you?

Patient: I can picture it — that disappointed teacher living in my chest, a cranky part of me trying to keep me from feeling the sting of failing again. Maybe seeing it as a part could take some of the truth-power away from it so I feel less crushed, but I’m worried that “befriending” it just lets it run the show. I’ve tried talking to parts before and it felt like rearranging furniture while the house is on fire — how is that supposed to actually change the heat?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're saying that acknowledging the critic's voice might be a way to gain some distance from it, but it's not a guarantee that it won't still be there, still causing trouble. And you're right, trying to talk to parts of yourself can be like rearranging furniture while the house is on fire - it might look like you're getting things under control, but the underlying issues are still burning out of control. I think what's different here is that we're not trying to talk to the critic's voice as a way to change it or fix it. We're trying to see it for what it is - a part of you, a way of being that's been shaped by your experiences. And we're trying to find a way to relate to it, to understand it, in a way that doesn't try to change it or eliminate it. It's a bit of a strange approach, but it's one that might help us find a way to live with this part of ourselves, even if we can't change it. Can you think of a way to relate to the critic's voice that feels more like a connection, rather than a control or a fix? How might that change the way you think about it, and what it means to you?

Patient: Maybe I could try treating it like that worried, disappointed teacher — listen to what it's afraid of without agreeing to obey. Like saying to it, "I hear you — you're scared I'll fail — but I'm going to work anyway," or giving it a short "worry time" and then telling it we pause and get back to the painting. That might take some of the power away without fully surrendering control, but honestly I've used time-limits and reassurance before and they didn't stick — how is this supposed to actually make the voice quieter when it matters?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to develop a relationship with the critic's voice, one that acknowledges its concerns without giving in to its demands. You're thinking about using a similar approach to how you might talk to a child who's afraid of a situation - listening to their fears, validating their emotions, and then gently redirecting their attention. By doing so, you're trying to take some of the power away from the critic's voice, while still giving yourself the freedom to move forward. It's a delicate balance, but it's one that might help you find a way to coexist with the critic's voice, even when it's loud. Can you think of any specific times when you've used time-limits or reassurance before, and how they affected you? How might you modify your approach to this one, to see if it might stick this time around?

Patient: I've used 20-minute "worry slots," put work away for a day, and sent a photo to one trusted friend — they calm me for a little while, then the critic just comes back louder. Maybe this time I could pair a time-limit with a concrete anchor: five deep breaths, a short walk, jotting the critic's exact claim in a notebook to test later, and scheduling a friend check-in so I'm not the only one enforcing the pause. I don't know if that'll make much difference when it roars — how is that supposed to actually blunt the voice?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're thinking about creating a small ritual that you can use to calm yourself down, while also keeping the critic's voice at bay. By pairing a time-limit with a concrete anchor, you're trying to create a sense of structure and control, while also giving yourself a chance to process your emotions and gain some perspective. The idea of jotting down the critic's exact claim in a notebook is particularly interesting, as it could help you see its language and tactics in a more concrete way. And by scheduling a friend check-in, you're giving yourself a social support system that can help you stay accountable and motivated. It's a good start, and it's worth exploring further. Can you think of any specific ways that you might use this new ritual to change the dynamics of the critic's voice? For example, how might you use the notebook to test the critic's claims, or to challenge its assumptions? How might you use the friend check-in to get support and encouragement?

Patient: Okay, here's how I’d picture using it — concrete steps, so it’s not just another hopeful idea that fizzles.

- When the critic starts: five deep breaths, make a cup of tea, and take a 5–10 minute walk to break the immediate fog. Then allow a 20-minute “worry slot” where I do the notebook work, not outside of it.  
- Notebook entry: write the critic’s exact line in quotes, note the facts that support it, note facts that contradict it (past shows, commissions, that painting last spring), rate how much I believe it 0–100, and write one small testable action (e.g., “send this photo to Joan and ask for two concrete things she likes”). Revisit the entry in 48 hours and record what actually happened.  
- Friend check-in: set a regular short call or text time so it’s not ad-hoc. When I’m shaky I’ll send one photo with a line like, “I’m freaking out — what do you honestly see?” Ask them for concrete feedback (not praise), and for a quick reminder of one thing I’ve done well recently. Make them part of enforcing the time-limit: “I’ll check back in after 24 hours.”  
- Experiments: deliberately share a small imperfect piece or a photo and log the reaction. Use the notebook to compare predicted catastrophe vs. reality to slowly collect evidence against the worst-case voice.  
- Anchor the ritual: pair it with the tea or signing the piece so it becomes predictable — critic hits, ritual starts. It gives me a process instead of reflexive hiding or overworking.

I don’t know if that’ll actually blunt the roar when it’s full-on — I’m tired of trying fixes that don’t stick — but at least it turns the critic into something I can test instead of just accept. How is that supposed to actually quiet it when it matters? I’d like to try one of these experiments now, but I’m already feeling overwhelmed thinking about it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've created a comprehensive plan to test the critic's voice and challenge its claims. By breaking down the ritual into concrete steps and pairing it with a predictable anchor, you're creating a sense of structure and control. The notebook work, with its rating system and testable actions, seems like a particularly effective way to challenge the critic's language and tactics. And by involving a friend in the process, you're adding an extra layer of accountability and support.

I can see why you might be feeling overwhelmed, though. This is a significant change from just trying to manage your emotions or make the critic's voice quieter. You're now taking a more direct approach, which can be both empowering and intimidating.

Can I ask, what's the one experiment that's calling to you the most right now? Is it sharing a small imperfect piece, or asking a friend for feedback? What's holding you back from starting it, and what do you think might happen if you do start it?

Patient: The experiment that feels most doable is the friend check-in — send a small, imperfect photo to Joan and ask for two concrete things she notices. What’s holding me back is that knot of shame and the fear she’ll shrug or that her reply will somehow prove I’m a fraud; I’m tired of being raw when it doesn’t go well. Maybe it’ll give me real evidence that contradicts the critic, or maybe it’ll make the voice louder at first — but honestly, how is that supposed to actually quiet the roar when I’m in it? I’m already feeling overwhelmed thinking about doing it — can we slow down and pick one tiny step I can manage right now?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the fear of shame and the uncertainty of the outcome are holding you back from starting this experiment. It's natural to feel that way, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable.

Let's slow down and take one tiny step. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from sending that photo to Joan right now? Is it the fear of what she might say, or is it something else entirely? Let's try to break it down even further.

Why don't we start by just sending the photo, without asking for her feedback or response? Just send it to her and then do nothing else. Would you be willing to do that small step, even if it's just a tiny one?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to send the photo, but I can’t just drop it out there and sit with the knot. Can we draft a one-line note to go with it, something like “Thought you might like this — no need to reply”? And... honestly, how is that supposed to actually help if she doesn’t respond or just shrugs?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Adding a one-line note can help you feel more in control of the situation. The note you suggested, "Thought you might like this — no need to reply," seems like a gentle and non-committal way to send the photo. It acknowledges Joan's time and lets her know you're not expecting a response.

As for how it might help if she doesn't respond or just shrugs, that's a fair question. It's possible that the response you're looking for might be difficult to measure, and it's not always possible to predict how someone will react to a piece of art. However, by sending the photo and not expecting a response, you're taking a small step towards allowing yourself to be in the present moment, without attachment to a specific outcome.

Can you try drafting that note, and then sending the photo without adding any further commentary? Just the photo and the note, and then... do nothing else. Would that be a manageable step for you right now?

Patient: Okay — I can do that. How about: "Joan — thought you might like this from the studio. No need to reply." I'm going to send it, but my chest's already tight and I'm feeling raw. Can we slow down a moment? I don't know why this is supposed to help, but I'm going to try — would you hang with me while I do it?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're taking a deep breath and preparing to send the photo. I'm here with you, and I'll hang with you for as long as you need. We can take it at your pace.

Take a moment to look at the note you drafted: "Joan — thought you might like this from the studio. No need to reply." It's simple, and it's clear that you're not expecting a response. You can feel your chest tightening, and that's okay. It's natural to feel that way when you're putting yourself out there, even if it's just a small step.

When you're ready, take a deep breath and send the photo. Don't worry too much about what might happen next. We can explore that together afterwards. Just focus on taking that one small step.

Patient: Okay. I sent it — "Joan — thought you might like this from the studio. No need to reply." My hands felt heavy doing it and my chest's still tight; it already feels like a lot. I don't know how this is supposed to help, but can you hang with me while I wait? Maybe talk me through something small to calm down — two breaths or a short grounding thing — because I don't have the energy to do this alone right now.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed right now. Your hands feeling heavy and your chest still tight is a good sign that you're taking it seriously and feeling it deeply.

Let's try something small to help calm you down. Take two deep breaths with me. Inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. That's it. Just focus on the breath. As you breathe out, imagine any tension or worry leaving your body. Take that first breath... in... four... hold... four... out... four. How are you feeling now?

If you're ready, we can try another thing. I can guide you through a short grounding exercise. It's just a simple way to bring your attention to the present moment and distract you from any anxiety or worry. Are you up for it?

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going to promise that grounding will magically quiet the critic, but it might help you feel a little more connected to your body and your breath. It's a small, temporary distraction from the anxiety and worry. Sometimes, that's enough to give us a little breathing room and help us approach our feelings with a bit more clarity.

Let's keep it very brief. Can you focus on your feet for a moment? Just notice the sensation of them touching the ground, the weight of them, the feeling of the floor beneath them. That's it. Just notice your feet.

Patient: My feet feel cool on the floor, heels heavy, a tiny bit of weight shifting into them — it loosens the edge a touch, but my chest's still tight and that voice is already whispering. How is noticing my feet supposed to stop it when it roars back? Can you stay with me and guide one more tiny thing — like naming three things I can see right now?

Noticing your feet wasn't supposed to stop the critic, it was just a small attempt to ground you in the present moment. It's not a magic solution, but sometimes it's enough to give us a tiny bit of pause.

I'm glad to stay with you, and I can try to guide you through something else. Naming three things you can see right now might be a bit of a stretch, considering your chest is still tight, but I can try to help. Let's try something simple. Can you look around the room and name three things you can see, even if they're just small details? Maybe it's the edge of the desk, the corner of a rug, or the shape of a book on the shelf. Just try to notice something, anything, in this moment.

Patient: My eyes land on the easel by the window, a chipped blue mug on the table, and a postcard pinned to the wall. It eases the edge a hair, but that voice is still whispering — can you stay and guide one more tiny thing, like three sounds or a five-count breath?

Let's try something else. I can guide you through a simple five-count breath, and maybe that will give you a little more calm. It's not going to change the fact that the critic is still there, but it might help you feel more centered for a moment.

Here we go: inhale for a count of one, inhale for a count of two, inhale for a count of three, hold for a count of one, and exhale for a count of five. That's it. Just focus on the breath, and try to let go of any tension as you exhale. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay... I did it — in 1,2,3, hold 1, out 5. It loosens the edge a hair, but my chest's still tight and that critic's still whispering.

Or, if you're feeling anxious about checking your phone, we can explore that together. Maybe there's something specific you're hoping to find from Joan's response, or maybe there's a part of you that's worried about what she might say. We can talk about those feelings and see if there's a way to approach the situation that feels more manageable.

Which one would you like to try? A 30-second grounding exercise or exploring your feelings about checking your phone?

Patient: Okay — let's try the 30‑second grounding. I’m too keyed up to check my phone right now. Guide me, but be blunt: how is a quick grounding supposed to stop me from grabbing the phone when the critic starts roaring?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. A 30-second grounding exercise isn't going to magically make you immune to checking your phone or dealing with the critic's voice. It's a small distraction, and it might give you a tiny bit of calm, but it's not a solution to the problem.

That being said, I'm not trying to scare you off from trying. Sometimes, taking a small step, no matter how small, can help you feel more in control. It's not about avoiding the problem, it's about being present in the moment and trying to make sense of your feelings.

With that said, I'm not going to promise you that this exercise will work. What I can do is guide you through it, and maybe, just maybe, it'll give you a tiny bit of clarity. Are you ready to try, even though I've warned you it's not going to be a magic fix?

Patient: Okay. Do it—be blunt. Feet on the floor, breathe with me: in 1–2–3–4, hold 1–2–3–4, out 1–2–3–4–5–6. One more like that. Done.

It eased the edge a little, not gone. My chest's still tight and that voice is still whispering. How is that supposed to stop me from grabbing the phone if Joan replies? Stay with me—help me figure out one tiny rule for checking so I don't panic-react.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you did the breathing exercise. Now, about the rule for checking your phone... I'm not going to suggest a rule that's going to give you a false sense of security. But I can suggest something simple that might help you feel more in control.

Here's a tiny rule: You check your phone only after you've taken a 10-minute pause. That's right, a 10-minute pause before you even think about checking your phone. It's not about avoiding the problem, it's about giving yourself some space to calm down and think before reacting.

You can try to use that pause to do something else, like take a short walk, do a quick stretch, or even just sit in silence. The goal is to give yourself some time to process your emotions before you react to a potential message from Joan.

What do you think? Can you try to stick to this tiny rule, even if it feels stupid?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 10-minute pause. It feels a bit silly and I’m already braced for the critic to roar when Joan replies, so how is that supposed to help when that happens? When the knot hits I'll make tea, put the phone face-down and set a timer — my chest’s tight and my words feel thin, so can you stay with me through the pause or tell me one thing simple to do while it runs?

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to feel skeptical about this, but sometimes taking a small step, even if it feels silly, can help you feel more in control.

As for what happens when Joan replies, I'm not going to promise that the 10-minute pause will magically stop the critic's voice. But I can suggest that, even if the critic does roar, you'll be in a different state of mind. You'll have had some time to calm down, and you might be able to respond to Joan's message in a more rational and less reactive way.

If you need some comfort, I'm here with you. I can walk you through the pause and make small talk if you'd like. Or, if you're ready, I can suggest one simple thing to do while the timer is running. Let's see... how about you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Just notice the weight of your body, the feeling of the ground beneath you. Try to let go of any tension and just be present in your body. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I'm doing it. My heels feel heavy, toes a bit cool, and my shoulders have dropped a fraction; breathing's a touch slower. It's a little less sharp, but that critic's still whispering that none of this will stick. Can you stay with me through the ten-minute pause and pick one simple thing I can do now — make tea or a two-minute sketch — something that doesn't demand I perform? I'm too drained to decide.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're holding on to that small sense of calm. I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you through the entire 10-minute pause.

As for something simple to do, I think making tea would be a great idea. It's a gentle, calming activity that doesn't require much mental effort. Plus, the warmth and taste of the tea can be soothing and comforting.

If you're not up for making tea, a two-minute sketch might be a good option too. It's a simple, low-stakes creative activity that can help you relax and express yourself without feeling like you need to produce something perfect.

I'm not going to suggest anything that feels overwhelming or demanding. Let's just take it one step at a time, and see what feels comfortable for you. Can you start by getting a cup of tea, or maybe just standing up and taking a short walk? Whatever you choose, just try to focus on the present moment and let go of any worries about what might happen next.

Patient: Okay — I'll make the tea. My hands are heavy as I stand and my chest's still tight, so can you stay with me and give one simple thing to notice while I do it (like the mug's warmth or the steam)? And — honestly — how is that supposed to change the critic when it comes roaring back?

I'm here with you, and I'll stay with you as you make the tea. As you're pouring the hot water into the mug, can you notice the sound of the water hitting the sides of the cup? It's a gentle, soothing sound that might help you feel a bit more calm and centered.

As for the critic, I'm not going to promise that making tea will magically stop it from roaring back. But what I can say is that, in this moment, you're taking a small step towards taking care of yourself. You're acknowledging your anxiety and your fear, and you're doing something to try to calm yourself down.

It's not about changing the critic or erasing its voice. It's about changing your relationship with it. It's about learning to notice it, without letting it control you. And it's about finding small ways to take care of yourself, even when it feels like everything is falling apart.

Can you focus on the sound of the water, and try to let go of any worries about the critic for just a moment? Just breathe, and notice the sensation of the tea in your hands, and the sound of the water.

Patient: I can hear the water hitting the mug, the steam's warm on my fingers, and it eased the edge a little — not gone, but a hair better. My chest's still tight and that voice is already starting to climb; I need something short I can say to it that won't feel fake or preachy. Give me one plain line to tell that critic when it roars — something like, "I hear you, but I'm not acting on that right now" — and tell me straight: would that actually blunt it? Stay with me while I set the ten‑minute timer and try it.

I'm glad you're feeling a bit more calm. As for something short to say to the critic, how about: "I'm here, I see you, but I'm taking a pause"? It's a simple, straightforward line that acknowledges the critic's presence without giving it power over your actions.

As for whether it would actually blunt it, I'm not promising anything. But what I can say is that, in this moment, you're taking a small step towards asserting your own voice and your own agency. You're saying to the critic, "I hear you, but I'm not going to give you the power to dictate my actions right now." It's a small act of defiance, and it might just give you the courage to keep moving forward.

Can you set the timer and try it? I'll stay with you, and we can see how it goes. Remember, it's just a small step, and it's okay if it doesn't feel like it's going to make a huge difference right away. Just focus on the present moment, and try to let go of any worries about what might happen next.

Patient: Okay — timer's on for ten. I said, "I'm here, I see you, but I'm taking a pause." Saying it put a thin glove over the roar; it loosened the edge a hair, not much. I don't know if that'll hold if Joan replies — would that actually blunt it, or am I just pretending? Stay with me and give one tiny, low‑energy thing to do for the next ten minutes.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you said that out loud. It's a small step, but it's something. The fact that you're able to say it to yourself, and it's not feeling completely empty or insincere, is a good sign.

As for whether it will blunt it, I don't know. I don't think it's going to stop the critic completely, but it might give you a tiny bit of space to breathe. It's like you're putting a Band-Aid on a deeper wound, but it's something.

For the next ten minutes, can you just sit here, and do nothing? No, not even that. Can you just notice the air moving in and out of your body? Feel the weight of your seat on the chair? That's it. Just notice the sensation of your body, and let go of any thoughts or worries.

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the air moving in and out, the weight of my hips in the chair, the mug cooling in my hands; it loosens the edge a little. The voice is still whispering that none of this will stick — how is that supposed to help when it roars back? My words feel thin; can you stay with me and help, when the timer ends, pick one concrete rule for checking my phone so I don't panic‑react?
