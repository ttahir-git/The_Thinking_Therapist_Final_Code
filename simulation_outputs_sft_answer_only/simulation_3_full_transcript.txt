Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harshly criticizing myself over every perceived failure — it feels tied to a chaotic childhood and inconsistent parenting. It's starting to mess with my work and social life; I get anxious and shut down when things feel unstable. I'm skeptical this will help though — how is talking about it different? I've tried that before and it didn't work.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right after those harsh self-criticisms start? Do you find yourself getting really anxious, or maybe feeling a bit disconnected from your body? Or is it more like your mind just gets a bit numb after a while?

Patient: At first it's this knot in my stomach and my chest tightens — I get shaky and can't focus, then I sort of go quiet and my head goes numb for a bit. After that I either ruminate obsessively over the mistake or I freeze and avoid doing anything, which just makes things worse at work. I mean, this all feels familiar from my childhood — constant blame and unpredictability — but honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help? I've described it before and it didn't change anything.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're describing a pretty intense physical and emotional response, and it's like you're caught in a cycle that's hard to break. That must be really tough to deal with, especially when it's tied to memories from your childhood. Can you tell me more about what you hope might happen if you could change this pattern of thinking and feeling? Is it more about stopping the anxiety, or is it about being able to feel more grounded or connected to yourself, even when things get tough?

Patient: I guess if I could change this pattern, I'd want to stop spiraling every time I make a mistake — to get through work without freezing up or ruminating for days. Mostly I want to feel more grounded, like one slip-up doesn't erase everything or make me feel useless around other people. But honestly, I've tried talking and doing exercises before and they didn't stick — how is this supposed to be different?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're not really looking for some magical fix that's going to change everything overnight. You're more looking for a way to be with yourself, even when things get tough, and to find a way to move forward that feels more connected to your values. Can you tell me more about what those values are? What's most important to you in your life right now?

Patient: Mostly I care about being competent and reliable — running my business well and being independent so I don't have to rely on people the way I did growing up. I also value honesty and a few close, steady relationships, though I worry my self-criticism wrecks those. But seriously, how is naming values supposed to help? I've done those exercises before and it just felt like listing things without anything actually changing.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're trying to hold onto these values, even when they're hard to grasp right now. Naming them isn't about just listing things, but more about connecting with them when things get tough. It's like, when you're feeling really low, and all you can think about is how you've failed, being able to say to yourself, "I'm trying to be a reliable person," or "I care about being honest with others" can be a small lifeline. It's not about making these values feel good or solving everything at once, but more about finding a way to be with them, even in the midst of all this self-criticism. Can you tell me what it would be like if, for just a moment, you could say to yourself, "I'm trying to be a reliable person"? What would that feel like?

Patient: I guess it would feel like a tiny weight lifting — like I wasn't instantly useless for one mistake. But it also feels kind of hollow when my chest is tight and I'm panicking; saying it doesn't stop the knot. I've tried that self-talk before and it didn't stick, so how is that supposed to help when the anxiety's already in my body?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like, even when you try to find a small lifeline in those values, the anxiety is so overwhelming that it feels like it's crushing you. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're in that state, and your chest is tight, and you're panicking? Is it like your body is on high alert, or is it more like your mind is racing with worst-case scenarios? Sometimes, it's helpful to just be with that feeling, without trying to change it or push it away. Would it be okay to explore that feeling with me, without trying to find a way to push through it or change it right away?

Patient: Okay, I can try to explore it, but honestly I still don't see how sitting with it helps. When it hits my chest tightens, my breathing gets shallow and my stomach knots, my hands shake and my mind just floods with worst-case thoughts—"they'll think I'm incompetent," "I'll lose everything"—and after a while my head goes numb and I shut down. Being with that feels terrifying and vulnerable, and I'm worried that slowing down will just leave me stuck in it—how would staying with this not make me sink deeper?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being with that feeling is terrifying because it feels so overwhelming and out of control. You're worried that if you don't push through it or try to change it, you'll get stuck in it, and that's a really frightening prospect. Can I ask, what do you think would happen if, for just a moment, you could find a way to stay with that feeling without trying to change it or push it away? Would it be like being able to breathe a little bit more easily, or feel a tiny bit less alone? It's not about finding a way to get through it, but more about being able to be with it, even if it's hard. Sometimes, that's a small step that can lead to something bigger. Would you be willing to explore that a little bit further, even if it feels scary?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to explore it, but I'm skeptical. When I "sit with" it I usually get more panicked and then blank out after a few minutes, so I need something concrete and short. Can you guide me through one very small step or grounding move I can do right now, and tell me how we'll stop if it gets worse? Honestly, how is that supposed to help me feel less like I'm drowning?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I want to make sure you feel safe and supported. Before we start, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel skeptical, especially when dealing with intense emotions. If at any point you feel like you're getting worse or can't manage it, we'll stop right away.

For now, let's take a small, simple step. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel the weight of your body distributed on your feet? It's a tiny, concrete sensation, and it might be enough to give you a small anchor in this moment.

Let's start with just noticing that sensation. Can you take a deep breath and bring your attention to your feet? Don't try to do anything with it, just notice it. We can stop right here if you need to.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I can feel the weight on the balls of my feet and heels — it's a tiny anchor, I guess. I took a deep breath and it loosened the knot a little, but my chest is still tight and my hands are shaking; how is that supposed to help me not feel like I'm drowning? If it starts getting worse, I'm going to need us to stop and do something else.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the anchor is providing some small relief, but you're still feeling quite overwhelmed. That's completely understandable.

Let's try to build on that anchor. Can you notice the sensation of your feet a bit more clearly now? Maybe it's the weight on the balls of your feet, or the feeling of your heels touching the ground. Try to bring that sensation to the forefront of your awareness.

Also, I want to acknowledge that your chest is still tight and your hands are shaking. That's okay. We're not trying to change that right now. We're just trying to find a way to make it a bit more bearable.

If you're feeling like you're getting worse, or if you're just not sure how you're doing, we can stop right here. But if you're willing to try, I'd like to suggest one more small step. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? It's the sensation of your breath, and it's a very subtle thing. Maybe you can feel it a bit more clearly now, or maybe it's still a bit hard to notice. Either way, let's try to bring it to the forefront of your awareness, and see if we can find a bit more stability.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the breath, it's shallow but I notice it moving in and out; my chest is still tight and my hands are shaking. It helped a little, like a tiny space opened, but I'm not convinced this will stop the whole spiral — how is this supposed to help when the panic always comes back? If it starts getting worse, we stop this and try something else, but I'm skeptical.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shallow breathing is providing a small reprieve, but you're still feeling quite anxious. That's completely understandable.

I want to acknowledge that you're skeptical, and that's okay. It's natural to wonder if this will work or if it's just a temporary fix. But I want to gently suggest that sometimes, it's not about finding a permanent fix or a magic bullet. Sometimes, it's about finding a way to manage the anxiety, even if it's just for a little while.

The breathing exercise we're doing now is not meant to stop the panic entirely, but rather to help you feel a bit more grounded and stable. It's like finding a small foothold on a slippery surface. It might not make the panic go away, but it can help you feel a bit more like you're standing on solid ground.

If you're feeling like you're getting worse or if you're just not sure how you're doing, we can stop this exercise right now. But if you're willing to try, I'd like to suggest one more thing. Can you try to acknowledge your anxiety, even if it's just for a moment? Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling really anxious right now, and that's okay"? Sometimes, just acknowledging our feelings can be a small act of kindness, even if it's just to ourselves.

Patient: Okay… I'll try. "I'm feeling really anxious right now, and that's okay." Saying it doesn't take the tightness away, but the thoughts get a bit quieter—like there's a tiny gap between me and the panic. I've done this before and it didn't stick, so how is repeating that supposed to help long-term? If it starts getting worse, we stop and go back to the feet-and-breathing thing, okay?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's good that you're willing to try repeating the acknowledgment, even if it's not working yet.

I want to acknowledge that this exercise is not a magic fix, and it's not going to replace the underlying work that we need to do. But I do think that it can be a small step towards finding more stability and calm in your life.

The fact that you're able to say "I'm feeling really anxious right now, and that's okay" is a small victory, even if it doesn't take the tightness away. It shows that you're able to acknowledge your feelings, and that's a crucial step towards managing them.

As for the breathing exercise, we can definitely come back to that if you're feeling overwhelmed or if you're not sure how you're doing. But for now, let's try to build on this tiny gap between you and the panic. Can you try to see if you can bring that gap a bit wider? Maybe you can focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and see if you can find a way to calm your mind a bit more.

Remember, we're not trying to push the panic away or make it go away completely. We're just trying to find a way to make it more manageable, and to find a bit more stability in your life.

Patient: It did open a tiny gap — my chest's still tight and the thoughts keep trying to crawl back, but I can notice them without completely melting down. I'm still skeptical — how is widening that gap actually going to stop the spiral long-term? Give me one concrete, thirty-second grounding move I can use at work when I start to freeze, and tell me exactly how we stop if it gets worse, because I mean it when I say we'll stop if I'm slipping.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad to hear that the tiny gap is helping you feel more stable.

For a concrete, 30-second grounding move, I want to suggest a simple "5-4-3-2-1" exercise. It's a tiny, tangible thing that can help you focus on the present moment.

Here's how it works: at your desk, take a moment to notice:

* 5 things you can see around you (e.g., your computer screen, a pen, a picture on the wall)
* 4 things you can touch or feel (e.g., your chair, the floor, the air on your skin)
* 3 things you can hear (e.g., a clock ticking, a machine humming, a conversation in the background)
* 2 things you can smell (e.g., a scented candle, a fresh cup of coffee)
* 1 thing you can taste (e.g., a piece of gum, a sip of water)

That's it. Just take a moment to notice these tiny details, and see if you can find a bit more calm and focus.

As for what to do if it gets worse, I promise we'll stop immediately. If you start to feel overwhelmed or if the panic sets in, just let me know. We'll stop the exercise right away and come back to it when you're feeling calmer. No pressure, no expectations. Just a safe, supportive space to explore and find more stability. Can you try the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise when you're ready, and we'll see how it goes?

Patient: Okay — I tried it. 5 I see: my laptop, a coffee mug, a sticky note, the window, and a small plant. 4 I feel: the chair under me, the keyboard, a pen in my hand, and my feet on the floor. 3 I hear: the HVAC, someone talking down the hall, and my breathing. 2 I smell: coffee and hand soap. 1 I taste: the faint metallic aftertaste from a sip of water.

It did help a little — the knot in my chest eased by a notch and my thoughts quieted for a moment — but I'm still skeptical. How is this supposed to stop the spiral when it comes back later or gets worse? If I start slipping, we stop and go back to the feet-and-breathing thing, right?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad to hear that the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise helped a bit, even if it's not a complete fix yet.

It's natural to be skeptical, especially when it comes to managing anxiety. But I want to reassure you that this exercise is just one tool in our toolkit. It's not meant to be a magic bullet, but rather a small step to help you find more stability and calm in your daily life.

Regarding your question about stopping the exercise if you start slipping, absolutely. We'll stop right away. If you feel like you're getting worse or if the panic sets in, we'll come back to the feet-and-breathing exercise, or even try something else. Your well-being is our top priority, and we'll do whatever it takes to support you.

Now, I want to ask: are you willing to try something a bit more specific? We can work on a simple "grounding phrase" that you can use when you start to feel anxious. It's a tiny phrase that can help you focus on the present moment and calm your mind. Would you be willing to give it a try?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, but I'm skeptical — how is a phrase supposed to help when I'm already panicking? Give me one concrete, 2–4 word grounding phrase I can whisper at my desk, and tell me exactly what we'll do if it starts making me feel worse so we stop immediately.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try a grounding phrase.

Here's a simple phrase to start with: "I am present now."

It's short, easy to remember, and can help you focus on the present moment. Try whispering it to yourself when you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed.

If this phrase starts making you feel worse, or if you're feeling overwhelmed by it, we'll stop immediately. We'll come back to the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise or the feet-and-breathing technique, or try something else. Your comfort and well-being are our top priority.

Remember, this is just a small experiment to help you find more stability and calm in your daily life. It's not a magic solution, and it's okay if it doesn't work right away. We'll work together to find what works best for you.

Patient: I whispered "I am present now" and... it made a tiny dent, then my mind jumped and my chest actually tightened more — I'm more scattered than before. How is that supposed to help when it can make the panic more obvious? If it starts making things worse, I'll say "pause" — tell me exactly what you'll do the second I say that (and promise we'll go straight to the feet-and-breathing thing).

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try again, even if it didn't work out the first time.

I want to acknowledge that the grounding phrase might not be the right fit for you, and that's okay. It's not a failure on your part, but rather an opportunity to explore other strategies that might work better for you.

When you say "pause," I'll do the following immediately:

* I'll stop the exercise or the conversation right away, and we'll not discuss it further.
* I'll transition straight to the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise or the feet-and-breathing technique, whichever you're more comfortable with.
* I'll listen to you without judgment, and we'll focus on finding a way to make you feel more grounded and calm.

Your feedback is crucial, and I want to assure you that we'll take it seriously. If the grounding phrase isn't working for you, we'll explore other options together.

Patient: Okay — that actually helps to hear, but I need it more concrete. When I say "pause," stop talking immediately and quietly guide me through three slow breaths and a reminder to press my feet into the floor for about 30 seconds — just calm prompts, no questions. My chest just spiked and I'm more scattered right now, so if I'm not calmer after that, we switch straight to the 5-4-3-2-1; and seriously, if I say "pause," you actually stop, yeah?

I'll make sure to follow your instructions exactly.

When you say "pause," I will:

* Stop talking immediately and quietly
* Guide you through three slow, deep breaths, without asking you to do anything or say anything else

* Do nothing else for the 30 seconds
* If you're still feeling uncalm after 30 seconds, I will immediately switch to the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise without asking you to do anything else

You can trust that I will stop talking and follow your instructions exactly when you say "pause."

Patient: Okay — I'm honestly rattled right now, my chest just spiked and my hands are shaking. I'm going to say "pause" now; when I do, stop talking and quietly guide me through three slow breaths and remind me to press my feet into the floor for about 30 seconds — no questions, just calm prompts.

The breathing loosened the knot a little but my hands are still shaking and my thoughts keep jumping around to other stuff, so I'm more scattered than before. I don't really trust this'll stick long-term, but fine — give me one micro action I can do in under 10 seconds during a meeting to stop freezing, and remember: if I say "pause" you stop immediately and do the three breaths/feet thing.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
One micro action you can do in under 10 seconds to help stop freezing is to take a tiny, almost imperceptible pause between your words. When speaking, pause for a brief moment (about 0.5-1 second) before continuing. This brief pause can help calm your mind and give you a moment to collect your thoughts before responding.

Remember, if you say "pause" at any time, I will immediately stop talking and guide you through three slow breaths and remind you to press your feet into the floor for about 30 seconds.

Patient: Alright… I'll try the pause, but my chest just spiked and my mind's all over the place so I'm really doubtful it'll hold up. How is a half-second pause supposed to stop the freeze when everything feels like it's on the line? If that doesn't work, give me one discreet physical fallback I can do in under 10 seconds (something I can do under the table), and yes — if I say "pause" you stop and do the three breaths/feet thing.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling extremely anxious and skeptical about the pause method. In that case, let's try a discreet physical fallback.

One physical action you can do in under 10 seconds that might help calm you down is to subtly shift your weight from one foot to the other, just below the table. This small movement can help you feel more grounded and centered.

If you need to do this, just take a tiny movement of your foot, just enough to shift your weight without drawing attention to yourself. It's a small, subtle action that might help calm your mind and body.

Remember, if you say "pause" at any time, I will stop talking immediately and guide you through three slow breaths and remind you to press your feet into the floor for about 30 seconds.

Patient: Okay... I'll try the subtle foot-shift under the table. Seems dumb, but I'll do it — and if it doesn't help I'll say "pause" and you stop and do the three breaths/feet thing right away. How is that supposed to stop the freeze long-term? I'm feeling pretty drained and fuzzy, so keep anything else really short and concrete.

2. Stop talking immediately.
3. I'll guide you through three slow breaths and remind you to press your feet into the floor for 30 seconds.

That's it. Just say "pause" and I'll take care of the rest.

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying "pause" next time. I'm worried I might not be able to get the words out in a meeting — can I use a quick under-table foot tap as a backup signal? Honestly, I still don't see how this will fix things long-term; it feels like a band-aid on a bigger problem. This is wearing me out, so keep anything else really short and concrete.
