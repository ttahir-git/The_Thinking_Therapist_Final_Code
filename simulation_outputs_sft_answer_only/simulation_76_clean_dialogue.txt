Patient: I'm an older business owner, and lately I've been avoiding gatherings because social situations feel unbearable — my mind keeps insisting something awful will happen. I picture myself saying one wrong thing, everyone finding out about my health scare, the gossip ruining my business, and it just spirals into catastrophe; it's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I usually handle things on my own, but this certainty is exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like the anxiety you're experiencing is really weighing on you, especially when it comes to social situations. Can you tell me more about how this anxiety affects your daily life and business? For instance, do you find yourself canceling plans or avoiding meetings because of these worries, or are you trying to find ways to cope with the uncertainty?

Patient: I end up canceling lunches and small meetups, and I avoid networking events or even casual visits from long-time friends because I’m terrified one slip-up will start a chain reaction. In my head it’s always: I say something odd, someone mentions the health scare, word spreads, a key client pulls out, staff panic, payroll dries up and the whole business collapses — it's like I can see the whole downfall play out. I've tried to cope on my own with quieting techniques, but people say it might not be that bad and I keep thinking that's wishful thinking, not realistic.

Therapist: It's like you're caught in this cycle of catastrophic thinking, where every possible scenario leads to a devastating outcome. It's not just about saying one wrong thing, but the entire social interaction unfolding into a perfect storm of disaster. It's understandable that you'd be hesitant to engage in social situations, especially when it feels like your carefully constructed world could be upended.

It's also interesting that you mention people's reassurances not being enough. It's almost like you're aware that they might be trying to protect you, but you're still not convinced. Can you think of a time when you might have pushed through your anxiety and still had a relatively positive experience? What was that like for you, and how did it make you feel?

Patient: I did once go to a long-time friend's dinner and for a little while it felt normal—I laughed, had a bite, and didn't spiral. But even then my mind kept replaying the worst: someone notices a weird pause, mentions the health scare, it leaks to clients, and everything falls apart—so that brief relief felt like a lull before an inevitable crash. I guess those moments just don't convince me; they feel like false reprieves, not real evidence things will be okay.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to convince yourself that these brief moments of normalcy are proof that things can go back to being okay, but your mind keeps turning those moments into evidence that the opposite is true. It's a really tough cycle to break, especially when it feels like your brain is trying to protect you from a perceived disaster.

Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this catastrophic thinking? Is it a specific event or experience that triggered this way of thinking, or has it always been there? Sometimes, by exploring the root of it, we can start to find ways to challenge it and change the way you think about these situations.

Patient: I think it really kicked off with the health scare — suddenly I felt exposed, like if anyone found out they'd see me as weak and that alone would set everything off. I've always been a bit of a worrier, but that episode turned it into this certainty that one slip will start a chain reaction and everything will collapse. I know that might sound like overreacting, but I can't shake the feeling that it's exactly what's going to happen.

Therapist: It's like your health scare became this tipping point, where your usual worries escalated into this all-consuming certainty that one mistake will have disastrous consequences. It's understandable that you'd feel vulnerable after a health scare, but it's clear that this has taken a toll on your daily life and social interactions.

It's also interesting that you mention feeling like others might see you as weak if they found out about the health scare. That kind of fear can be really paralyzing, making it hard to connect with others or feel like yourself. Have you found any ways to cope with this fear, or is it something you're still trying to figure out?

Also, can you tell me more about what it means to you to "collapse" in this context? What are some of the specific things that would happen in your mind if everything were to go wrong? Maybe exploring those thoughts a bit more could help us find a way to address them.

Patient: I try short-term coping—deep breathing, keeping busy, or just skipping things—but it only quiets the fear for a little while. When I picture a collapse it's very specific: someone notices a pause, they bring up the health scare, clients whisper, a major account pulls out, staff panic, payroll dries up, creditors come calling, and I lose the building and everything I've built. Then I see my name in the papers and old friends avoiding me—it's not a maybe in my head, it's inevitable. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find ways to manage the anxiety, but those coping mechanisms only provide temporary relief. It's like the fear is always there, lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce.

I want to try to help you see this differently. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to "lose the building and everything I've built"? What is it about that scenario that feels so catastrophic? Is it the loss of your business, your reputation, or something else entirely?

Also, I want to try to change the way we talk about this. Instead of saying "collapse," let's try to say "the worst-case scenario." How does that feel? Does it make the fear feel more manageable? Sometimes, by giving it a different label, we can start to see it in a new light.

And one more thing. Can you think of a time when you felt truly safe, when everything seemed to be going right? What were you doing then? Was it something you did, or was it something that happened around you? Maybe we can find a way to connect those feelings of safety to the fear you're experiencing now.

Patient: Losing the building isn't just money—it's the proof that I mattered, my reputation, everything I've worked for, and in my head that loss means everyone I cared about turns away. Calling it the "worst-case scenario" feels like a label that understates it; my mind treats it as a chain of events that's going to happen, not just a possibility. I did feel safe once at that friend's dinner, but even then I kept imagining the leak and the fallout, so it felt like a lull before the inevitable. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like the loss of your business is not just about financial security, but about the sense of self-worth and validation that comes with it. The fear of losing everything you've worked for is a deeply personal and emotional one.

I can see how labeling it as a "worst-case scenario" might be understating the extent of your anxiety. It's clear that this is a deeply ingrained and pervasive fear that's affecting your daily life.

It's interesting that you mention feeling safe at that friend's dinner, but even then your mind was racing with worst-case scenarios. This suggests that your brain is always on high alert, trying to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.

Can I try to ask a different question? Instead of trying to connect this to your problem, can we explore what it would be like to let go of this fear, even if just for a moment? What would it be like to feel a sense of calm and safety, without the weight of this fear holding you back? Sometimes, by exploring the opposite of what we're feeling, we can start to find a way to move towards it.

Patient: I can't even imagine letting go without my head already scripting the disaster—if I relax and laugh at a gathering, someone will notice a slip, mention the health scare, clients will whisper, an account will pull out and everything spirals. Thinking about calm feels like pretending; I'm trying to picture safety but my mind keeps writing the ending where I lose the building and everyone turns away. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down? I really don't see any other outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and trapped by your own thoughts. It's like your mind is creating a narrative that's impossible to escape, and it's taking a toll on your emotional state.

Can I try to help you slow down a bit? Instead of trying to imagine a specific outcome, can we focus on just one small moment? Let's take a deep breath together and try to focus on the present. Can you tell me what's happening in your body right now, just in this moment? What sensations are you feeling?

And then, if you're ready, we can try to take one small step forward. Can you think of a single thing you'd like to do, just right now, that would help you feel a little bit better? It might be something small, like taking a few more deep breaths or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. Whatever it is, can we try to focus on that one thing, just for a moment?

Patient: My chest's tight, breathing's shallow, my stomach's in knots and my shoulders feel locked — my hands are a bit shaky too. I can try one small thing: three slow, deep breaths and really feel my feet on the floor, but I'm telling you now I don't expect it to change the movie in my head — as soon as I relax it already scripts someone noticing the health scare and everything falling apart.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of physical tension right now, and your mind is still stuck in this cycle of fear and anxiety. It's like your body is reacting to the emotional distress, and it's hard to separate the two.

Let's focus on those three slow, deep breaths, then. Can you try to bring your attention to your breath, and really focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Try to let go of any thoughts about the outcome, and just be present with your breath. It might feel weird at first, but can you try to stay with it, even if it's just for a few seconds?

And when you're ready, we can try to bring your attention back to your feet on the floor. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, and the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet? Try to let go of any tension in your shoulders, and see if you can relax a bit.

Remember, it's not about changing the movie in your head right now. It's just about being present with your breath and your body. We can try to work with that in a minute, if you're ready.

Patient: I did the three breaths—my chest eased a little and my shoulders loosened, so that helped in the moment, but my head immediately started narrating the rest: someone notices a weird pause, mentions the health scare, clients whisper, a big account pulls out and then everything collapses. I don't know how to make that story stop; I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the three breaths were a small success in the moment, but your mind immediately jumped back into its narrative mode. It's like your brain is trying to prepare for the worst-case scenario, even when you're trying to take a break.

Let's slow down, like you said. Can we try to take a step back even further? Instead of focusing on the story your mind is telling, can we try to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Just feel the air entering and leaving your nostrils, and the rise and fall of your chest. Try to stay with that sensation, without getting caught up in the story.

We can also try to explore what might be driving that narrative in your mind. Is there something specific that's triggering that worst-case scenario, or is it a general pattern that's been developing over time? Sometimes, by exploring the root of our thoughts, we can start to find ways to interrupt that narrative.

But for now, let's just focus on the sensation of your breath. Can you stay with it, even if it's just for a few more seconds?

Patient: The breaths helped my chest loosen, but my mind immediately rewound the whole chain — someone notices the pause, mentions the health scare, clients whisper, a big account pulls out and everything tanks. It really kicked off after the health scare and now it's just my default; when people suggest other outcomes I think they're being optimistic, not realistic. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe just sit with the breath a bit more?

Therapist: It sounds like the breaths did help with the physical tension, but your mind immediately went back to its default mode. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from a perceived threat, even when you're trying to relax.

Let's slow down and focus on the breath even more. Can you try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without any thoughts or distractions? Just the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, and the feeling of your body supporting your breath.

I want to try something else, too. Can you think of a time when you felt really safe and secure? It could be a memory from your childhood, a vacation, or even a moment from your daily routine. Try to hold onto that feeling of safety and security, and see if you can bring it into this moment.

We're not trying to change anything or fix anything right now. We're just trying to sit with the breath and find a sense of calm and security. Can you try to stay with the breath, and see if you can connect with that feeling of safety?

Patient: I tried to bring up that safe dinner, but even that memory my mind rewrites into the same script — someone notices, the health scare gets mentioned, clients pull out, and I lose everything. The breaths loosened my chest a bit, but the story's still playing on loop and it's wearing me down; my hands are still trembling when I think about the payroll. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we just keep sitting with the breath a little longer? I don't really believe imagining safety changes anything, but maybe the breathing can buy me time.

Therapist: It sounds like even the memory of the safe dinner got reworked into the same narrative. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the perceived threat, even when you're trying to focus on a positive memory.

Let's keep sitting with the breath, then. Can you try to stay with the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without any thoughts or distractions? Just the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, and the feeling of your body supporting your breath.

I want to try something else, too. Can you bring your attention to your physical body, and notice where the trembling is happening? Is it in your hands, your arms, or somewhere else? Try to notice the sensation of your body responding to the trembling, and see if you can bring some awareness to that area. Maybe, just maybe, we can start to calm that physical response, even if the story isn't changing.

We're not trying to change anything right now. We're just trying to find a sense of calm and security, one breath at a time. Can you try to stay with the breath, and see if we can find some small sense of calm in this moment?

Patient: Mostly in my hands and forearms, and my heart's a bit jumpy too — the tremble settles into my fingers when I think about the payroll. The breathing eases my chest some, but as soon as I let up my head strings the whole screenplay together: someone notices the pause, the health scare gets mentioned, clients whisper, an account bolts and everything collapses — that's the truth, not a maybe. I don't believe the safety memories; they feel like pauses before the fall. Can we just keep sitting with the breath a little longer? I'm getting worn out.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical symptoms are intensifying, with the trembling in your hands and forearms, and the jumpy heart. The screenplay is still playing out, and you're feeling like it's the only reality.

I want to try something different. Instead of focusing on the breath, can we try to notice the sensations in your body without trying to change them? Can you just observe the trembling in your hands and forearms, the jumpy heart, and the sense of unease without trying to calm them down or change them? Sometimes, by just noticing our physical sensations, we can start to feel a sense of connection to our body, even if we're not trying to change anything.

We're not trying to escape or avoid the feelings right now. We're just trying to find a sense of curiosity and connection to what's happening in our body. Can you try to approach this with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to fix or change it?

We're not going to rush through this, and we're not going to try to push through it. We're just going to sit with it, slowly, and see what happens. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to notice without changing it — my hands are buzzing, fingers trembling, my heart's fluttering and my chest is tight again. I can look at the tremble, feel the weight in my forearms, notice the air in my nostrils, but my head immediately starts the movie: someone pauses, mentions the health scare, clients whisper, an account bolts, and everything's gone — like it's already written. I don't know how to stay curious without the screenplay taking over; can we just keep sitting with the breath a bit more and maybe you can help me stay here?

Therapist: It's like your brain is still trying to take control, and it's hard to stay curious when the screenplay is already playing out.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the breath, can we try to look at the pause between the screenplay and the curiosity? Can you see the space between your mind's automatic response and your desire to stay curious? It's like there's a small gap there, and we can try to fill it with a sense of curiosity and exploration.

Imagine you're a detective trying to solve a mystery. You have to look at the clues, piece them together, and try to figure out what's really going on. That's what we're doing right now. We're looking at the clues, trying to understand what's happening, and seeing if we can find a way to stay curious without the screenplay taking over.

I'm here with you, and I'm going to stay with you. We'll keep sitting with the breath, and we'll try to find a way to stay curious. Can you try to let go of the screenplay for just one moment, and see what happens?

Patient: I try, I really try — but the second I let go my head stitches the whole thing back together and says it's already happened. For a beat I felt lighter, then I pictured the whisper, the account walking, payroll drying up, and I can't convince myself any other outcome is real. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and just sit with the breath a little longer?

Therapist: It's like your brain is stuck in a loop, and no matter how hard you try, you can't shake the feeling that the worst-case scenario has already happened.

Let's take a step back. Can we start with just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Not the thoughts, not the feelings, just the physical sensation of the breath. It's like noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin.

I want to try something. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, and then, just for a moment, bring it to the sensation of your feet touching the ground? It's like grounding yourself in the present moment, and it can help you feel more connected to your body and less connected to the thoughts that are overwhelming you.

We're not trying to change anything or fix anything. We're just trying to find a way to be present with yourself, right now, in this moment. Can you try that with me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is feeling my feet or watching my breath supposed to stop the rest of the movie from happening? I can try to ground myself, but my mind already plays the next scene: someone notices the pause, the health scare gets mentioned, clients whisper, an account bolts, payroll dries up and I lose the building. It feels irrelevant to the real problem—how does noticing my toes help with creditors or reputations? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and just keep sitting with the breath a little longer while you explain what that actually does for the collapse I'm seeing?

Therapist: It's like you're feeling a bit frustrated that we're trying to do something that doesn't seem to be working, and that's understandable.

The idea of grounding yourself with the breath and your feet isn't meant to stop the movie from playing out entirely, but rather to help you feel more connected to your body and less disconnected from your thoughts. It's a bit like taking a step back from the chaos of the movie and looking at the scene from a different perspective.

Think of it like this: when you're watching a movie, you can sometimes feel like you're just along for the ride, without any control over what happens. But if you were to take a piece of popcorn and hold it in your hand, you might feel a bit more connected to the experience. You're not controlling the movie, but you're still a part of it, and that can make it feel more manageable.

In a way, the same thing is happening with the breath and your feet. You're not changing the movie, but you're trying to find a way to feel more present and connected to yourself, which might help you feel less overwhelmed by the thoughts and feelings that are coming up.

It's not about the creditors or reputations directly, but about finding a way to feel more grounded and connected to yourself, so that you can handle the stress and uncertainty of the situation in a more manageable way.

I know it might sound a bit abstract, but I'm here to help you work through this, and I'm not going anywhere. Can we try to focus on the breath and your feet for just a little while longer, and see if we can find a way to make this feel more manageable for you?

Patient: Alright — I'll try to keep with the breath and my feet, but I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops reputational damage or creditors knocking. My hands are still buzzing and the second I loosen up my head stitches the screenplay back together: someone notices, mentions the health scare, clients whisper, an account bolts and payroll dries up. Can we slow down and stay with the breathing a bit longer, and also talk about something concrete I could actually believe in that would stop an account from leaving?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try to focus on the breath and your feet. It's understandable that you're looking for something more concrete to help you cope with the stress of your situation.

Let's take a step back and look at the situation from a more practical perspective. When an account leaves, it's often due to a combination of factors, including the quality of service, communication, and the overall relationship between the two parties. If you can focus on building a stronger, more positive relationship with your clients, you may be able to reduce the likelihood of them leaving.

One concrete thing you could try is to proactively reach out to your clients and check in with them regularly. This shows that you value their business and care about their needs, which can help to build trust and strengthen your relationship.

For example, you could send a brief email or make a phone call to ask about their current projects and see if there's anything you can do to support them. This might be something as simple as providing some additional resources or offering to help with a specific task.

By taking a more proactive and personalized approach, you may be able to reduce the likelihood of clients leaving and build a stronger, more positive relationship with them.

Now, let's take a moment to focus on the breath and your feet again. Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then slowly bring it to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Try to let go of any thoughts or distractions, and just focus on the physical sensation of the breath and your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to feel my feet and follow the breath. I can feel the weight in my heels and the air moving in and out, and my chest eases a touch, but my hands are still buzzing. I can't see how calling clients helps — in my head any outreach becomes proof: someone senses I'm fragile, they whisper, an account bolts faster, staff panic and payroll dries up — outreach feels like pouring gasoline on the fire. Can we just keep sitting with the breath a bit longer and maybe work through a concrete script or plan step-by-step? I'm getting worn out and I need you to slow down with me.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to keep trying to focus on the breath and your feet. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and need to take things slow.

Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's normal to feel like outreach is pouring gasoline on the fire in your mind. It's a common fear that many people face, especially when they're feeling vulnerable or uncertain.

Instead of trying to come up with a concrete script or plan right now, let's try to focus on just one small step. Can you try to imagine yourself making a single phone call to a client? Just one call. What would you say to them? What would you ask? Try to break it down into a very small, manageable task.

We can take it one step at a time, and see if we can find a way to make that small task feel less overwhelming. And if you're still feeling stuck, we can try to find a different way to focus on the breath and your feet.

Remember, the goal is not to try to fix everything or come up with a solution right now. It's just to take a deep breath, and try to feel a little bit more present and connected to yourself. Can you try to do that for me? Can you take one more deep breath, and just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is making a call not going to make things worse? If I call, they'll hear the tremor in my voice and it becomes proof I'm fragile. 

I guess the script would be something like, "Hi Mr. Jones, just checking in to see how things are going and if there's anything we can do to help," but my head immediately turns that into, "They're worried—run," and then the account bolts, staff panic, payroll dries up and I lose the building. 

Can we slow down and do another breath? I'm getting worn out and I don't really believe a script will stop what's already written.

Therapist: It sounds like making a call would only add to the anxiety and reinforce the fear that you're fragile. That's a very valid concern.

Let's take a step back and look at the script you came up with. It's a simple, friendly script that's meant to check in with the client and see if there's anything you can do to help. But, as you said, your head immediately starts to rewrite it in a way that's catastrophic.

Can you try to imagine what it would be like if you didn't have that catastrophic thinking? If you could just see the script as a simple, friendly check-in, without immediately turning it into a worst-case scenario?

Let's try to focus on the script again, but this time, let's try to keep it simple and friendly. No need to try to change it or rewrite it. Can you just focus on the words, and see if you can feel a sense of calm and connection to the client?

Take a deep breath, and let's try to focus on the words. "Hi Mr. Jones, just checking in to see how things are going and if there's anything we can do to help." Can you just say that, without thinking about what it means or what might happen?

Let's just focus on the words, for now. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how am I supposed to just say that without it becoming proof? Okay... "Hi Mr. Jones, just checking in to see how things are going and if there's anything we can do to help." I said it, but my voice trembled and now I can already see him telling someone, the account bolts, staff panic, payroll dries up and I lose everything — I'm overwhelmed, can we slow down and sit with this a bit more?

Therapist: It sounds like even the simple act of saying the words is enough to trigger your catastrophic thinking. Your mind is already predicting the worst-case scenario, and it's hard to separate the reality of the moment from the fantasy of what might happen.

Let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation. It's not about being "strong" or "tough"; it's about being human and facing your fears.

Can we try to focus on just one small thing? Let's look at your voice. You said the words, but your voice trembled. That's a physical response to your emotional state. Can you just notice the sensation of your voice without judging it or trying to change it?

Take a deep breath, and let's focus on your voice. What does it feel like to say those words? Can you just observe the sensation without trying to analyze it or change it?

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or fix anything right now. We're just trying to be present with ourselves and each other. Can you try to do that for me? Can you just sit with your voice and your breath, without trying to change anything?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my voice supposed to stop an account from leaving? I tried to observe it: my voice shook, my chest tightened, and my head immediately stitched the whole thing together—someone notices the tremor, they whisper about the health scare, a big client bolts, staff panic, payroll dries up and I lose the building. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and just keep sitting with the breath a bit while you talk me through one concrete next step I might actually believe in?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to keep trying. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated.

Let's take a step back and acknowledge that noticing your voice is not a solution to preventing the account from leaving. It's just a way to try to understand your physical response to the situation.

Can we try to focus on just one small thing that might help? Let's say you're going to make a phone call to the account. Can you try to make that one call, without worrying about what might happen? Can you just focus on putting one foot in front of the other, and making that one call?

We don't need to come up with a whole plan or strategy right now. Just one small step. Can you try to make that one call, and see what happens?

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or fix anything right now. We're just trying to take one small step, and see what happens. Can you try to do that for me? Can you just take one small step, and make that one call?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is making that single call supposed to stop the whole cascade I can already see? I can't make the call right now; my hands are buzzing and any outreach feels like proof it all goes wrong. Can we slow down and just sit with the breath a bit longer, and if you want me to try a concrete step, could you role-play the whole call with me line-by-line (you as Mr. Jones) so I can watch how it might actually go? I don't expect it to change the ending, but maybe staying here and doing it very slowly will help me manage without panicking.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try to take that small step. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to proceed.

Let's try to break it down into a more manageable task. Instead of trying to make a phone call right now, let's try a role-playing exercise. I'll play the role of Mr. Jones, and we can go through a simulated conversation. This might help you feel more comfortable and prepared for the real thing.

We'll start with a simple scenario. I'll introduce myself, and then we can go from there. You can play the role of yourself, and we can see how the conversation unfolds.

Here we go:

"Hi, this is Mr. Jones. I'm calling from Smith & Co."

Your turn. Just respond as you would in a real conversation. We'll take it one line at a time.

Patient: Hello… Mr. Jones. It's—it's [name]—sorry, my voice is already shaking. I keep seeing you say something about my health scare to someone else and then the account bolts and everything collapses, so I’m nervous—can we go very slowly?

Therapist: It's okay to be nervous, [name]. I can see that you're already on edge. Let's take a deep breath and try to calm down, okay? I'm not going to bring up any of that stuff right now. Can we just start with a simple introduction, like we did before? I'm calling because I've been thinking about our previous conversations, and I wanted to touch base with you about a few things. Can you tell me where you are right now, and if you're free to chat for a minute?

Patient: I'm in my office at the shop, and I can talk for a minute — my hands are still buzzing and my voice shakes. I'm not sure I follow how this won't make things worse; the second I speak I picture you mentioning the health scare, the account bolting, and everything collapsing. Can we do this very slowly?

Therapist: I'm glad we can take it slow. Let's start with just a simple greeting. I'll say something as simple as "Hello, [name]", and then you can respond. We can go from there.

"Hello, [name]. How are you today?"

(Please respond, and we'll take it from there)

Patient: I'm… anxious, my hands are buzzing and my voice is already shaking. If I sound too steady he'll notice something's off, someone will bring up the health scare, the account bolts, staff panic and payroll dries up — that's what my head says will happen. Can we go very slowly?

Therapist: I'm going to try to give you a simple, straightforward greeting. I want to start with just a small, single sentence. Can you try to respond with just a single word or phrase?

"Hello."

Just a simple hello. Can you try to respond to that?

Patient: Hello… I'm here, but my hands are buzzing and my voice is shaking — I can already see you mentioning the health scare, the account bolting, staff panicking and payroll drying up. Can we go very slowly?

Therapist: It's like you're already anticipating the worst-case scenario. I want to try to slow things down even further. Let's start with just a small, neutral statement. Can you try to respond with a single word or phrase to that?

I'm calling to... (pause)...check in.

(Please respond with just one word or phrase)

Patient: Very worried.
