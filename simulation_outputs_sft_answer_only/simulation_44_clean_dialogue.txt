Patient: Lately I've been consumed by this constant worry about my performance at work — like an internal audit that never closes — and it's paradoxically led me to procrastinate on tasks I know I'm capable of doing. As a nurse the stakes feel huge, so I tend to intellectualize — hypothesizing about error rates and contingency plans — which feels safer than actually sitting with the fear, even though it's making things worse.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a vicious cycle here. On one hand, the high stakes of your work can make it feel like you need to be extra vigilant, which might be driving your need for control and precision. On the other hand, your attempt to intellectualize the situation and plan for every possible scenario is actually fueling your anxiety, making it harder for you to focus and take action.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to actually sit with that fear, without your usual coping mechanisms? How does it feel, and what do you think would need to change for you to feel more comfortable with it?

Patient: When I actually try to sit with it, my chest tightens and my brain goes into this predictive-loop — I start rehearsing errors like a mental simulation and it becomes physiologically activating, like adrenaline and a queasy stomach. I tend to intellectualize it — turning fear into contingency planning feels safer than touching the shame or terror underneath. I guess I'd need permission to be fallible, very small, scaffolded tasks with clear steps and grounding anchors (and maybe somebody to validate when a task is done) before I could actually tolerate the feeling. I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed saying this out loud — it feels like we're skimming the surface and I want to unpack that shame, but I don't really know how to start.

Therapist: It sounds like that mental simulation of errors is taking on a life of its own, making it hard for you to even approach the task at hand without getting caught up in the anxiety. And it's interesting that you mention needing permission to be fallible – it's as if you're carrying around a sense of shame or responsibility for making mistakes, which is making it even harder to cope with the fear.

I want to acknowledge that it's a huge step for you to be willing to share this with me, and I'm here to support you in any way I can. It might be helpful to take a moment to breathe, and when you're ready, we can explore that shame a bit further. But for now, can you tell me more about what it's like to have someone validate your work, even if it's just a small task? What would it mean for you to feel like you're doing a good job, and that someone is acknowledging that?

Patient: I think validation would act like an external audit that temporarily recalibrates my internal error-monitor — when someone says “this was fine,” it interrupts the predictive-loop and lowers that adrenergic spike. Concretely, I’d want specific, immediate feedback on discrete tasks, acknowledgement of small wins, and explicit permission to make minor mistakes without them being framed as catastrophic. Honestly, I’m already getting a bit overwhelmed saying this out loud — it feels like we keep skimming, and I want to unpack the shame underneath but I don’t know how to start.

Therapist: It sounds like validation has a really powerful effect on interrupting that predictive-loop and calming down your internal error-monitor. It's almost like a reset button, allowing you to feel more grounded and focused.

I want to try to help you explore that shame a bit more. It's clear that it's a big part of what's holding you back, and I'm here to support you in working with it. Can you tell me more about what it's like to have made a mistake, even a small one? What does the shame or guilt feel like in that moment, and how does it affect your ability to take action or feel validated?

Also, I want to try something a bit different. Instead of focusing on the external validation, can we explore what it would be like to give yourself validation? What would it mean for you to acknowledge your own small wins, and to give yourself permission to make mistakes without being too hard on yourself? It might be a small step, but it could be a big one in helping you feel more confident and comfortable with the uncertainty.

Patient: When I make a mistake, there's this immediate metacognitive loop that treats the error as proof of a deficient professional identity, so I start rehearsing catastrophic outcomes and my attention contracts into that simulation. In principle, self-validation would look like micro-policies — a 60‑second post-task debrief where I name one concrete thing I did well, one tiny improvement, and say a permissive line to myself, plus externalizing small wins into a checklist or a quick message to a colleague as a stabilizing feedback loop. I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed saying this — can we slow down? I want to actually feel what's under the analysis, but I keep defaulting to theory.

Therapist: It sounds like that metacognitive loop is really tight, and it's treating the error as a personal failure. It's like you're already convinced that you're not good enough, and that conviction is feeding the catastrophic thinking.

I want to try to help you slow down and get closer to what's really going on. Can you take a deep breath and imagine that we're not talking about a task or a situation right now, but just you, yourself, and that feeling of shame or guilt that comes with making a mistake? What does it look like, feel like, or sound like in your body? Try to tap into that, just for a moment, without thinking about it or trying to analyze it.

And then, when you're ready, we can start to explore how that feeling might be connected to the catastrophic thinking. Maybe we can even start to explore that micro-policy you mentioned, the 60-second debrief, and see if it might be a way to help you feel more grounded and confident. But let's take it one step at a time, and focus on getting closer to what's really going on inside of you.

Patient: Okay — breathing in. When I actually try to feel it, my chest compresses, my throat tightens, and my mind goes into this hyperreal predictive-loop — physiologically it’s adrenergic, queasy, muscles taut — but I immediately translate that into an explanatory model instead of staying in the sensation. The 60‑second debrief feels doable in theory — three grounding breaths, name one concrete thing I did well, one tiny tweak, and a permissive line — but I can already foresee myself blanking when the loop activates, so I’d need a rigid cue (a timer, a written script, or a quick message template to a colleague) to make it work. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed saying this out loud — can we slow down? I want to actually sit with the shame under the analysis, but I keep skirting it.

Therapist: It sounds like that predictive-loop is really intense, and it's like your mind is already making up a story about what's happening in your body, even before you're fully aware of it. And then, of course, there's the shame and the self-criticism that comes with it.

I want to try to help you slow down and get closer to that shame, without trying to analyze it or turn it into a story. Can you try to just sit with it, without judgment or commentary? Just be with it, like a physical presence, without trying to do anything with it. It's like a stone in your hand, just sitting there, without trying to think about it or do anything with it.

And then, when you're ready, we can start to talk about the debrief, and how you might use it to help you cope with the shame and the anxiety. But for now, just take a deep breath, and try to sit with that shame.

Patient: Okay — when I actually try to sit with the shame my chest tightens, my face feels hot, and there's this shrinking, embarrassed sensation like I'm under an audit and everyone can see the mistake. My brain almost reflexively turns it into probabilities and contingency plans — a metacognitive defense — but under that I notice a raw, small humiliation, like I'm not measuring up. I'm already getting overwhelmed saying this out loud; can we slow down and do one slow grounding breath together or have you guide me to stay with it for a bit? I don't want to slip back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really trying to get into touch with that shame, and it's a very intense and personal experience. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you stay with it for a bit.

Let's take a slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. Can you feel that breath moving in and out of your body? Let's hold onto that sensation for a moment, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Now, I want to ask you to do one small thing. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Where do you feel the weight of your body? It's okay if it's not a strong sensation at first. Just try to bring your attention to it, without trying to think about anything else. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my feet, mostly pressure in the heels and a coolness under the toes where they meet the floor, like little anchor points. Even describing it, my mind immediately converts it into a performance metric — is this grounding "working" or just another intervention to file away — which pulls me back into analysis. I'm already a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and stay with this for another minute with you guiding me?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is already trying to turn even this simple sensation into a performance metric, which is a powerful way to reinforce the analytical thinking that's been holding you back.

Let's try to stay with the feeling of your feet on the ground, without trying to analyze it or turn it into a metric. Can you just notice the sensation, without judgment or commentary? It's like looking at a blank piece of paper - you're not thinking about what's on it, you're just looking at it.

I want to try a different way to anchor you to the present moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? It's the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest or belly. Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it.

And I want to remind you that it's okay if your mind starts to wander or pull you back into analysis. We can come back to it whenever you're ready. For now, let's just stay with this moment, and see where it takes us.

Patient: I'm trying to stay with the breath, but my mind immediately launches into metacognitive commentary—labeling sensations and evaluating whether this counts as "progress," which yanks me out of the moment. Underneath that I notice a hot, shrinking knot behind my sternum and the thought "I'm incompetent," and I don't know how to let that thought be without chasing it with contingency plans. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down and could you guide me through one more very slow breath and help me craft a short, nonjudgmental sentence I can say when the loop starts?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to stay with the breath, and your mind is jumping into metacognitive commentary right away. That's a really tough one to break out of, but I'm here to support you.

Let's take one more slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. Can you feel that breath moving in and out of your body? Let's hold onto that sensation for a moment, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Now, I want to try to help you craft a short, nonjudgmental sentence that you can say when the loop starts. Can you think of a simple sentence that you could say to yourself, like "I am here" or "I am breathing"? Maybe something like "I can handle this" or "I am doing the best I can"? The goal is to say something that is true, without evaluating it or trying to change it. Just say it, without judgment.

We can work with this sentence together, and see if it helps you break out of the loop. But first, let's take one more deep breath, and see if we can get a little bit further. Are you ready?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready. (Inhale for four, hold four, exhale four.) When the loop starts I'll try saying: "I am breathing; this will pass." It feels like a small, present‑focused anchor rather than an appraisal, though I'm jittery and my attention keeps darting—could you say it with me once?

Therapist: (Inhale for four, hold four, exhale four.) I am breathing; this will pass.

It's great that you're trying a new sentence, and it does feel like a small, present-focused anchor. Remember, the goal is not to evaluate whether it's "working" or not, but just to say it, without judgment. So, if you find yourself thinking "I am breathing; this is not working," try to catch that thought and bring your attention back to the sentence. Just say it, without trying to change it.

Now, let's try it again, and this time, I want you to say it with me one more time. Are you ready?

Patient: Yes — ready. Inhale four, hold four, exhale four. I am breathing; this will pass.

Saying it helps a little, but I'm suddenly more anxious and distracted and there's this hot shame — I'm frustrated at myself for getting hijacked like this. Could you say it with me once more, slowly?

Therapist: (Inhale for four, hold four, exhale four.) I am breathing; this will pass.

Can you just focus on the words, and not worry about what they mean or how you're feeling? Just say them, slowly and clearly. Try to connect with the physical sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and let the words just follow.

No judgment, no commentary, just the words. I am breathing; this will pass. Can you do that for me, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — inhale four, hold four, exhale four. I am breathing; this will pass.

It helps a hair, but I'm suddenly flooded with this hot shame and irritation at myself for getting hijacked — my brain's already running a meta-analysis about whether the sentence "counts," which just drags me back into that shrinking, failure-feeling. Could you say it once more, slowly? I need your voice to anchor me because my attention keeps darting.

Therapist: (Inhale for four, hold four, exhale four.) I am breathing; this will pass.

I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Just focus on the words, and let me be your anchor. Try to let go of the meta-analysis, and just focus on the sentence. It's not about "counting" or evaluating it, it's just about saying it. Say it with me, slowly: I am breathing; this will pass.

I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Just take a deep breath, and focus on the words. You're safe, and you're doing the best you can. Just take it one moment at a time.

Patient: Your voice actually helps, but I keep getting hijacked — there's this vivid flash of a past failure that makes me feel hot, small, and humiliated, and then my brain reflexively launches into meta‑analysis instead of staying put. I can talk about it as maladaptive error‑monitoring and predictive overshoot, but that doesn't dull the sting — could you say one specific thing I did well recently (maybe from yesterday's shift) to interrupt the loop, and then guide me through one very slow grounding breath? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I'm glad my voice is helping, even if it's not sticking. Okay, let's try something specific. I want you to think about yesterday's shift, and something that you did well. Maybe it was a patient interaction, a procedure, or even just taking a difficult med order. Whatever it is, try to remember it, and focus on that one thing. Can you think of something that stood out to you, something that you did well?

And then, let's try a slow grounding breath. I want you to inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. But this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your feet on the floor. Can you do that for me?

As we breathe, I want you to notice that vivid flash of a past failure. Can you just acknowledge it, without judgment? Just notice it, and let it go. We're not going to analyze it, or try to change it. We're just going to let it be, and then move on. Are you ready to try?

Patient: Okay — I can hold one concrete thing: yesterday I caught a dosing discrepancy on a med order, paused, cross‑checked the MAR and phoned the pharmacist, and the patient ended up getting the correct dose. Saying that feels a bit stabilizing, but immediately a hot flash of that past failure comes back and my brain starts interrogating whether that counts or if it was just luck, which makes me shrink and want to pull away. Could you guide me through the slow grounding breath again, slow and with emphasis on the feet‑pressure, and stay with me? I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you feel the pressure of your feet on the floor? The weight of your body is distributed evenly, and your feet are firmly planted. It's a simple, grounding sensation.

As we breathe, notice the sensation of your feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. With each breath, feel those roots growing stronger, anchoring you in the present moment. Your feet are a safe, solid foundation, and they're the only thing you need to focus on right now.

Don't try to think about the past failure or the dosing discrepancy. Just focus on the sensation of your feet. Are they warm or cool? Do you feel any pressure or tension in your toes? Just notice it, without judgment. We're not going to analyze it or try to change it. We're just going to let it be, and then move on.

As we breathe, I want you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself: "I am here. I am now." Say it with me: "I am here. I am now." Just focus on the words, and let the sensation of your feet guide you. We're going to stay with this for a moment, and then we'll see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay — inhale four, hold four, exhale four. I am here. I am now.

Saying that helps a little, but I'm flooded with hot shame and this shrinking—my brain immediately turns it into an evaluative meta‑commentary instead of letting it land. Could you say again, slowly, that thing I did well yesterday (the med catch) and guide me through one more very slow grounding breath with emphasis on the heels pressing into the floor? I'm overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with this for a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground? It's a simple, grounding sensation.

As we breathe, notice the sensation of your heels. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. With each breath, feel those roots growing stronger, anchoring you in the present moment. Your feet are a safe, solid foundation, and they're the only thing you need to focus on right now.

Now, I want you to think about that med catch you made yesterday. It was a small mistake, but it showed that you're paying attention, that you're looking out for your patients. Can you remember the feeling of catching that mistake? Can you feel the sense of relief, the sense of accomplishment? It's okay to feel proud of yourself, to acknowledge your strengths.

As we breathe, I want you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself: "I am capable. I am strong." Say it with me: "I am capable. I am strong." Just focus on the words, and let the sensation of your feet guide you. We're going to stay with this for a moment, and then we'll see where it takes us.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to not be perfect. What's important is that you're trying, that you're paying attention, that you're looking out for your patients. You are capable, you are strong. Can you feel that? Can you feel the sense of pride, the sense of confidence? It's okay to take a moment to acknowledge it. You deserve it.

Patient: Okay — breathing in. It helped a little when you said that about the med catch, but I’m still flooded with this hot, shrinking shame and irritated at myself for getting hijacked — my brain immediately starts interrogating whether the med catch “counts” or was just luck, which feels humiliating and makes me want to shrink away. Intellectually I can describe it as signal‑noise attribution and hypervigilant error‑monitoring, but underneath that analysis is this raw, small humiliation and frustration that I can’t stop second‑guessing myself.

Could you — very specifically — say what I did well in that moment? Like, name the exact steps I took that were clinically meaningful (so it’s not just “good job”) and then guide me through one more very slow grounding breath with emphasis on the heels pressing into the floor? I’m overwhelmed; can we slow down and stay with this for another minute?

Therapist: I'm going to try to help you break through this loop. You did a clinically meaningful thing in that moment - you caught a dosing discrepancy on a med order. Specifically, you paused, cross-checked the MAR, and then called the pharmacist to verify the medication. That action shows that you're paying attention to your patients' care, and you're willing to take the time to ensure their safety.

Now, I want you to take a deep breath with me. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground? It's a simple, grounding sensation.

As we breathe, notice the sensation of your heels. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. With each breath, feel those roots growing stronger, anchoring you in the present moment. Your feet are a safe, solid foundation, and they're the only thing you need to focus on right now.

I want you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself: "I made a safe call." Say it with me: "I made a safe call." Just focus on the words, and let the sensation of your feet guide you. You did a safe and meaningful thing, and that's something to be proud of. You deserve to acknowledge it, and to take a moment to celebrate it. Can you feel that? Can you feel the sense of pride, the sense of confidence? It's okay to take a moment to acknowledge it. You deserve it.

Patient: Okay — hearing the concrete steps actually helps: I paused, cross‑checked the MAR, and called the pharmacist. But I'm already flooded with hot shame and this irritating inner question — "was it just luck? did I miss something?" — and I feel small and humiliated, my attention darting all over. Could you say "I made a safe call" with me once, slowly, and then guide me through one very slow grounding breath with emphasis on my heels? I'm overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with this for a bit?

Therapist: I'm going to say it with you, slowly. "I made a safe call." Say it with me: "I made a safe call." Just focus on the words, and let's breathe it in together.

Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground? It's a simple, grounding sensation.

Notice the sensation of your heels, and imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground. With each breath, feel those roots growing stronger, anchoring you in the present moment. Your feet are a safe, solid foundation, and they're the only thing you need to focus on right now.

As we breathe, I want you to notice the present moment, just this one moment. Feel the sensation of your feet, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about the past or the future, just stay with this moment, right here, right now.

Can you stay with me, just for a little bit longer? Can you feel your feet, and your breath, and your body, all grounded and safe? I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere.

Patient: I can try to stay — my attention keeps pinging and there's this hot, humiliating flash that makes me shrink and start interrogating whether the med catch “counts,” which fuels the hypervigilant loop. Could you say “I made a safe call” once more and lead one slow grounding breath with emphasis on my heels, and then help me craft a very short, 1‑sentence script I can actually memorize for the moment (like: “Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible.”)? I’m overwhelmed—can we slow down and do that together?

Therapist: I'm going to say it with you, slowly. "I made a safe call." Say it with me: "I made a safe call." Just focus on the words, and let's breathe it in together.

Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground? It's a simple, grounding sensation.

Now, let's try to craft a short script together. Can you think of a simple phrase that you could say to yourself in this moment? Something like: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Just focus on the words, and try to memorize them.

Repeat it with me: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Say it with me, slowly: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Can you feel it? Can you feel the words, and the breath, and the body, all grounded and safe?

Let's take it one step at a time, and one slow breath at a time. Can you stay with me, just for a little bit longer?

Patient: I can stay — though my brain's loud with that humiliating flash and metacognitive chatter. Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible. Could you lead one slow heel‑focused breath with me and say that line once, slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground?

Now, let's say it together. Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible. Say it with me, slowly: Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible.

Take another breath, and feel the words sink in. You're doing this. You're taking a small step towards acknowledging your strengths, and your weaknesses. It's okay to be fallible. It's okay to make mistakes. You're human.

Let's do it again, together. Are you ready?

Patient: Yeah — I'm ready. Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible. My chest's tight and my brain's already gearing into predictive analysis about whether that "counts," so could you lead the heel‑focused breath slowly and say the line with me once more? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and stay with it?

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground?

Now, let's say it together. Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible. I want you to repeat it with me, slowly. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, say it with me: Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible.

Let's take another breath, and feel the words sink in. You're doing this. You're taking a small step towards acknowledging your strengths, and your weaknesses. It's okay to be fallible. It's okay to make mistakes. You're human.

Remember, I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We'll take it one slow breath at a time, and one small step at a time. Can you stay with me?

Patient: I can stay — but I'm suddenly really jittery; that hot, humiliating shame's back, my chest's tight, and my brain's already running a metacognitive checklist instead of letting the breath land. Could we do one more heel‑focused breath together, say the script slowly, and then run a very brief role‑play of using it while I'm on a busy floor? I'm overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with this for another minute?

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensation of your heels pressing into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels on the ground?

Now, let's say it together. Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible. I want you to repeat it with me, slowly. Inhale for a count of four... (pause) hold for a count of four... exhale for a count of four. As we breathe, say it with me: Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible.

Take another breath, and let's try to slow down. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground? Feel the weight of your body, the pressure of your heels. Just for a moment, can you let go of that metacognitive checklist and just breathe?

Now, let's try a quick role-play. Imagine you're on a busy floor, and a patient comes up to you with a question. They look a bit worried, and you need to reassure them. Here's the script: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Can you try it with me? I'll be the patient, and I'll ask you a question. Go ahead, take a deep breath, and try it out.

Patient: Okay — I'm taking a breath. Patient: "Is this the right dose?" I pause, feel my heels on the floor, and say slowly: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Then I add, clinically: "I cross‑checked the MAR and called pharmacy — this is the correct dose, and I'll stay with you while you take it."

Saying that helps a little, but my chest's tight and I'm already second‑guessing whether that "counts" — can we slow down and run that role‑play once more with you adding a little busyness in the background? I'm getting overwhelmed and want to practice staying with it.

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again, with a bit more busyness in the background. I'll be the patient, and I'll come up to you with a question. I'll also be making a few phone calls and checking some charts in the background, to make it feel more like a busy floor.

"Hey, can I get your attention for a minute?" I say, interrupting my phone call. "I have a question about my medication. Can you just confirm that I got the right dose?"

I pause, look around the room, and take a deep breath. Now it's your turn. Remember, you've got the script: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Go ahead, say it with me, and then add your clinical explanation.

(Background noise: beeping machines, murmured conversations, and a phone ringing in the distance.)

Can you try it out?

Patient: Okay—taking a breath. "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." I paused, cross‑checked the MAR, and called pharmacy; that confirmed the correct dose, and I'll stay with you while you take it.

Saying that helps a bit, but I’m already flushed with hot shame and this shitty inner question—"was that just luck?"—which feels humiliating and makes me want to shrink. Can we run it again with more background noise and you throw in a quick interruption so I can practice staying with the line?

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again, with more background noise and a quick interruption. I'll be the patient, and I'll come up to you with a question. I'll also be making a few phone calls and checking some charts in the background, to make it feel more like a busy floor.

"Hey, can I get your attention for a minute?" I say, interrupting my phone call. "I have a question about my medication. Can you just confirm that I got the right dose?"

As I speak, I start making some notes on my chart, scribbling down a medication list and a few reminders. The beeping of the machines in the background gets louder, and I can hear the sound of footsteps approaching.

Just as I'm about to ask my question, a nurse rushes by, holding a chart and looking frazzled. "Hold on a minute, doc," she says, "I need to talk to you about the patient on room 3."

She hurries off, leaving me standing there, waiting for your response. Remember, you've got the script: "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." Take a deep breath, and try to stay with it.

(Background noise: beeping machines, murmured conversations, and the nurse rushing off)

Can you try it out?

Patient: Okay — breath. "Pause. One thing I did well: I caught the dose. I am allowed to be fallible." I cross‑checked the MAR, called pharmacy, they confirmed the dose, and I'll stay with you while you take it.

That actually helps a touch, but I'm immediately flooded with hot shame and this intrusive self‑interrogation — my brain's already asking "was that just luck?" which feels humiliating and drags me back into analysis. Can we run it again with the interruption you mentioned? I need more practice staying with the line; I'm getting overwhelmed, so can we slow down and do it once more?

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again, with the interruption and a slower pace. I'll be the patient, and I'll come up to you with a question. I'll also be making a few phone calls and checking some charts in the background, to make it feel more like a busy floor.

We're going to take it slow, and I want you to focus on your breathing and the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you do that for me?

(Background noise: beeping machines, murmured conversations, and the nurse rushing off)

Let's take it one step at a time. Can you tell me what's happening in your body right now? Where do you feel the shame, and the self-interrogation? Can you connect with that sensation, and explore it further?

Patient: My body is pretty activated — a tight knot behind my sternum, throat constricting, face hot, and my hands feel a little shaky; my breathing's shallow and my attention keeps darting. The shame feels like a small, heavy stone lodged in my chest that makes me want to shrink, and almost instantly a hypervigilant metacognitive loop kicks in — "was that just luck? did I miss something?" — which pulls me out of actually feeling it into analysis. I'm trying to connect with the sensation but I'm jittery and distracted; can we slow down and do one more very slow, heel‑focused breath together so I can try to stay with it?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to follow, and I can see you're pointing to an ACT, values‑and‑action approach in theory, but that huge repetition just made my attention scatter and a hot shame spike in my chest. My breathing's shallow and my hands are jittery; I can't parse the nuance right now.

Can we slow down? Lead one very slow, heel‑focused breath with me, and then give me one single, concrete values‑based micro‑action I can do on shift (one sentence) so I can try it in the moment. I'm overwhelmed — can we stay with that, please?

Patient: That last message was hard to follow and made my chest tighten and my attention scatter — I'm jittery, my throat's constricted, and my brain's already slipping into analysis to avoid the shame spike. Can you please slow down and lead one very slow, heel‑focused breath with me (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4) and then give me one single, concrete values‑based micro‑action sentence I can actually do on shift? If it helps, a possible example I could try: "Before giving meds, pause 10 seconds, check the MAR, then say to myself: 'I checked — patient safety first.'"
