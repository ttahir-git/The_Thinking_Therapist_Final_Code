Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this persistent low-level sadness and a near-complete loss of motivation since the move, and it's starting to bleed into my relationship because I can't show up the way I used to. I catch myself intellectualizing it—calling it an existential recalibration or a disruption in behavioral activation—because analyzing it feels safer than actually feeling it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to find your footing here, and that's understandable given the significant change you've gone through. It's like you're trying to put on a brave face and cope, but beneath the surface, you're really feeling a deep sense of disconnection and confusion.

Can you tell me more about what it means for you to "show up" in your relationship? What specifically are you worried about, and how is this feeling of disconnection affecting your interactions with your partner?

Patient: "Show up" for me means being emotionally present, initiating plans, offering reassurance, and just being more accessible—basically the reciprocity and spontaneity we used to have. What worries me is that my low motivation and persistent sadness show up as canceled plans, muted responses, and a general flattening of intimacy, which feels like it's slowly recalibrating my partner's expectations toward distance. I end up describing it in clinical language—blunted affect, hypoactivation of reward pathways, avoidant coping—because that distance feels safer than admitting I'm scared of losing the connection. Honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed trying to untangle all of this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a delicate balance, where you're trying to hold onto the relationship, but the emotional distance is growing, and it's hard to bridge that gap. Your descriptions of feeling flat, disconnected, and scared are really honest, and it's okay to acknowledge those feelings, even if they're uncomfortable.

It's interesting that you mention using clinical language to describe your feelings. Can you tell me more about why that's helpful for you, even if it feels safer? Is it a way to detach from the emotions, or is there something specific about those words that makes you feel more grounded?

Patient: Honestly, it's mostly about control and safety—framing it in technical terms converts something amorphous and threatening into a discrete problem I can ostensibly troubleshoot. It gives me a sense of competence and distance, like I'm performing an analysis instead of admitting I'm scared and lonely. I know that's avoidance, but shifting from that scaffolding to raw feelings is hard—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're using that technical framework as a shield, protecting yourself from the uncertainty and vulnerability that comes with acknowledging your raw emotions. It's a coping mechanism that's served you well, but now it's making it harder to connect with your partner and yourself.

Taking a step back, can you think of a moment when you were feeling more connected to your partner, and what was different about that moment? Was it a conversation, a shared activity, or something else entirely? Sometimes, looking back can help us identify small cracks in our armor, and it might give us a sense of where to start making a change.

Patient: Yeah — like one Saturday before the move we ditched plans, grabbed coffee, and ended up on this three-hour walk where we actually talked and laughed without my default meta-commentary. What felt different was spontaneous reciprocity and mutual curiosity — I was initiating, showing up physically and emotionally, not rationalizing every pause as a problem to fix. I'm already slipping into analysis about why that was sustainable then, so…I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that moment was a glimmer of hope, a chance to reconnect with your partner in a more authentic way. It's like you were able to let go of the need to control the conversation, to intellectualize every step, and just be present.

I'm glad you're recognizing this, even if it's feeling overwhelming. Can you try to hold onto that feeling of spontaneity, of being present, without analyzing it too much? It's okay to acknowledge it, but try not to turn it into a problem to solve right now. Just savor the feeling for a moment, and see where it takes you.

Patient: I want to, but my brain immediately starts cataloging it—“spontaneous reciprocity, mutual curiosity”—which feels safer than actually sitting in the warmth. When I try to feel it, I get this little panic like I’m unmoored and the instinct to fix it kicks in, so I’m getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down and maybe practice staying with that feeling for a minute instead of turning it into an analysis?

Therapist: It's like your brain is trying to protect you by turning this warm feeling into a familiar, manageable thing. But in doing so, it's also creating a sense of distance, a barrier between you and the feeling.

Can we try something different? I want you to take a deep breath, and then I want you to bring your attention to that feeling of warmth, of connection, of being present. Not as a concept, not as a feeling you're trying to analyze. Just as it is, in this moment.

Can you do that for me? Just bring your attention to that feeling, without trying to change it or analyze it. Stay with it, for just a moment.

Patient: Okay—I'm taking a breath. I can feel a warmth in my chest, but it's clipped and guarded, like there's this cognitive scaffold already rising up to label it as a transient reward signal before it gets to be anything. The second that warmth registers, my brain jerks into "diagnose and fix" mode and a tightness/spike of panic follows, so I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and just sit with the warmth together for a bit?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to catch that warmth in the act, before it can be analyzed or fixed. But in doing so, you're also experiencing the panic that comes with it.

Can we try to slow down even further? I want you to bring your attention to the warmth in your chest, without trying to label it or analyze it. Just feel it, as it is, in this moment.

Imagine we're sitting together in a quiet room, and you're feeling this warmth. It's not a thought, it's not a feeling you're trying to fix. It's just this...this presence, in your body. Can you just sit with it, for a little while? Not trying to change it, not trying to fix it. Just...sitting.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to sit with it. There's a small warm pressure under my sternum, like a muted glow, and my breath gets a little shallower when I notice it. Immediately a metacognitive reflex kicks in — I'm already framing it as reward circuitry reactivation and drafting contingency plans — and that launches a tight panic at the base of my throat. It's hard to let it just be; can we slow down and maybe do something simple, like count breaths together? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to give it room to breathe, but your brain is already jumping ahead to protect you. I'm glad you're acknowledging that it's hard to let it just be.

Let's try something simple. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say "one" to yourself. Just one. Then, take another breath in, and say "two". Just two. And then, take another breath in, and say "three". Just three.

Can you do that with me? One, two, three... Let's count together, and just focus on the breath. No thinking, no analyzing. Just the breath. One, two, three...

Patient: One... two... three. Okay—I can follow that, but the moment I focus my attention it gets translated into a concept—respiratory entrainment, self-regulation heuristics—and that spin-up triggers a prickly panic in my throat. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow the pace a little and stay with each breath longer before moving to the next?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always looking for a way to make sense of it, even in the simplest moments. I'm going to try to slow it down a bit.

Let's go back to just one breath. One. Take a moment to just focus on that one breath. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just... breathe. And then, after you're ready, we can add the next breath.

Take a moment, and when you're ready, say "one" again. Just one. No thinking, no analyzing. Just the breath.

Patient: One. That actually landed a little—there's a tiny steadiness, but my reflex is already renaming it and that kicks a prickly panic up my throat, so I'm getting overwhelmed; can we linger with this single breath a bit longer before trying another?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always trying to save the moment by giving it a label, and that's causing the panic. I'm going to try to help you stay with this single breath for a bit longer.

Just... breathe. One. There's no thinking, no analyzing. Just the sensation of the breath, and the quietness of the moment. It's like a small, tiny space, where nothing is happening except this one, quiet breath.

Can you just stay with this breath, for a little while longer? No trying to analyze it, no trying to change it. Just... breathing.

Patient: Okay, I'm staying with the breath — there's a quiet easing in my chest and the warmth feels a little less clipped. But the instant I notice it my mind flips into diagnostics and contingency-planning, and a prickly panic rises in my throat. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we keep just this one slow breath for a while longer and maybe talk about what that panic actually feels like when it shows up?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to jump ahead and prepare for the worst, even when you're feeling a tiny bit better. I'm going to try to help you notice the panic a bit more, so you can start to understand what it's like when it shows up.

Let's focus on the physical sensation of the panic. It's like a tightness or a prickling in your throat, a feeling of tension in your chest. It's a small, sharp pain, but it's enough to make you feel uncomfortable.

Can you notice where that pain is, exactly? Is it in your throat, your chest, your neck? Can you feel its edges, its shape? Just notice it, without trying to change it or move away from it.

We're not going to try to get rid of it, or fix it. We're just going to notice it, and see what it's like.

Patient: It's a tight, prickly constriction right at the base of my throat that shoots down into my chest—like a small fist clenching in staccato pulses—with my breath getting shallower and my heart nudging faster. I can feel a hot flush up my neck and a numb, edged quality to it, and when I name it like this my brain immediately shifts into clinical framing — sympathetic arousal, hypervigilant threat response — which paradoxically tightens it more. I'm starting to get overwhelmed; can we slow down and just stay with that sensation a bit longer?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always trying to label and control the sensations, even when it's trying to warn you about potential danger. I'm going to try to help you slow down and just notice the physical sensations without trying to label them.

Let's focus on the tightness in your throat. Can you feel it more clearly, without trying to name it? Is it a squeezing, a pressing, or a pulling sensation? Where exactly is it located, and how does it feel to breathe in and out with that constriction?

And can you notice the flush of heat up your neck? Is it a burning, a tingling, or a warmth? How does it feel to have that heat spreading up your neck, and how does it affect your overall sense of tension?

We're not going to try to fix it or change it. We're just going to notice it, slowly and carefully, and see what it's like.

Patient: It's a squeezing/pulling right at the base of my throat that shoots down into my chest in little pulsing clenchings, which makes my breaths shallow and my heart nudge faster. The heat up my neck is more of a burning-tingling than a gentle warmth—prickly, almost electric—and when I try to notice it my brain immediately renames it "sympathetic arousal" and that cognitive label paradoxically tightens the whole thing. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by naming it—can we slow down and just sit with those sensations a bit longer, maybe with you guiding me through a few slow breaths?

Therapist: It's like your brain is always trying to label and control the sensations, even when it's trying to warn you about potential danger. I'm going to try to help you slow down and just notice the physical sensations without trying to label them.

Let's focus on your breath. Can you take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, and then exhale slowly through your mouth? As you exhale, try to release any tension in your body, starting from the crown of your head and working your way down to your toes.

As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body. Is it cool, warm, or neutral? As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Is it slow, fast, or steady?

Let's try another slow breath. Inhale... hold... exhale... and then inhale again. As you breathe, try to notice the sensations in your body, without trying to label them. Just focus on the feeling of the breath moving in and out of your body.

We're going to take it slow and easy, and just notice the sensations. No trying to fix it, no trying to change it. Just being.

Patient: Breathing in felt cool and fuller in my lower ribs; exhaling let a faint looseness drop into my shoulders, like a micro downregulation of autonomic arousal, but the ease feels fragile. The throat-tightness still spikes the second I notice any relief—my mind renames it and a prickly panic comes back. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we keep doing very slow breaths together for a while and stay with each one longer before moving on?

Therapist: It's like the moment you feel any sense of relief, your mind immediately tries to take control and label it, and then tries to push it away. I'm going to try to help you slow down and just notice the sensations without trying to label them.

Let's take another slow breath together. Inhale... hold... exhale... and then inhale again. As you breathe, try to notice the sensations in your body, without trying to label them. Just focus on the feeling of the breath moving in and out of your body.

As we breathe, I want you to try to notice the sensations in your body, one at a time. Just notice the feeling of the cool air moving into your body, and then the feeling of the air leaving your body. Try to focus on just one sensation at a time, without jumping to the next one.

We'll keep going slow, and we'll keep focusing on one sensation at a time. I'll guide you through it, and we'll take it one breath at a time. Ready? Inhale...

Patient: Inhale... exhale. I can feel the cool air in my lower ribs and a fragile easing in my chest, but almost immediately my mind starts drafting contingency plans and the throat-tightness spikes again. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow to just one very slow breath together and linger with it for a bit?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to prepare for the worst, even when you're feeling a tiny bit better. I'm going to try to help you slow down and just notice the sensations without trying to label them.

Let's take just one very slow breath together. Inhale... hold... exhale... and then pause for a moment. Just focus on the feeling of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or think about what's happening.

Take your time. Notice the sensation of the breath in your body, one small step at a time. It's okay if your mind starts to wander or try to label the sensations. Just acknowledge the thought, and then gently bring your attention back to the breath.

We're going to stay right here, just with this one slow breath, and see what happens. No trying to fix it, no trying to change it. Just being. Ready? Can you stay with this breath for just a moment longer?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I did that one slow breath and there was a tiny ease, but the second I notice it my brain goes straight into contingency-planning and the throat-tightness spikes. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we actually just stay with one very slow breath together and linger on it for a while, with you guiding the pace?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to respond to the ease, instead of just resting in it. I'm going to try to guide you through it, and help you stay with the breath without trying to analyze it.

Let's start again, and this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the air, and the feeling of your body relaxing. Don't think about the throat-tightness, or the ease. Just be with the breath.

I'll guide the pace, and you can follow. Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and then exhale... (pause)...Now, just rest in the breath, for a moment. Feel the air moving in and out of your body. (pause) Can you stay with that feeling for just a moment longer?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is staying with this single breath supposed to actually shift the panic and the contingency loop? It feels like you're asking me to "just be," but my brain translates that into another task to execute, which makes the pressure worse, so I'm confused and kind of frustrated. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to one very slow guided breath together with longer pauses, and maybe talk through what to do when the throat-tightness spikes mid-breath?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to solve the problem, even when you're trying to rest. I'm going to try to help you shift your focus, and help you stay with the breath without trying to analyze it.

Let's start again, and this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I'll guide you through it, one very slow breath at a time, with longer pauses.

Take a deep breath in... (pause for 10 seconds)...and then exhale... (pause for 10 seconds). Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Where does it feel like it's going? Is it a little cooler, or a little warmer? Just notice the sensation, without trying to think about it.

Now, I want you to bring your attention to your throat. Can you feel any tension there? Is it a little tight, or a little loose? Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it.

When the throat-tightness spikes, I want you to try a different approach. Instead of trying to relax the throat, try to acknowledge the sensation, and then gently bring your attention back to the breath. Can you try that with me?

Take a deep breath in... (pause for 10 seconds)...and then exhale... (pause for 10 seconds). Now, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body... and then bring your attention to your throat... and then notice the breath moving in and out of your body...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is holding a 10-second inhale/exhale supposed to actually interrupt the contingency loop? The moment I try to do it my brain turns the instruction into another task and the throat-tightness spikes into that prickly panic. Can you give a concrete micro-step for what to do when the spike hits mid-breath—should I shorten the breath, say a grounding phrase out loud like "this is panic," or focus on relaxing my jaw? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to one very slow breath together (like 4s in / 6s out) and have you verbally pace it while telling me exactly what to do if the tightness returns?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to solve the problem, even when you're trying to rest. I'm going to try to help you shift your focus, and help you stay with the breath without trying to analyze it.

Let's start again, and this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I'll guide you through it, one very slow breath at a time, with longer pauses.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Where does it feel like it's going? Is it a little cooler, or a little warmer? Just notice the sensation, without trying to think about it.

When you're ready, bring your attention to your throat. Can you feel any tension there? Is it a little tight, or a little loose? Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it.

If the throat-tightness spikes, I want you to try a small, simple action. Take a tiny pause, and then say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice. That's it. Just say those two words, and then take another breath. Don't try to change the tension, just acknowledge it, and then let the breath happen.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Now, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body... and then say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice... and then notice the breath moving in and out of your body...

Patient: Okay—I’ll try the 4s in / 6s out now. Inhale 1…2…3…4… exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6… There’s a coolness low in my ribs and a tiny looseness, but the moment the throat-spike nudged up I said “I’m feeling tightness” out loud and it felt oddly procedural—my brain instantly turned it into interoceptive labeling, which dulled it a little then rebounded. I’m not sure that saying the phrase is actually helping—how is that supposed to interrupt the loop? I’m getting overwhelmed; can you verbally pace a really slow 4/6 with me and tell me exactly when to say the phrase if the tightness starts to rise?

Therapist: It's like your mind is always trying to solve the problem, even when you're trying to rest. I'm going to try to help you shift your focus, and help you stay with the breath without trying to analyze it.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Where does it feel like it's going? Is it a little cooler, or a little warmer?

Now, I want you to bring your attention to your throat. Can you feel any tension there? Is it a little tight, or a little loose?

As you're breathing, I want you to check in with your body. If you start to feel any tension, even a tiny bit, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice. Not when you first feel it, not when it's just a tiny bit, but when it's getting to the point where it's starting to feel like it's going to spike.

Let's try it. Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. If you start to feel any tension, don't try to push it away, just acknowledge it. Say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, and then take another breath. We'll try it again, and this time, I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath, and the phrase will come later.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to actually interrupt the contingency loop? When I turn the breath and the phrase into another task, it feels procedural and then the tightness rebounds. Can you verbally pace one very slow 4s in / 6s out for me with longer pauses and tell me exactly when to say "I'm feeling tightness" (for example, on exhale count 3), and what to do immediately after I say it? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to just that one guided breath together?

Therapist: Let's try a single, very slow breath together. I'll pace it, and I want you to follow my lead.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... (pause for 3 seconds)...4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Notice the sensation of the air leaving your body, and bring your attention to your throat. If you start to feel any tension, even a tiny bit, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice. Not when you first feel it, not when it's just a tiny bit, but when it's getting to the point where it's starting to feel like it's going to spike.

As soon as you say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness", I want you to take a tiny pause, and then gently bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath. Don't try to change the tension, just acknowledge it, and then let the breath happen.

Take this one step at a time. Focus on the breath, and the phrase will come later. We'll try it, and see what happens.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... (pause for 3 seconds)...4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying it on exhale count 3 supposed to actually interrupt the contingency loop instead of turning into another procedural task? I'll try it: inhale 1…2…3…4… exhale 1…2…3—(saying “I’m feeling tightness”)—4…5…6, and it felt oddly clinical and a little numbing. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to one very slow breath with you verbally pacing it and tell me exactly whether to pause, hold attention in my throat, or drop it to my lower ribs immediately after I say the phrase?

Therapist: Let's try one very slow breath together. I'll pace it, and I want you to follow my lead.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

I want you to bring your attention to your throat. As you exhale, start to focus on the sensation in your throat. If you start to feel any tension, even a tiny bit, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice.

Immediately after saying the phrase, I want you to drop your attention to your throat. Don't try to hold it, don't try to change it. Just let the sensation of the breath move down into your body, to your lower ribs.

Take this one step at a time. Focus on the breath, and the phrase will come later. We'll try it, and see what happens.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds)...and then exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is dropping attention to the throat supposed to interrupt the loop instead of just creating another micro-task my brain performs? I tried it just now: inhale 1…2…3…4… exhale 1…2…3 (said “I’m feeling tightness”)…then I consciously dropped attention and tried to let the breath move to my lower ribs, and there was a momentary easing that my mind immediately re-labeled as an "interoceptive shift," which paradoxically made the tightness snap back. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to one very slow 4s in / 6s out with you verbally pacing each count and telling me exactly when to say the phrase and whether to hold attention in the lower ribs or just let it be right after I say it?

Therapist: I'm going to pace each breath very slowly, and I want you to focus on the exact moment when I tell you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness".

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should be on your lower ribs, noticing any sensations there.

Exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... (pause for 5 seconds).

Now, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice.

Immediately after saying the phrase, I want you to try to drop your attention to your lower ribs. Don't try to hold it, don't try to change it. Just let the sensation be, without focusing on it.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should still be on your lower ribs, noticing any sensations there.

Exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Now, I want you to try to let the breath move down into your body, to your lower ribs, without focusing on it. Just let it be.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should be on the sensation of the breath, without focusing on your lower ribs.

Exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

We'll try to stay with this very slow pace, and see if we can help you interrupt the loop.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to actually interrupt the loop instead of just becoming another procedural task my brain performs? I can try the one very slow 4s in / 6s out with you verbally pacing each count, but tell me exactly when to say “I’m feeling tightness” (for example, exhale count 3) and whether I should drop attention into my lower ribs or just let it diffuse the moment I say it—otherwise my mind just relabels it and the tightness snaps back. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow to that single guided breath now and take it really, really slowly?

Therapist: I want to try a single, very slow breath with you, and I'll guide you through each count.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should be on your lower ribs, noticing any sensations there.

Now, exhale... 1... 2... 3... (pause for 3 seconds).

At this point, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice. This is a very specific moment, and I want you to focus on just this one phrase.

Immediately after saying the phrase, I want you to try to let the sensation of the tightness diffuse. Don't try to hold it, don't try to change it. Just let it be, without focusing on it.

Exhale... 4... 5... 6... (pause for 6 seconds).

Your attention should be on the sensation of the breath, without focusing on your lower ribs.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

We'll try to stay with this very slow pace, and see if we can help you interrupt the loop.

Note: I'm pacing the breath very slowly, but I want you to focus on the exact moment when I tell you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness". This is a specific moment, and I want you to focus on just that one phrase.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like another procedural task and I can't see how saying the phrase on exhale count 3 actually decouples the contingency loop. I'll try, but can you verbally pace one single 4s in / 6s out now and tell me exactly when to say "I'm feeling tightness" (say, on exhale count 3), and the precise micro-action after I say it — e.g., immediately drop attention to lower ribs and let the breath carry it, or simply let it diffuse without focusing — and then tell me when to resume normal breathing? I'm getting overwhelmed by all the instructions; can we slow way down and just do that one guided breath together with long pauses and calm pacing?

Therapist: Let's try a single, very slow breath together. I'll pace it, and I want you to focus on the exact moment when I tell you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness".

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should be on your lower ribs, noticing any sensations there.

Now, exhale... 1... 2... 3... (pause for 3 seconds).

At this point, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice.

(I want you to pause for a moment, and then speak the phrase. I'll wait for a moment before guiding you further.)

(Speaking the phrase is the only goal at this moment. Don't worry about what happens next. Just focus on saying the phrase.)

(I'll wait for another moment before guiding you further.)

Please, take your time. Just focus on saying the phrase.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that phrase supposed to decouple the loop? Okay, I'll try anyway: "I'm feeling tightness." Saying it felt performative, like interoceptive labeling, and it didn't really diffuse; my mind just turned it into another task. I'm getting overwhelmed—can you stay silent for ten seconds after I say it and then tell me exactly when to drop attention to my lower ribs?

Therapist: I'll wait in silence for 10 seconds after you say the phrase.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—what am I supposed to do during that silence? Saying the phrase felt procedural, like interoceptive labeling, and the quiet just amplified the tightness instead of diffusing it. I'm getting overwhelmed; can you now verbally guide one single 4s in / 6s out breath, tell me to say "I'm feeling tightness" on exhale count 3, then actually stay silent for ten seconds, and after that tell me exactly when to drop attention to my lower ribs? Can we slow the pace and do it together right now?

Therapist: I want to try a single, very slow breath with you, and I'll guide you through each count.

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

Your attention should be on your lower ribs, noticing any sensations there.

Now, exhale... 1... 2... 3... (pause for 3 seconds).

At this point, I want you to say the phrase "I'm feeling tightness" out loud, in a soft voice. This is a very specific moment, and I want you to focus on just this one phrase.

(Silence for 10 seconds)

Now, I want you to drop your attention to your lower ribs. Don't try to hold it, don't try to change it. Just let the sensation be, without focusing on it. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving down into your body, carrying the tightness away from your lower ribs.

Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 4 seconds).

We'll try to stay with this very slow pace, and see if we can help you interrupt the loop.

Patient: I tried that sequence—said the phrase on exhale, stayed in the silence, and consciously dropped attention to my lower ribs, and there was a millisecond of ease before my meta-cognitive apparatus re-framed it as interoceptive labeling and the tightness snapped back. I'm confused by the instruction to "let the breath carry the tightness away"—is that a visualization, an attentional shift, or a specific somatic cue (soften jaw, relax throat, lengthen exhale)? How am I supposed to do that mid-spike without it becoming another procedural task? I'm getting overwhelmed; can you verbally pace one single 4s in / 6s out with calm counting, tell me to say the phrase on exhale count 3, then stay silent for ten seconds, and then give the exact micro-action I should take immediately after (for example: relax jaw + drop attention to lower ribs and keep breathing)?
