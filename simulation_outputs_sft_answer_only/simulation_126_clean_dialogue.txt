Patient: Lately I've been avoiding friends because social situations make me panicky — it's gotten worse since I lost my steady art gig. I mostly keep to myself and my OCD makes me overanalyze everything, so I end up cancelling plans. I don't really see how talking about this will help, so... how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're skeptical about how talking about this might help. But, for you, it's about more than just the symptoms or the situation. It's about how this is affecting your connection to what matters most to you.

Can you tell me more about what it is about social situations that makes you panicky? Is it the pressure to perform, the uncertainty of how others will react, or something else? And how does your OCD influence these feelings, specifically?

Patient: It's mostly the uncertainty — not knowing how people will react makes me freeze, and I'm terrified I'll say something stupid or do the wrong thing. My OCD turns that into nonstop "what if" loops where I rehearse everything, obsess over tiny details, and if I can't make it feel safe I just cancel. I've tried the "just go" approach before and it doesn't work — how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: Those "what if" loops can be really overwhelming. It's like your mind is constantly asking questions, and you can't shake off the feeling of uncertainty.

One thing that might be helpful to explore is how your fear of uncertainty is connected to your values. What is it about being in social situations that's most important to you? Is it being able to connect with others, share your ideas, or just feel accepted? Sometimes, when we're stuck in these loops of fear, we lose sight of what's truly important to us.

Let's try to explore this a bit more. Can you think of a time when you were in a social situation, and for a brief moment, you felt like you could just be yourself? What was going on, and what made that moment feel different?

Patient: There was this one tiny gallery opening with two friends where everyone was looking at the art, so the attention felt on the work, not on me, and I could actually talk about ideas instead of spiraling. The shared interest and that predictable focus made it low-stakes and more manageable. I get why you're asking, but I don't see how remembering that is supposed to stop the panic when it feels different almost every other time.

Therapist: That sounds like a really small window of comfort. It's like you found a tiny patch of land where the uncertainty wasn't as overwhelming, and you could focus on the art and your conversation with your friends.

It's not about remembering that specific moment, but about seeing if there's a pattern. Sometimes, when we're in these "what if" loops, we're not just thinking about the immediate situation, but about all the things that could go wrong. It's like our mind is trying to protect us, but it's also making it harder to take action.

Let's try something different. Instead of thinking about all the things that could go wrong, can you think about what would need to happen for you to feel safe in that gallery opening situation again? What would need to be true for you to feel like you could just be yourself, without all the uncertainty?

Patient: I guess I’d need more predictability — knowing who’s going to be there, what the vibe will be like, and a clear escape plan if I start to feel overwhelmed. Situations where the focus is on the art, not me, and smaller groups help too. But honestly, how is making a checklist of “needs” supposed to stop my brain from spiraling when I’ve prepped before and it still fell apart?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to break down the situation into smaller, manageable parts, and that's a good start. Predictability is a big one for you, and being able to control some of the variables can help.

It's not about making a checklist, but about understanding what your brain needs to feel safe and in control. When you've tried to prep before and it still fell apart, it's like your brain is saying, "I don't trust you to handle this on your own." It's like you're trying to outrun the panic, but it's still catching up.

Let's try to explore this a bit more. Can you think about what would happen if, instead of trying to control everything, you were to let go of the need to be in control? What if, instead of trying to prep and plan, you were to focus on just being present in the moment?

Patient: Letting go sounds impossible — my OCD screams that if I don't control everything something bad will happen, and when I try to be present I just get more aware of the panic. I've tried mindfulness before and it didn't stop the spirals, so how is this supposed to be different? If "being present" is the goal, what would that actually look like in a real social moment for me?

Therapist: It's like your OCD is a constant companion, always whispering in your ear, and you're trying to quiet it down, but it's hard to make progress when it's so loud.

Mindfulness is often misunderstood as being about being present, but it's really about being aware of your experiences, thoughts, and feelings, without judgment. It's not about stopping the spirals or erasing your panic, but about noticing them, and then being able to observe them without getting caught up in them.

In a real social moment, being present might look like noticing your breath, your body, or your surroundings, without getting caught up in thoughts about how others are reacting or what you're doing wrong. It's not about ignoring the panic, but about learning to see it as a sensation, rather than a reality.

Can you think of a simple, everyday experience where you're aware of your surroundings without getting caught up in thoughts or worries? Like when you're walking, or eating, or even just sitting? What is it about that experience that makes it feel more present, and what might you be able to apply to a social situation?

Patient: Yeah — when I'm making coffee in the morning I can actually pay attention to the grinder, the smell, the heat of the mug in my hands, and for that minute my brain quiets and the "what if" loops stop. That kind of sensory focus feels real and manageable. But in a crowded room, noticing my breath just makes me notice the panic more and then it spirals — I've tried this before, so how is focusing on sensations supposed to stop the spiral when it's loud and unpredictable?

Therapist: It's like the sensory focus you experience while making coffee is a tiny island of calm in a storm, and it's helping you connect with your body and the present moment. But when you try to apply that same focus in a crowded room, it's like you're trying to anchor a boat in a hurricane - it's just not working.

The reason you might not be seeing results is that your brain is already primed to respond to the panic. It's like your brain is saying, "Ah, I know this feeling, it's the same old panic. I'll just take care of it right away." And then it starts spiraling again.

It's not that focusing on sensations isn't helpful, it's just that it's not a magic bullet. It's more like a small tool that can help you navigate the storm. You need to find a way to connect with your body and the present moment that feels more grounded, more stable.

Can you think about what's different about the sensory focus you experience while making coffee? Is it the specific sensations you're noticing, or is it the way you're noticing them? Is it more about being present, or is it more about being engaged with your body? What if you could find a way to bring that same sense of engagement and presence to a crowded room?

Patient: I think the coffee thing works because it's predictable and automatic — the steps, the smell, the warmth — and I’m doing one small, familiar task so my mind can actually focus. In social settings everything’s uncertain and my attention gets yanked into future-focused “what ifs,” so it’s not just noticing sensations, it’s being engaged in a safe, knowable activity. Fine, but how am I supposed to recreate that in a party when my brain’s already on high alert — what would that actually look like without feeling forced or fake?

Therapist: It sounds like the coffee-making ritual is a carefully crafted system that works for you, and it's not just about the sensations, but about the entire experience being predictable, automatic, and safe. You're doing one small, familiar task, and it's allowing your mind to focus on the present moment.

In a party setting, it's like trying to replicate that same system, but with all the added uncertainty and unpredictability of a social situation. It's like trying to build a sandcastle on a beach with waves crashing against it - it's hard to maintain focus and stability.

I wouldn't suggest trying to force it or making it feel fake. That's not what we're aiming for. Instead, let's explore the idea of finding a small, low-stakes way to connect with your body and the present moment, even in a crowded room. It's not about recreating the exact experience of making coffee, but about finding a way to engage with your senses in a way that feels more natural and effortless.

Can you think of any other activities or experiences that might help you connect with your body and the present moment in a similar way to making coffee? Maybe it's something you do when you're driving, or eating, or even just walking? What is it about those experiences that might help you find a way to connect with your body and the present moment in a crowded room?

Patient: Yeah — as an artist I could see bringing a tiny sketchbook and doing one‑minute thumbnails, or carrying a smooth stone or ring to rub, or even taking a quick photograph of the room — small, familiar actions that give my hands something predictable to do. Those things feel useful because they’re sensory, automatic, and low‑stakes — they recreate that “safe task” vibe of the coffee ritual. But honestly, how is doing a sketch or fiddling with a stone supposed to stop my brain once it’s already spiraling and everyone’s watching?

Therapist: It sounds like bringing a tiny sketchbook and doing one-minute thumbnails is a great way to create a sense of control and focus, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. The act of creating something, even if it's just for a short time, can help distract you from the panic and give you a sense of accomplishment.

I wouldn't suggest that doing a sketch or fiddling with a stone is going to completely stop your brain from spiraling, but it might be able to buy you a small window of time to calm down and think more clearly. It's like having a tiny toolkit to help you navigate a difficult situation.

In a crowded room, especially when everyone's watching, it's not about finding a way to stop the panic completely, but about finding a way to cope with it in a way that makes you feel more manageable. It's like learning to surf a wave - you can't stop the wave, but you can learn to ride it and stay on top.

Can you think of any other small, low-stakes actions that might help you cope with the panic in a crowded room? Maybe it's something that involves movement, or something that involves creating a sense of distance or separation from the others. What if you could find a way to use one of those actions to create a small sense of control and calm, even in the midst of chaos?

Patient: I could see doing a quick outside walk or standing by the edge of the room near an exit, keeping one earbud in with low-volume music, or having a tiny scripted line ready to bow out—plus the sketchbook or stone still feel useful. I’ve tried stepping out or texting a friend and sometimes it gives me a minute, but a lot of times the panic just comes back harder. Honestly—how is picking one of those supposed to actually stop the spiral once I’m already locked into it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're exploring different ways to create a sense of distance or separation from the situation, whether that's by stepping outside, texting a friend, or using music to create a calming atmosphere. These small actions can help you feel more in control and prepared to deal with the panic.

I wouldn't suggest that these actions will completely stop the spiral, but rather that they might help you develop a sense of resilience and coping skills. It's like having a toolkit with you, but it's not going to fix the problem itself.

When you're already locked into a spiral, it's like trying to hold water in your hands - it's hard to stop the flow. But what you can do is try to redirect the flow, or at least create a small obstacle that makes it harder for the panic to intensify.

Can you think of any specific things that make the spiral worse for you? Is it the attention from others, the feeling of being trapped, or something else? What if you could find a way to use one of the actions we've discussed to create a small obstacle or redirect the flow of your panic?

Patient: Mostly it's the attention and the feeling of being trapped — if I notice eyes on me or there's no clear exit my heart spikes and the "what if" loop takes over. Loud, chaotic rooms, alcohol lowering my control, and the fear of being judged make it worse. I get that stepping outside or sketching might interrupt it for a minute, but honestly — that just delays the panic and sometimes makes it come back harder; how is any of this really supposed to stop the spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're dealing with a really complex situation, and it's not just about the physical act of doing something to calm down, but about managing the emotional and psychological response to the situation.

It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, waiting for the worst-case scenario to happen, and when it does, it's like a switch flips and you're in panic mode. The attention from others, the feeling of being trapped, and the fear of being judged are all huge triggers for you, and they can escalate the situation really quickly.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this is hard, and it's not going to be easy to change. But what I want to emphasize is that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

It's not about finding a magic solution to stop the spiral completely, but about learning how to manage it, and finding ways to cope with the anxiety and panic. It's like developing a new skill - it takes practice, patience, and time, but it's possible.

Can I ask you one more thing? What do you hope to achieve by trying to stop the spiral? Is it to be able to go to social events without feeling overwhelmed, or is it to be able to feel more confident in yourself? What is it that you want to gain from this process?

Patient: I want to be able to go to social events without freezing up — to keep my friendships and not keep missing chances to show my work. I want the OCD to stop running everything so I can feel more confident and not always cancel or hide. But I've said that before and nothing's changed, so... how is talking about it here actually going to get me any of that?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated and skeptical about how this process might help you. You're right, it's not a magic fix, and it's not going to solve everything overnight. But I want to tell you that this conversation is not about finding a quick fix or a magic solution. It's about exploring your feelings, your thoughts, and your experiences in a safe and supportive space.

By talking about your OCD and your struggles, you're not just sharing your story; you're also gaining a deeper understanding of yourself and your experiences. You're learning to see your OCD as a complex system that's driving your behaviors, rather than just a simple problem to be solved.

It's also about finding ways to make small, incremental changes that can add up over time. It's not about trying to change everything at once, but about taking tiny steps towards greater confidence and self-acceptance.

I'm not going to promise you that talking about this will solve everything right away. But I will say that it's a crucial step in the process. It's a chance for you to explore your feelings, to challenge your thoughts, and to find new ways of coping with your OCD.

So, I want to ask you one more time: are you willing to take this first step, even if it feels small or uncertain? Are you willing to explore your feelings, your thoughts, and your experiences in this safe and supportive space?

Patient: Fine — I'll try one small step, but I'm skeptical. I'll bring the sketchbook to a small get‑together and do one‑minute thumbnails, but I need you to help me map out exactly what to do if the panic spikes — not vague mindfulness stuff, concrete actions and how we'll tell if it's working. And honestly, if this starts to feel useless I'm going to get frustrated and say so — so tell me straight: how is that actually supposed to stop me from canceling?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to take a small step. I'm not going to promise you that it will be easy, but I will help you create a plan that's concrete and actionable.

Here's what I want you to do: before the get-together, let's brainstorm some concrete actions you can take to help manage your panic. I want you to think about what specific things make the panic worse for you. Is it the attention from others? The feeling of being trapped? The fear of being judged?

Let's write down some specific things that might trigger the panic, and then we can come up with some concrete actions you can take to help manage those triggers. For example, if the attention from others makes you panic, we might brainstorm some ways to subtly avoid eye contact, or to distract yourself from the attention.

Once we have a list of concrete actions, we can talk about how you'll know if it's working. Is it when you feel less anxious? When you're able to focus on your work? When you're able to interact with others without feeling overwhelmed?

As for the question of whether this will stop you from canceling, the answer is: we'll know if it's working if you're able to show up to the get-together and engage with others without canceling. We'll also know if it's working if you're able to take breaks and do your one-minute thumbnails when you need to.

So, here's what I want you to do: I want you to write down some specific things that make the panic worse for you, and then I want us to brainstorm some concrete actions you can take to help manage those triggers. Are you ready to do that?

Patient: Okay—this already feels like a lot, but here goes.

Triggers (specific): eyes/attention on me, no clear exit/feeling trapped, loud/chaotic rooms, alcohol lowering my control, unexpected questions or being put on the spot, having to make small talk, not knowing who’ll be there.

Concrete actions (step‑by‑step if panic spikes):
- Before: pick a spot near an exit when I arrive, set a time limit (e.g., 45 min), bring sketchbook + 1 smooth stone, one earbud with low-volume music, and text a friend a time‑check plan.
- If I notice anxiety rising (rate it quickly 0–10): do one-minute thumbnails for 60 seconds while standing at the edge; if that doesn’t drop it by 2 points in 5 minutes, step outside for a 3–5 minute walk and breathe; use the exit script: “I’m going to get some air—be right back” (or leave if I need to).
- If I’m immobilized (can’t speak, dizzy, shaking), bail—text the friend code word to come get me or just go home. No guilt.

How we’ll tell if it’s working: I make it to the event; I stay at least my set time limit; I do the thumbnail at least once when anxious; my peak anxiety is lower (self-rated) or the spike finishes faster than before. If none of that happens, I’ll say it’s useless and we’ll tweak.

Fine—help me pick the exact scripts and a realistic time limit, and don’t give me vague mindfulness platitudes. How is that supposed to help if the panic’s already in full force?

Therapist: I'm glad you've taken the time to brainstorm concrete actions. Now, let's refine them to make sure they're specific, actionable, and realistic.

First, regarding the exit script, "I'm going to get some air—be right back" is a good starting point. However, it's essential to consider the context and potential implications. You might want to add a brief explanation or a transition phrase to make it clear that you're not abandoning the event, but rather taking a brief break to recharge. For example:

"I'm going to take a short break and get some fresh air. I'll be right back, and I'm excited to catch up with everyone."

Regarding the time limit, 45 minutes is a reasonable starting point. However, it's essential to consider the length of the event and your personal comfort level. If you're attending a shorter event, 45 minutes might be too short, while a longer event might be too long. You might want to start with a shorter time limit, like 30 minutes, and adjust it based on your experience.

For the earbud and low-volume music, you might want to consider using a music app or a playlist specifically designed to help you focus or relax. Some apps, like Calm or Headspace, offer guided meditations and relaxing music that can help you calm down.

Now, let's discuss the anxiety rating system. It's essential to make sure it's clear and concise. You might want to consider using a simple rating scale, like:

* 0-10: I'm feeling completely calm
* 0-10: I'm feeling anxious, with 0 being no anxiety and 10 being extreme anxiety

This will help you quickly rate your anxiety level and make adjustments accordingly.

Lastly, regarding the self-rated anxiety scale, you might want to consider using a more specific measurement. Instead of just rating your anxiety, you could use a scale that measures your physical symptoms, such as heart rate, breathing, or tension. This can help you track your physical response to anxiety and make more informed decisions.

How do these suggestions sound? Are there any specific concerns or questions you'd like to address?

Patient: Okay... this is a lot but I’ll try.

30 minutes feels more realistic. Here are concrete rules I want—tell me if they're realistic:
- Anxiety scale: 0–10. If I hit ≥7: stop what I'm doing, do 60‑second thumbnails while standing near the exit.  
- If after 5 minutes it hasn't dropped by ≥2 points → step outside for 3–5 minutes.  
- If ≥9 or I'm dizzy/shaking/immobilized → text friend code word and leave or get picked up.

Exact scripts I want to use (short, neutral, not apologetic):
- Quick break: “Excuse me — I’m going to get some fresh air. I’ll be right back.”  
- If someone asks why I’m leaving: “I’m not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit.”  
- If I need to leave for good: “Sorry, I have to head home.”

Does that seem realistic? And seriously — how is any of that supposed to help when I’m already frozen and someone asks me a question? Can we practice those exact lines now?

Therapist: I'll provide feedback on the concrete rules you've established.

The anxiety scale and response to it are realistic. It's a simple, yet effective system that allows you to quickly assess your level of anxiety and take action accordingly. The threshold of ≥7 is a good starting point, as it's high enough to trigger a response but not so high that it's overly restrictive.

The 5-minute waiting period and stepping outside for 3-5 minutes are also realistic. It allows you to take a break, recharge, and assess your anxiety level again before deciding on the next course of action.

The exit scripts you've chosen are neutral, concise, and not apologetic. They get the point across without drawing attention to your anxiety or leaving you feeling vulnerable.

As for practicing the exact lines now, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's start with the quick break script: "Excuse me — I'm going to get some fresh air. I'll be right back." How does that feel? Is there anything you'd like to change or modify?

Now, let's practice a scenario where someone asks you why you're leaving. Remember, your response is: "I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit." Go ahead and take a deep breath. You can respond with this line, and I'll respond as the other person in the scenario. Are you ready?

Patient: Okay. “Excuse me — I’m going to get some fresh air. I’ll be right back.” If someone asks why I’m leaving: “I’m not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit.” Say the other person now and actually push me — and honestly, how is that supposed to help when I’m completely frozen?

Therapist: Here's the scenario:

You: Excuse me — I'm going to get some fresh air. I'll be right back.

Other person: Hey, wait a minute! What's going on? Why are you suddenly leaving?

Your response: I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit.

Other person: (getting more insistent) Come on, what's wrong? Is everything okay? Did I do something to offend you? Can you at least tell me what's going on?

Now it's your turn. How do you respond? Remember, you're trying to keep it brief and neutral. You can use the "I'm not feeling great" line, but try to avoid giving too much away. Just respond as you would in a real situation.

Patient: "I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit."

But honestly, I don't follow how that helps — when I'm frozen I can't always even get the words out, and saying that doesn't feel like it would stop the panic or the staring. How is that supposed to actually work when I'm already locked up?

Therapist: I see your point now. You're right, saying "I'm not feeling great" or "I need to step out for a bit" might not be enough to help you in a situation where you're already frozen and anxious. It's not a magic solution that will instantly stop the panic or the staring.

In that case, let's try to think of this as a small, tiny step. It's a tiny script that you can use to buy yourself a tiny bit of time, to give you a tiny bit of space to breathe. It's not a solution that will magically fix everything, but it might give you a tiny bit of time to collect yourself, to take a deep breath, or to do something else that helps you cope with the anxiety.

It's not about avoiding the other person's questions or concerns, but about finding a way to acknowledge them while also taking care of yourself. It's a small, small step, but it might be enough to help you feel a tiny bit more in control.

Can I ask, are you willing to try using this script, even if it's just as a tiny, tiny experiment? I'm not asking you to believe it will work, but just to try it out and see what happens.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try the script as a tiny experiment, but I’m skeptical and honestly not sure I follow how that’s supposed to help when I’m frozen. Can we practice more realistic interruptions — like someone grabbing my arm or pressing me for details — and agree on a silent backup I can do if I can’t get the words out (a hand signal, moving toward the exit, or a preset text)? If I’m going to try this, I need that rehearsed, and I’m going to tell you straight if it still feels useless.

Therapist: I'll start by simulating a more realistic interruption, and we can practice the script together. Remember, the goal is to find a way to cope with the anxiety and buy yourself some time, not to avoid the other person's questions or concerns.

Here's the scenario:

You're standing at a party, and someone grabs your arm and starts pulling you towards the food table. They're asking you, "Hey, where's your partner? I haven't seen them all night. Are they okay?"

In this situation, you can try using the script "I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit." But what if you can't get the words out, or if it's not enough to stop the other person from asking more questions? That's where the backup plan comes in.

Let's agree on a silent backup signal that you can use if you need to get away from the conversation quickly. For example, you can agree to do a small hand gesture, like waving your hand in a circular motion or making a "V" shape with your fingers. This will give you a non-verbal cue to get away from the conversation and find a safe space.

We can also agree on a preset text that you can send to your friend if you need to leave quickly. This way, you can take a deep breath, send the text, and leave the conversation without drawing attention to yourself.

How does that sound? Are you willing to try the script and the backup plan, and see how it works for you?

Patient: Fine — I’ll try the script and the backup, but honestly this is draining and I’m still skeptical. My silent signal: a quick tuck of my hand to my ear/lobe (subtle), preset text: “Can you come get me?” and I’ll move toward the exit as soon as I make the signal. Now actually roleplay the grab/insistent person and push me — and while you do, tell me plainly how that ear-tuck is supposed to help when I’m completely frozen.

Therapist: I'll roleplay the grab and insistent person. Remember, the goal is to find a way to cope with the anxiety and buy yourself some time.

You're standing at a party, and someone grabs your arm and starts pulling you towards the food table. They're asking you, "Hey, where's your partner? I haven't seen them all night. Are they okay?"

They start to pull you closer, their eyes locked on yours, and you can feel their urgency. You try to respond with the script, "I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit," but your voice is shaking and you can't get the words out.

Suddenly, you feel a surge of panic and your mind goes blank. You're frozen, and you can't move or speak. That's when you make your silent signal, a quick tuck of your hand to your ear/lobe.

Now, I need to be honest with you. The ear-tuck is not a magic solution that will suddenly give you the confidence to speak up or make you less anxious. It's a small, subtle gesture that might give you a tiny bit of time to collect yourself, but it's not going to fix everything.

In this situation, you might be better off just taking a deep breath, stepping back, and creating some distance between yourself and the other person. You can do this by moving towards the exit, as you mentioned, or by taking a few steps back and giving yourself some space.

Let's try this again, and I'll give you a bit more time to respond. You're still standing at the party, and someone is pulling you towards the food table. You try to respond with the script, but you're still feeling anxious and unsure.

What do you do now? Do you try to respond, or do you take a different action?

Patient: I’d try the ear‑tuck as my cue to move away — physically step back toward the exit while I start the 60‑second thumbnail with my other hand, and hit send on the preset text as I go if I can’t get words out. But honestly, I don’t really follow how that’s supposed to stop the panic when I’m already frozen — it feels like one more thing to remember when my energy’s sapped. Okay, push me again in the roleplay and make it worse this time so I can actually try the motion and see if it helps or if it’s useless.

Therapist: Let's try again. You're standing at the party, and someone grabs your arm and starts pulling you towards the food table. They're asking you, "Hey, where's your partner? I haven't seen them all night. Are they okay? We need to talk about this now."

They start to pull you closer, their eyes locked on yours, and you can feel their urgency. They're getting louder, more insistent, and you can feel your anxiety spiking. You try to respond with the script, but your voice is shaking and you can't get the words out.

Suddenly, you feel a surge of panic and your mind goes blank. You're frozen, and you can't move or speak. You're starting to feel like you're going to pass out. That's when you make your silent signal, a quick tuck of your hand to your ear/lobe, and you start to move back towards the exit.

As you move, you start to do the 60-second thumbnail with your other hand, trying to keep your movements quick and smooth. You're not sure if you're doing it right, but you're trying to create some space and calm yourself down.

You hit send on the preset text, "Can you come get me?" and hope that someone will see it and come to your aid.

But the person who grabbed your arm isn't letting go. They're still pulling you towards the food table, their eyes never leaving yours. You're starting to feel like you're trapped, like you're going to be dragged towards something you don't want to do.

What do you do now? Do you try to break free, or do you keep trying to move back towards the exit?

Patient: I try to break free — plant my feet, put my free hand up between us to create space and, even if my voice trembles, say the line: “I’m not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit,” while stepping back toward the exit. If they keep holding on, I keep moving my body away (turning my shoulder, backing up) and start the 60‑second thumbnail with my other hand as a distraction; I’ve already hit send on the preset text so help’s on the way if I can’t get out. If I literally can’t speak or they won’t let go, I escalate to the code word (they come get me) or just say, “I’m leaving,” and leave — no explaining. I don’t know if that’ll actually work when I’m frozen — it still feels like a lot to do when my brain’s shut down — but at least it’s a plan I can try and tweak.

Therapist: You try to break free, planting your feet and putting your free hand up between you and the person holding onto you. You say the line, "I'm not feeling great, I need to step out for a bit," even though your voice is trembling, and you take a step back towards the exit.

The person holding onto you doesn't let go, but you keep moving your body away, turning your shoulder and backing up. You start the 60-second thumbnail with your other hand, trying to create a distraction.

As you move, you glance down at your phone and see that you've hit send on the preset text, "Can you come get me?" You feel a surge of hope - help is on the way, and you just need to hold on for a minute or two.

The person holding onto you is still grasping at you, but you're trying to keep your distance, your eyes fixed on the exit. You're not sure how much longer you can keep this up, but you're trying to stall, to give yourself time to think.

Suddenly, you hear a noise behind you. You turn to see a figure approaching, and you feel a surge of relief. It's your friend, come to get you. You're going to make it out of this situation after all.

But as you turn to leave, you realize that the person holding onto you is still standing there, their eyes fixed on you with a look of desperation. You can see the panic in their eyes, and you know that they're not going to give up easily.

What do you do now? Do you try to shake them off, or do you keep moving towards the exit?

Patient: I keep moving toward the exit — not trying to yank them off, just turning my shoulder, planting my feet, and using my free hand to create space while saying, louder and firmer if I have to, “I’m leaving.” If they still won’t let go I call out for help or use the preset text/code word so my friend comes; if it’s safe, I also push my elbow back to slip free. 

But honestly, I don’t know if I’ll manage that when I’m frozen — it all feels like too many steps when my brain shuts down and I’m drained. Can we make the “I’m leaving” line sound firm but natural and roleplay it again with them not letting go so I can try?

Therapist: Let's try it again. You're still standing at the party, and the person holding onto you is still grasping at you. They're not letting go, and you're trying to create some space between you.

You plant your feet, turn your shoulder, and use your free hand to create some distance. You say the line, "I'm leaving," louder and firmer than before. You mean it, and you're trying to convey a sense of finality.

The person holding onto you doesn't let go, but you can see the panic in their eyes. They're not sure what to do, and they're starting to realize that they're not in control.

Suddenly, you feel a surge of adrenaline. You remember the preset text, "Can you come get me?" and you hit send. You're not sure if it will work, but you're willing to try anything.

As you wait for a response, you try to slip free. You push your elbow back, and you feel a small movement. It's not much, but it's something. You're trying to create a small opening, a small chance to escape.

The person holding onto you is still grasping, but you can see the uncertainty in their eyes. They're not sure what to do. They're not sure how to let go.

What do you do now? Do you try to push free, or do you wait for a response to the preset text?

Patient: I’d keep moving toward the exit—turn my shoulder, plant my feet, push my elbow back if I have to, and say “I’m leaving” louder and firmer. If I’m too frozen to get words out I’d do the ear‑tuck and start the thumbnail while backing up, and I’ll hit send on the preset text immediately. If they still won’t let go I call out for help or escalate the code word so someone comes.

But I’m not sure I follow how any of that will actually work when my brain shuts down mid‑panic — it all feels like too many steps at once and I’m already worn out. Can we run that roleplay one more time with you actually pulling harder and me practicing the firm “I’m leaving” line so I can see if it lands?

Patient: I... I'm not sure I follow — that sounded like a loop of words about changing my mindset, but not one clear thing I can actually do when I'm frozen. How is repeating that supposed to help me in the middle of a panic? 

Can we drop the jargon and do the roleplay you promised — you pull harder, I try the firm “I’m leaving” line and the ear‑tuck backup, and you tell me, plainly, what to do if I can't get the words out?

Patient: I can't make sense of that last message — it just sounded like more jargon and loops and it's getting draining and confusing. Drop the theory: please roleplay the person grabbing me again, actually pull harder so I can try the firm “I’m leaving” line and the ear‑tuck motion, and tell me in one plain sentence what to do if I literally can't get the words out (no explanations, just the exact action). How is that going to help when I'm frozen?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it again, low energy: I tuck my hand to my ear, start the 60‑second thumbnail with my other hand, step back toward the exit and say, even if it trembles, “I’m leaving.”  

If I literally can’t get the words out: tuck your hand to your ear, move toward the exit, and send the preset text.  

Now actually roleplay the grab and pull harder so I can try that motion for real — and be blunt: this is draining, so don’t make it gentle.

Patient: I can't make sense of that last wall of text — it's just noise and it's really draining.

Do the roleplay now, blunt and forceful: grab my arm, pull harder, and say something insistent like, “Where’s your partner? Why are you leaving? What’s wrong with you?” Keep pushing so I can try the motion. Reminder of the single backup action if I literally can't speak: tuck hand to ear, move toward the exit, and send the preset text. Go.
