Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this recursive pattern of hypercritical self-evaluation—every perceived failure gets amplified into evidence of some intrinsic flaw. I’m in my late twenties, a student, and recent job instability has just magnified that old, internalized narrative from being bullied in school, which now sabotages my social confidence. I mostly intellectualize it—constructing theories and semantic frameworks about why it persists—because actually sitting with the shame or fear feels intolerably vulnerable.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the depth of this struggle, especially when it feels like it's been simmering beneath the surface for so long. Can you tell me more about what it's like to intellectualize this stuff? It feels like you're trying to protect yourself from the discomfort of those feelings, but at the same time, it's also like you're trying to prove to yourself that you're not actually vulnerable. Is that a fair observation?

Patient: Yeah, that feels fair. I tend to deploy this metacognitive toolkit—abstract theories, attributional analyses, and schematic narratives—as a way to create distance from the raw affective stuff. If I actually sit with the shame or the fear it feels destabilizing, so I translate it into causal chains and hypotheses instead. It gives me a sense of control and even a performative proof that I’m competent, but paradoxically it also prevents me from feeling or resolving the underlying insecurity.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this intellectualizing process is helping you maintain a sense of control, but it's also creating a barrier between you and the emotions. You're using your theories and frameworks to keep the shame and fear at arm's length, but that's also preventing you from experiencing any potential resolution or healing.

Can you think of a moment, even a small moment, where you might have let your guard down and sat with one of these feelings, even just for a second? Maybe it was a fleeting glance in a mirror, a passing comment from someone, or a particularly difficult memory. What happened in that moment, if anything?

Patient: There was this one time after a rejection email — I went into the bathroom and caught my reflection, and for maybe ten seconds my chest tightened and my throat closed. Instead of staying with that constriction I immediately narrated it: "this is evidence of failure," drafted a theoretical causal chain about learned helplessness and social conditioning, and started dissecting past bullying episodes. So the feeling was there, but I metabolized it into analysis before it could translate into anything like sadness or fear I could actually sit with.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that you caught yourself immediately after that moment of constriction. It sounds like your mind is very quick to defend against that feeling, to turn it into something more manageable.

It's also telling that you said you "metabolized" the feeling into analysis, that you broke it down into smaller parts that you could control. That's a very characteristic response, especially for someone who's used to intellectualizing their emotions.

But can you think of what would happen if you let that feeling sit there for just a little bit longer, without immediately trying to analyze it? Maybe it's just a tiny, tiny step, but what if you allowed yourself to feel that tightness in your chest, that constriction in your throat, without trying to rationalize it or turn it into a theory? What do you think might happen, if you just let it be for a moment?

Patient: If I let it sit, I imagine that tightness could diffuse into a more specific affect—maybe shame opening into sadness or grief—and I'd become more aware of somatic sensations instead of launching into a narrative. Theoretically that could permit some affective processing and weaken the automatic loop of hypercritical self-talk, maybe even leave me feeling a bit lighter or less performatively competent. But honestly, picturing that makes me a little panicky—I can already see my brain latching onto analysis to avoid the feeling, and I'm not sure how to tolerate that without immediately verbalizing a theory.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught between the desire to experience a different emotional response and the fear of your mind racing to analyze and defend against it. The idea of feeling shame or sadness without immediately turning it into a narrative or a theory seems daunting, especially since you're worried about your brain's response.

It's interesting that you mention feeling "panicky" at the prospect of allowing yourself to feel without analysis. That suggests that you're deeply invested in maintaining this particular way of coping, even if it's not necessarily helping you in the long run.

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to stop analyzing your emotions and just allow yourself to feel? Is there a part of you that's curious about what it would be like to experience those emotions in a more direct way, or is it more of a survival instinct, a way to avoid getting overwhelmed?

Patient: It's definitely both. There's a small, tentative curiosity—I imagine that if I let the feeling sit it might dissipate into something like grief and actually relieve that constant cognitive churn, maybe even soften the self-flagellation. But the survival instinct is louder: if I stop analyzing I fear the shame will cascade, I'll feel exposed or immobilized, so my brain preemptively turns it into a tidy theory to contain it. I don't know how to tolerate that split without slipping back into narration, and just saying that makes me a little on edge.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught between a desire to break free from the constant analysis and the fear of being overwhelmed by the emotions that come with it. The curiosity about what it would be like to experience grief or sadness in a more direct way is present, but it's being held back by the fear of the unknown.

It's interesting that you mention the self-flagellation, which suggests that there's a sense of internalized criticism that's already present, even if it's being masked by the analysis. Can you think about what might happen if you were to acknowledge that criticism, even if it's just for a moment, without immediately turning it into a theory? Maybe it's just a tiny step, but what if you allowed yourself to feel that criticism, to own it, without trying to rationalize it or turn it into something else?

Also, I want to gently suggest that your mention of being "on edge" might be a sign that you're close to a breakthrough. It's not uncommon for people to feel a bit uneasy or nervous when they're on the cusp of experiencing something new, especially if it's related to their emotions. Would you be willing to take a small risk and see where this feeling takes you?

Patient: Okay — I can try, tentatively, as an experiment. Maybe start with something tiny: I sit with the throat-tightness for like thirty seconds while you guide me, though I can already hear my inner commentator drafting causal models to avoid it. Part of me is genuinely curious that it might soften into sadness or relief, but I'm also on edge and a little panicky about being stuck in it — can you help me stay with it without letting me narrate the whole time?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it one small step at a time. I'm here to support you, and I'll do my best to help you stay with the feeling without letting your inner commentator take over.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your throat. Can you feel the tightness there? It's a small, subtle sensation, but it's present. I want you to focus on that sensation, just for a moment.

Notice how your body is responding to that tightness. Are there any other physical sensations that are connected to it? A lump in your throat, a sense of constriction in your chest? Just acknowledge those sensations, without trying to analyze them or change them.

For now, just stay with the tightness in your throat. Don't try to do anything with it, just observe it. You can think about it, but don't try to think about it in a particular way. Just be with it, as it is.

Take another deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. Notice how your body is feeling, just for a moment. Are there any changes in your body, or are the sensations still present?

Remember, this is just a small experiment. We're not trying to do anything dramatic or intense. We're just taking a tiny step, to see what might happen. So, take your time, and just be with the feeling.

Patient: Yeah—I noticed the tightness, and there was also this dull, spreading pressure in my chest like a knot. For a few seconds something that felt like sadness actually surfaced, a warm-ish welling, but almost immediately my inner commentator started generating causal narratives about bullying and failure. I'm already a little shaky and tempted to explain it away—can you help keep me anchored there, maybe with a simple prompt or reminder to breathe, so I don't default back into analysis?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to grasp onto that small well of sadness, but your mind is already racing to defend it. That's a really tough spot to be in.

Here's a simple thing you can try: whenever you feel the urge to analyze or rationalize, pause for just a second. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. As you exhale, say the word "breathe" to yourself. Just "breathe." No thinking, no analysis. Just the word "breathe."

If you need a little more help, I can remind you to breathe every now and then. But try to do it on your own first, just to see how it goes. You can do it.

Also, I want you to know that it's okay if the sadness doesn't stay. It's okay if it disappears or changes. Just acknowledge it for now, and don't try to change it. We're just trying to see what it's like to feel it, without getting too caught up in analysis. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay—I can try that. I just took a slow breath and said "breathe" to myself; it did ease the throat a little, but my inner commentator immediately started drafting a metacognitive narrative about failure and conditioned responses. I'm a bit shaky and honestly tempted to verbalize the analysis instead of staying with the sensation—could you gently prompt me with "breathe" every so often, like every 10–15 seconds, so I don't slip back into explaining it away?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is trying to find a way to analyze and rationalize the experience, even though it's been eased slightly by the breathing.

Okay, let's try this: every 10-15 seconds, I'll gently remind you to breathe. I'll just say "breathe" in a soft voice. It's not a big deal, but it might help you stay focused on the sensation instead of your inner commentary.

So, here's the plan: I'll remind you to breathe, and then you can try to stay with the sensation. Don't worry about analyzing it, just be with it. If you need to, just say "breathe" to yourself, and then try to stay with the feeling.

Ready to try it? Take a slow breath in, and say "breathe" to yourself.

Patient: Okay — I breathed in and said "breathe" to myself; the throat loosened a hair and the chest knot felt a little less taut, but my inner commentator is already drafting an entire etiological essay about why it happened. I'm a bit shaky and tempted to explain it away, so yeah, please keep saying "breathe" every 10–15 seconds and maybe nudges like "notice the chest" would help me stay with the sensation instead of narrating.

I'm not asking you to change anything or try to fix it, I just want you to notice the sensation. Can you do that? Just notice the chest, and the feeling of the knot.

Patient: I can feel the chest knot — a dull, localized tightness that loosens a hair when I inhale; the "breathe" helps. But my inner commentator is already launching into a metacognitive elaboration, mapping it to past bullying and perceived failure, so I’m tempted to narrate. Could you keep saying "breathe" and occasionally "notice the chest" so I can try to stay with it instead of explaining it away?

But my inner commentator is circling again, queuing up etiological explanations, and I'm getting shaky and a bit panicky; can we slow to longer, softer breaths and keep the prompts—“breathe,” “notice the chest”—so I don’t default to narrating? I want to stay with this but it’s hard; please nudge me gently if I slip into analysis.

My cognitive apparatus is already busy generating etiological narratives about why this happened, but I want to stay somatic; can you slow the breaths further and keep saying "breathe" and "notice the chest" every 8–12 seconds? Also, could you add a simple grounding prompt like "feel your feet" between breaths? That usually helps anchor me when my mind starts racing.

It's like your body is holding onto something, but you're not quite sure what. Take a few more breaths in... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... (slowly, 15 seconds) and let's focus on that sensation. Just notice the chest, without thinking about anything else right now. Can you feel the dull pressure? The prickly tightness?

Take another breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... (slowly, 15 seconds) and say "breathe".

Notice the chest again. Take a moment to really notice it. Can you feel the dull pressure under your sternum? The prickly tightness in your throat? It's like your body is holding onto something, but you're not quite sure what. Take a few more breaths in... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... (slowly, 15 seconds) and let's focus on that sensation. Just notice the chest, without thinking about anything else right now.

Take another breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4...

Patient: I'm here — I followed the inhale but my attention keeps fracturing; my heart's a bit fast and there's that prickly throat tightness and the dull pressure under my sternum. My metacognitive inner commentator is already scaffolding an etiological narrative about bullying and failure, and I don't want to hand it the wheel right now, so please keep guiding me. Say "breathe," "notice the chest," "feel your feet," and "safe here" every ~8–10 seconds, count slow inhales/exhales (about 5–6 seconds), and linger longer on "notice the chest" before moving on — tell me when to take the next breath.

I'm glad you're here. Let's take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (slowly, 6 seconds) and say "breathe" to yourself.

Feel your feet on the ground. Can you feel the sensation of your feet touching the chair or floor? It's okay if your mind starts to wander, just bring your attention back to your feet.

Patient: I'm following the breaths — the long inhales help a little, but my heart's still racing and there's that prickly throat tightness and dull pressure under my sternum. My inner commentator keeps strapping on an etiological narrative about bullying→failure, and I don't want to hand it the wheel, so please keep saying "breathe," "notice the chest," "feel your feet," and "safe here" every ~8–10 seconds and linger on the chest for longer pauses. I'm shaky and a bit panicky and honestly frustrated this is so hard, but I want to keep sitting with it — if I start narrating, prompt me to just say "breathe" or to name one simple sensation instead.

Patient: Okay—I'm jittery and my mind's already leaping into explanations. Please just give me simple anchors: say "breathe" now, wait ~8–10 seconds, then "notice the chest," then "feel your feet." Keep them short and slow so I don't narrate.

Patient: That rapid stream felt like white noise and actually ramped up my anxiety — my heart's faster, throat tighter, attention splintered. Can we slow it down to gentle prompts every ~8–10 seconds: say "breathe" (long 5–6 sec inhale/exhale), pause, then "notice the chest" and linger there, then "feel your feet" before repeating? If I start narrating or explaining, just say "breathe" or ask me to name one simple sensation — I'm shaky but I want to keep trying. Go ahead and say "breathe" when you're ready.

Patient: I’m getting more rattled by the scrambled prompts — my heart’s racing and my attention’s fracturing, and I can feel the pull to explain instead of sit with it. Please, just the simple cycle now: say “breathe,” pause ~8–10 seconds, then “notice the chest,” pause, then “feel your feet,” then “safe here,” and start with “breathe” now — I need that steady rhythm so I don’t spiral into narration. I’m shaky and on edge, but I want to keep trying; nudge me back to one simple sensation if I start explaining.

Patient: I'm stuck in that loop — my mind keeps chanting "I have a theory" and it's drowning out the actual sensations; my throat's tight and my heart's racing. I'm frustrated and anxious and I don't want to default to explaining it away, so please do the steady cycle I asked for: say "breathe" (long 5–6s inhale/exhale), pause, then "notice the chest," pause, then "feel your feet," then "safe here," and repeat. If I start narrating, just say "breathe" or ask me to name one simple sensation so I don't hand the wheel to the inner commentator. Go ahead — say "breathe" now.

Patient: Okay — I'm anxious, heart's racing, throat tight, and my head keeps looping into explanations about bullying and failure instead of staying with the body. Can you just do the simple cycle I asked for now: say “breathe” (long inhale/exhale), pause ~8–10s, then “notice the chest,” pause, then “feel your feet,” then “safe here,” and repeat? If I start narrating, just say “breathe” to pull me back.
