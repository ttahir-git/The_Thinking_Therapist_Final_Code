Patient: Lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because I get really anxious in social situations — it feels intense and overwhelming. It's tied up with my OCD and money stress, even though my partner's pretty supportive. I don't know, talking about it feels awkward but I wanted to bring it up.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings, especially when it's tied up with your OCD and financial stress. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in a social situation and your anxiety kicks in? Is it the feeling of being judged, the pressure to be perfect, or something else entirely?

Patient: I guess it starts with this rush — my heart spikes, I get sweaty, and my head goes fuzzy like I can't think straight. Then I worry everyone's judging me or that they'll see I don't have my life/money together, and my OCD makes me replay everything I said or obsess over whether I said the "right" thing. I don't know, it's really awkward to go into and I keep wanting to change the subject.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your anxiety can be quite overwhelming, and it's not just about being judged by others, but also about your own internal worries. The replaying of conversations and the fear of making a mistake can be really debilitating. It's like your mind is constantly on high alert, making it hard for you to just be present in the moment. Have you ever noticed when you're in a social situation, do you find yourself wanting to make a quick exit or trying to find a way to distract yourself from these thoughts?

Patient: Yeah, I usually scan the room for an exit or start fiddling with my phone to escape. I end up replaying stuff I said, sometimes bolt out early, and if the convo turns to money I just freeze because I can't talk about my own situation. I don't know, can we not dive too deep into that right now?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're using these coping mechanisms to try and escape the overwhelming feelings. I'm here to listen if you're ready, but I also want to make sure you feel comfortable. Let's take a step back for a moment. You mentioned your partner is pretty supportive. How does that impact your anxiety, or do you feel like you're able to open up about this stuff with them?

Patient: They're pretty supportive — they remind me it's okay and sometimes come to events with me, which actually helps a lot. But I don't really talk to them about the money stuff; I feel ashamed and like I'd be burdening them, and I guess that just makes the anxiety worse. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to go into the money part — can we not dig into that right now?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're carrying a heavy burden of shame around the money aspect, and that's making it even harder to deal with the anxiety. It's not awkward to talk about, it's just hard because of how you feel about it. I want to connect with what you do value, and it seems like your relationship with your partner is important to you. Can you tell me a bit about what you value most in your relationship, or what brings you comfort and connection with them?

Patient: I guess I value that they're reliable and patient — they come to events with me and make things less scary. They make me laugh and don't pressure me about money, which helps, but I still feel embarrassed and tend to avoid bringing it up. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to go deeper into that right now.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your partner's reliability and patience are a big source of comfort for you, and they help you feel more at ease in social situations. It's like they're providing a safe space for you, which is really important. Can I ask, what's one small thing that your partner has said or done recently that made you feel seen or heard, even if it's just in a small way? Maybe that can help us connect with what you value in your relationship.

Patient: I guess the other night before a party I was freaking out and they just hung back with me until I stopped pacing — just being there made me feel seen. They also said, like, "we'll figure it out together" about money, and that landed even though I didn't really say anything. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about but those little things help.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's amazing how sometimes it's the small, unspoken moments that can have a big impact. Your partner's willingness to just be there with you, even when you're freaking out, must have been incredibly comforting. And the way they acknowledged the elephant in the room, even if you didn't say anything about it, can be really powerful. It's like they're showing you that they're willing to face the issue together, which can be a huge weight off your shoulders. Can I ask, do you think there's anything specific that would make you feel like you could talk to your partner about your money worries, or is it just the feeling of being seen and heard that matters?

Patient: I guess if they could offer a concrete, nonjudgmental plan or just say it's okay to be imperfect, that might make it easier to bring it up. But I don't know—talking about money feels really exposing and shameful, so I mostly avoid it. Can we slow down? This is getting a bit intense and awkward for me.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of talking about money, and that's making it even harder for you to open up. It's not about being perfect or exposing yourself, it's about feeling seen and heard. I'm here to listen, not to judge. Can we take a step back and focus on something else for a bit? What do you like to do in your free time? Is there anything that brings you joy or helps you relax?

Patient: I guess I usually tinker with side coding projects and data viz stuff — it feels productive and takes my mind off things. I also like running and going to the climbing gym; moving helps calm me, and cooking with my partner is nice when we both have time. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to go deep into feelings right now — can we keep it light?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy activities that are hands-on and creative, like coding and data visualization. It's great that you find them productive and help you unwind. Exercise and physical activity can be really helpful for managing anxiety, and it's awesome that you have healthy outlets like running and climbing. Cooking with your partner sounds like a nice way to spend time together and relax. Let's keep the conversation light and focus on these positive activities. Is there a recent project or hobby that you're particularly enjoying, or something new that you're looking to try?

Patient: I've been working on a side project — a personal dashboard that pulls in my runs and climbing sessions and makes nicer visuals out of the data. It's oddly satisfying to build and tweak, and I'm thinking about doing a small local hackathon to push it, though the meetup part makes me nervous. I don't know, it's easier to talk about this than... feelings, so can we keep it light?

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're working on a side project that you're passionate about. Building and tweaking can be very satisfying, and it's awesome that you're thinking of taking it to the next level with a hackathon. The meetup part might be a bit daunting, but it's normal to feel nervous about meeting new people and showcasing your work. What do you think is the most exciting part of this project for you, aside from the technical aspect? Is it the sense of accomplishment, the possibility of getting feedback, or something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I guess the most exciting part is the sense of accomplishment when messy runs/climbs data actually looks clean and maybe getting some feedback, but the meetup side still makes me nervous.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're thinking about what motivates you to work on your project. The sense of accomplishment is a big part of it, and being able to showcase your work and get feedback from others can be really helpful.

As for the meetup part, it's okay if it's still making you nervous. Can you tell me more about what's specifically making you feel that way? Is it the thought of talking to people about your project, or is it more about being in a group setting? Sometimes just acknowledging the feeling can help make it feel a bit more manageable.

Patient: I guess it's mostly the group thing — my chest gets tight and I start worrying they'll judge me, especially if someone asks how I make money or what I'm doing with it. Talking about the project one-on-one feels okay, but in a meetup I worry I'll say something dumb or they'll see I don't have it together. I don't know, can we not dig into that too much? It's getting kind of awkward.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the group setting makes you feel more exposed and vulnerable. Talking about your project one-on-one can be a more comfortable and controlled way to share it. The meetup setting adds a lot of extra pressure, especially when it comes to talking about your personal life and finances.

Let's take a break from that for a bit. Can we go back to something more lighthearted? You mentioned you enjoy running and climbing. Have you noticed any changes in your running or climbing routines recently, or are you looking to try anything new in those activities?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. Running's been pretty steady — I've started interval sessions and a new trail that actually makes it fun again, and with climbing I'm doing more bouldering to work on technique. It helps me zone out and feel less wound up. I don't know, can we keep it light?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're finding ways to make your running and climbing more enjoyable and engaging. The interval sessions and new trail for running, and the bouldering for climbing, are great ways to challenge yourself and stay motivated.

It's also nice that you're finding that these activities help you feel less wound up and more focused. Can I ask, what's been on your mind lately that's been making you feel wound up? Is it related to work, or something else entirely? We can try to explore that a bit more if you'd like.

Patient: I guess it's mostly the money stuff and the OCD — worrying I can't keep up with bills and that people will see I'm failing. Work has deadlines and imposter-y stuff that piles on, and then social situations just amplify everything. I don't know, it's really awkward to go deeper into it right now — can we maybe focus on coping strategies or stick with the running/climbing stuff for a bit?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like a lot of pressure is coming from different directions, and it's hard to know where to start. The money stress, OCD, work deadlines, imposter syndrome, and social situations can all feel overwhelming at the same time.

Let's try to focus on some coping strategies that might help. Have you ever tried journaling or writing down your thoughts and feelings? Sometimes putting your thoughts on paper can help you process and release them. We could also explore some mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, that might help you stay calm and focused in the moment.

You mentioned running and climbing as things that help you zone out and feel less wound up. Those are great examples of activities that can be good for stress relief. Do you find that when you're doing these activities, you're able to quiet your mind and focus on the present moment?

Patient: I guess when I'm running or climbing I can actually quiet my mind — the rhythm or the moves make it easier to focus and the OCD quiets down for a bit. But it's not perfect; sometimes my head still wanders to bills or some replayed convo even mid-run. I don't know, can we keep it practical—like talk about quick grounding tricks I can use when the anxiety spikes?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're finding that running and climbing can help calm your mind to some extent. Even if your thoughts still wander, it's still a good way to give your brain a break.

Quick grounding tricks can be really helpful when anxiety spikes. One thing you might try is focusing on your five senses. For example, you could notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin. Sometimes, noticing the small details in your environment can help bring you back to the present moment.

Another trick is to use a physical anchor, like a small object in your pocket or a watch on your wrist. You could focus on the feeling of the object, or the way it looks. This can help distract you from anxious thoughts and bring you back to the present.

We could also explore some simple, one-word reminders that you could use when you feel anxious. For example, you might repeat the word "breathe" to yourself, or "ground." These small reminders can help calm your mind and bring you back to the present.

Do any of these ideas sound like they might be helpful, or is there something else you've tried in the past that you'd like to build on?

Patient: I guess the five-senses thing and a small physical anchor (like a smooth stone or a coin in my pocket) sound doable when my chest spikes. Box breathing or a short 4‑4‑4 pace helps sometimes too, and having a phone reminder that just says "breathe" seems low-effort. I don't know, can we keep this practical and not get into the feelings part right now?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're finding some small techniques that can help in the moment. The five-senses trick, physical anchors, box breathing, and phone reminders can all be useful tools to have in your toolkit.

Let's keep focusing on practical strategies. Have you ever considered creating a simple "emergency kit" with a few small items that can help you calm down in a stressful moment? This could be a small notebook, a pen, a set of sticky notes, or a small pack of gum. Having these items with you can provide a sense of control and comfort when you're feeling anxious.

We could also explore the idea of creating a "calm-down script" for yourself. This could be a short phrase or sentence that you repeat to yourself when you're feeling anxious. For example, "I've got this," "I can handle this," or "I'm safe." Having a clear, confident message to repeat can help shift your perspective and calm your mind.

Do any of these ideas resonate with you, or is there something else you'd like to try?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds doable — an emergency kit with a smooth stone, earbuds, gum, and a tiny notebook feels low-effort. A short calm-down script like "I'm breathing, I'm safe" might work, but I don't know, I feel weird saying it out loud. Could you give me one or two super simple scripts I could use and a quick way to set a discreet phone reminder?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
An emergency kit with those items sounds like a great starting point.

For a calm-down script, here are two simple options that you can use:

1. "Breathe in calm, breathe out stress."
2. "I've got this, I've got this, I've got this."

These scripts are short, easy to remember, and can help you focus on your breath and calm your mind. You can try saying them out loud in front of a mirror, or record yourself saying them to help get used to the sound.

For setting a discreet phone reminder, you can use a simple alarm or a reminder app. Here's a quick way to set one:

* Open your phone's reminder app (e.g., Apple's Reminders, Google's Alarms, or a third-party app like Any.do or Habitica).
* Tap the "+" icon to create a new reminder.
* Set the reminder to go off at a specific time or when you leave your home (so you can trigger it discreetly).
* Enter a simple message, like "Breathe in calm" or "I've got this."
* Set the reminder to vibrate or make a soft sound, so it won't startle you.

Try it out and see what works best for you!

Patient: I guess I can try that — I'll set a vibrating reminder that just says "Breathe" so I can read it or repeat it silently. I don't know, saying the scripts out loud feels weird, so a silent phrase would be better; maybe "Breathe — one step" or just "In — out." Can you suggest one short silent script and a quick way to set a location-based reminder (like when I leave home) on my phone?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Using a short, silent script can be more discreet and help you focus on your breath.

Here's a short, silent script: "Now."

You can try saying this to yourself when you feel anxious, and it can help you bring your attention to the present moment. If you find it easier to repeat a phrase with movement, "In — out" is a great option. It's a gentle reminder that can help you focus on your breath.

For a location-based reminder, you can use a feature like "When I Leave" or "Arrival" on your phone. Here's how to set it:

* Open your phone's reminder app (e.g., Apple's Reminders, Google's Alarms, or a third-party app like Any.do or Habitica).
* Tap the "+" icon to create a new reminder.
* Tap "Add Location" or "Set Location" and select the location you want to set the reminder for (e.g., your home, office, or a specific building).
* Choose the time of day or when you want the reminder to go off.
* Enter a simple message, like "Breathe" or "Now."
* Tap "Save" to set the reminder.

When you leave the designated location, the reminder will trigger, and you can try to use your script to calm down.

Patient: I don't know—suddenly my chest feels tight and I'm kinda distracted. The "Now" script seems okay, but I'm jittery; could you walk me through the exact steps for setting a location-based reminder on an iPhone? I guess a slow, step-by-step would help because I'm too scattered to figure it out right now.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try, and I'll guide you through it step by step. Since you're feeling jittery, let's take it slow and calm.

To set a location-based reminder on an iPhone, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Reminders app**: Find the Reminders app on your iPhone. It's usually on the home screen, but if you can't find it, you can ask Siri to open it for you.
2. **Tap the "+" icon**: On the Reminders screen, you'll see a "+" icon in the top-right corner. Tap this icon to create a new reminder.
3. **Choose a reminder type**: You'll see a few options: "Event," "Task," and "Reminder." Tap "Reminder" since we're setting a simple reminder.
4. **Give your reminder a name**: Type a short name for your reminder, like "Breathe." This will be the title of your reminder.
5. **Add a message (optional)**: You can add a brief message to your reminder, but since we're keeping it simple, let's leave this blank for now.
6. **Tap "Add Location"**: Scroll down and tap "Add Location" at the bottom of the screen.
7. **Choose a location**: Select the location where you want the reminder to trigger. You can choose a specific address, a building, or a location on a map.
8. **Tap "Done"**: When you select a location, tap "Done" to save it.
9. **Set the reminder time**: Choose the time of day when you want the reminder to go off. You can set it for a specific time or choose "Repeat" if you want it to go off daily, weekly, or monthly.
10. **Save the reminder**: Tap "Save" to set the reminder.

Take a deep breath and try to repeat the process. If you need help or feel overwhelmed, we can stop and try again another time.

(Remember, you can always come back to this conversation and ask for help whenever you need it.)

Patient: Okay, I'm opening Reminders now — my hands feel a bit shaky. Walk me through it really slowly: I tap "+", type "Breathe", then do I tap the little "i" or "Details"? I see a toggle for "Remind me at a location" — should I turn that on, then search "Home" and pick "When I leave"? Also, how do I make it vibrate only so it doesn't blare? I don't know, I'm kind of jittery, so please go step-by-step.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to help you through this step by step. Take your time, and I'll guide you through each action.

**Step 1: Tap the "+" icon**
Look at your screen and find the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the Reminders app. It's a small white "+" sign. Tap this icon with your finger. You'll see a new reminder screen appear.

**Step 2: Type "Breathe"**
On the new reminder screen, type "Breathe" using your finger. You can type with your thumbs or index fingers. Don't worry about typos; we can fix that later.

**Step 3: Tap the "i" or "Details" icon**
Look at the screen and find the "i" or "Details" icon. It's usually a small "i" symbol or a magnifying glass icon. Tap this icon to see more details about the reminder.

**Step 4: Add a location**
Now, look at the screen and find the toggle for "Remind me at a location." It's usually a small switch or a checkbox. Tap this toggle to turn it on. This will allow you to set a location for your reminder.

**Step 5: Search for "Home" and set the reminder to "When I leave"**
On the same screen, you'll see a search bar at the top. Type "Home" using your finger. You can use your thumbs or index fingers. Once you type "Home," a list of nearby locations will appear. Find your home address and tap on it. Then, tap "When I leave" to set the reminder to trigger when you leave your home.

**Step 6: Adjust the reminder settings (optional)**
If you want to change the reminder time or repeat the reminder, you can do so on this screen. However, for now, let's focus on setting the location and making the reminder vibrate.

**Step 7: Make the reminder vibrate only**
Look at the screen and find the "Sounds" or "Alerts" option. It's usually a small icon with a bell or a vibration symbol. Tap this option to adjust the reminder settings. Choose the "Vibration" option to make the reminder vibrate instead of playing a sound.

Take a deep breath and try to repeat the process. If you need help or feel overwhelmed, we can stop and try again another time.

(Remember, you can always come back to this conversation and ask for help whenever

Patient: Okay, slow — I'm doing it but my hands are shaky. Walk me through exactly so I don't mess it up:

1. In Reminders: tap "+", type "Breathe". Then tap the little "i" or "Details" — right?
2. Turn on "Remind me at a location" toggle — yes? Then in the search bar type "Home", pick my address, and choose "When I leave" — then tap "Done" or "Add" to save?
3. For vibrate-only: should I flip the ring/silent switch on the side to silent (so orange shows)? And make sure Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Vibrate on Silent is ON. Is there anything else I need to change in Settings > Notifications > Reminders (like turn Sounds off) so it doesn't play a noise?

**3. Make the reminder vibrate-only**
To make the reminder vibrate-only, you need to flip the ring/silent switch on the side of your iPhone to silent (so the orange shows). Then, go to Settings, tap on Sounds & Haptics, and make sure Vibrate on Silent is ON. You may also need to go to Settings > Notifications > Reminders and turn off Sounds. This will ensure that your reminder only vibrates and doesn't play a noise.

Take a deep breath and try to repeat the process. If you need help or feel overwhelmed, we can stop and try again another time.

Patient: Okay — my hands are still shaky but I think I did the steps: typed "Breathe," tapped Details, turned on Remind me at a location, picked Home and When I leave, and hit Add. I flipped the silent switch and checked Settings > Sounds & Haptics to make sure Vibrate on Silent is on, and I turned off Sounds under Settings > Notifications > Reminders — I think? I don't know, I'm not totally sure it saved right.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're trying to test it. I'll guide you through a quick test step by step.

**Testing the Reminder without Leaving the House**

To test the reminder without leaving the house, you'll need to set a location that's close to your current location. This will help the reminder trigger when you're within a short distance of the set location.

**Step 1: Enable Location Services for Reminders**

To enable Location Services for Reminders, go to Settings and scroll down to Reminders. Tap on "Location Services" and toggle it on. You'll see a small map icon appear next to your location. This is the location that Reminders will use to determine when you're close enough to trigger the reminder.

**Step 2: Test the Reminder**

Now, go back to your Reminders app and make sure you're still on the same screen. You should see the reminder you just set, with the location set to "Home" and "When I leave". Take a deep breath and try to trigger the reminder manually by tapping the "Breathe" reminder. If everything is set up correctly, the reminder should trigger, and you should hear a vibrate or see a notification.

**Step 3: Check the Settings**

Go to Settings and check that Vibrate on Silent is still ON and that Sounds is turned OFF under Settings > Notifications > Reminders.

Take a deep breath and try to trigger the reminder again. If it still doesn't work, we can try to troubleshoot further.

Patient: I don't know — it didn't seem to trigger and now my chest's tight and I'm getting jittery. I guess maybe Location Services isn't on for Reminders? Can you walk me through, really slowly, how to check that (like which Settings to tap and what to pick)? Also, what's a simple way to test the location trigger without actually leaving the house? Can we slow down — I'm shaky and need step‑by‑step.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm so sorry to hear that the reminder didn't trigger. I'm here to help you troubleshoot it step by step.

**Checking Location Services for Reminders**

To check if Location Services is enabled for Reminders, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** on your iPhone. It's usually on the home screen, but if you can't find it, you can ask Siri to open it for you.
2. Scroll down and tap on **Location Services**.
3. Look for **Reminders** in the list of apps. It might say "Reminders" or "Reminders (background location only)".
4. If you see **Reminders** listed, tap on it.
5. Look for a toggle switch that says **Location Services**. It's usually a small switch or a checkbox.
6. If the toggle switch is turned **ON**, Location Services is enabled for Reminders.

**Testing the Location Trigger without Leaving the House**

To test the location trigger without leaving the house, you can try moving around your home or a small indoor space. Here's how:

1. Go to a room where you've set the reminder to trigger.
2. Move around the room or go to a different room. You can even close your eyes and walk to a different room.
3. Take a deep breath and try to trigger the reminder manually by tapping the "Breathe" reminder.
4. If everything is set up correctly, the reminder should trigger, and you should hear a vibrate or see a notification.

**What to Do if it Doesn't Work**

If the reminder still doesn't trigger after trying these steps, we can try to troubleshoot further. You can also try resetting the reminder or deleting it and starting over.

Remember, I'm here to help you, and I'll walk you through each step slowly and carefully. Don't worry, we'll get it sorted out together.

Patient: I don't know — my chest is still tight and I'm jittery, so please go really slow. Can you tell me exactly which menus to tap (like Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Reminders?) and whether I should pick "While Using" or "Always" and turn on Precise Location or Background App Refresh? Also give me one simple test I can do right now that doesn't involve actually leaving the house — something I can try step‑by‑step so I can see if it's saved correctly.

I'm glad you're open to trying something else. Let's start with a simple breathing exercise. I'll guide you through it step by step.

**4-4-4 Breathing Exercise**

This exercise can help calm your mind and body. Please follow my instructions carefully.

**Step 1: Inhale**
Take a deep breath in through your nose. Count to 4 in your head: "1, 2, 3, 4." Your belly should rise as you inhale.

(Pause for a moment)

**Step 2: Hold**
Hold your breath for a count of 4: "1, 2, 3, 4." Try to relax your body and feel the breath in your lungs.

(Pause for a moment)

**Step 3: Exhale**
Slowly exhale through your mouth. Count to 4: "1, 2, 3, 4." Your belly should fall as you exhale.

(Pause for a moment)

Repeat this cycle a few times, focusing on your breath and the counting.

If you need a break or feel overwhelmed, we can stop and try something else.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. In—1,2,3,4. Hold—1,2,3,4. Out—1,2,3,4. 

Hmm, that helped a little but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaky. Can we do one more round, but slower and with you counting each step? I don't know, it's kinda hard to focus right now.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another round, and I'll count each step more slowly to help you focus.

**4-4-4 Breathing Exercise (Slow and Counted)**

**Step 1: Inhale**
Inhale deeply through your nose... 1... 2... 3... 4. Your belly should rise as you inhale.

(Pause for a moment, counting out loud)

**Step 2: Hold**
Hold your breath... 1... 2... 3... 4. Try to relax your body and feel the breath in your lungs.

(Pause for a moment, counting out loud)

**Step 3: Exhale**
Slowly exhale through your mouth... 1... 2... 3... 4. Your belly should fall as you exhale.

(Pause for a moment, counting out loud)

Repeat this cycle a few more times, focusing on your breath and the counting. Remember, I'm counting each step, so take your time and breathe slowly.

If you need to, we can stop and try something else. But first, let's see if this helps calm you down a bit more.

Patient: I don't know — that helped a little, but my chest is still tight and my hands are shaky. Can we do one more really slow round of the 4‑4‑4 where you count each number out loud slowly? If that's too much, we can try a 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding instead, but please walk me through each step slowly — I'm pretty scattered right now.
