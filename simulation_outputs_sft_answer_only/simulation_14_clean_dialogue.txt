Patient: Hey—I’m an artist and lately I’ve been using booze and weed more to numb the grief, which I know is messing with my focus and my work. I can’t shake the feeling that this will definitely spiral: I’ll miss deadlines, lose clients, my studio will go under, and I’ll end up alone and broke with nothing left to show for my life. I try to stay upbeat, but my brain keeps replaying that worst-case movie and I can’t stop watching it.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of failure and the potential consequences are really weighing on you right now. You're seeing how your current coping mechanisms might be affecting your work, and that's causing you a lot of anxiety. It's not easy to deal with this kind of pressure, especially when it feels like it's all connected to your passion for art.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to stay upbeat, but your mind keeps going back to that worst-case scenario? How does that feeling affect your work, and have you noticed any specific things that trigger it?

Patient: I try to joke and act upbeat, but my head immediately starts scripting the whole collapse—I'll miss a deadline, a client will bail, word gets around, my rent won't get paid, and the studio's gone for sure. It makes me procrastinate or numb out with booze and weed so I can stop hearing that movie, which just makes the work worse and the spiral feel more inevitable. Triggers are stuff like getting an email about a show, seeing someone else getting a break, or anything that reminds me of them—those moments flip the switch and the disaster-plan kicks in. I know other things could happen, but honestly I can't see past the worst-case; it feels like the only realistic timeline.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of failure is taking on a life of its own for you, and it's hard to shake the feeling that you're already staring into the abyss. When that worst-case scenario starts playing out in your head, it's like you're stuck in a loop where nothing can calm you down or make you feel better. It's like the anxiety is feeding off itself, making it even harder to focus on your work and enjoy the things that bring you joy.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're numb out with booze and weed? Does it ever help you feel better in the short term, or is it just a temporary escape? And how do you think your art would change if you were able to shake off that constant fear and doubt?

Patient: Numbing takes the edge off for a little while — I can sleep or stop the crying — but the next day everything's foggy, I get less done, and the shame makes the disaster-movie louder. If I could shake the fear, maybe my work would be sharper and I'd take more risks or actually finish shows, but I can't convince myself that would matter long-term — my brain already has the sequel written where I still lose clients, run out of money, and it's all for nothing. I know that sounds bleak, but I can't help getting pulled back into that script every time.

Therapist: It sounds like the numbness and the shame are kind of a toxic cycle for you. It's like you're trying to escape the pain and the fear, but the escape only leaves you feeling more stuck and worse off in the end. And that fear of failure, it's like it's already won, you know? It's like your brain is writing this story of what could go wrong, and it's hard to shake that feeling that it's all just a matter of time before it all falls apart.

Can you tell me more about what the shame part of this feels like? Is it like you're punishing yourself for not being able to deal with your emotions, or is it more like you're ashamed of who you are as an artist? How does that shame show up in your work, and do you feel like it's holding you back in any way?

Patient: It feels like I'm punishing myself — like I’m a fraud who can’t even handle grief, so I deserve the collapse my brain predicts. It shows up as hiding work, sabotaging projects, doing safe small stuff instead of riskier pieces, and calling in sick the day of a show so I don't have to face people. Then the avoidance becomes “proof” in my head that the disaster is coming, so I numb out to stop the shame, which just makes the whole cycle louder. People tell me other things could happen, but honestly that sounds naive — my mind says the worst-case is the only real timeline.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-doubt are really crippling for you. It's like you're trapped in this vicious cycle of self-punishment, where you feel like you're a failure as an artist and a person. The avoidance and hiding are like a desperate attempt to escape that feeling, but it only seems to make things worse.

I want to ask you something, though it might sound a little weird. Can you think of a time when you were really proud of yourself as an artist? Not just a good show or a successful piece, but something that made you feel really proud to be you? It's like I'm asking you to tap into a part of yourself that might be feeling a little buried right now.

Also, I want to try something a bit experimental. Would you be willing to try making a small, tiny commitment to yourself, just for a minute? Maybe something like, "I will draw for 5 minutes, no matter what." Or, "I will take a deep breath and look at this piece of art without judgment." It's just a tiny tiny step, but it might be enough to start to break that cycle of avoidance and shame.

Patient: There was this one show last year where I finished a whole series and people actually cried at one piece — I felt proud like I mattered for a second. Even that memory turns into a script in my head: they’ll eventually say it was a fluke, I won’t repeat it, and it’ll all prove I’m a fraud. I’ll try the five minutes of drawing now, but honestly I’m bracing for it to just remind me of what I lost and push me to drink so I can’t feel the shame, which will then make everything worse. Can we do it now? I'm already worrying about how it’ll go wrong.

Therapist: It sounds like that moment of pride and connection with your audience was fleeting, and it's been replaced by the same old script of self-doubt and shame. Even the memory of that positive experience is now tainted by the fear of being found out and losing your self-worth.

I'm not going to try to convince you to draw now, because I think that might make things worse. Instead, I want to ask you to take a step back and try to understand what's really going on here. It's not that you're not capable of creating something beautiful or meaningful; it's that the fear of failure and the shame of not being good enough are overwhelming you.

Can you think of a time when you were afraid of something, but you still pushed through it anyway? Maybe it was a small thing, but it's something that might give you some insight into what you're capable of. And it's not about being brave or foolhardy; it's about being willing to take a risk and see what happens.

Also, I want to try something different. Instead of focusing on drawing or creating, I want to try to explore this feeling of shame and self-doubt with you. Can you tell me more about what it feels like to be a "fraud" in your own eyes? Is it a constant presence, or does it come and go? And how does it affect your relationships with others?

Patient: Yeah — once I had to give a short talk at a gallery and I basically forced myself to show up, and people liked it, so for a minute I felt like maybe I could handle things. Immediately after, though, my head wrote the next scene: I’ll flub the next show, someone will call me out as a phony, clients will disappear, and that’ll prove I never deserved that one good night. The fraud feeling is almost constant now — a low-grade narrator predicting the worst, not a mood that comes and goes. It makes me keep things surface-level with friends or bail before they can see me fall, which then just becomes “proof” in my head that I’m losing them. I want to take small risks, but I’m already scripting their collapse, so I reach for a drink or a joint to quiet the movie.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-doubt have become a constant companion, a narrative that you can't seem to shake. It's like you're living in a perpetual state of anxiety, where every moment is a potential disaster waiting to happen. And it's not just the external validation you're seeking, but also the internal sense of self-worth.

I want to try to understand what's driving this narrative. Is it a fear of failure, a fear of not being good enough, or is it something deeper? It seems like it's not just about external validation, but also about internal self-acceptance. Can you think of a time when you were able to accept yourself, flaws and all, without the need for external validation?

Also, I want to explore this concept of "proof" a bit more. It seems like whenever you feel like you're losing someone or that you're not good enough, you use that as evidence to reinforce the narrative. But what if we were to challenge that notion of "proof"? What if we were to say that it's okay to not have all the answers, to make mistakes, and to stumble? Could that shift the way we approach these situations?

One more thing, I want to try a small experiment. Can you tell me about a time when you felt really good about yourself, without any of the self-doubt or shame? It could be a small thing, but I want to try to tap into that feeling and see if we can build on it.

Patient: There was this one afternoon after finishing a big piece where I actually felt… proud and kind of peaceful, like for a moment I wasn’t chasing anyone’s approval. Friends hugged me, someone wanted to buy it, and I remember thinking, “Maybe I’m doing okay.” Of course my brain immediately wrote the next chapter — that was a fluke, the next show will tank, people will see I’m a fraud — so even that good memory gets undercut and feels like the calm before the storm.

Therapist: It sounds like you've experienced a moment of peace and self-acceptance, where you felt proud of your work and at ease with yourself. But, as you've said, your brain immediately jumped in to undermine that feeling, predicting that the success was just a fluke and that the next show would be a disaster.

It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's like you're living in a state of constant anticipation, where every positive moment is met with a negative counterpoint.

I want to try to explore this further. Can you tell me more about what it's like to feel that sense of peace and pride? What does it look like, how does it feel? And how does your brain's response to that feeling affect your daily life?

Also, I want to try a small exercise. Can you think of a time when you felt that sense of peace and pride, and then write it down? Try to capture the details, the sights, the sounds, the feelings. Just write it down, without editing or censoring yourself. Let's try to tap into that feeling and see if we can hold onto it a little longer.

Patient: Okay — here's the memory, raw: late afternoon sun slicing through the studio window, turpentine and coffee in the air, my finished piece on the easel, people circling it, one person wiping their eyes and telling me it moved them; my chest felt warm and steady, like for a minute I actually mattered. I can feel the light on the canvas, the low murmur of voices, the weight of the applause still in my palms as I write it down. But of course my brain immediately scripts the next scene — they'll call it a one-off, the next show will flop, clients will ghost, rent won't get paid, and the studio will be empty — so even this memory turns into evidence the collapse is coming. I'm trying to hold onto the calm, but honestly I keep bracing for how it all goes wrong.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto a feeling, a sense of pride and self-worth, but your brain is constantly undermining it, predicting that it's all just a temporary high before the crash.

I want to try to do something different. Instead of focusing on the script your brain is writing, can you try to hold onto the memory of that feeling of calm and self-worth? Can you try to feel the warmth in your chest, the light on the canvas, the weight of the applause?

It's like you're trying to hold onto a feeling, but your brain is telling you it's not real. It's like you're trying to grasp a handful of sand, but the moment you think you've got it, the sand slips through your fingers.

Can you try to do something tactile? Can you hold a physical object, like a pen or a stone, and focus on the texture, the weight, the feel of it in your hand? Maybe that can help you feel more connected to the memory, more connected to the feeling of calm and self-worth.

Also, I want to try something else. Can you try to reframe the script your brain is writing? Can you try to see it as a prediction, rather than a certainty? Can you try to see that the collapse is not a guarantee, but a possibility?

It's like you're trying to rewire your brain, to change the way it's thinking. It's not easy, but it might be possible.

Patient: Okay — I grabbed a pen like you said; it’s cool and a little scratchy against my thumb, and for a second the weight in my chest loosens a touch. But the relief is tiny because I’m suddenly hit with this shame from something that happened before and it makes me feel small and stupid, like I don’t deserve that calm. Reframing it as “just a prediction” feels naive to me — my brain insists the collapse is the only real timeline and I can’t buy the alternative. Can we slow down? I’m already bracing for how this will go wrong.

Therapist: I can see that reframing the script as "just a prediction" is not easy for you. It's like you're trying to convince yourself that it's not a certainty, but your brain is still holding onto that feeling of shame and doubt.

Can you try to focus on the pen in your hand? Can you feel the weight of it, the way it fits in your palm? Maybe that can help you ground yourself in the present moment, and make it easier to deal with the feelings that are coming up.

It's okay to feel small and stupid sometimes. It's okay to have those feelings. But can you try to reframe them a little bit? Can you try to see that those feelings are not a reflection of your worth as an artist or as a person? Can you try to see that they are just a part of the emotional landscape of your brain, and that they don't have to define you?

I want to try something else. Can you take a deep breath with me? Can you feel the air move in and out of your body? Can you try to let go of the shame and the doubt for just a moment, and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

And when you're ready, can we try to explore that shame a little bit more? What is it that's causing you to feel small and stupid? Is it something specific that happened, or is it a more general feeling? Can we try to unpack it a little bit, and see if we can find a way to work with it?

Patient: I took a breath and felt the pen, but I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help when my head's already scripting the collapse as inevitable? There's this shame from something that happened before that keeps bubbling up and makes me feel small and stupid, and deep breaths feel like a band-aid on a sinking ship. Can we slow down? I don't know how to dig into it without getting flooded.

Therapist: I can see that the previous suggestion might not have resonated with you, and that's okay. It's like you're trying to hold onto a thread that's fraying, and it's hard to keep a grip.

Can I try something a bit different? Instead of focusing on the breath or the pen, can we try to explore the shame that's bubbling up? It's like you said, it's making you feel small and stupid, and it's hard to deal with.

Can you tell me more about what happened before that's causing this shame? What was it, and how did it make you feel? I'm not looking for a story or a narrative, just a sense of what's going on.

Also, I want to try to reframe the way we're talking about this shame. Instead of saying "it's making you feel small and stupid," can we say "it's a really painful emotion that's coming up for you"? Can we try to acknowledge the shame without judgment, and see if we can find a way to work with it?

It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take things slow. I'm here to support you, and we can go at your pace.

Patient: I... I'm not sure I can put it into words — it's tied to something that happened before that still makes me feel small and stupid, and when that shame hits I get flooded and I can't think straight. I can't really explain the details right now, it just shows up and then I reach for booze or weed to shut it down, which only proves my brain's worst-case script that I'm already failing. Reframing feels kind of naive to me — my head says that one thing is the beginning of the end — so can we slow down and maybe unpack this in tiny bits?

Therapist: It's like the shame and the memories are tied up together in a way that's hard to untangle. It's not surprising that you're feeling overwhelmed and don't know where to start.

Can I try to simplify things a bit? Instead of talking about "the shame" or "the script," can we focus on just one thing at a time? Let's say, for example, that the booze and weed are helping to temporarily numb the feelings. But then you're using that as "proof" that you're already failing, which makes it harder to feel better.

Can we try to explore that one step at a time? What do you think is happening when you reach for the booze or weed? Is it like a temporary escape, or is there something else going on?

Also, I want to try to reframe the way we're talking about failure. Instead of saying "you're failing," can we say "you're feeling like you're not good enough"? Can we try to separate the feeling of failure from the fact that you're trying to cope with your emotions?

It's okay to take things slow, and it's okay to focus on one thing at a time. We can go at your pace, and I'm here to support you.

Patient: When I reach for booze or weed it’s to mute the movie — to shut up that worst-case narrator for a few hours. It does help me sleep and stops the crying, but the next day I’m foggy, get less done, and the shame gets louder so my brain treats it like proof that the collapse is coming. It’s not just escape — it feels like silencing the predictions so I don’t have to feel tiny — and reframing “failing” as “feeling not good enough” sounds kind of hopeful in theory, but my mind says that’s naive and the disaster is inevitable. Can we slow down? I’m already bracing for how this will go wrong.

Therapist: It sounds like the booze and weed are helping you cope with the emotional pain, but the next day, the shame and doubt come flooding back, and it's like your brain is telling you that you're just delaying the inevitable.

Can I try to ask a question, just one question? Is it possible that the shame and doubt aren't just about the failure, but also about the fact that you're not good enough? Like, is there a part of you that's afraid that you're not worthy of success or happiness, no matter what you do?

It's a big question, but I want to try to get at the root of this feeling. Maybe if we can explore what's driving the shame and doubt, we can start to find ways to address it.

And I want to try to reframe this conversation. Instead of saying "the collapse is inevitable," can we say that you're facing a really tough time, and it's okay to not be okay? That it's okay to feel scared and unsure, and that you're not alone in this.

We can take things one step at a time, and we can focus on finding ways to cope with the shame and doubt, rather than trying to fix everything at once. Sound okay?

Patient: Maybe...yeah. Part of me does believe it’s not just about failing at a thing — it feels like I’m not worthy, like nothing I do actually counts, and that just makes the disaster script feel guaranteed. Saying “you’re not alone” or “we can do this” sounds naive to my brain; I can’t stop picturing the sequel where the tiny wins evaporate and the collapse happens anyway. Can we slow down and pick one tiny, concrete step to try right now? I’m bracing for how it’ll go wrong, but I’m willing to try something small if we take it super slow.

Therapist: I can see that the shame and doubt are deeply ingrained, and it's not just about failing at something, but also about feeling unworthy and unimportant.

Let's take a deep breath and try to simplify things even further. Can we focus on just one tiny thing, like taking a small action or making a tiny decision? Something so small that it feels almost insignificant, but might be a tiny step towards breaking the cycle of shame and doubt.

For example, let's say you want to start by just making a cup of tea. Can you do that for me? Just get up and make a cup of tea, without thinking too much about it. It's just a tiny step, but it might be enough to help us get started.

And when you're making the tea, can you try to focus on the sensation of the water in the cup, or the smell of the tea? Can you try to just be present in the moment, without thinking about the script or the disaster that might come afterwards?

We'll take it one tiny step at a time, and we'll focus on just this one small action. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll make the tea. I’m already bracing that it’ll only quiet things for ten minutes before my brain scripts the next disaster, but I’ll try to notice the heat and the smell while I do it. Can we keep talking while I’m doing it?

Therapist: I'll keep talking while you make the tea. Just focus on the sensations and the sound of the water, and try to let go of any thoughts about the future or the past.

Can you tell me a little bit about the tea? Is it a favorite of yours, or are you trying something new? Just noticing the taste and the smell might help you be more present in the moment.

And remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander. Just notice the thought and let it go. Come back to the present moment and focus on the tea. We're taking it one small step at a time.

How's the water boiling? Is it getting too loud?

Patient: It's chamomile — my fallback when I want to feel okay. The kettle's just starting to sing and the steam smells kind of like the studio after a long day, which for a second loosens my chest. Then the shame barges back in and my brain's already scripting the sequel where this calm disappears and I reach for booze to quiet the movie. I'm not sure I follow how focusing on the tea actually changes anything — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down?

Therapist: I can see that the shame and doubt are still present, and that the chamomile tea is bringing up some familiar feelings. It's like the tea is a comfort, but also a reminder of what's not working.

Let's take a step back and look at this from a different perspective. When you're focusing on the tea, you're not trying to change the way you feel or the fact that you're experiencing shame and doubt. You're just noticing the sensations and the sounds around you. It's not about changing anything, it's about being present in the moment.

Think of it like this: when you're driving, you're not trying to change the fact that you're on the road, but you're paying attention to the road, the traffic, the other cars around you. You're not trying to change the fact that you're driving, but you're focusing on the present moment.

It's the same with the tea. You're not trying to change the fact that you're feeling shame and doubt, but you're focusing on the sensations and the sounds around you. It's a small, small step, but it might help you feel more present and less overwhelmed.

Can you try to focus on the steam coming out of the kettle? Can you notice the sound of the steam hissing? Just for a moment, can you try to be present in the moment, without thinking about the future or the past?

Patient: Okay — I watched the steam for a moment and felt my chest loosen a little, the warm scent almost like that studio light. But then that old memory and shame sneak back in and my brain insists the calm is temporary — as soon as the kettle cools the whole collapse sequel starts again. I’m not sure I follow how this helps long-term; can we slow down and pick one tiny step that feels like actual progress and not just a band-aid?

Therapist: I can see that the moment of calm was brief, and the shame and doubt are already creeping back in. It's like the steam was a small comfort, but it's not enough to make a lasting change.

Let's take a step back and look at this from a different perspective. Instead of trying to change your entire emotional landscape, let's focus on a small, tiny step that might help you feel more grounded and present. It's not about fixing everything, it's about finding one small thing that you can do to take care of yourself, even if it's just for a moment.

Can you think of one small thing that you used to do for yourself, when you were feeling okay? Maybe it was taking a short walk, or reading a book, or talking to a friend. Whatever it was, can you try to do that one small thing again? Not to fix everything, but just to take care of yourself for a moment.

It's not about progress, it's about taking care of yourself. It's about finding one small way to feel more present, more grounded, and more connected to yourself, even if it's just for a moment. Can you try to do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try a short walk, like ten minutes around the block. I’m already bracing that it’ll just be a tiny temporary thing and that when I get back the movie will be louder and I’ll reach for a drink, but I’ll try — can we keep talking while I go so I don’t spiral?

Therapist: I'll keep talking while you walk. Just take your time, and try to focus on your breathing and the sensation of your feet on the ground. Don't worry too much about what's going to happen when you get back, just take it one step at a time.

Can you tell me something about your walk so far? How's the air feeling? Is it cool or warm? Just noticing the details might help you stay present.

And don't worry if your mind starts to wander. Just acknowledge the thought and let it go. You can say to yourself, "Okay, I'm thinking about X, but I'm also taking a walk and feeling the sun on my skin." Just try to stay with it for a little while longer.

How's your breathing? Can you feel your chest expanding as you inhale? That's a good sign. Just try to keep that going for a few more minutes, and see where it takes you.

Oh, and one more thing. Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? It's a pretty simple thing, but it can be really grounding. Just try to focus on the feeling of your feet making contact with the earth, and see if that helps you feel more connected to yourself.

Patient: The air’s cool and a little sharp, my chest was tight at first but breathing’s loosening when I focus on the steps — my feet feel heavy but steady. For a few breaths the movie quiets, then the shame sneaks back and my brain’s already scripting the next scene: I’ll drink to blot it out, miss work, lose clients, and everything I’ve built gets wiped out. Saying that out loud helps a bit—can we keep talking while I finish the walk? I need us to move slow and pick one tiny thing to notice next so I don’t get swallowed by the predictions.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that the walk is helping to calm you down a bit. The cool air and the sensation of your feet touching the ground can be really grounding.

Let's try to focus on one tiny thing at a time. As you finish your walk, can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground again? It's a simple thing, but it can be really helpful to focus on the physical sensation of your body.

And when you're ready, can you try to notice the sounds around you? Not just the noise of the wind or the birds, but any other sounds that are present. It might be the sound of a car driving by, or the hum of a machine in the distance.

Let's take it slow, and focus on one thing at a time. We're not trying to change everything at once, but rather just notice one tiny thing that's present in the moment. Can you try to do that for me?

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that it's normal to have these thoughts. But I also want to remind you that you're not alone, and that we're here to support you. Can you try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay?

Let's take a deep breath together and try to focus on the present moment. Can you try to notice your breath, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground?

Patient: Okay — I breathed and felt my feet on the ground and it loosened the tightness a bit, but that shame from before keeps barging back and I get flooded and confused like I can’t think straight. I don’t really know how focusing on breath stops the movie — can we slow down and pick one tiny, concrete next thing? Maybe something like setting a 5‑minute timer to sketch one quick line or sending one short text to a friend — something I can actually do while you stay with me so I don’t spiral. I’m bracing for it to go wrong, but I’ll try if we keep it super small.

Therapist: I can see that the shame and confusion are still present, and it's like the movie is still playing in the background. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We can take it one tiny step at a time, and I'll be right here with you every step of the way.

Let's take that 5-minute timer idea. Can you try to set it for just 5 minutes, and commit to doing one small thing during that time? Maybe it's as simple as drawing one line, or sending one text to a friend. Whatever it is, can you try to focus on that one thing, and not worry about the rest?

I'll be here with you, and I'll help you stay on track. We can do this one tiny step at a time, and see where it takes us. And remember, it's okay if it goes wrong. It's not about success or failure, it's about taking that first small step, and seeing where it leads.

So, let's set that timer, and get started. Can you try to set it for 5 minutes, and commit to doing one small thing during that time? I'll be right here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I’ll set the timer for five minutes and do one quick sketch, just one sweep across the page. I’m already bracing that the old shame will crash in and I’ll want to bail or reach for a drink, so can you stay with me and tell me to take a slow breath if I start panicking? If I blurt out that it’s “pointless” or start scripting the disaster, call me on it and ask what just happened — I need someone to interrupt the sequel.

Therapist: I'll be right here with you, and I'll help you stay on track. Let's set that timer for 5 minutes, and you can do that quick sketch. Just remember, it's okay if it's not perfect, it's just a small step.

When you start, I want you to take a slow breath with me. Inhale... 1... 2... 3... Hold it... 1... 2... 3... Exhale... 1... 2... 3... Just take a slow breath, and try to relax. Don't worry about what's going to happen next, just focus on the present moment.

If you start to feel anxious or your mind starts to wander, I want you to take another slow breath, and come back to the present moment. If you blurt out that it's "pointless" or start scripting the disaster, I'll call you on it. I'll ask, "What just happened? Where did that come from?" or "Can you tell me what's going on right now?" I'll interrupt the sequel, because it's okay to acknowledge it, and it's okay to take a step back.

Let's do this, one small step at a time. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay — timer’s set and I’m ready, even though my hands are shaky and my head’s already scripting that this will look awful and I’ll drink to erase the shame afterward. I don’t really get how five minutes fixes anything, but I’ll do one slow sweep now — if I panic or say it’s “pointless,” call me on it and ask where that came from. Starting the line…

Therapist: I can see that your hands are shaking, and your head is already anticipating the worst. But I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be nervous, and it's okay to not know how to do this.

As you start the line, I want you to take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of the pen moving across the paper. Just focus on the line, and try not to worry about how it's going to look. It's just five minutes, and it's not about creating a masterpiece. It's just about taking one small step.

If you start to feel anxious or your mind starts to wander, I want you to take another deep breath and come back to the present moment. I'll be right here with you, and I'll help you stay on track.

Where are you on the line? Is it starting to take shape, or are you still thinking about it?

Patient: The line’s there — shaky, a little wobble, but it’s a line. My brain’s already yelling that it’s garbage, I’ll drink to erase it tonight, and that’ll be proof the whole collapse is real. I’m pissed and ashamed that this memory-surge keeps hijacking me and I can feel the panic rising. Can you call me on the “pointless” thought now like we agreed and ask where that came from?

Therapist: I can see that the line is shaking, and your brain is already telling you that it's not good enough. But I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be frustrated and ashamed.

But I also want to call you out on that "pointless" thought. Where did that come from? It sounds like it's just a way of sabotaging yourself, of giving up before you even try. But I want you to know that it's not pointless. This line, this small act of creating something, it's not just about the end result. It's about the process, the journey, the small steps you take towards healing and growth.

Can you tell me more about what's behind that "pointless" thought? Is it fear, shame, or something else? Let's explore it together, and see if we can find a way to reframe it, to make it more positive and empowering.

Patient: It comes from that old shame — a mix of fear and this steady conviction I'm a fraud. When I think "pointless," it's that shame shouting that whatever I do will just lead to the same collapse (I’ll drink, I’ll erase it, it’ll prove I never deserved the good moments), and I can see the whole sequel playing out so other outcomes feel impossible. Call me on it — ask me “what’s the evidence for that?” or “what just happened?” — don’t let me skate past it. Stay with me; I’m bracing but I want to keep going.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is really driving that "pointless" thought, and it's not just about being frustrated or anxious. It's a deep-seated conviction that you're not good enough, that you'll always end up failing, and that's what's driving you to self-sabotage.

I want to call you out on that shame, because it's not just a feeling, it's a narrative that's been repeated over and over again. And I want to ask you, what's the evidence for that "pointless" thought? What's the proof that you're a fraud? Is it just a feeling, or is it something that's been perpetuated by others, by society, by your own self-talk?

Let's explore this together, and see if we can find a way to reframe that narrative, to make it more compassionate and realistic. I'm here to support you, and I'm not going to let you skate past this. We're going to dig in, and see if we can't find a way to break free from that shame and find a new way forward. Are you ready to do that?

Patient: I want to, but I'm already bracing—my brain says the evidence is obvious: every time I numbed, I slept, missed work, a client ghosted, money got tight, so in my head that's proof the same collapse will happen again. If we start poking at it I can feel the panic and that shame surge, and I know I'll reach for a drink—so to me digging feels like it just hands the sequel a script. Okay—do it: call me on “pointless,” ask “what’s the evidence?” and “what just happened?” — but stay slow and keep it to one tiny step so I don't get swallowed by the predictions.

Patient: Uh — I didn’t follow that. That last message sounded like static and now I feel that old shame slam back in; my chest’s tight and my head’s already scripting the sequel where I drink, mess up, and everything falls apart. Can you do what we agreed — call me on the “pointless” thought and ask, “What’s the evidence for that?” and “What just happened?” — but keep it slow. I’m bracing hard, so talk me through it step by step.

Patient: I didn’t follow that — it sounded like static and now that old shame slammed into my chest. My head’s already spitting the sequel where I drink, mess up, and everything collapses, so I’m bracing hard. Please — ask me, “What’s the evidence for that ‘pointless’ thought?” and “What just happened?” — but keep it slow and stay with me while I answer.
