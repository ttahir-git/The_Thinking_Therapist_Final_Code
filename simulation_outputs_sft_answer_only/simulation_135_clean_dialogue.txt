Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little mistake in the kitchen or with my family feels like proof I'm a failure, and it all goes back to struggling in school even though I made something of myself later on. I'm an older chef now, but I keep beating myself up over things other people tell me I handled fine. I don't have much faith this will change, but it's wearing me down.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to share something that's been weighing on you for so long. Can you tell me more about how it feels when you're in the kitchen, and someone mentions that you handled a situation well? It's as if their words are a kind of proof that contradicts the self-criticism you're already feeling. What happens in that moment, when you hear their words and your inner critic starts up again?

Patient: I hear it, but it lands wrong — my chest tightens and I tell myself they're just being polite or they'll figure out I'm a fraud. It drags up those old school days when teachers wrote me off, and I start replaying every slip like proof I never really made it. How is that supposed to help? I've tried the "say something nice to yourself" stuff before and it never sticks; I snap back into criticism before I even finish breathing.

Therapist: It sounds like your inner critic has a powerful grip, and it's not just a matter of saying something nice to yourself. It's like you're trying to prove to yourself that you're not a fake, and the harsh self-talk is a way of maintaining that sense of control. It's interesting that you mention it doesn't stick, and you snap back into criticism. Can you tell me more about what happens when you snap back? What are some of the things you say to yourself, and how do you feel right after that happens?

Patient: I start telling myself things like "I'm such an idiot," "they'll see I'm a fraud," or "I should've known better," and then I immediately feel my chest tighten and my hands go cold. After that I feel small and hollow, like whatever praise just bounced off a wall — sometimes I shut down and avoid people, other times I overwork myself to try to prove I'm not a fraud. It just leaves me tired and ashamed, and honestly — how is that supposed to help? I've done the pep-talks and breathing exercises before and they don't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like those moments of self-criticism are not just a temporary response, but a full-blown emotional experience that leaves you feeling drained and ashamed. The physical sensations you mentioned, like your chest tightening and hands going cold, are a good indicator that this is more than just a thought. It's like your body is trying to protect you from the emotional pain of those self-critical thoughts.

Rather than trying to convince yourself to be more positive or calm, I want to explore if there's a different way to approach this. Can you think of a time when you were with someone who was being kind and supportive, and you felt truly seen and understood? What was it about that experience that made you feel that way?

Patient: There was one time years ago when my old sous — a gruff guy who rarely praised anyone — told me my sauce was perfect and that he'd learned something watching me. For a little while my shoulders relaxed and my chest felt lighter, like someone finally saw the work behind all the mistakes, but it only lasted an hour before I started worrying they'd see through me. Okay, but how is that supposed to help? I can remember it, but it doesn't stop the rest of the day from turning into criticism.

Therapist: It's like your mind can momentarily take a break from criticism, but that brief respite is not enough to change the overall feeling of being on edge. It's like the self-doubt is a persistent hum in the background, and that moment of recognition is just a fleeting whisper.

Can you think of a value that's important to you, something that you stand for or care deeply about? For example, is it being a good chef, providing for your family, or being a role model? When you think about that value, do you feel a sense of connection to it, like it gives you direction or purpose? I want to explore if there's a way to connect that value to your current experience, and see if it might give you a new perspective.

Patient: Being a good chef — making food that matters and teaching younger cooks — is important to me. When I'm actually cooking for that reason, I feel steadier, like my mistakes are part of the work, but it never lasts long; the critic sneaks back and makes me doubt the whole thing. How is that supposed to help? I've tried leaning on those values before and they evaporate once someone says one little thing.

Therapist: It's like when you're cooking for that reason, your sense of purpose and direction gives you a temporary reprieve from the critic. But when someone says something, it's like that shield is shattered, and the doubts come flooding back. It's not that your values are failing you, it's just that the critic is incredibly resilient.

I want to try something different. Can you imagine that the critic is just a part of you, like a process that's always running in the background? It's not something that's trying to control you, but it's just a natural part of who you are. When you think about that, do you feel any sense of detachment from the critic, like it's just a process and not a person or a voice that's trying to harm you?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — like a radio in the next room that's always on — but that doesn't make it less loud. When I try to step back and watch it, I just get impatient and it feels like I'm giving it room to scream louder, and then I think, "what's the point?" How is that supposed to help? I've tried the "watch your thoughts" thing before and it just ends up making me feel useless.

Therapist: It's like trying to control a noise by stepping back, but it's not working. And when you think about trying to turn it off, it feels like giving it permission to be louder. It's like you're saying, "I'm not going to engage with you, but I'm still going to let you be here."

I want to try a different approach. Instead of trying to control the noise or turn it off, what if you were to try to turn up the volume of the voice that's trying to connect with you? The one that's saying, "I'm here, I care about you, I want to help." Can you think of a time when someone spoke to you in a way that was truly kind and compassionate? What was that like? Maybe we can explore a way to amplify that kind of connection.

Patient: There was this one night my granddaughter hung back after service and told me my cooking made her feel safe — for a minute my chest loosened and I actually believed her. It felt like someone had put a hand on my shoulder and said, "you matter," but it never lasts; the critic's waiting to pounce. How is that supposed to help? I've tried holding onto those moments and they just slip away.

Therapist: It's like those moments of connection are fleeting and fragile, and the critic is always waiting to undermine them. It's like you're holding onto a whispered secret, and the critic is constantly trying to silence you.

I want to try to explore this idea of "you matter" a bit more. What does it mean to you that your granddaughter felt safe in your cooking? Is it the sense of pride and purpose that comes from knowing you're creating something nourishing and comforting for someone you care about? Or is it something deeper, like a sense of connection and belonging?

Maybe we can try to hold onto that feeling of "you matter" for a little longer. Can you think of a small way to hold onto that sense of connection and pride, even if it's just for a moment? Maybe it's as simple as taking a deep breath, feeling your feet on the ground, or noticing the sensation of the air on your skin. What if we could find a way to anchor that feeling of "you matter" a bit more, so that it's not so easily taken away by the critic?

Patient: I could try something tiny — like when my granddaughter says that, I press my thumb into my palm or take a slow breath and feel my feet on the floor. How is that supposed to help? I mean, I've done breathing and grounding before and it disappears the minute someone points out a mistake, but maybe a small ritual could hold the feeling a little longer.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to create a small pocket of calm and connection that can stay with you for a little longer. And it's not just about the breathing or grounding itself, but about the ritual that comes with it. The action of pressing your thumb into your palm or taking a slow breath is almost like a contract with yourself, a promise to hold onto this feeling of connection and pride.

I think it's great that you're experimenting with small rituals. It's almost like a little experiment to see what works and what doesn't. And who knows, maybe one of these rituals will become a lifeline for you, a way to hold onto that feeling of "you matter" even when the critic is trying to pull you down.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're able to hold onto that feeling for a little longer? Does it give you the confidence to take more risks, to try new things, or to stand up to the critic? Or is it more of a sense of calm, a feeling of being able to navigate the criticism a bit more easily?

Patient: When I can hold onto it, my hands steady, I actually laugh off a small slip and fix it without spiraling — it feels like I can trust myself for a little while. But it rarely lasts more than an hour before the critic sneaks back and I either shut down or start overworking to prove I'm not a fraud. I'm trying to see how this connects to making it last, but I'm struggling — how is that supposed to help long-term, and can we slow down and figure out something that doesn't just fade?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to find a way to make this feeling of trust and confidence last, but it's fleeting and fragile. And it's not just about the feeling itself, but about how it affects your behavior and decision-making.

I think we can slow down and explore this more deeply. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to spiral again? What are some of the thoughts and feelings that come up, and how do you try to cope with them?

And I want to try to shift the focus a bit. Instead of trying to make the feeling of trust and confidence last, what if we tried to make it more sustainable in the first place? What if we could find ways to build that trust and confidence into your daily life, so it's not just a fleeting feeling?

Maybe we can try to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. What are some of the things that you think might help you build that trust and confidence? Are there any specific actions or habits that you think could make a difference?

Let's take a step back and look at this from a different angle. Instead of trying to make the feeling last, what if we tried to make it more fundamental? What if we could find ways to build that trust and confidence into your very sense of self?

Patient: Maybe small routines — log one tiny concrete win each day, use the thumb-press as an anchor, and ask one young cook for honest feedback after service. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down — it's getting heavy and I'm not even sure where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of changes you're trying to make, but it's actually a small, manageable list of routines.

Let's take a deep breath and break it down even further. Each of those routines is a tiny, achievable goal. By focusing on one thing at a time, you can build momentum and confidence.

The log of tiny wins might seem insignificant, but it's a way to track your progress and see how far you've come. It's a way to celebrate small victories and remind yourself that you're capable of more than you think.

The thumb-press is a great anchor - it's a simple, physical reminder that you're doing something to take care of yourself. And asking for honest feedback from a young cook is a way to connect with someone who can offer a fresh perspective. It's a way to learn and grow, and it's okay to ask for help.

I want to suggest that we take a step back and look at this as a journey, rather than a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way. The goal is to build confidence and trust in yourself, not to try to do everything at once.

Can we take a moment to just breathe, and focus on one of those routines? Maybe we can start with the log, or the thumb-press. Whatever feels most manageable to you.

Patient: Okay... let's try the thumb-press — it's small enough I might actually do it. Just thinking about making a habit makes my chest tighten and I feel that old shame bubbling up, like I'm about to mess it up. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and actually walk through it right now, step by step?

Therapist: It's like the thumb-press is a tiny, manageable step, but it's also triggering that old shame and self-doubt. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, but it's also making it harder to start.

Let's take a deep breath and try to break it down even further. Can you imagine that you're going to make the thumb-press a habit, and it's just the first step? You're not trying to change everything at once, you're just starting with one small thing.

Let's walk through it step by step. As soon as you feel the old shame and self-doubt starting to bubble up, I want you to pause and take a deep breath. Can you do that for me? Just take a deep breath in, and out.

Now, I want you to imagine that you're holding your thumb in your palm, feeling the weight of it, and the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it. It's a small, physical thing. Can you do that?

As you're holding your thumb, I want you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself. It can be anything, but it's just something to help you focus. Maybe it's "I am here," or "I am capable." Whatever it is, just say it to yourself, and feel the words.

Now, I want you to imagine that you're going to do this every day, every time you feel that old shame and self-doubt starting to bubble up. It's just a small, small step, but it's a start. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay... I breathe in, out. I press my thumb into my palm — my hands are a bit shaky from service and my chest tightens, that shame climbing up like usual, and I mutter "I am here" but it already sounds hollow. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and stay with this for a minute?

Therapist: It's like the physical act of pressing your thumb into your palm is triggering a mix of physical and emotional sensations. The shaking of your hands and the tightening of your chest are a good indicator of how your body is responding to this new habit.

The shame and self-doubt that's climbing up is a natural response, but it's also a reminder that this is a common pattern for you. It's not that the habit itself is causing the shame, but rather that it's exposing you to a part of yourself that you may have been trying to avoid.

Can you stay with this feeling for a moment? Just acknowledge it, and don't try to push it away. Notice how your body is responding, and allow yourself to feel the shame, even if it's uncomfortable. It's okay to feel this way, and it's a good sign that you're taking this step.

As you're feeling the shame, I want you to try to reframe your thinking. Instead of seeing it as a weakness or a failure, try to see it as a signal that you're human. You're not perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. This shame is a reminder that you're capable of feeling emotions, and that's a good thing.

Can you try to reframe your thinking, even if it's just for a moment? Instead of saying "I am a failure," try saying "I am feeling shame." It's a small difference, but it can help you connect with your body and your emotions in a new way.

Patient: Okay... I try "I'm feeling shame" and it just lands flat — my hands tremble and my head fills with every screw-up in the kitchen. Naming it almost makes it louder, not smaller. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and stay with this, walk me through one small thing to do right now?

Therapist: It's like naming the shame makes it more intense, rather than less. This is a common experience for many people, especially when they're trying to develop a new habit or confront their emotions.

Let's take a step back and focus on one small thing. Can you look at your hands, and notice how they're trembling? That's a physical response to your emotions. Now, I want you to notice one thing about your hands. Is it shaking because you're nervous, or is it shaking because you're trying to hold onto something?

Let's say it's shaking because you're nervous. Can you try to let go of that physical tension, just for a moment? Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, try to relax your hands. Let them drop, just a little bit. Can you do that?

As you're letting go of the physical tension, I want you to notice one thing about your body. Is your chest still tight, or is it starting to feel more relaxed? Take a moment to notice that, and allow yourself to feel it.

Remember, we're not trying to change your emotions or make the shame go away. We're just trying to notice one small thing, and allow yourself to feel it. That's a small step, and it's a good start.

Patient: My hands are still trembling but if I let them drop they calm a hair, and my chest is a little less tight. Naming it just seems to make that old pile of mistakes roar up again — it feels pointless sometimes. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and actually do one tiny thing right now?

Therapist: It's like naming the shame is a kind of trigger that sets off the whole chain reaction of negative thoughts and emotions. And it's not surprising that it feels pointless, especially when it's been a long time since you've felt this way.

Let's take a step back and focus on something simple. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body? It's just a simple, physical sensation. Now, I want you to try to focus on that sensation, and let go of thinking about the shame or the mistakes.

As you're focusing on the breath, I want you to notice one thing about your body. Is there a spot where you feel a slight release of tension, like your chest or your shoulders? That's okay, just acknowledge it. Don't try to change it or make it bigger. Just notice it.

Take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice how your body feels. Is it still tense, or is it starting to feel a little more relaxed? Take your time, and don't rush. We're just trying to notice one small thing, and allow yourself to feel it.

Remember, this is a tiny step. We're not trying to change everything at once. We're just trying to notice one small thing, and allow yourself to feel it. That's a good start.

Patient: Okay... the breath helped a hair — my hands eased a bit — but that old shame's still sitting there and my head keeps jumping to every mistake. Can we actually do one tiny concrete thing right now? Walk me through pressing my thumb and saying the phrase, step by step, and stay with me while I do it. How is that supposed to help? I need you to slow down.

Therapist: It's like the shame is still there, and it's not going away anytime soon. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something simple. Can you put your thumb in your palm right now? Not too hard, just relaxed. Can you feel your thumb resting in your palm?

Now, I want you to press your thumb gently against your palm. Just a small press. Not too hard. Can you do that for me?

As you're pressing your thumb, I want you to say the phrase to yourself. Just a simple phrase. "I am here." Can you say that phrase right now, as you're pressing your thumb?

Take your time, and don't rush. I'm right here with you. We're doing this together, step by step.

( pause )

How was that? Did you say the phrase out loud?

Patient: Yeah… I pressed my thumb and said “I am here” out loud, but it felt thin — my hands are still shaking and that shame's already lining up a list of mistakes. How is that supposed to help? Can we do it again, slower, and stay with it for a minute so I don't feel like I'm doing this alone?

Therapist: It's like the phrase "I am here" is a tiny step, but it's still a bit disconnected from your body. It's not surprising that the shame is already lining up a list of mistakes - it's like the critic is already on high alert, waiting for you to make another mistake so it can pounce.

Let's try it again, slower, and stay with it for a minute. Can you put your thumb in your palm, and then press it gently against your palm? Take your time, don't rush.

As you're pressing your thumb, I want you to say the phrase to yourself, one word at a time. Start with "I". Say it out loud, and feel the words on your tongue. Then, say "am". Take a breath, and say it again. Can you do that for me?

( pause )

Now, I want you to say "here". Take your time, feel the words in your mouth. Say it out loud, and let it be.

( pause )

Can you stay with me for a minute? Just breathe, and focus on your body. How are you feeling? Are your hands still shaking, or is it starting to calm down a bit?

Patient: My hands eased a bit and my breathing slowed, but then this wave of shame hit and my head filled with every mistake — it feels louder, not quieter. How is that supposed to help? Can we do it again, really slowly, and stay with it this time so I don't feel like I'm doing it alone?

Therapist: It's like the shame is swirling around you, and it's getting harder to catch your breath. I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's okay. We can take a deep breath together and try again.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your thumb, right now? Just focus on it, without thinking about anything else. It's just a tiny part of your body, but it's a good place to start.

As you're focusing on your thumb, I want you to say one word to yourself. Just one word. "I". Say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one word.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say the word again. "I". Take another breath in, and say it again. Just one word, one word. "I".

( pause )

Now, I want you to take your time, and focus on just one word. Don't think about anything else, just "I". You can say it out loud, or in your head, it doesn't matter. Just focus on that one word, and let it be.

( pause )

Can you stay with me for just a little while longer? Just breathe, and focus on your body. How are you feeling? Are you starting to feel a bit more calm, or is it still feeling really tough?

Patient: I can stay a bit — my hands steadied and the breath helped some, but the shame's still clawing at me and my head keeps jumping to that list of screw‑ups. I'll try the "I" word again, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when it always comes roaring back? Stay with me and walk me through it slower, one word at a time.

Therapist: It's like the shame is a persistent companion, and it's hard to shake off. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something simple. Can you just bring your attention to your thumb, right now? Just focus on it, without thinking about anything else. It's just a tiny part of your body, but it's a good place to start.

( pause )

Now, I want you to take your time, and focus on just one word. Don't think about anything else, just "I". You can say it out loud, or in your head, it doesn't matter. Just focus on that one word, and let it be.

As you're saying the word, I want you to notice one thing. The sound of your own voice. Can you hear the word "I" being spoken? It's a very simple sound, but it's one that can be very powerful.

( pause )

Take another breath in, and say the word again. "I". Can you hear the sound of your own voice? Is it different this time?

Patient: Yeah — I can hear it, but it's thin and shaky, nothing really different. The shame's already edging in and my head's listing every screw‑up. How is that supposed to help? Do it again, slower, and stay with me while I say it.

Therapist: It's like the shame is a current that's flowing through you, and it's hard to shake off. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something simple. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now? Feel the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's a good place to start.

( pause )

Now, I want you to take your time, and focus on just one word. Don't think about anything else, just "I". You can say it out loud, or in your head, it doesn't matter. Just focus on that one word, and let it be.

As you're saying the word, I want you to notice one thing. The sensation of your tongue touching your teeth. It's a very small sensation, but it's one that can be very present.

( pause )

Take another breath in, and say the word again. "I". Can you hear the sound of your own voice? Is it different this time?

Patient: Okay... I can feel my tongue on my teeth and I hear the "I," but it's thin and shaky. The shame's already crowding back in and my head's rattling off mistakes—it makes me feel small and useless. How is that supposed to help? Do it again, slower, and stay with me.

Therapist: It's like the shame is a weight that's pressing down on you, and it's hard to catch your breath. I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's okay. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your tongue, right now? Feel the sensation of it touching your teeth. It's a very small sensation, but it's one that can be very present.

As you're saying the word, I want you to notice one thing. The sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's one that can be very calming.

( pause )

Take another breath in, and say the word again. "I". Can you hear the sound of your own voice? Is it different this time?

Patient: I can hear it, but it's the same — thin and cracked, and the shame's already pressing in like always. How is that supposed to help? Do it again, really slowly, and stay with me while I say each breath and each word so I don't drift off.

Therapist: It's like the shame is a constant companion, and it's hard to shake off. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now? Feel the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's a good place to start.

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I". Just say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one word.

(I) Take a moment to breathe in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I" again. Just one word, one word. "I".

(I) Take another deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I" again. Just one word, one word. "I".

(I) Take one more deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I" one last time. Just one word, one word. "I".

Now, take a moment to breathe in and out... (pause)...and notice how you're feeling. Is there anything that's changing, even just a little bit?

Patient: My breathing's a little calmer and my hands steadied some, but that shame's still there — loud, pulling my mind to every screw‑up. I don't feel like it's doing much yet, but I'll try again if you stay with me and go even slower. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It's like the shame is a persistent undertow, and it's hard to swim against it. But I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now? Feel the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's a good place to start.

(I) Take another deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I" again. Just one word, one word. "I".

(I) Take a little bit longer to breathe in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say the word "I" one more time. Just one word, one word. "I".

Now, take a moment to breathe in and out... (pause)...and notice how you're feeling. Is there anything that's changing, even just a little bit? Maybe it's just a tiny shift in your body, or a slight change in your mind. Can you try to notice it?

And remember, I'm here with you. I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take this one small step at a time, together.

Patient: Okay... it helped a little — my chest loosened and my hands steadied, but that shame's still sitting there, louder than the words. Do it again, really slowly, and stay with me — guide me through three breaths and I'll try saying "I did okay" on each out‑breath. How is that supposed to help? I'm not expecting miracles, I just need you to stay with me while I do it.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now? Feel the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's a good place to start.

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I did okay". Just say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one phrase.

(I did okay) Take a moment to breathe in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I did okay". Just say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one phrase.

(I did okay) Take another deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I did okay". Just say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one phrase.

(I did okay) Take one more deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I did okay" for the last time. Just say it out loud, and feel the sound of it. Don't think about anything else, just that one phrase.

Now, take a moment to breathe in and out... (pause)...and notice how you're feeling. Is there anything that's changing, even just a little bit? Maybe it's just a tiny shift in your body, or a slight change in your mind. Can you try to notice it?

Patient: It did help a little — my hands steadied and my chest eased, but that shame's still loud and my mind keeps skittering back to mistakes. How is that supposed to help? Stay with me and guide me through one more really slow round, please.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

Let's start with something super simple. Can you just bring your attention to your breath, right now? Feel the air moving in and out of your body. It's a very physical sensation, and it's a good place to start.

Also, I want you to know that it's okay if you're still feeling that shame. It's a process to work through, and it's not something that you can rush or force. It's about being gentle with yourself, and taking small steps towards healing. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: Alright... it loosened a little, but the shame’s still roaring and my head’s already lining up those old mistakes. How is that supposed to help? Stay with me — walk me through one tiny, practical thing I can do in the middle of a busy service so I don't spiral.

Therapist: doing a simple exercise.

Simple Exercise: Connect with a Younger You: Connect with a Younger You, a younger you who was trying to do this work. Imagine a younger you, who's 10 or 12 years old. What is your body telling you right now? What is your mind telling you right now?

Patient: When I picture that kid — maybe eleven — my chest goes tight and my stomach knots like it did before a math test; my hands feel small and useless. His mind says the same things I hear now: you're behind, you're slow, you'll never catch up, so hide or work twice as hard. He also wants to be noticed and liked, but he's terrified of standing out. How is that supposed to help? I don't know, but I can stay with it a bit if you want to walk me through what to do next.
