Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — like my whole identity is just tied up in the business and I don't know what matters beyond that. Since the kids left it's been louder in my head and I keep second-guessing everything about who I am now. I don't really like talking about this, I guess, but it's been on my mind a lot.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to bring this up, especially when it feels so personal. Can you tell me more about what you mean by your whole identity being tied up in the business? How have you noticed that feeling change, especially since the kids left?

Patient: I don't know, it's like the business became the thing that proves I'm useful — my calendar, my clients, the money, that's how I measure myself now. Since the kids left it's this quiet space where I expect to feel... I don't know, free? Instead it just feels empty and everything about me shrinks to work. I guess I avoid thinking about it because it gets messy and I don't really like going there.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the silence after the kids left has been a bit of a shock, and you're not sure how to navigate this new dynamic. It's like your sense of purpose and identity was tied up in being a parent, and now that's gone. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to think about who you are now, without the business or the kids? Do you find yourself getting anxious or avoiding certain thoughts?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to picture myself without the business or the kids it just goes blank, like I'm looking at someone I don't recognize. I get anxious, my chest tightens, and I start doing busywork or scrolling to not feel it. I guess I'm scared I'll find out there's nothing else there, so I avoid thinking about it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to protect yourself from a feeling of uncertainty or loss. Can you bring me back to that blank space for a moment? What does it feel like when it goes blank? Is it a numbness, a hollowness, or something else? Sometimes, by acknowledging and noticing our emotions, we can start to make room for them.

Patient: I don't know — it's mostly hollow, like a quiet blankness that feels numb more than anything. My chest gets tight and I start watching myself from the outside, like I'm not really in the room. I guess I distract myself because I'm scared if I look too closely I'll fall apart.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to observe yourself from a safe distance, to avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed. That numbness and the distraction you mentioned, it's almost like a coping mechanism, a way to keep yourself from feeling too much. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you say you're scared if you look too closely you'll fall apart? What does falling apart feel like for you in that moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess falling apart feels physical, like my hands tremble, my chest squeezes, and then I start crying and can't really get myself back together. It scares me because I worry people will see I'm a mess and that everything I've built will feel pointless, like there's nothing left of me beyond the business. I don't really like going deeper into this right now — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're afraid of confronting the vulnerability and uncertainty that comes with falling apart. It's completely understandable that you'd want to slow down and take care of yourself in this moment. Can we take a step back and breathe together for a moment? No rush, just a slow, deep breath in and out. Sometimes, pausing and being present with our emotions can help us feel a bit more grounded.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. I breathed in and out slowly — it helped a little, my chest unclenched some, but I'm still shaky and it feels awkward doing it. I don't know, I guess I feel kind of exposed when we slow down like this, can we take it more gently or just talk for a minute instead?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like slowing down makes you feel more aware of your vulnerability, and that can be uncomfortable. I'm not trying to make you feel exposed, but rather, I want to create a space where we can talk more gently. Let's take it one step at a time. Instead of focusing on breathing, why don't we talk about what you do like when you're trying to avoid feeling this way? What are some things you do to distract yourself or cope with these feelings?

Patient: I don't know — mostly I bury myself in work, do a bunch of busywork or mindless scrolling until I feel numb, and sometimes I have a glass of wine to quiet it down and then feel guilty. I guess I also do little creative things like sketching or rearranging things around the shop because they're safe and controllable, but I never finish them. Can we... talk about ways to make small changes? I get nervous when it feels like we might dig too deep.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using a mix of coping mechanisms to deal with these feelings, and some of them can be helpful in the moment, but maybe not so much in the long run. It's like you're trying to manage the symptoms, but not really addressing the underlying stuff.

Let's talk about making small changes. I'm not suggesting we do anything drastic or overwhelming. Can you tell me about one of these small things you do, like sketching or rearranging things in the shop? What does it feel like when you do it, and what do you think it's helping you with? Maybe we can build from there.

Patient: I guess sketching is the one that feels manageable. When I sketch I get this quiet focus — my mind settles and I can control something small — but I never finish things because I start doubting they're any good and then feel stupid about it. I don't know, it sort of shows me there's something besides the business, but I get nervous talking about it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like sketching is a way for you to get some quiet focus and control, even if it's just for a small amount of time. The fact that you feel nervous talking about it, though, suggests that there's something specific about it that's making you feel uncertain or self-conscious.

Can you try to separate the fact that you're creating something from the fear of it not being good enough? Sometimes, when we're creating, our minds can get caught up in the idea that it's perfect, and that's when we start to doubt ourselves. What if we explored the idea that it's okay if your drawings aren't perfect, and that the act of creating itself is what's valuable, not the end result?

Patient: I don't know — maybe you're right, the making part does feel calming and like I'm allowed to mess up. But I almost always think it'll look stupid and stop. Could we talk about tiny, low-pressure steps to keep going with a sketch so it feels less scary? I'm nervous about digging too deep, so can we keep it gentle.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on taking tiny, low-pressure steps to help you feel more comfortable with sketching. Sometimes, it's the small actions that can add up to make a big difference.

Why don't we start with something super simple? What if you just commit to drawing for one minute a day, no matter what it looks like? It's a tiny commitment, and it might help you build momentum. We can even start with a prompt, like drawing something you see outside the window, to get you started.

How does that sound? Is it something you'd be willing to try?

Patient: I guess I can try the one-minute thing — that feels small enough that I won't panic. I don't know if I'll remember to do it though; could we make it even gentler, like setting a phone timer and giving me a really dumb, low-stakes prompt so it feels silly not serious? Also... I'm already worrying I'll stop after a day because I think it's stupid — what do I do when that doubt hits?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
The phone timer can help make it feel even more low-key and silly. Let's try a super simple prompt, like drawing a dot. Just a single dot. That's it. No need to think about it too much.

When that doubt hits, can you try to notice it, but not act on it? Like, if you think, "This is stupid, I'll never do it again," you could just pause for a moment and say, "Okay, I'm thinking that right now. But I'm also going to draw that dot." It's like acknowledging the doubt, but not letting it take over.

We can also try to reframe the thinking a bit. Instead of thinking, "This is stupid," try telling yourself, "I'm trying something new, and it's okay if it's not perfect." It's like giving yourself permission to make mistakes, and that can be really helpful.

How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add or try?

Patient: Okay... I can try the dot thing and set a timer — that feels stupidly small, so maybe I won't panic. I already feel this prickly shame and frustration bubbling up, like something from before that makes the doubt scream louder, and then I want to quit before I start. I don't know, I guess I'll try the "I'm thinking that" trick when it hits, but can we also make a tiny fallback plan? Like if I miss a day I just put an X on a sticky note instead of beating myself up — can we keep it really gentle?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
The sticky note idea is a great way to have a gentle fallback plan. It's like having a safety net, but still allowing you to take responsibility for your actions.

When you put the X on the sticky note, can you try to say something like, "Okay, I missed a day. That's okay. I'll try again tomorrow." Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge it as a small setback and move on.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to miss a day or two. It's not a failure if you don't stick to it perfectly. It's all about being kind to yourself and finding a way to get back on track.

Let's make a deal. If you miss a day, you put an X on the sticky note, and then you try to get back to drawing that dot. But if you don't miss a day, we can celebrate it as a small win and keep moving forward. Sound good?

Patient: Okay, deal — I'll try the dot and the sticky-note fallback. I already feel this prickly shame and frustration bubbling up from something else, and it makes me want to quit before I even start, so I guess I'm nervous about actually doing it. Can we also set a tiny phone reminder and come up with one super-forgiving phrase I can say to myself when the shame gets loud? I don't know what that phrase should be — can you help me with one?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're feeling more ready to move forward.

Let's set a tiny phone reminder for, say, 10 minutes before your drawing time. That way, you'll have a little bit of time to get settled and calm down before you start.

As for a super-forgiving phrase, I've got one that might work for you: "I am showing up." Repeat that to yourself whenever the shame and frustration start to kick in. It's a simple phrase that reminds you that you're taking the first step, and that's something to be proud of. It's not about creating a perfect piece of art; it's about showing up and being present in the moment.

When you feel the shame and frustration creeping in, take a deep breath and say it to yourself: "I am showing up." Try to focus on the words, and not the emotions. You can even say it out loud, if it feels more comfortable.

How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add or try?

Patient: I guess that sounds okay — yeah, set the 10-minute reminder, that's probably helpful. I don't know, I worry "I am showing up" will feel empty when the shame spikes, so could we have a backup like "One dot is enough" or just "This is okay"? I'm already feeling that prickly shame and want to run, so can we keep the plan really small and check in after a few days instead of scheduling a bunch of stuff?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to make sure your backup plan is effective.

Let's keep the backup phrase simple and concise. "This is okay" is a great choice because it's a straightforward and compassionate statement. It acknowledges that it's okay to not be perfect, and it's a reminder that you're doing the best you can.

So, we'll stick with the backup phrase "This is okay" for now. If you find that it's not resonating with you, we can explore other options later.

As for the plan, I completely understand that you're not ready for a big commitment. Let's take it one step at a time. Why don't we check in after a few days to see how it's going? We can start with a simple check-in, just to see if you're feeling more comfortable with the dot and the reminder. No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle check-in to see how things are going.

How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add or try?

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try the dot with a 10-minute reminder and use "This is okay" when the shame spikes. I already feel that prickly shame and frustration bubbling up—like that old failure feeling—and I don't know if I'll stick with it, but the sticky-note fallback feels doable. Yeah, let's check in in a few days, but can we keep that check-in really short?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Remember, it's just a small step, and you can always stop if it doesn't feel right. If you're ready, we can schedule that 10-minute reminder and get started.

And don't worry if the shame spikes - that's exactly when you'll need to remind yourself, "This is okay." It's a gentle phrase, and it's there to help you calm down and keep going.

For the check-in, I promise it'll be super short. Just a quick yes or no: are you doing the dot today? That's it. No questions, no fuss. Just a simple confirmation.

Shall we get started?

Patient: Okay... I guess we'll get started — I'll set the 10‑minute reminder and try the dot. I'm already feeling that prickly shame and frustration bubbling up, like something from before, and it makes me want to quit before I even start. Can we keep the check‑in really, really short — just the quick yes/no — and remind me gently if I don't do it? I don't know, I'm nervous.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's make it super simple. Just commit to doing the dot for the next 10 minutes. If you need a reminder, I can send a gentle one to your phone. Just a quick "Hey, don't forget to take a minute to draw a dot."

When you're ready, just say "yes" to this simple question: "Did you draw a dot today?"

That's it. Just a yes or no, and we'll go from there.

Patient: No — I haven't done it yet. I'm already feeling that prickly shame and this frustrated urge to quit, I don't know... can you send that 10‑minute reminder? I guess I'll try if you do.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I've sent a gentle reminder to your phone for 10 minutes from now. It's just a simple notification: "Take a minute to draw a dot."

If you're still feeling that shame and frustration, don't worry. You can cancel the reminder at any time. Just let me know, and we'll stop for now.

Take a deep breath, and remember: "This is okay." You can try again whenever you're ready.

Patient: Okay... I already feel that prickly shame and that old failure feeling creeping in — my chest is tight and I’m nervous I’ll bail. The reminder’s fine, please nudge me gently if I ignore it but don’t be harsh. I don’t know if I’ll actually do it when it pings, but I’ll try to stay for the minute.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel that way, and it's okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts before proceeding.

When the 10-minute reminder pings, I'll send a gentle nudge to remind you to take a minute to draw a dot. The message will be simple: "Just 1 minute to draw a dot. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready."

If you're not feeling up to it, you can simply acknowledge the reminder and we can pause for now. No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle reminder to help you get started.

Take a few more deep breaths, and try to stay present for just one minute.

Patient: Okay... I'm already feeling that prickly shame and that old failure feeling — my chest's tight and part of me just wants to run. I don't know if I'll actually do it when it pings, but I'll try to stay for the minute; please just nudge me gently and don't make a big deal if I miss it.
