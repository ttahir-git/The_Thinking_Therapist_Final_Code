Patient: Lately I get paralyzed before any social event — my mind turns into this fortune-telling machine that insists everything will go wrong: I'll say something stupid, they'll all judge me, I'll embarrass myself, and then I'll be left out and alone. I'm usually outgoing and my partner tries to be supportive, but once that story starts I can't shake it, so I just avoid gatherings.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being caught up in that fortune-telling machine is a really tough experience for you, especially when it feels like it's holding you back from connecting with others and enjoying social events. Can you tell me more about what it's like to try and talk your way out of that narrative, or to attempt to do something valued, like seeing friends or meeting new people?

Patient: I try to talk myself down — tell myself people are mostly kind or my partner reminds me it's okay — but my brain instantly shoots back a full disaster movie: I'll blurt something awful, everyone will laugh, my reputation will tank, they won't invite me again, and I'll end up completely cut off. It's like arguing with a loud, very certain voice that feels more real than anything I say, so every reasonable thought sounds naive.

Therapist Answer:
It feels like you're stuck in this cycle of trying to counteract that inner voice, but it's still having a powerful impact on your actions. Can you think of a time when you were able to momentarily step back from that inner narrative, even if it was just for a brief moment? Maybe you noticed something about your thoughts that seemed a bit...off, or perhaps you caught yourself taking a deep breath. What was that moment like, and did you do anything different when it came back?

Patient: Yeah — there was one night I actually made it to a small dinner. I noticed my hands shaking, took a few deep breaths and even told myself out loud “this is just the fortune-telling voice,” and I stayed for maybe twenty minutes, laughed at a joke and felt a tiny win. Then someone made a quiet aside, my brain immediately spun it into a story where they were all whispering about me, my face went hot, and I left convinced I’d ruined everything and they'd never invite me again.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that you noticed your hands shaking, which suggests that your body was already preparing for the worst. Even with your best efforts to counteract the fortune-telling voice, it's clear that it's a deeply ingrained pattern for you. Can you think of what might have happened if, instead of immediately falling back into the story about the whispering, you'd tried to stay with that tiny win of staying for twenty minutes? Maybe it's worth exploring what would have happened if you'd been able to maintain that small sense of accomplishment, even if only for a little while longer.

Patient: If I'd stayed, my brain would have turned that tiny win into a bigger mess: I'd force a laugh, blurt something clumsy, everyone would go quiet and exchange looks, someone would whisper and it would feel like they're mocking me, and I'd leave convinced I'd ruined my friendships. I really don't see that calm sticking — it always feels like the pause before a bigger humiliation that definitely happens. I don't know what you'd even suggest, because I just keep getting pulled into the next disaster story.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've been caught up in this cycle of thinking before, and it's like your brain has a way of twisting even the smallest glimmers of hope into a more catastrophic outcome. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the potential pain of humiliation, but in doing so, it's actually making things worse. 

Can you think of what might be driving this need to protect yourself from humiliation? Is it something that's happened to you in the past, or is it a feeling that's always been there? Maybe exploring this a bit more could help us find a way to break this cycle.

Patient: I guess it comes from old stuff — my dad was always sharp with criticism and there was that one presentation years ago where I froze and felt everyone laughing; it lodged in me. Now my brain tries to “protect” me by predicting humiliation so I don't end up exposed — which, of course, means I avoid things and the story becomes self-fulfilling: I skip the party, they think I’ve become aloof, they stop inviting me, and I end up alone. With the kids gone it’s worse — fewer distractions, more time for the worst-case movie to run. I know people say that’s exaggerating, but honestly that kind of optimism just sounds naive to me; it’s what always happens.

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like this experience from your past has become a kind of inner warning system, always on the lookout for potential humiliation and trying to prevent it from happening. And it's not just about the past experience itself, but the feelings of inadequacy and vulnerability that come with it. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from those feelings, but in doing so, it's also creating a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

It's interesting that you mention people saying that's exaggerating, but for you, it's not about being overly pessimistic, it's about being honest about how you feel. It's like your brain is trying to make sense of this experience, but it's doing it in a way that feels overly cautious.

Can you think of a moment when you've been in a situation where you've felt safe enough to try and be a little more optimistic, without it feeling like you're being naive or trying to avoid the worst-case scenario? Maybe there's a small part of you that's starting to wonder if this constant pessimism is really the best way to protect yourself.

Patient: There was that one evening at a book club where someone smiled at a comment I made and I actually felt a flicker of "maybe this isn't so bad" — but then my mind ran the tape: I say one thing dumb, they all look at each other, someone makes a joke behind my back, my boss (who's there) hears it and thinks I'm incompetent, and suddenly I'm out of a job and out of friends. I know you're asking me to hold that small win, but honestly that other chain of events feels way more real than the quiet smile — the optimistic outcome just sounds naive to me.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is constantly running that scenario, and it's hard for you to shake the feeling that the other chain of events is more likely to happen. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the potential pain of humiliation, but in doing so, it's also making it harder for you to see that there's a possibility for a more positive outcome.

It's interesting that you mention the small smile at the book club, though. It's like that tiny moment of connection with someone else was a small crack in your armor, a small glimmer of hope that maybe things aren't as bad as you think. But even that small win gets twisted into a more pessimistic scenario in your mind.

Can you try to hold onto that small smile for a moment longer? Just let yourself imagine what it would be like if that smile turned into a connection with someone, and maybe even a small sense of belonging. What do you think it would feel like to be able to hold onto that feeling, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I try to, I really do, but the minute I imagine that smile leading somewhere my brain writes the rest of the movie: I say one clumsy thing, they whisper, my boss hears and thinks I’m a joke, I get sidelined at work, the invites stop, and I'm left out and alone. If I could actually hold onto that connection it would feel like a breath of relief — lighter, less on edge — but I can't trust it; my chest tightens and the disaster tape takes over again. I don't know how to keep that tiny calm from getting swallowed up.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is constantly playing that movie, and it's hard to hold onto anything else, no matter how small. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from the potential pain of humiliation, but in doing so, it's also making it impossible for you to feel anything else.

It's interesting that you mention the feeling of relief that comes with holding onto that tiny calm. It's like you're trying to grasp onto a lifeline, a way to escape the constant fear of disaster. But even that lifeline feels fragile, and your brain is always ready to snatch it away.

Can you try to ask yourself one small question: What would it take for you to feel like that calm wasn't being swallowed up? What small thing could you do to make it feel more solid, more real? It might be something tiny, like taking a few deep breaths, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. Whatever it is, it might be just enough to help you hold onto that tiny calm for a moment longer.

Patient: Maybe if I did tiny practical things — feel my feet on the floor, take five slow breaths, have a one-line go-to comment rehearsed, or tell my partner to give me a discreet cue — I might hold that calm a bit longer. But honestly, the minute someone shifts or makes a small joke my brain will treat it like proof I'm a fool and all those tricks will feel useless. I'm getting frustrated and tired of this loop — can we slow down and actually try to pick apart why the disaster tape feels so much more real than anything else?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling stuck in this cycle, and the frustration is building up. You're trying to find small ways to cope, but the moment something goes wrong, it all feels like it was for nothing.

Let's try to take a step back and look at this from a different angle. Can you tell me more about what happens when the disaster tape plays out in your mind? What is it about that scenario that feels so real to you? Is it the specific words or actions that someone takes, or is it the feeling of being humiliated or embarrassed?

It might be helpful to explore this further. For example, is it the feeling of being judged by others that's so painful, or is it the fear of being rejected or abandoned? Are there any specific memories or experiences from the past that might be linked to this fear?

By exploring these questions, we might be able to start to understand why the disaster tape feels so much more real to you than anything else. It's possible that there are some underlying fears or anxieties that are driving this, and by getting to the root of those, we might be able to find some ways to break the cycle.

Patient: It's less about the exact words and more about the whole scene my brain scripts: faces go flat, someone snorts a laugh, a whisper starts, my boss's brow tightens, and suddenly I'm incompetent and friendless. My body jumps first — chest tight, stomach sinking, hands shaking — and that physical reaction feels like proof the catastrophe is actually happening. It goes back to my dad's barbed comments and that time I froze in a presentation; once that tape plays, any small cue is just confirmation, and honestly any suggestion that things could turn out fine just sounds like naive wishful thinking.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain is creating a complete narrative around the scenario, including all the emotional and physical reactions. It's not just the specific words or actions that trigger it, but the whole experience of being humiliated, embarrassed, and rejected.

It's interesting that you mention the physical reaction of your body jumping first. It's like your brain is anticipating the worst-case scenario and preparing your body for it, even before the thoughts and emotions have fully kicked in. This can make it feel like the catastrophe is actually happening, even though it's just a product of your imagination.

It's also clear that this narrative is deeply tied to your past experiences, particularly your dad's comments and that time you froze in the presentation. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from those experiences by anticipating and preparing you for the worst-case scenario, even though it's unlikely to happen.

Can you think about how this narrative affects your daily life? For example, do you find yourself avoiding certain situations or people because you're afraid of being humiliated or embarrassed? Or do you feel like you're constantly on edge, waiting for the worst-case scenario to happen?

Also, have you ever tried to challenge this narrative, even just for a moment? For example, have you ever said to yourself, "Wait a minute, I'm not really going to freeze up like that," or "I'm not going to be humiliated like that"? How did it feel to challenge this narrative, even if only for a moment?

Patient: I do a lot of avoiding — decline dinners, skip the after-work drinks, dodge small gatherings so I don’t have to face that tape. I’ve tried calling it out (“that’s just the fortune-telling”), rehearsing lines, and using the breathing trick — once I even stayed and laughed for a bit — but the minute my chest tightens or someone shifts in their seat the whole disaster script feels proven and the calm evaporates. Arguing with the thought just feels pointless because my body is already reacting like it’s real, and that makes me feel stupid and more panicked. I’m getting frustrated — can we slow down and actually try to figure out why my body gives that tape so much credibility?

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in a cycle of avoidance and anxiety, and you're trying to find ways to cope with it. It's interesting that you mention trying to call out the thought ("that's just the fortune-telling") and using breathing tricks, but ultimately feeling like it's not working.

It's possible that your body is responding to the anxiety and fear that's associated with the fortune-telling voice, rather than the actual thought itself. This can make it feel like the thoughts are having a direct impact on your body, even if you're trying to rationalize them.

One thing to consider is that your body is wired to respond to threats, even if they're not real. This is a natural response to help you stay safe. However, in your case, the threat is not real, but your body is still responding as if it is. This can make it feel like you're trapped in a loop of anxiety and fear.

Let's try to explore this further. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation where you felt anxious or scared, but it was not a real threat? For example, were you nervous about a presentation or a test? How did your body respond in that situation? Did it feel like the same sensation of chest tightness or shaking?

Also, have you ever noticed that the anxiety and fear seem to be more intense in certain situations or around certain people? For example, is it harder to cope with anxiety in certain social situations or around a particular person? Understanding these patterns might help you develop more effective coping strategies.

Patient: Yeah — same deal with presentations or tests: my hands go cold, my chest tightens, I start sweating, and my brain is already narrating everyone's judgment before I even open my mouth, so it feels like it's actually happening even though it isn't. It's always worse around my boss or in big groups or with people I don't know well; small, familiar gatherings are easier, but even then the tape can kick in the minute someone glances away. I'm getting impatient with all the talk about breathing — can we slow down and actually try to figure out why my body insists the fake movie is real?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is perpetually primed for a threat, even when there's no real danger. This hypervigilance can make everyday situations feel overwhelming and anxiety-provoking.

It's interesting that you mention it's worse around certain people, like your boss or in big groups. This might suggest that there's a specific dynamic at play, perhaps related to social status, authority, or competition. When you're in a situation where you feel like you're on display, your body's reaction can be amplified.

The fact that small, familiar gatherings can still trigger the tape, even if it's less intense, suggests that it's not just about the situation itself, but also about your internal state. It's possible that you're carrying around a lot of anxiety or stress, which can make it harder to relax and feel at ease, even in familiar settings.

Let's try to explore this further. Can you think of a specific memory or experience that might be contributing to your hypervigilance? For example, was there a particular incident or conversation with your boss or in a group setting that made you feel anxious or humiliated? Or is it more of a general feeling, like you're always "on edge"?

Also, have you noticed that your body's reaction is always focused on the potential negative outcome, rather than the actual possibility of success or positive feedback? For example, when you're presenting, is your mind racing with worst-case scenarios ("I'll trip and fall", "I'll say something stupid"), rather than positive thoughts ("I'll do great", "I'll make a good impression")? This might be a key insight into why your body is reacting the way it is.

Patient: Yeah — it goes back to that presentation and my dad's snide remarks; I can still feel the conference-room silence and my boss's raised brow like a template for every future disaster. My body locks first — chest tight, stomach dropping — and that physical alarm makes the worst-case script feel like it's already happening, not just a thought. Maybe it’s also the empty-house, extra time to ruminate, but any optimistic possibility just sounds naive to me and my brain instantly flips to the catastrophe. I'm frustrated and tired of circling this — can we slow down and actually try to figure out why my body treats the fake movie as real?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is holding onto that traumatic experience, and it's triggering a primal response every time you're in a similar situation. The physical symptoms you're describing, like the chest tightness and stomach dropping, are classic indicators of a fight-or-flight response, which is designed to prepare your body for immediate action.

It's interesting that you mention the template for every future disaster being the conference-room silence and your boss's raised brow. This suggests that your brain is drawing a direct connection between those past experiences and the present moment, even when there's no actual threat.

The fact that your body reacts before your brain even has a chance to think critically about the situation is a key point. It's not just a matter of rational thinking or optimism; your body is responding on a fundamental level, as if it's already perceived a threat.

Let's try to break this down further. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation where you felt like your body was reacting without your brain even being aware of it? For example, were you on a plane, and your heart started racing without you even realizing it? Or were you walking down the street, and your feet started tapping out a nervous rhythm without you even noticing?

Also, have you noticed that your brain's response is often accompanied by a sense of shame or embarrassment? For example, when you're in a situation and your body starts reacting, do you feel like you're somehow failing or not good enough? This might be a key insight into why your brain is responding the way it is.

Patient: Yeah — like last Tuesday I walked into a staff meeting and before I even sat down my heart was pounding and my hands were cold; my brain had already written everyone whispering that I’d messed up and my boss looking disappointed. That physical surge always drags shame in with it — I feel exposed and like a fraud, which to me just proves the catastrophe is real. I’m getting impatient — can we actually slow down and dig into why my body treats that fake movie as if it’s already happening, because “just breathe” sounds naive to me.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is perpetually in a state of hypervigilance, even in situations where there's no actual threat. The fact that you're walking into a staff meeting and your body is already reacting like a disaster is unfolding is a powerful indicator of the root of this issue.

I want to explore this further. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation similar to this, but it was a positive experience? For example, were you in a meeting where you felt confident and prepared, and your body didn't react in a way that suggested you were in danger? Or were you in a social situation where you felt relaxed and at ease, and your body didn't go into fight-or-flight mode?

Also, have you noticed that the shame and embarrassment you feel in these situations are always closely tied to the physical sensations you experience? For example, when you're in a situation and your heart is pounding and your hands are cold, do you feel like you're somehow failing or not good enough? This might be a key insight into why your brain is responding the way it is.

It's also interesting that you mention the phrase "just breathe" sounds naive to you. This suggests that you're not just looking for a simple solution to calm your nerves, but you're looking for a deeper understanding of what's driving this behavior. You're looking to dig into the root of this issue, rather than just treating the symptoms.

Can I ask, what do you hope to find out about yourself and this behavior by exploring this further? What do you think would help you feel more confident and in control in these situations?

Patient: I want to understand why my body treats the fake movie as if it’s already happening — if I could spot the trigger earlier maybe I could interrupt the chain. Maybe mapping the exact cues, rehearsing a line, or having my partner give a discreet signal would help me stay a bit longer, but honestly I don't trust any of that to stop the tape — it always finds a way to prove itself right. I'm frustrated and tired of circling this — can we slow down and actually work through those trigger moments in detail?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're at a point where you're looking for a more concrete understanding of how to break this cycle. You're willing to dig deeper into the specific moments when your body starts reacting, and see if we can identify any patterns or triggers that might be causing this.

Let's take a step back and look at the last time this happened to you. Can you walk me through exactly what happened, from the moment you started feeling anxious to the moment it passed? Try to be as specific as possible about your physical sensations, your thoughts, and any external stimuli that might have been present.

For example, what did you see, hear, or feel right before you started feeling anxious? Was there anything in particular that caught your attention or triggered a reaction? And how did your body respond? Did you feel a lump in your throat, your heart start racing, or your palms get sweaty?

By mapping out these specific moments, we might be able to identify some commonalities or patterns that can help us better understand what's going on. And who knows, we might even be able to find some ways to interrupt the cycle or change your response to these triggers.

Patient: Okay — last Tuesday, exactly like before. I stepped into the conference room and the moment the door shut behind me my heart jumped, my palms went cold, and my vision narrowed to one thing: my boss's face. The first thought was instant and loud — "they can see I'm shaky" — and that flipped into the whole movie: someone will snort, people will whisper, my boss will frown like he always did that day years ago, I'll freeze, they'll think I'm incompetent, and I'm done. Physically it climbed fast: chest tight, breath shallow, stomach dropping, knees a little weak, my hands fumbling with my notes so my voice came out thin — which my brain took as proof the catastrophe was happening. I tried one breath, tried to tell myself "that's the fortune-telling," even mouthed a practiced line in my head, but the shaming feeling came with it — like being exposed — and every little shift in the room felt like confirmation. I left the meeting early because I couldn't keep pretending; sitting in the car the next twenty minutes I kept replaying it and spiraled into "they're already talking about how useless I am," convinced I'd ruined things. I know you might suggest other explanations, but honestly that alternate, calmer outcome sounds naive — the disaster tape just feels so much more real.

I can see that you're trying to pinpoint exactly when the panic sets in, and it's clear that you're looking for a very specific moment to change your response. It's like you're searching for a tiny trigger that, when pressed, sets off the whole chain reaction of anxiety.

Let's break down the first few seconds, exactly as you described. The moment the door shuts behind you, your heart jumps, your palms go cold, and your vision narrows to your boss's face. Can you tell me more about what's happening in your brain right then? What's the first thought that pops up, and how do you know it's going to lead to the whole disaster movie?

It sounds like you're already anticipating a negative outcome, and that's what's causing your body to react. You're not just thinking, "Oh no, I'm going to say something stupid," but "I'm going to say something stupid, and they're all going to think I'm incompetent." That's a very specific and intense fear, and it's likely driving your physical response.

Can we try to slow down the narrative a bit? Instead of jumping straight to the meeting, let's explore what's happening in the moments leading up to it. What are you thinking and feeling right before you walk into the conference room? Is there something specific that's making you anxious, or is it just a general sense of unease?

Patient: Right before I walk in I'm already halfway through the movie — picturing my boss's disapproving look and thinking, "They can see I'm shaking," which instantly flips to "I'll freeze, they'll laugh, I'm done." My body tightens — jaw clenched, stomach in knots, breath shallow — and that physical proof makes the catastrophe feel unavoidable.

I can see that you're already in a state of hyperarousal, even before you've entered the conference room. Your mind is already racing with worst-case scenarios, and your body is responding with physical tension.

Let's try to break down those first five seconds, even further. What's the first thing you notice about your body before you walk in? Is it just a general feeling of tension, or is there something specific that's caught your attention?

For example, are your hands shaking slightly, or is your jaw clenched? Are your breaths shallow, or is your stomach knotting up in a specific way? By noticing these small physical sensations, we might be able to get a better sense of what's driving your anxiety.

Also, can you try to pinpoint exactly what's making you think, "They can see I'm shaking"? Is it a specific memory, a past experience, or just a general fear of being judged? Understanding the root of this thought might help us address the underlying issue.

Remember, we're not trying to change what's happening in the moment, but rather to understand it better. By getting more specific about your thoughts and physical sensations, we might be able to develop a more effective strategy for coping with your anxiety.

Patient: The very first thing is a tightness behind my sternum and a lump in my throat — my hands go cold and my jaw locks up before I even think a word. The thought “they can see I’m shaking” pops in because that conference-room silence and my dad’s barbs are like a mental movie I can’t turn off; the body reacts, so it feels like proof the movie’s already playing.

It's interesting that you mention your dad's barbs and the conference-room silence as a mental movie that you can't turn off. This suggests that your anxiety is not just about the current situation, but also about past experiences and memories that are still triggering a strong response.

Let's take a closer look at those first two or three bodily cues. Can you try to describe the sensation of the tightness behind your sternum in more detail? Is it a feeling of pressure, a knot, or a sense of constriction?

Also, can you think about how your jaw locking up affects your breathing? Do you find that you're holding your breath, or that your breaths are shallow and quick?

By exploring these physical sensations in more detail, we might be able to get a better sense of what's driving your anxiety and how to address it. Remember, we're not trying to change what's happening in the moment, but rather to understand it better and develop a more effective strategy for coping with it.

Patient: It feels like a heavy band squeezing across my chest so my breaths get short and high, there's a lump in my throat, and my jaw locks so my voice comes out thin. That surge feels like proof the catastrophe is already happening — the thought “they can see I’m shaking” pops in and the whole disaster movie takes over, so “just breathe” sounds naive even though a slow breath sometimes nicks the edge.

I can see that you're trying to pinpoint the exact moment when the anxiety response kicks in, and you're focusing on the physical sensations that accompany it. The feeling of a heavy band across your chest, the lump in your throat, and the locked jaw are all classic indicators of a strong anxiety response.

It's interesting that you mention the thought "they can see I'm shaking" popping in, and the whole disaster movie taking over. This suggests that your brain is already anticipating a negative outcome, and it's using past experiences and memories to fuel that anticipation.

Let's try to break down the chest-tightening and jaw-clenching in more detail. Can you think about what's happening in your body right before the chest tightens? Is it a sense of tension, a feeling of pressure, or a physical sensation that's building up?

Also, can you try to pinpoint the exact moment when the jaw locks up? Is it a sudden movement, or is it a gradual tightening of the jaw muscles? By understanding the exact nature of this physical response, we might be able to identify the trigger that sets off the entire anxiety response.

Remember, we're not trying to change what's happening in the moment, but rather to understand it better. By getting more specific about your physical sensations, we might be able to develop a more effective strategy for coping with your anxiety.

Patient: Right before the chest squeezes it's a tiny, almost reflexive jolt — like the door click or my eyes catching my boss's face triggers a flash of that old conference-room silence, and my neck tenses up first, then the tight band wraps my sternum so my breath shortens to a quick, shallow gasp. The jaw clench is abrupt, like I'm stopping a word from coming out; it's a hard, instant clamp that makes my voice thin and makes swallowing feel weird.

Also, can you try to pinpoint the exact moment when your neck tenses up? Is it a subtle movement, or is it a sudden contraction of the muscles? By understanding the exact nature of this physical response, we might be able to identify the trigger that sets off the entire anxiety response.

Remember, we're not trying to change what's happening in the moment, but rather to understand it better. By getting more specific about your physical sensations, we might be able to develop a more effective strategy for coping with your anxiety.

One more question: Can you think about what's happening in your mind right before the jolt? Are you thinking about the past, rehearsing a conversation, or worrying about something specific? By understanding what's going on in your mind, we might be able to identify the underlying cause of your anxiety response.

Patient: Right before the jolt my mind snaps to that exact flash — the conference-room silence and my boss’s frown — and it immediately scripts the next few minutes: I flub a line, someone snorts, whispers start, my boss writes me off, and I’m finished. It isn’t me rehearsing different endings so much as a fast, certain movie that feels inevitable; sometimes it even skips to other disasters—losing respect, losing invites, ending up alone—and that certainty slams my body shut. I’m frustrated — can we slow down and actually pick apart that micro-jolt, because anything that says it might not happen just sounds naive to me.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're trying to pinpoint the exact moment when your mind starts scripting the disaster scenario, and you're focusing on the physical sensations that accompany it. The flash of the conference-room silence and your boss's frown is a crucial detail.

It's interesting that you mention your mind doesn't just rehearse different endings, but instead scripts a fast, certain movie that feels inevitable. This suggests that your brain is using a narrative structure to process the threat, and it's not just a matter of imagining different outcomes.

Let's try to break down the physical sensations that accompany the jolt. Can you think about what happens to your body right before the jolt? Is it a sense of tension, a feeling of pressure, or a physical sensation that's building up?

Also, can you try to pinpoint the exact moment when your body shuts down? Is it a sudden movement, or is it a gradual tightening of the muscles? By understanding the exact nature of this physical response, we might be able to identify the trigger that sets off the entire anxiety response.

I want to push back on your frustration a bit. You're saying that anything that suggests the disaster might not happen sounds naive, which implies that you're not sure what the underlying cause of your anxiety is. Is that a fair assessment? Are you willing to explore the possibility that your anxiety might not be as fixed as you think, and that there might be ways to challenge or change your narrative about the disaster?

Let's take a step back and look at this from a slightly different angle. Can you think about what would happen if you were able to challenge or change your narrative about the disaster? What if you could start to see that the scenario you're scripting isn't necessarily a fixed or inevitable outcome? How might that change your relationship with your anxiety, and your physical sensations?

Patient: If I could actually change the movie, I think I'd feel lighter — chest less tight, breath slower, I might even stay and enjoy part of a conversation. But my brain immediately scripts that trying to act confident will just look forced, they'll see I'm "trying" and laugh, and it'll prove the worst-case true, so I can't trust that outcome. I'm getting really frustrated — can we slow down and pick apart that micro-jolt the moment the door clicks or my eyes hit my boss, because that feels like the lever that flips the whole tape.

I can see that you're trying to pinpoint the exact moment when your brain starts scripting the worst-case scenario, and you're focusing on the physical sensations that accompany it. The feeling of being able to change the movie and feeling lighter is a crucial detail.

It's interesting that you mention your brain immediately scripts that trying to act confident will just look forced. This suggests that your brain is anticipating a negative outcome and is trying to protect you from embarrassment or humiliation.

Let's try to break down the physical sensations that accompany the jolt. Can you think about what happens to your body right after the door clicks or your eyes hit your boss? Is it a sense of tension, a feeling of pressure, or a physical sensation that's building up?

Also, can you try to pinpoint the exact moment when your brain starts scripting the worst-case scenario? Is it a split second, or does it take a little longer? By understanding the exact nature of this physical response, we might be able to identify the trigger that sets off the entire anxiety response.

I want to ask you a question: Have you ever noticed that when you're feeling anxious or on edge, your mind tends to catastrophize small, normal events? For example, if you're getting ready for a meeting, your mind might start thinking, "What if I trip on the way in? What if I say something stupid?" It's like your brain is trying to prepare you for the worst-case scenario, even when there's no real danger.

Can you think about whether this might be happening in your current situation? Are you noticing any patterns or catastrophizing small, normal events?

Patient: Yes — that's exactly what's happening. Little, normal things — the door click, someone clearing their throat, a pause after I speak — instantly turn into a full disaster movie in my head: I flub a line, they whisper, my boss writes me off. It's automatic and feels unstoppable because my body reacts first, so trying to argue with it feels pointless. I'm getting frustrated — can we slow down and actually pick apart that micro-jolt when the door clicks or my eyes hit my boss?

Patient: Okay — in those first two seconds it's always the same: the door click or a soft cough hits and my vision tunnels to my boss, my neck snaps tight, then that band squeezes my chest and I gasp. The gasp feels like confirmation — my throat blocks, my voice thins, and the movie is already rolling: everyone’s judging, I stumble, I’m finished. I'm getting really fed up with the talk-and-breathe stuff; can we actually slow down and pick apart that exact click-to-gasp moment, step by step, because nothing else feels real when that flip happens.

Patient: Alright — the current thing is work plus the empty nest giving that fortune-telling machine more airtime: a tiny pause at a meeting instantly becomes the whole chain — fumble a line, boss frowns, reputation collapses, job gone, friends stop inviting me. Belonging and respect matter a lot, so those imagined losses feel catastrophic and the body reacts before the thought finishes. I'm fed up and tired of this loop — can we actually slow down and pick apart that door‑click‑to‑gasp moment, step by step?

Patient: I'm trying to do the pause thing, but the moment the door clicks my neck tightens and that band squeezes my chest so fast the pause never has a chance. Can we actually slow down and walk through that click-to-gasp step by step — tell me what to notice first, then next, because I'm sick of breathing tricks that feel naive and I need to find that tiny lever that flips the whole disaster movie.

Patient: Okay — step by step: the very first thing is a tiny, reflex neck‑jolt the moment the door clicks or my eyes hit my boss. Then that band clamps across my sternum, my breathing chops into short gasps, a lump forms in my throat and my jaw snaps shut so my voice goes thin. My vision tunnels to faces and the instant “they can see I’m shaking” thought fires off the whole disaster movie. I’m exhausted with the breathing stuff — can we actually slow down and sit with that neck‑jolt for a minute and name what it feels like, because once that flip happens the rest follows every time.
