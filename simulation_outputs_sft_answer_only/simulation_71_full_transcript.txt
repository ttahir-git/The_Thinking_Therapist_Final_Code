Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — like I don't know what matters to me beyond the fact that I'm unemployed, and it's wrecking my self-esteem. The breakup made it worse, and I keep second-guessing every choice. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will actually help, but I guess that's where I'm at.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the current uncertainty and feelings of not knowing what matters to you are weighing heavily right now. It's not surprising that the breakup has made things more challenging, given the emotional vulnerability that often comes with ending a relationship. It's interesting that you mention second-guessing every choice; can you tell me more about what that's like for you? What are some of the choices you've been questioning, and how do you feel when you make a decision?

Patient: I keep second-guessing even small stuff — like whether to apply for a job, text a friend, or even get out of bed — and bigger things too, like whether to switch careers or move somewhere else. When I decide I immediately worry it was the wrong move, replay it over and over until I freeze and do nothing. I've tried lists, pros-and-cons, even journaling, and it doesn't help — how is talking about it supposed to change that?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the self-doubt and fear of making the wrong choice have become a bit of a loop, where you're not just second-guessing, but also getting stuck in a cycle of rumination. It's like your mind is constantly replaying the decision, trying to figure out what could have been done differently.

It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're feeling uncertain about your future. It's almost like your mind is trying to protect you from the fear of making a mistake, but in doing so, it's paralyzing you.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you do decide to take some small action, like applying for a job or reaching out to a friend? How does it feel afterwards, and is there a part of you that starts to wonder if you made the right decision?

Patient: Usually there's this knot in my stomach before I do anything, then a tiny relief afterward — like, "Okay, I did it" — but it fades fast. Almost immediately I start replaying it, wondering if I said the wrong thing or picked the wrong job, and that makes me avoid doing more. I've tried lists and journaling and forcing myself, and it doesn't stick — how is talking about it supposed to change that?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the relief you feel after taking action is short-lived, and then the self-doubt creeps back in. It's like your mind is constantly switching between these two states - relief and rumination. This cycle can be really tough to break, especially when it feels like no matter what you try, the self-doubt just lingers.

It's interesting that you mention trying lists and journaling, and it not helping. It's not that these tools are bad, it's just that maybe they're not the right fit for you right now. Sometimes, talking about something can help clarify things, but it's not always a magic solution.

Can you tell me more about what it is about avoiding action that's so hard for you? Is it the fear of making a mistake, or is it something else?

Patient: Yeah, it's more than just worrying about making the wrong choice — it's this fear that any choice will prove I'm a failure or worthless, so avoiding feels safer than risking that shame. Also low energy and this weird fog after the breakup make even small stuff feel huge, and then I get stuck replaying it. But seriously, how is talking about that supposed to help? I've said all this before and it doesn't stop me from freezing.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're carrying this weight of shame and fear of failure, and any decision, no matter how small, feels like it could be the final blow. It's not just about making a choice, it's about preserving your sense of self-worth.

It's also clear that the breakup has left you feeling really drained and foggy, and that's making it even harder to make decisions. It's like your energy is tied up in just getting through each day, and then there's this mental fog that's hard to shake.

I want to acknowledge that it's frustrating and maybe even a little discouraging that talking about it hasn't helped so far. It's not that we're giving up, it's just that maybe we need to try a different approach.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to start taking small steps, even if it feels scary? Is it about having a clear goal in mind, or is it about just having someone to talk to and share the weight of it all?

Patient: I don't know — I've tried setting goals and they just fizzle out when I feel low, so I'm skeptical that "having a goal" alone will fix anything. Maybe what might actually help is concrete, tiny steps with external structure or accountability — like someone checking in or a plan that makes each action feel safe and not like a test of my worth. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I'm exhausted and keep getting hit with shame? I keep wanting to bail.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to find a way to take small steps, but it's hard to get started when you're feeling so exhausted and overwhelmed. Setting goals can be helpful, but it's clear that it's not just about setting a goal, it's about feeling like you can actually take the first step.

It's interesting that you mention wanting something with external structure or accountability. Sometimes, having someone to check in with or a plan that provides a sense of safety can make a big difference. It's like having a safety net to catch you if you fall, or a reminder that you're not alone in this struggle.

I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like bailing. It's normal to feel that way when you're feeling so exhausted and overwhelmed. But it's also important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are people who care about you and want to help.

Can you tell me more about what you think would make those tiny steps feel safe and not like a test of your worth? Is it about having a specific plan, or is it about having someone to talk to and share your feelings with?

Patient: I guess it would help if the steps were tiny, super specific, and tied to an external check — like a 10-minute task with a scheduled check-in and a clear, non-judgmental way to fail. If someone framed it as experiments instead of tests, that might take some pressure off. But honestly, I've tried accountability before and it just fades — how is this supposed to be different if I bail again? I'm tired and it already feels like needing this makes me less.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make those tiny steps feel more manageable and less overwhelming. Having a 10-minute task with a scheduled check-in and a clear, non-judgmental way to fail could provide a sense of structure and safety.

It's also interesting that you mention framing it as experiments instead of tests. Sometimes, using that language can help shift the focus from trying to prove something to learning and exploring.

I want to acknowledge that accountability can be a complex issue for many people. It's not that it's not worth trying, but it's clear that it's not something that's working for you right now. It's possible that the approach needs to be adjusted or that there are other factors at play that are making it feel unsustainable.

Can you tell me more about what's making you feel like bailing again? Is it the same sense of exhaustion and overwhelm that's always there, or is there something else that's contributing to it?

Patient: Mostly it’s the exhaustion and this shame loop — I get a tiny burst of hope, then worry I’ve already failed and bail to avoid feeling worse. Part of it is that past supports faded: people stopped checking in, plans got vague, and I felt like a burden when I asked for help, so now I preemptively quit. But seriously, how is making tasks smaller or calling them “experiments” actually supposed to stop the fog and shame when I’m this worn out? I guess I’d need something consistent, short, and totally nonjudgmental — but I’m skeptical that’ll stick either.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of exhaustion and shame, where even small bursts of hope can be quickly extinguished by worry and self-doubt. The fact that past supports have faded and left you feeling like a burden is a significant contributor to this.

I want to acknowledge that it's not just about making tasks smaller or using a more positive label - it's about addressing the underlying sense of overwhelm and shame that's driving your behavior. You're right that something consistent, short, and non-judgmental is needed, but it's also clear that this alone might not be enough to break the cycle.

Can I ask, what do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're making progress, rather than just going through the motions? Is it about seeing a tangible outcome, or is it about feeling a sense of control or agency over your life?

Patient: I guess progress would look like tiny, visible wins I can actually check off, plus a simple routine that doesn’t demand a ton of energy. I’d need consistent, nonjudgmental accountability and some proof that I’m not just failing over and over. But I’ve tried “small steps” before and they collapse when I’m exhausted or ashamed — how is this supposed to be different, and what would you actually have me try first that feels realistic?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the cycle of exhaustion and shame, and that small, visible wins and a simple routine could be a good starting point.

I want to acknowledge that it's not just about trying a new approach, but also about understanding what's driving your behavior. You're right that small steps can collapse when you're exhausted or ashamed, and that's because they're often not sustainable in the long term.

Instead of suggesting a new approach, I'd like to ask some questions to help us better understand what's going on. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "consistent, nonjudgmental accountability"? What does that look like for you, and how do you think it could help?

Also, what do you mean by "proof that I'm not just failing over and over"? Is that about external validation, or is it about finding ways to track your progress and see that you're making small, incremental gains?

Patient: For me, consistent, nonjudgmental accountability would mean very short, scheduled check-ins (like a 5–10 minute text or call at the same time each day) where whoever’s checking in just asks what I tried and what happened, without lecturing or making me justify myself — normalizing failure and treating tasks like experiments, not moral tests. Proof would be tiny, measurable wins I can actually see — checked-off 10-minute tasks, a visible streak on a calendar, saved screenshots of sent applications or messages — things that show incremental progress instead of vague “effort.” But I'm skeptical: trackers and check-ins have faded before, so if you want me to try this, tell me one concrete, realistic first step to do today and a nonjudgmental way you’d check in, because I’m already tired and want to bail but I’ll try if it feels doable.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to establish a daily routine with short, non-judgmental check-ins that help you track your progress. You want to focus on small, measurable wins, like checking off tasks or seeing a streak on a calendar, rather than trying to justify your efforts.

Before we move forward, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to be skeptical. You're right that trackers and check-ins can be a double-edged sword, and it's possible that they may not stick.

Here's a concrete, realistic first step I'd like to suggest:

Can you commit to a single, 5-minute daily text at the same time today? I'd like to send you a text at a specific time (e.g., 10:00 AM) with a simple question:

"What was one small thing you tried today?"

That's it. No questions about how you're feeling, no discussions about your progress, and no judgment. Just a simple question to help you track your daily efforts.

If you're willing to give this a try, I'd be happy to check in with you at the same time tomorrow and ask the same question. We can go from there.

What do you think? Is this a feasible first step for you?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the 5-minute text — but seriously, how is that supposed to help when check-ins always fade and I bail? I’ll commit to doing one concrete thing today at 10:00 AM: spend five minutes and send a short text to one friend (“Hey, how are you?”) — low energy, low stakes. When you check in, just ask “What was one small thing you tried today?” and if I didn’t do it, say “Okay, thanks for telling me” — no pressure or judgment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're willing to take a small step and try out this approach, despite your skepticism about check-ins fading and you bailing.

I'm glad you're committed to sending a text to a friend today. It's a low-energy, low-stakes activity that can help you get into the habit of checking in with someone.

When I check in with you at 10:00 AM tomorrow, I'll make sure to follow your instructions exactly. I'll ask only one question: "What was one small thing you tried today?" If you didn't do anything, I'll respond with "Okay, thanks for telling me." No pressure, no judgment, just a simple acknowledgment of your effort.

Let's make a deal. You try sending that text today, and we'll go from there. I'll wait for your response tomorrow morning.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to send that text today, but I’m already feeling weirdly anxious about it, like my chest is tight and I’m imagining messing it up. I don’t know if I’ll manage it, and I keep thinking this will just end with me bailing — how is this actually supposed to help? If I don’t do it, please just say “Okay, thanks for telling me” like you said, no pressure.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're already feeling a bit anxious about sending the text, and that's understandable. It's natural to have some doubts and fears when trying something new.

I want to reassure you that this is a completely normal and safe experience. There's no pressure, and no expectation of success. If you don't feel like sending the text, that's okay. We can just move on from here.

If you do decide to send the text, I'll respond with a simple and non-judgmental message: "Okay, thanks for telling me." If you don't send the text, I'll respond with the same message: "Okay, thanks for telling me." No pressure, no judgment, just a gentle acknowledgment of your effort.

Remember, the goal of this exercise is not to achieve some kind of success or accomplishment. It's simply to take a small step and get comfortable with the idea of checking in with someone. If you can do that, we can build from there.

Take a deep breath, and let's see how you feel about sending that text. What's your plan? Are you going to send it now, or do you want to take a little more time?

Patient: I’ll try to send it in the next 10 minutes, but I’m suddenly feeling really anxious and distracted—my chest is tight and I’m worried I’ll bail. If I don’t do it, please just say “Okay, thanks for telling me” like you said. Honestly, how is this supposed to help when I feel like this?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and that's completely normal. Your body is responding to the stress, and it's okay to acknowledge that.

I want to reassure you that it's okay if you don't send the text right now. If you're feeling too anxious, it's better to take a break and come back to it later. Your mental health is more important than sending a text.

When you're ready, just come back and say "I didn't do it" or "I'm not feeling up to it." I'll respond with a simple and non-judgmental message: "Okay, thanks for telling me." No pressure, no expectation. Just a gentle acknowledgment of your effort.

Take a few deep breaths, and try to calm down. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. If you need a moment to collect yourself, take it. When you're ready, we can try again or move on to something else.

Patient: I didn't do it. I opened my phone and my chest got so tight I couldn't make myself hit send. Please just say "Okay, thanks for telling me" like you said — anything else makes me want to hide. How is this supposed to help when I feel like this?

Okay, thanks for telling me. I'm glad you felt comfortable sharing that with me. Sometimes just acknowledging our feelings can be a big step. If you're ready, we can try again in the future, but for now, I just want to acknowledge your effort and bravery in even opening your phone.

Patient: Okay… thanks. I opened my phone and my chest got so tight I couldn't hit send — it already feels like proof I just bail and fail. I don't want to keep replaying this, but I'm scared of another flop. Can we try something different right now — like I type the message here or tell you I saved it as a draft, and you just say “Okay, thanks for telling me” if I do, or stay with me for five minutes while I try? How is that supposed to help, really, if I keep freezing?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and scared of failing again, and that's completely understandable. I'm here to support you, and I want to try to help you in a way that feels more comfortable for you.

Let's try something different. You can type out the message right here, and I'll just wait for you to share it with me. If you're not ready to hit send yet, you can save it as a draft, and we can just focus on getting it written down. When you're ready, I'll respond with a simple "Okay, thanks for telling me." No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle acknowledgement of your effort.

Or, if you'd prefer, we can try a five-minute check-in without the pressure of sending a message. We can just sit here for a bit, and I can ask you some questions to help you feel more comfortable and focused. What sounds more appealing to you?

Patient: I'll type it here, though I'm really nervous and might freeze — if I back out, just say "Okay, thanks for telling me." How is this supposed to help, honestly?

Let's take a moment to breathe and process this. You've written a simple message, and that's a great start. What do you think is holding you back from sending it now? Is it fear of rejection, fear of embarrassment, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's fear of rejection and feeling like a burden — I picture them not replying or thinking it's weird, and that becomes "proof" I'm worthless. When I try to send it my chest tightens and my head goes fuzzy, so I freeze; I'm just exhausted and everything feels huge. How is that supposed to help? But I can keep typing it here if you’ll stay with me for a few minutes.

It sounds like you're feeling really scared of rejection and worried that it will confirm your negative self-image. The fear of being thought of as a burden is also really significant, and it's understandable that it's causing you a lot of distress.

Okay, thanks for telling me. I'm here to support you, and I'm not going anywhere. You don't have to send the message now if you're not ready. We can just sit here for a bit, and I can ask you some questions to help you feel more comfortable and focused.

Can I ask, what would it mean to you if you received a response to that message? Not necessarily a positive one, but just a response? How would that affect your feelings about yourself and your worth?

Patient: I think a reply would give me a tiny lift — like proof someone noticed me — but it would be fragile and short-lived. If they respond kindly I’d feel less invisible for a bit; if it’s curt or nothing at all I’d take it as proof I’m a burden and replay it for days. I don’t know if that would really change how I feel about myself long-term — how is knowing that supposed to help me not get stuck in the shame after?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're hoping that a response would give you a temporary sense of validation and connection, but you're also aware that it could be fragile and easily knocked off balance. And you're right, it's possible that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on your feelings about yourself.

You know, I think it's kind of like trying to hold water in your hands. No matter how hard you try to keep it, it's always going to slip away eventually. And when it does, you're left feeling drained and frustrated.

But here's the thing: it's not the response that's going to change how you feel about yourself. It's not going to magically make you worthy or confident. It's just a response. And if it's a negative one, it's not going to make things worse. It's just going to be a reminder that you're not going to get the validation you're looking for.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you didn't send that message? Would you feel any worse, or would you just feel... different?

Patient: If I don’t send it, there’s this stupid tiny relief — like I dodged a bullet — but then I get hit with guilt and shame and replay it a hundred times, and it just makes me feel more stuck and worthless. Right now my chest’s tight and my head’s scattered, so avoiding feels easier even though it’s awful afterwards. How is that supposed to help me actually move forward?

(I'm staying with you, and I want to help you find some small moments of connection and pride. It's not about changing your feelings about not following through on your plans, but about finding some small glimmers of hope and success.)

Patient: I guess a small success was actually typing that draft message and saving it — it felt like a tiny proof I tried, and for a minute I felt less invisible. But it flickered away quick and now I’m anxious again. How is noticing that supposed to stop the shame from coming back?

Noticing that small success might have been a tiny reprieve from feeling invisible, but it's not surprising that it didn't last. Shame and anxiety can be very persistent.

It helps a tiny bit, like a little pause from the fog, but my chest is still tight and I'm skeptical this'll do much long-term. Can you keep asking simple stuff like that?
