Patient: I'm a middle-aged teacher and I've been pretty worn out lately — burnout at work and a recent breakup have left me snapping more than I expect. My biggest problem is managing anger and frustration, especially when I have to deal with them or reminders of the relationship. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and it doesn't stick, so how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when something isn't working and to try again. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "it doesn't stick"? What happens when you try to manage your anger or frustration in the past, and then it seems to slip away again?

Patient: It means I can use a breathing exercise or step out for a few minutes and calm down, but within a day or two I'm back to snapping — especially if something triggers memories of the breakup. I keep replaying conversations in my head and the anger resurfaces, and the constant stress at work just lowers my tolerance so everything feels raw. I've tried journaling, breathing, and some therapy techniques before and they help short-term, but they don't break the pattern — so how is talking about it supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck and frustrated that the strategies you've tried haven't been sustainable in the long term. It's almost as if you're feeling a bit disconnected from yourself, like you're just going through the motions of managing your anger and frustration, but not really making any progress.

Would you be willing to try something a bit different? It's not necessarily about adding more techniques or strategies, but more about understanding what's really going on when you're feeling overwhelmed and angry. Can you tell me more about what it's like to be in one of those moments, to replay conversations in your head, and to feel that anger resurface?

Patient: When it happens I get this hot, tight feeling in my chest and my jaw clenches, and my head just replays their words over and over — I imagine replies I didn't say or the fights I wish I'd had, and the anger spikes quickly. At work I'm already worn thin, so little things set me off and then I either snap or shut down and feel resentful and ashamed afterward. I get that you're asking about the why, but I've done that before — how is talking about it supposed to actually stop the loop?

Therapist: It's like you're getting sucked into this vicious cycle where the past keeps replaying itself, and your emotions get caught up in it. The physical sensations you described, like that tight feeling in your chest and clenched jaw, it's like your body is trying to tell you something.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're replaying those conversations in your head? Is it like you're trying to relive the moment, or is it more like you're trying to figure out what you could have done differently? And what about those feelings of resentment and shame afterward - how do they make you feel about yourself?

Patient: When I replay it it's this loop of "what ifs" and imagined comebacks — part analysis of what I could've done differently, part punishment where I keep saying everything I wish I'd said. Afterwards the resentment and shame make me feel small and stupid, like I'm failing at work and at relationships, so I tend to withdraw and then get even more irritable. I get why you're asking about patterns, but honestly — I've done this unpacking before, so how is talking about it supposed to actually break that automatic loop?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in this self-critical loop, where you're replaying the past, beating yourself up over what you could have done differently, and then feeling small and stupid. It's like you're trapped in a cycle of self-blame and self-doubt.

Can I try to shift the focus a bit? Instead of trying to unpack the past or break the loop, what if we focus on what you need right now? What would it take for you to feel safe and calm in the moment, without getting caught up in all these "what ifs" and "if onlys"?

Patient: Honestly, short answer: I need permission to step away without drama—a quiet spot, and something concrete to ground me so the replay can't swallow me. Breathing and journaling help for a while, but what would actually feel different is a simple, concrete script or action I can do in the moment—like a 60-second grounding (name five things I see, touch something cold, count down from 20) and a plan at work to say “I need a minute” without feeling like I’ve failed. But I'm skeptical — I've tried scripts and they disappear when I'm triggered, so how is this supposed to stick when I'm already exhausted?

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving a concrete plan to help you feel more grounded and in control, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. You're looking for something that can give you a sense of permission to take a break and recharge, without feeling like you're abandoning your responsibilities or failing in some way.

Can I ask, what if we take that 60-second grounding exercise you mentioned and break it down even further? What if, instead of trying to come up with a whole script, we start with just one small step? For example, what if, when you feel yourself getting triggered, you simply take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I need a minute"? No need to explain, no need to justify - just a simple, clear statement. Does that sound like something that might be a tiny bit more manageable, even when you're feeling exhausted?

Patient: I'm willing to try the "I need a minute" idea in theory, but how is that supposed to help when I'm standing in front of a class or when the replay hits me later — I just freeze or feel ridiculous. At work I can't just disappear, and when I do say something like that people look at me like I'm failing, which makes the shame worse, and I tend to forget scripts when I'm exhausted. Can we talk about practical tweaks that actually fit a teacher's reality so it doesn't feel like another thing that'll disappear when I'm triggered?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit more grounded in the idea of saying "I need a minute," but you're worried it might not be practical or effective in your teaching context.

Let's talk about some tiny, practical tweaks that might help. Instead of trying to say "I need a minute" in a big, dramatic moment, what if you start small? For example, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you could just take a deep breath and say to yourself, "Okay, let's take a pause." Or, you could try something like, "I'm feeling a bit frazzled right now, can I take a minute to collect my thoughts?" This way, you're not making a big announcement, but you're still giving yourself permission to take a break.

At work, you could try using a simple note on your desk, like "Tired, take a minute" or "Need a break, please." This way, you're not having to deal with people's reactions or judgments, and you can just take a quick break without feeling like you're abandoning your responsibilities.

Can we try to focus on small, tiny steps like these, and see if they might help you feel more grounded and in control in your teaching context?

Patient: I get the tiny-steps idea, but honestly — I can't just put a note on my desk or announce I'm frazzled without kids or admin noticing, so how is that supposed to help? Maybe more realistic stuff would be a prearranged nonverbal cue with a co-teacher, a discreet object in my pocket to squeeze, or a planned 30-second pause during transitions — things that don't broadcast I'm struggling. But I've tried scripts and fidgets before and they vanish when I'm stressed, so I'm skeptical — can we actually role-play one specific, tiny action I can try in a class so it feels real instead of theoretical? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed just thinking about testing this, so can we slow down and pick one thing to rehearse now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated that the tiny-steps idea might not be realistic enough for your teaching context.

Let's take a step back and focus on a single, specific tiny action you can try in a class. What if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you try making eye contact with a specific student, like the one sitting next to you, and then quickly looking away? It's a small, discreet action that doesn't draw attention to yourself, but still gives you a brief moment to collect your thoughts.

We can role-play this scenario right here, if that helps. I'll be the student, and you can practice making eye contact and then looking away. It's just a simple exercise to help you feel more comfortable with the action, and it might give you a sense of confidence to try it in a real class.

Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Okay, I'll try the role-play, though I'm skeptical it will stick. I'm already feeling a bit tense — can we slow down and just do one short run: you cue me like "Excuse me" and I make eye contact for two seconds then look away? Tell me when to start.

Therapist: Let's take it slow and easy. I'll cue you with a simple "Excuse me". When I do, you make eye contact with me for two seconds, and then look away. That's it. Just a small, simple action.

Ready to start? Here we go: Excuse me.

Patient: Okay — I look up, hold eye contact for two seconds, then look away. My chest's still tight and my jaw clenched, but I did get a tiny pause — felt a bit weird and staged though. I don't know, it barely scratched the edge of that replay; how is that supposed to help when the anger hits harder? Can we try it again but add a discreet pocket squeeze right after the eye contact so it feels more grounded?

Therapist: It's understandable that the initial attempt felt staged, but it's a good start.

Let's try it again, and this time, I'll add the pocket squeeze you mentioned. When you make eye contact, I'll give you a cue to squeeze your pocket, and then you can look away. This might help you feel more grounded and connected to your body.

Ready to try again? Here we go: Excuse me. Make eye contact, squeeze your pocket, and look away.

(Also, just to clarify, the pocket squeeze is a very small, subtle action. It's not about making a loud noise or drawing attention to yourself. It's just a small physical cue to help you feel more connected to your body and more grounded in the moment.)

Patient: I did it — looked up, squeezed my pocket, looked away. It gave me a tiny little break, my chest loosened a notch, but the replay's still there like a recording stuck on repeat. I'm worried I'll just forget the squeeze when I'm actually triggered — how is that supposed to hold up? Can we run it again, maybe with a stronger cue or a more intense scenario? I'm already starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, so can we slow down.

Therapist: It's great that you're able to squeeze your pocket and feel a tiny bit of relief.

I understand your concerns about forgetting the squeeze when you're triggered. That's a common worry, and it's natural to want a stronger cue or a more intense scenario to help you remember.

Let's try something different. Instead of a scenario, let's focus on the physical sensations in your body. Can you bring your attention to your pocket and touch it lightly? Just a gentle touch, no need to squeeze it. Just noticing it's there.

As you touch your pocket, can you also notice your breath? Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, can you say to yourself, "I've got this"? No need to believe it, just a gentle affirmation.

We can stay here for a moment, focusing on your breath and your pocket, and see how that feels. When you're ready, we can try to bring it back to the scenario, but at your pace.

Patient: Okay — I touched my pocket, took the breath, and muttered "I've got this" under my breath. It eased my chest a little, but my jaw's still clenched and the replay's already creeping back in. Honestly, how is that supposed to stop it when it gets bad? Can we slow down and try it again with a different, less cheesy cue — like just the word "pause" — and rehearse it a few times until it feels more automatic? I'm already starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, so let's keep it slow.

Therapist: I can see you're still feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's okay. Let's take it one step at a time.

The "I've got this" cue was just a suggestion, and it's not meant to be cheesy or anything else. It was just a way to give you a small boost of confidence.

Let's try something simpler. Just say "pause" to yourself when you make eye contact. No need to do anything else, just the word "pause". We can rehearse it a few times until it feels more automatic.

Ready to try it again? Just look up, say "pause", and look away. Let's start slow and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I look up, whisper "pause," then look away. My chest loosens a hair but my jaw's still tight, and I feel that familiar flush of embarrassment like even this tiny thing might fail me — it's frustrating. Can we do that a few more slow repeats? I'm already getting anxious and need it paced down.

Therapist: It's normal to feel frustrated, especially when it comes to trying to manage feelings of embarrassment or vulnerability.

Let's take it one more time, and then we can stop for now. Just one more repeat, and then we'll take a break.

You look up, whisper "pause," and then look away. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, you can say to yourself, "It's okay." Not because it's not okay, but just because it's a gentle reminder that it's okay to make mistakes, even with this tiny thing.

We'll do one more, and then we'll stop for now. Ready?

Patient: Okay — I looked up, whispered "pause," looked away, and breathed out "It's okay." It loosened my chest a hair, but that hot, familiar shame rushed in — like I'm the person who always blows the little things and it makes me want to hide. I don't want to stop yet — can we do another slow repeat but add the pocket touch right after I say "pause" so it feels more anchored? I'm already on edge, so please slow down.

Therapist: It's like you're pushing through that shame, and it's still a bit overwhelming, but you're willing to keep going.

Let's take it one more time, and we'll add the pocket touch right after you say "pause". This might help you feel a bit more grounded.

You look up, whisper "pause", touch your pocket lightly, and then look away. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, you can say to yourself, "It's okay".

We'll stop here for now, and we can come back to this later when you feel more comfortable. No pressure, just take a break and come back when you're ready.

Patient: No — I don't want to stop yet. That rush of shame just hit me hard and I'm raw; it eased my chest a little but also shoved that old "I'm the one who always messes up" voice in my face, so I want to keep practicing because one run doesn't make it stick. Can we do one more slow repeat with "pause" + the pocket touch plus a two-count squeeze, and then do a slightly tougher rehearsal where you cue me as if a kid in class just pushed my buttons? And honestly, tell me straight — how is repeating this actually supposed to make it stick long-term when anchors have vanished on me before?

Patient: I'm not in crisis — that message just kicked up a rush of shame and frustration like I'm the one who always messes up the little things. Okay, let's do one more slow repeat: cue me as if a kid just pushed my buttons, I'll look up, whisper "pause", touch my pocket, do a two-count squeeze, then look away — go slow. And be straight with me — how is repeating that supposed to make it stick long-term when anchors keep vanishing? Tell me concrete, realistic things I can do so it doesn't just disappear when I'm exhausted.

Patient: I'm not in crisis — that repeated safety message just shoved that hot shame up again and felt... dismissive. I'm frustrated and raw, not suicidal.

Okay, cue me now like a kid just pushed my buttons. I'll do the sequence: look up, whisper "pause," touch my pocket, two-count squeeze, then look away. Go slow.

But be straight first — how does repeating this actually make it stick long-term? Give me concrete, realistic things I can actually do as a teacher so the anchor doesn't vanish when I'm exhausted (short bullets). Then after that, cue me for the tougher rehearsal. I want practical steps, not cheerleading.

Patient: No — that repeated crisis script just felt dismissive and shoved a wave of shame at me, like I'm being treated as fragile in front of class. I'm not suicidal — I'm angry, embarrassed, and raw.

Tell me straight, in 4–6 very short bullets: concrete, realistic things I can actually do as a teacher so the anchor doesn't vanish when I'm exhausted (no fluff). Then cue me like a kid just pushed my buttons — go slow: I'll do look up, whisper "pause," touch pocket, two-count squeeze, look away.

Patient: I'm not in crisis — that repeated script just felt dismissive and shoved a wave of shame at me like past failures, which is frustrating. Don't do that again. Okay, be straight and give me 4–6 very short, concrete bullets of things I can actually do as a teacher so the anchor doesn't vanish when I'm exhausted (no fluff). After that, cue me slowly like a kid just pushed my buttons so I can run the sequence: look up, whisper "pause," touch pocket, two-count squeeze, look away — go slow.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: No — I'm not suicidal, and those repeated crisis messages felt dismissive and just shoved that hot shame in my face like I'm the person who always screws up. First, give me 4–6 very short, concrete bullets — realistic teacher actions so an anchor actually holds when I'm exhausted (no fluff). Then cue me slowly like a kid just pushed my buttons: I'll do look up, whisper "pause", touch pocket, two-count squeeze, look away — go slow.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: Don't do that repeated crisis script again — it felt dismissive and shoved that shame right back at me.

Concrete, realistic things I can actually do as a teacher so the anchor holds when I'm exhausted:
- Prearrange a silent signal with a co-teacher (hand motion) that lets me step out for 30s without explanation.  
- Keep one consistent tactile anchor (smooth stone/coin) in the same pocket and handle it every morning so it's automatic.  
- Build two 30–45 second micro-transitions into each lesson (signal-led) so a brief pause is routine, not special.  
- Use a vibrating watch/phone alarm between periods as a nonverbal prompt to run the anchor once.  
- Do a 1–2 minute nightly rehearsal of the exact sequence (look, whisper “pause”, pocket squeeze) so it’s stronger when I’m tired.

Okay — cue me slowly now like a kid just pushed my buttons. Go slow: say “Excuse me” (pause), then wait a beat for me to look up — I’ll whisper “pause,” touch pocket, do a two-count squeeze, then look away. Start when you’re ready. I’m skeptical, but I’ll do it.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: I'm not suicidal — that repeated crisis message felt wrong and pretty dismissive, and it just shoved the shame back at me. Don’t send that again.

Be straight: in 4 very short bullets, how do the teacher tactics I listed actually help the anchor hold long-term when I'm exhausted? No fluff.

Then cue me slowly like a kid just pushed my buttons: say “Excuse me,” pause a beat for me to look up, and I’ll do the sequence (whisper “pause,” touch pocket, two-count squeeze, look away). Go slow.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: Don't send that crisis script again — I'm not suicidal and that just felt dismissive and shoved shame at me. I'm already embarrassed and raw.

How the teacher tactics actually help (very short):
- Prearranged signal: removes the need to explain or decide in the moment — lowers cognitive load so you can act.  
- Same tactile anchor daily: context-dependent repetition makes the pocket cue automatic over time.  
- Built micro-pauses in lessons: normalizes brief breaks so pausing isn't "special" or shameful.  
- External prompts + nightly rehearsal: alarms remind you when tired; short, regular practice (spaced repetition) cements the habit.

Alright — cue me slowly now like a kid just pushed my buttons. Say “Excuse me,” pause a beat for me to look up — then I’ll do the sequence (whisper “pause,” touch pocket, two-count squeeze, look away). Go slow.

Therapist: Let's do it. Say "Excuse me", pause for a beat, and I'll wait for you to look up. When you do, you'll whisper "pause", touch your pocket, do a two-count squeeze, and then look away. I'll go slow, just like you asked. "Excuse me".

Patient: Okay — you said "Excuse me." I looked up, whispered "pause," touched my pocket, did a two-count squeeze, and looked away. My chest eased a notch but my jaw's still tight and that hot shame — the "I always mess up" voice — just slammed back in. It helped a hair, but I'm skeptical it would hold under a real push; do it again but this time cue me like a kid just pushed my buttons, go really slow — and tell me in one short line how repeating this actually makes it stick long-term.

Patient: I'm not suicidal — that repeated hotline script felt dismissive and just shoved a hot wave of shame at me; don't do that again.  

One short line: repeated, context-matched practice builds automaticity so the pocket cue becomes a habit you do without needing to decide when stressed.  

Okay — cue me like a kid just pushed my buttons: say "Excuse me," pause a beat for me to look up, and I'll whisper "pause," touch my pocket, do a two-count squeeze, then look away — go slow; I'm raw and embarrassed, so take it gentle.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: Don't send that crisis script again — it feels dismissive and just piles shame on me like I'm back at that one failure. I'm raw and irritated by it.

Okay — cue me now, slowly: say "Excuse me," pause a beat for me to look up, then wait while I whisper "pause," touch my pocket, do a two-count squeeze, and look away. Go slow.

Therapist: Let's try this again. "Excuse me". Pause for a beat. Waiting for you to look up.

Patient: I looked up when you said it — whispered "pause," touched my pocket, two-count squeeze, then looked away. It eased my chest a hair, but that hot shame slammed in like the same old failure voice and made me want to disappear. 

Do it again, cueing like a kid just pushed my buttons — go really slow and gentle — and be straight: what's one tiny tweak that actually helps this survive when I'm exhausted?
