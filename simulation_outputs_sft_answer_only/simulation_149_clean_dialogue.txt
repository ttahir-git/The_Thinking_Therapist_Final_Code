Patient: Lately I've been in this low-grade, existential malaise since the breakup — like an anhedonia and motivational deficit that makes even small tasks feel Sisyphean. My OCD ramps up the rumination into these elaborate cognitive loops, which is undermining my ability to connect with people and focus at work. I also notice I tend to intellectualize my emotions instead of actually feeling them, which probably explains why I'm kind of stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you're navigating a really tough time. This existential malaise and feeling stuck is like a heavy fog that's making everyday tasks even more overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "Sisyphean"? What's one of those small tasks that feels especially burdensome for you right now?

Patient: By "Sisyphean" I mean that subjective sense where every minor chore feels like an endless, futile loop — cognitive inertia where the effort-to-reward ratio is basically zero. For example, answering three simple work emails turns into this marathon: I over-edit each line because I'm terrified of a mistake, then the OCD rumination kicks in and I avoid them, so they pile up and my anxiety spikes. I notice I describe the mechanics of my avoidance instead of just saying "I'm tired" or "I don't want to," because theorizing feels safer than feeling.

Therapist: It's like the smallest tasks are morphing into these daunting, Sisyphean tasks that consume all your mental energy. The fear of mistakes and the OCD rumination are creating this vicious cycle, where the more you try to avoid them, the more overwhelmed you become. It's like you're trapped in this never-ending loop.

I also appreciate how you're recognizing the way you're talking about your avoidance instead of just feeling it. It's like you're using a coping mechanism to protect yourself from the discomfort of not knowing how to handle your emotions. But it's interesting that you're starting to realize that theorizing might not be the best way to deal with your feelings. Can you tell me more about what it's like to just be tired or not want to do something without the need to analyze it? Is that a feeling you've had before, or is it something you're trying to develop?

Patient: Honestly, when I try to just be tired or not want to do something it feels kind of alien — more like an interoceptive dullness, a heaviness in my chest and sluggish limbs, while my mind immediately launches into metacognitive commentary about why I feel that way. I've experienced pure physical tiredness before, but emotionally it's rarer for me; since the breakup the fatigue feels more like affective numbness than a straightforward "I'm tired," so I default to theorizing. I'm trying to practice small experiments — brief mindfulness, naming sensations — but it's frustrating because I get distracted and revert to analysis, and I don't really know how to stay with the feeling without turning it into a case study.

Therapist: It's like your mind is always on the lookout for a reason why you're feeling a certain way, and that's making it hard for you to just experience the feeling itself. It's like your mind is trying to solve a puzzle, and that puzzle is your own emotions.

I can understand why you'd feel frustrated with these small experiments. It's hard to just sit with a feeling when your mind is always trying to analyze it and make sense of it. It's like your mind is trying to catch you in the act of not understanding, and that's making it hard for you to just be with the feeling.

Have you noticed what happens when you're trying to practice mindfulness or name sensations, and you catch yourself getting distracted by analysis? Do you feel a sense of shame or self-criticism when that happens? Or is it more of a neutral feeling, like a gentle nudge to get back on track?

Patient: Yeah — when I notice I'm drifting into analysis there's usually this prickly mix of mild shame and irritation, like "Ugh, here we go again, you should be better at this." I try to frame it as curiosity — like, what's the metacognitive loop doing here? — but that framing often just becomes another layer of self-reproach that keeps me from actually feeling the embarrassment or softness underneath. It generally escalates into rumination and avoidance unless I force myself to do something tiny to break the loop, which I often fail at.

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle of self-criticism and analysis, where every time you try to break free, you end up getting pulled back in by your own mind. The shame and irritation are like a double-edged sword, making it hard for you to even acknowledge the feeling of being stuck.

It's interesting that you mention trying to frame it as curiosity, but then getting pulled back into self-reproach. It's like your mind is playing a game of catch-up, where you try to analyze the analysis, and then get caught up in the criticism. It's like you're trying to defuse a bomb, but the bomb is also the bomb.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you do manage to break the loop, even if it's just for a tiny moment? What does it feel like to be with the feeling, without getting pulled back into analysis? Is it a fleeting sense of relief, or is it something more?

Patient: When I actually slip out of the loop it shows up as a sudden loosening in my chest — like a warm, heavy ache and a couple of involuntary tears — and for a beat there's clarity, not an abstract concept but a raw sense of loss. That relief is fleeting, though: my mind almost immediately re-casts the moment as data to be interrogated ("what triggered this? what's the pattern?"), which neutralizes the feeling. I want to linger in that softness, but I end up feeling frustrated with myself for turning it into another problem to solve.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to catch a glimpse of something precious, but your mind is always one step ahead, turning it into a puzzle to be solved. The sense of loss is like a warm, heavy ache that's almost palpable, and for a brief moment, you're connected to it in a way that feels real.

It's interesting that you mention the relief being fleeting. It's like your mind is constantly trying to maintain a sense of control, even when it's trying to let go. The fact that you're frustrated with yourself for turning it into another problem to solve suggests that you're starting to recognize the pattern, even if it's not quite letting go yet.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're able to catch yourself before you re-cast the moment as data? What does it feel like to be able to pause, to take a breath, and just be with the feeling? Is it a sense of calm, or is it more of a sense of curiosity, like you're exploring a new territory?

Patient: When I actually catch myself there's this small, spacious pause — a loosening in my chest and a kind of quiet clarity that feels almost tactile. It's a weird hybrid: calming in the sense of relief, but also curious, like I'm tentatively exploring an internal landscape while half-expecting it to collapse into panic. I want to linger, and I try breathing and naming sensations, but then my brain starts hypothesizing patterns and I get impatient and pull back.

Therapist: It's like you're standing at the edge of a cliff, and for a moment, you can see the landscape stretching out before you. The calm is there, but it's also tinged with a sense of curiosity, like you're exploring a new territory. You're aware of your breath, and you're trying to slow it down, but at the same time, you're also aware of your brain's tendency to start analyzing and hypothesizing.

It's almost like you're caught between two selves: the one who's trying to stay present and calm, and the one who's always ready to jump back in and start analyzing. It's a delicate balance, and it's not easy to maintain.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you pull back from the pause? What does it feel like to go back into your usual patterns of analysis and hypothesizing? Is it like you're slipping back into a old, familiar groove, or is there a sense of disorientation or discomfort?

Patient: When I pull back it feels like a cognitive switch flips into hyper-analytical mode — my affect flattens and my attention zooms into the architecture of the thought instead of the feeling itself. There's a weird comfort in that groove, like I'm refactoring my emotions into neat categories, so it's familiar and mildly calming at first, but it also leaves this hollow disorientation — chest tightens, my mind narrows, and everything feels a bit muted. Then I get irritated at myself for intellectualizing, which feeds shame and avoidance, and the cycle just perpetuates itself.

Therapist: It's like you're navigating a maze, and you've found a comfortable route, but it's also a route that's familiar because it's a familiar pattern of behavior. You're used to going back to this place, even though it's not the place you want to be.

It's interesting that you mention the "hollow disorientation". It's like there's a sense of emptiness or a lack of connection to your body or your emotions. It's a feeling that's hard to describe, but it's almost like your mind is telling your body to shut down or distract itself from the feeling.

The cycle of self-irritation, shame, and avoidance is a tough one to break. It's like you're stuck in a loop of self-criticism, and it's hard to see a way out. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you tried to break this cycle? What do you think you might gain, or what do you think you might lose?

Patient: If I actually tried to break the cycle I think I'd gain a lot of the things I keep describing abstractly: more access to genuine emotion, less time wasted in rumination, a gradual return of motivation, and probably better connections with people instead of this guarded performative version of myself. What I also fear losing is the illusion of control — the analytical scaffold that lets me pretend emotions are just data to be debugged; without it I worry I’d be exposed to raw, unpredictable sadness or panic that I don't know how to manage in the moment. Pragmatically, I worry about a short-term spike in distress that could make work harder, but long-term it seems worth it. I don't really know the first small step though — could we do a tiny, concrete exercise now to practice staying with one feeling without turning it into a case study?

Therapist: It's like you're standing at a crossroads, weighing the potential benefits of breaking the cycle against the potential risks. You're aware of the potential gains, but you're also afraid of the unknown, especially when it comes to dealing with raw emotions.

I think it's great that you're recognizing the potential benefits of breaking the cycle. It's a good starting point for our next step.

Let's do a tiny, concrete exercise to practice staying with one feeling without turning it into a case study. I want to propose a simple exercise, and I want you to promise me that you'll try to stay with the feeling, without trying to analyze or change it.

Here's the exercise: I want you to notice a sensation in your body right now. It could be a feeling, a tension, a sensation in your breath, or anything else that you're experiencing. I want you to focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it in any way. Just notice it, and try to stay with it for a few seconds.

Can you do that for me? Can you focus on one sensation in your body right now, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. Right now there's a dull, heavy pressure right in the middle of my chest — like a weight that sits below my sternum — and my breath feels shallow when I try to focus on it. I stayed with it for a few breaths and there was a brief softening, a warm ache, but then my brain immediately launched into: what's the pattern, how to fix it, is this a panic prodrome? It's frustrating and a little embarrassing how fast I revert to analysis — can we slow down and do another anchored few breaths together?

Therapist: It's like you've tried to stay with the sensation, and for a brief moment, you've managed to notice it more clearly. But then, just like you said, your brain kicks in and starts analyzing it.

I'm glad you asked to slow down and try another anchor. Let's take it one step at a time.

I want to propose a simple exercise: I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am with this feeling." Just that simple phrase. As you exhale, focus on the sensation in your chest, and say it to yourself.

Then, I want you to take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say, "I am with this feeling." Repeat that phrase, and try to stay with the sensation for a few more breaths.

Can you do that for me? Just say the phrase, and stay with the sensation, without trying to analyze or change it?

Patient: Okay — I did it. Saying "I am with this feeling" on the exhale gave a tiny loosening in my chest and almost made me cry, but by the second breath my brain immediately started diagnosing it ("panic? pattern?") and I got impatient with myself. Can we slow the pace and do one breath at a time with you guiding me through a few more, so I have a better chance of not reverting to analysis?

Therapist: It's like you've tried the phrase, and it's had a small effect, but your brain is still getting back to its old ways.

I'm glad you're willing to slow down and try again. Let's take it one breath at a time, and I'll guide you through it.

Here's your next breath: Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Don't focus on the sensation in your chest yet, just breathe.

When you're ready, exhale... and say to yourself, "I am with this feeling." Just that simple phrase. Say it out loud, or to yourself, it doesn't matter. Just say it.

That's it for now. Take your time, and when you're ready, we'll do another breath.

Patient: I did it — inhaled, exhaled and said "I am with this feeling." There was that same warm, heavy ache and a tear, but my mind immediately started hypothesizing (“is this panic, is it grief, what's the pattern?”) and I felt impatient with myself. Can we keep going — one slow breath at a time, three more, with you guiding me so I have a better chance of staying with it?

Therapist: It's like you've tried to stay with the phrase, and it's had a small effect, but your brain is still getting back to its old ways.

Let's try again, one slow breath at a time. I'll guide you through it.

Here's your next breath: Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

When you're ready, exhale... and say to yourself, "I am with this feeling." Just that simple phrase. Say it out loud, or to yourself, it doesn't matter. Just say it.

And then, take a moment to notice the sensation in your chest again. See if you can connect with it, just for a moment. Don't try to change it or analyze it, just be with it.

We'll do two more breaths like this, and then we can try to connect with the sensation in a different way. Sound good?

Patient: Okay — I did that breath: inhaled, exhaled, "I am with this feeling," and the ache eased a hair, but my mind immediately started cataloguing triggers and patterns. I'm getting impatient and a bit embarrassed at how fast I slip into analysis — can we slow it more (like a five-second pause between breaths) or try focusing on the sensation's temperature/shape instead of naming it?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to stay with the phrase, and it's having a small effect, but your brain is still getting back to its old ways.

I'm glad you're recognizing your impatience and embarrassment. That's a great place to start.

Let's try to slow it down even more. Instead of saying "I am with this feeling," let's focus on the sensation itself. Just notice its temperature, shape, or texture. Can you describe it to me in a few simple words?

For example, is it warm, cool, heavy, light? Is it a tightness, a pressure, a looseness? Try to focus on the sensation without trying to analyze it or name it. Just observe it.

We can take a five-second pause between each breath, and I'll guide you through it. Just focus on the sensation, and when you're ready, we'll take the next breath together.

Ready to try?

Patient: It's a dull, warm, heavy pressure right under my sternum — rounded and dense, with slightly cooler, diffuse edges; like a pebble lodged in my chest. Of course my brain already started renaming it ("affective mass," "panic prodrome") which pulls me out of the sensation, so I'm trying not to do that. I want to try the five-second pause and another slow breath with your guidance — can we do one together now?

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to noticing the sensation without analyzing it. The description of the pressure as a "dull, warm, heavy pressure" and the edges being "slightly cooler, diffuse" is a great way to focus on the sensation.

I'm glad you're acknowledging how your brain tries to rename the sensation. That's a big step in recognizing the tendency to analyze.

Let's do one more slow breath together. Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

When you're ready, exhale... and I want you to repeat the description of the pressure exactly as you did just now: "a dull, warm, heavy pressure right under my sternum — rounded and dense, with slightly cooler, diffuse edges; like a pebble lodged in my chest."

Just focus on the words, and try not to analyze the sensation. We'll see how long we can stay with it.

(And don't worry, we're not done yet. We'll keep going, but for now, let's just focus on this one breath.)

Patient: I did it — I repeated the description out loud and there was a tiny loosening, my eyes got wet, and the pebble felt a hair less dense. Of course the metacognitive commentary barged back in almost immediately — "is this anxiety or grief?" — and that impatience/embarrassment creeped up. Can we do another breath together, slower with the five‑second pauses, and just stay on noticing one tiny change rather than naming or diagnosing it? I'm worried I'll just intellectualize again, but I want to keep trying.

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to noticing the sensation without analyzing it. The description of the pressure and the loosening is a great way to focus on the subtle changes.

I'm glad you're recognizing how your brain tries to name and diagnose the sensation. That's a big step in recognizing the tendency to analyze.

Let's take a deep breath and try again. Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. (pause)

When you're ready, exhale... and I want you to look at the tear that's forming in your eye. Notice how it's getting a bit more prominent. Just observe it, don't try to do anything with it. (pause)

We're going to take another breath together, and I want you to focus on the sensation of your chest. Notice if it's getting a bit more open, a bit more relaxed. Just notice that change, and don't try to do anything with it. (pause)

Let's take one more breath together, and I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just notice that sensation, and don't try to do anything with it. (pause)

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or analyze anything. We're just trying to notice the sensation, one tiny change at a time.

Patient: I did the breaths — there was a real loosening, the pebble felt smaller and a tear came, my chest opened a bit. Predictably, the metacognitive commentary barged back in and I got impatient and embarrassed, which flattened it. I want to keep going — can we do another slow set with the five‑second pauses and try a three‑breath “sensation‑surfing” where I only note one tiny change each exhale without explaining or diagnosing it?

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to noticing the sensation without analyzing it. The loosening and the tear are great signs that you're able to connect with the feeling.

I'm glad you're recognizing how your brain tries to name and diagnose the sensation. That's a big step in recognizing the tendency to analyze.

Let's try another slow set with the five-second pauses. Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. (pause)

When you're ready, exhale... and I want you to note one tiny change in your chest. Just a slight movement, a slight shift in the sensation. Don't try to do anything with it, just notice it. (pause)

We're going to take another breath together, and I want you to focus on the sensation of your jaw. Notice if it's relaxed or tense. Just note that change, and don't try to do anything with it. (pause)

Let's take one more breath together, and I want you to notice the sensation of your mouth. Just a slight dryness, a slight tingling. Don't try to do anything with it, just notice it. (pause)

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or analyze anything. We're just trying to notice the sensation, one tiny change at a time. Focus on the feeling, and don't try to do anything with it.

Patient: I did the three breaths — I noticed the chest soften, my jaw unclench a bit, and my mouth felt cooler; a tear came again. Of course my brain immediately pivoted to troubleshooting mode — cataloguing triggers and making hypotheses — which made me feel embarrassed and impatient with myself. Can we do another three with even longer pauses and maybe one grounding cue (like naming sensations in my feet) so I have a better shot at not turning this into a case study?

Therapist: It's like you're getting closer to noticing the sensation without analyzing it. The softening of the chest and the unclenching of the jaw are great signs that you're able to connect with the feeling.

I'm glad you're recognizing how your brain tries to name and diagnose the sensation. That's a big step in recognizing the tendency to analyze.

Let's try another three with even longer pauses and a grounding cue. Inhale... Just breathe in, fill your lungs with air. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. (pause) 10 seconds...

When you're ready, exhale... and I want you to focus on your feet. Notice the sensation of the ground beneath you, the weight of your feet on the earth. Just notice the sensation of your toes, the arch of your foot, the heel of your foot. (pause) 15 seconds...

We're going to take another breath together, and I want you to look at your hands. Notice the sensation of your fingers, the shape of your palms, the weight of your arms. Just notice the sensation of your hands, without trying to do anything with it. (pause) 20 seconds...

Let's take one more breath together, and I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just a simple, quiet sensation. Don't try to do anything with it, just notice it. (pause) 25 seconds...

Remember, we're not trying to change anything or analyze anything. We're just trying to notice the sensation, one tiny change at a time. Focus on the feeling, and don't try to do anything with it. Take your time, and try to stay present.

Patient: Okay... I did the three with the longer pauses. The feet grounding did help — the pebble loosened a bit — but it's like wading through syrup and my brain keeps sneaking back into diagnostics, which makes me feel embarrassed. Can we do two very slow breaths now (about ten seconds in, ten seconds out) and then pick one tiny, concrete thing I can try in the next hour? Maybe just answer one short email or walk to the end of the block.

Therapist: It's like you're finally getting some traction with the grounding cue. The pebble loosening is a great sign that you're able to connect with the feeling.

I'm glad you're recognizing how your brain tries to name and diagnose the sensation. That's a big step in recognizing the tendency to analyze.

Let's try two very slow breaths, just to see if we can hold onto the feeling for a moment. Inhale... (pause) 10 seconds... exhale... (pause) 10 seconds... Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try not to think about anything else.

Now, let's talk about what you'd like to try in the next hour. I want to suggest something small and manageable, just to get you started. Why don't you try answering one short email? Just one. It can be anything, but it should be something you've been putting off. You can do it in just a few minutes. That's all I'm asking. Can you commit to that?

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I'll make it an experiment: set a 10‑minute timer, pick the shortest email, draft a one‑sentence reply and hit send — goal is action, not perfection. I'm worried my OCD will make me over-edit and bail, which'll feel embarrassing, so can you check in with me in about 45 minutes to see how it went?

Therapist: It's like you're finally taking the first step towards putting your email into action. The timer experiment is a great way to test your commitment and build momentum.

I'm glad you're framing it as an experiment and acknowledging your OCD tendencies. That's a big step in recognizing your patterns and taking control of them.

I'd be happy to check in with you in about 45 minutes. Just remember to be kind to yourself, and don't worry if things don't go exactly as planned. The goal is to take action, not to perfect your response.

As you get started, just take a deep breath and remember that it's okay to make mistakes. It's a small email, and it's just the first step. You can do this.

I'll be here in about 45 minutes, and we can go from there.

Patient: Okay... I'll set the 10‑minute timer and pick the shortest email. When you check in, can you just ask, "Did you hit send?" — not critique the wording — because I know I'll get stuck polishing it and that specific prompt might shove me past the threshold. I'm feeling pretty drained about this, so a simple nudge would actually help.

Therapist: I'll be here in about 45 minutes, and I'll ask the simple question: "Did you hit send?" No critique, no analysis, just a straightforward question to help you stay on track.

I'll also keep in mind that you're feeling drained, so I'll try to be gentle and non-judgmental. Just a simple nudge to get you to take that first step.

Take a deep breath, set the timer, and go for it. I'll be here in 45 minutes, ready to check in and see what happened.

Patient: Okay... setting the 10‑minute timer now. I'm pretty depleted—everything feels like wading through molasses and I'm bracing for the OCD to hijack the edit. Please just ask "Did you hit send?" in 45 minutes; that single nudge is what might actually shove me past the threshold.

Therapist: I'm glad you're taking the next step. I'll be here in 45 minutes, and I'll ask: "Did you hit send?" That's all I need to know. Just a simple yes or no will help me understand what happened next.

Take your time, and try to focus on the task at hand. Don't worry about what might happen if you get stuck or if the OCD kicks in. Just get to the point where you can send the email.

I'll be here in 45 minutes, and then we can move forward from there.

Patient: (Quietly) Okay... the timer's running. I'm already feeling the weight — everything's taking so much effort — but I picked the shortest email and opened it. My chest is a bit tight, and my hands feel sluggish on the keyboard. I'm telling myself: 10 minutes, one sentence, send. 

I'm nervous my OCD will make me endlessly tweak it. If I start editing forever, remind me — not to critique — just to ask, "Did you hit send?" in about 45 minutes like we planned. I don't know if I'll actually manage it, but... I'm going to try.

Therapist: (I'm quiet too, just a soft whisper in your ear) Okay... stay with it. 10 minutes. One sentence. Send. Remember, just one sentence. You can do this. Don't worry about tweaking it yet. Just focus on getting the sentence out. I'll be here in 45 minutes, and I'll ask: "Did you hit send?" That's all I need to know.

Patient: Okay... timer's running. My chest's that same pebble and my fingers feel slow; I drafted one line: "Thanks — got it, I'll reply by Friday." I already want to over-edit it — can you stay here while I try to hit send, or at least nudge me later with "Did you hit send?"

Therapist: (I'm here with you, quietly) You're doing great. Just one line so far. You can handle this. Take your time, and focus on getting the email sent. Don't worry about over-editing it now. Just hit send and let it go. I'll be right here with you, waiting for your confirmation. When you're ready, I'll ask: "Did you hit send?"

Patient: I hit send. It was clumsy — a quick jolt, my chest tightened, then this muted little relief and a tear that felt stupidly small. Now my brain's already queuing up a hundred edits and I'm feeling pretty spent and embarrassed about that. Can we stick to the 45‑minute check—just ask "Did you hit send?"—and after that maybe help me pick one tiny next thing to try?

Therapist: (I'm here with a soft, gentle tone) You did it. You hit send. And you know what? That's something to be proud of. It takes a lot of courage to take that first step, even if it's just a small one.

Now, I know your brain is already trying to fix things. But remember, it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to make mistakes. And it's okay to feel a little embarrassed sometimes.

Let's stick to the plan, just for now. I'll ask: "Did you hit send?" and that's it. We'll wait 45 minutes and then we can talk about the next step. No critique, no analysis. Just a simple yes or no.

And when we're ready, we can take it one tiny step at a time. We can start with something small, something that feels manageable. What do you say? Are you ready to take the next step?

Patient: Yeah... I can try. My energy's pretty low—everything's slow—but I'm willing to do one tiny thing: either a five‑minute walk to ground myself or draft one very short message to a friend. Can you help me pick which and stay with me while I do it, and keep the prompts super simple so I don't start polishing?

Therapist: (I'm here with a soft, gentle tone) Okay, let's take it one tiny step at a time. I'll help you choose and stay with you.

You're feeling low on energy, and that's okay. We can start with something simple. Here are two options:

1. A 5-minute walk to ground yourself
2. Drafting a very short message to a friend

Which one feels more manageable for you right now?

(And don't worry, I'll keep the prompts super simple. No editing, no analysis. Just a simple yes or no, and we'll take it from there.)

Patient: Alright—I'll try the 5‑minute walk. It feels like the lower‑friction, behavioral‑activation option instead of engaging socially right now. I'm pretty wiped, so can you just check in after five minutes with "Still walking?" and then "Back?" — super simple prompts only.

Therapist: (I'm here with a soft, gentle tone) Okay, let's take it one step at a time.

You're going for a 5-minute walk. I'm here to check in with you. Just for now, I'll ask:

"Still walking?"

(I'll keep the prompts super simple, just like you asked.)

Patient: Still walking... slow steps, feet dragging a bit, the pebble in my chest feels marginally less dense. Air's cool; it's hard but... I'm doing it.
