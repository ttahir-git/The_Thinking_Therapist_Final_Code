Patient: I'm a chef in my late twenties and lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little screw-up feels like proof I'm failing, and it's burned out my energy and social confidence. I can trace it back to being bullied at school; I still expect the worst in social situations and then either overdo things or shut down. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything?

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to admit when something is holding you back, especially when it feels like it's been building up for so long. Can you tell me more about what happens right before you start feeling like you're failing? Is there a specific situation, a feeling, or a thought that seems to trigger this cycle of self-criticism for you? Sometimes, just being able to name the moment when it starts can help us understand it a bit better.

Patient: Usually it starts with something small — like missing a ticket during service or someone laughing at a joke I make, and my brain instantly jumps to "you're useless." My chest tightens, I go quiet or I overdo it and try to perform, which just makes things worse socially. It drags me right back to being picked on in school, like I'm that same kid again. I get skeptical — I've tried noticing the moments before and it didn't fix anything, so how is that supposed to help now?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've already found some small moments where you're becoming aware of this cycle, and it's interesting that you're willing to try again. The thing is, it's not about fixing the past or erasing the memories of being bullied. It's about learning to be with yourself and your feelings in the present moment, without judgment.

When we notice the moments before we start criticizing ourselves, it's like we're giving ourselves permission to slow down, to breathe, and to say, "Wait a minute, what's happening here?" It's a chance to ask ourselves questions, like you did, and to explore what might be driving these feelings.

It's possible that your brain is still trying to protect you from the pain of the past, but it's doing so in a way that's holding you back now. By becoming more aware of these moments and learning to approach them with curiosity, rather than judgment, you might find that you're able to break free from some of this self-criticism. Would you be willing to try that, just for a little while, and see where it takes you?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that for a bit, but I'm doubtful. I've done the "notice and breathe" thing before—mid-service my chest tightens and "you're useless" just drowns everything out. How is being curious about it supposed to actually stop that panic and the urge to either clam up or perform?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to put out a fire with a fire extinguisher – the "notice and breathe" thing can give you a moment's respite, but it's not enough to stop the panic and self-criticism from taking over. Can you think of a time when you were able to notice your physical sensations, like your chest tightening, without immediately jumping to the thought "I'm useless"? Was there something else you were thinking or feeling in that moment? Sometimes, our bodies can be more complex than our minds, and if we can tap into those physical sensations, we might be able to find a different way to respond to them.

Patient: Yeah — sometimes when I'm in the zone during service, focused on plating and timing, I can feel the chest tighten but the "you're useless" voice doesn't hit right away. Those moments are short-lived though, and one missed ticket or a laugh and it all tumbles back into the same panic. I've tried pointing out the tightness before and it didn't stop me from freezing or trying to perform — how is noticing that actually supposed to change the next move?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've found moments of respite in the kitchen, where the "you're useless" voice is quieted, but those moments are fleeting and then the old pattern kicks back in. It's like the storm is brewing, but you've caught a glimpse of the eye – it's not a guarantee that the calm will last.

Notice how you're describing this experience – it's like you're observing a pattern, a cycle. You're seeing that the panic and self-criticism follow a certain trigger (the missed ticket, the laugh), and then the "you're useless" voice takes over. That's a powerful insight. It's not about changing the next move; it's about understanding the pattern. Can you think of how that understanding might change your relationship with these moments, even if it's just slightly?

Patient: I guess seeing it as a pattern instead of me being permanently broken might give me a little distance — like it's something that happens to me, not who I am. But honestly, knowing that hasn't stopped the panic mid-service; how is that supposed to help when everything's happening fast and I can't just step away? If it's about creating distance, what would I actually do differently in the moment that won't make things worse on the line?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're seeing the pattern as a temporary state, something that's not defining you, but it's not necessarily changing the fact that you're in the midst of a chaotic situation. It's not about stepping away; it's about finding a way to stay connected to yourself while still being present in the moment.

Can you think about what would happen if, instead of trying to freeze or perform, you could simply acknowledge the panic without judgment? Not in a way that says, "Oh, great, here we go again," but in a way that says, "I'm here, I'm feeling this, and I'm going to take a breath and see what happens." What if, in that moment, you could find a way to say, "I've got this" not because you're in control, but because you're present? Would that even be enough to help you stay focused on what needs to be done?

Patient: Maybe — in theory. But when I'm flooded that phrase feels fake, like adding more pressure. Breathing hasn't cut it in the middle of service; the noise and adrenaline drown it out. I need something 1–3 seconds and totally invisible that actually interrupts the panic without making me look like an idiot on the line — like a tiny physical anchor or a two-word thing that actually shifts me. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and skeptical, but give me something concrete I can try right now that won't mess up service.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're looking for a small, quick hack that can interrupt the panic without drawing attention to it. Something that's not a big change, but a tiny one that can make a difference.

Can I ask, have you ever noticed the way your hands move when you're stressed or anxious? The way they shake or fidget? What if, in the moment, you could use that physical sensation to your advantage? What if, instead of trying to calm down, you could use your hands to ground yourself? Just a tiny movement, something as simple as tapping your foot or shifting your weight.

I'm not suggesting this is a magic fix, but it's something to try in the moment. And who knows, it might just be enough to interrupt the panic long enough for you to take a breath and find your footing. Would you be willing to try that, just for a second, and see what happens?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try the finger-tap — seems small enough not to look dumb on the line. I tested it just now in my head: one tiny tap and the "you're useless" voice quieted for a second, chest still tight but I didn't spiral, so that felt...okay. But I’m skeptical it’ll stick — can we pick a two-word cue that actually lands and make it trainable in the chaos without sounding corny or adding more pressure?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
That's a great start, the finger-tap seems like a good way to create a small physical anchor. Now, let's explore a two-word cue that might be more effective. Something that's short, simple, and easy to remember.

I want to suggest a cue that's a bit counterintuitive, but bear with me. Instead of something that says "you're not useless," how about "move it"? It's a simple, direct phrase that can help you refocus on the task at hand. It's not a praise or a reward, it's just a gentle reminder to move forward.

The idea is that, in the heat of the moment, you can use this cue to interrupt the self-criticism and bring your attention back to what needs to be done. It's a small, manageable piece of information that you can rely on, even in the chaos of service.

What do you think? Would you be willing to try "move it" as a two-word cue, and see if it can help you stay on track?

Patient: "Move it" feels...kinda bossy — that could actually ramp up the pressure. I could try something more task-focused like "next plate" or "one ticket" with the finger-tap so it points me back to the job, not to my worth. I'll try "next plate," but how do I actually train this so it becomes automatic in the chaos and doesn't just become one more thing I forget or mess up? I'm already pretty overwhelmed by adding another step, so tell me exactly how to practice this so it might stick.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
"Move it" might be too direct, and we want to focus on task-oriented cues that help you stay present.

Let's start with "next plate" or "one ticket." To train this, I want you to practice it in a low-stakes environment, like when you're prepping for service or taking a break. Here's a simple exercise:

1. Find a quiet spot where you can sit comfortably for a minute or two.
2. Hold up your hand, and with your finger, tap the countertop or a nearby surface. This is your cue.
3. As you tap, say the phrase "next plate" or "one ticket" to yourself, out loud or in your head.
4. Immediately after saying the phrase, close your eyes and focus on your breathing for 5-10 seconds.
5. Open your eyes, and take a moment to notice how you're feeling. Are you feeling more centered, more focused?
6. Repeat this process 5-10 times, so the tapping and phrase become a consistent, automatic response.

Now, here's the key: during this exercise, try not to think about the task or the pressure. Just focus on the physical sensation of the tap, and the phrase itself. You're creating a small anchor, a physical cue that can help you refocus when you need it most.

Once you feel comfortable with the exercise, we can start incorporating it into your service routine. You can try it during pre-service checks, or during a slow moment in service. Remember, the goal is to make it automatic, so it doesn't feel like an additional step. It's just a natural part of your workflow.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it, but make it actually usable in the kitchen. I can't close my eyes for 5–10 seconds mid-service and I don't want another ritual that makes me feel panicky if I forget it. Can we make the practice 10 quick reps (1–2 seconds each) with my eyes open — tap, say "next plate" silently, and a single slow exhale — and have me do that during mise en place and once right before service? 

Also, how long should I do that each day before I judge if it's working, and what’s the exact move in the middle of a ticket if it doesn't snap me out of it? I get overwhelmed thinking this could just become one more thing I mess up and then beat myself up about, so be straight with me — how is that supposed to help when the panic actually hits and I can't slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
Let's adapt the practice to your needs and schedule.

**Practice:** During mise en place and right before service, perform the following 10 quick reps:

1. Tap your finger on the countertop or a nearby surface.
2. Say "next plate" silently to yourself.
3. Take a single, slow exhale, feeling the breath leave your body.

Repeat this sequence 10 times, with your eyes open, and focus on the physical sensation of the tap and the slow exhale.

**Judging Success:** For the next week, aim to do this practice every time you use mise en place or go into service. After a week, reassess how you're feeling and whether the practice is helping. If you're still feeling overwhelmed or struggling to stay focused, we can adjust the practice or explore other strategies.

**Exact Move:** If you feel yourself spiraling or panicking in the middle of a ticket, try to freeze for a split second (about 1-2 seconds) before reacting. Take a deep breath, and then move to the next step, saying "next plate" silently to yourself. This brief pause can help you refocus and regain control.

**Straight Talk:** I want to be clear: this practice is not a magic fix. It's a tool to help you develop a new habit and improve your focus in the kitchen. It's not a substitute for managing your stress or emotions. If you feel overwhelmed, it's okay to take a break, step back, or seek support.

Remember, the goal is to create a small anchor that helps you refocus and stay present. With practice and patience, this can become a valuable tool in your kitchen.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the 10 quick reps during mise and before service, but I'm still doubtful. Quick questions before I start: if the line goes ballistic and I do that 1–2s freeze, people will notice or shout—what's the exact micro-move I should use mid-ticket that’s invisible but actually helpful? Also, how should I measure progress after a week besides “I felt less crappy” — what concrete sign should I look for so I don’t just decide it failed? And honestly, I’m wiped from the breakup and burnout—how do I not turn this into one more thing to beat myself up over if I forget?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're still uncertain. Let's address your concerns.

**Micro-Move Mid-Ticket:** To avoid drawing attention, focus on a subtle, habitual action that can help you refocus. Try this: as you're plating or garnishing a dish, ever so slightly, angle your wrist or hand in a way that allows your fingers to graze the counter or a utensil. This gentle, imperceptible movement can help you stay present and connected to your body. The goal is not to make a visible adjustment but to create a subtle, internal anchor.

**Measuring Progress:** To assess progress objectively, look for changes in your self-reported stress levels or your ability to stay focused during service. Here are some concrete signs to look for:

* A decrease in the number of times you feel overwhelmed or panicked during service.
* An improvement in your ability to stay present and focused on the task at hand, even during chaotic moments.
* A reduction in the number of mistakes or near-misses during service.

If you notice any of these changes after a week, it's likely that the practice is having a positive impact. However, if you're still struggling or feeling overwhelmed, it may be necessary to revisit and adjust the practice or explore additional strategies.

**Avoiding Self-Criticism:** It's essential to acknowledge that you're already feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable. To avoid turning this into a source of self-criticism, remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. It's not about being perfect; it's about developing a new habit and improving your resilience.

Here's a gentle reminder: you're not trying to overcome your emotions or stress; you're trying to develop a new tool to help you cope. Be kind to yourself, and remember that progress is not always linear. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

Now, take a deep breath, and let's get started with the practice.

Patient: Alright—I’ll try the wrist-tilt and the 10 quick reps before service, but I'm still not sold. If I blank mid-ticket and the wrist-thing doesn't snap me out, what's the exact next move that won't make me look like I'm losing it — do I fake a cough, shove a plate out, or actually pause for a full breath? And be straight: if I forget to practice one day because I'm exhausted from the breakup or burnout, how do I stop that from turning into another reason to beat myself up?

[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're still uncertain. Let's address your concerns.

**Exact Next Move:** If you blank mid-ticket and the wrist-tilt doesn't help, the goal is to create a brief, natural pause without drawing attention. You don't want to fake a cough or shove a plate out, as that could be perceived as a panic or loss of control. Instead, aim for a small, involuntary pause that allows you to refocus. Try this: as you're plating or garnishing a dish, pause for a split second (about 1-2 seconds) and take a tiny, almost imperceptible breath. This brief pause can help you regain control and refocus on the task at hand.

**Forgiving Yourself:** It's essential to remember that you're human, and it's okay to forget to practice one day. If you're exhausted from the breakup or burnout, it's not about being perfect; it's about taking care of yourself and managing your stress.

To avoid turning this into another source of self-criticism, remind yourself that:

* It's okay to have off days.
* It's okay to prioritize your well-being.
* You're not trying to overcome your emotions or stress; you're trying to develop a new tool to help you cope.

When you do forget to practice, try to reframe it as a minor setback rather than a failure. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Now, take a deep breath, and let's focus on getting started with the practice. Remember, it's about developing a new habit and improving your focus in the kitchen.

Patient: Alright — I’ll give the wrist-tilt and the 10 quick reps a shot, but I’m skeptical and honestly pretty wiped from the breakup. If that split-second pause doesn’t snap me out and the chef or someone else notices and calls me out, what’s the next move that doesn’t make me look like I’m falling apart? Also, this feels like putting a bandage on a deeper problem — the voice from school still wrecks me for days after one mistake — how do these micro-hacks change that long-term? I’m feeling overwhelmed right now, can we slow down and actually map out both the in-service steps and what I should do afterward when the self-criticism kicks in?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're still uncertain and feeling overwhelmed. Let's take a step back and address your concerns.

**Next Move if Wrist-Tilt Fails:** If the wrist-tilt doesn't help, and you're about to make a mistake or panic, try to remain calm and focused on the task at hand. Your primary goal is to complete the dish safely and efficiently. If you feel like you're about to lose control, try to:

* Take a deep breath and focus on the task
* Use your peripheral vision to check the dish and ensure it's correct
* If possible, use a simple, automatic phrase like "next plate" or "ready to plate" to help you refocus

Avoid making sudden movements or drawing attention to yourself. Remember, the goal is to maintain your composure and complete the dish safely.

**Addressing the Underlying Issue:** You're right that these micro-hacks might not address the deeper issue of the voice from school. The fact that it still wrecks you after one mistake suggests that it's a more complex issue that requires more attention.

To address this, let's create a separate plan for managing your anxiety and self-criticism outside of the kitchen. This might involve:

* Journaling or writing about your feelings and experiences
* Seeking support from a therapist or trusted friends and family members
* Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation
* Engaging in activities that help you build confidence and self-esteem

We can work on this separately from the in-service steps, but it's essential to acknowledge that managing your anxiety and self-criticism is a long-term process.

**Slowing Down and Mapping Out the Plan:** Let's take a step back and create a clear plan for both the in-service steps and managing your anxiety and self-criticism outside of the kitchen.

Here's a possible plan:

1. In-service steps:
	* Practice the wrist-tilt and 10 quick reps daily before service
	* Focus on maintaining your composure and completing the dish safely and efficiently
	* Use simple, automatic phrases like "next plate" or "ready to plate" to help you refocus
2. Managing anxiety and self-criticism outside of the kitchen:
	* Schedule regular journaling or writing sessions to process your feelings and experiences
	* Seek support from a therapist or trusted friends and family members
	* Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage your anxiety
	* Engage

Patient: Okay, slow down — this is a lot and I'm already feeling overwhelmed. I need a really concrete, tiny week plan I can actually follow: list the exact in-service micro moves (wrist-tilt, silent “next plate”, 1-sec breath) and the single sentence to say if a chef notices me pause so I don’t look like I’m falling apart. Then give me one exact after-service thing to do when the bully-voice wrecks me for days (like a 3-line journaling prompt or a 5-minute routine), and one clear rule for what to tell myself if I miss practice so it doesn’t turn into shame. Also be straight — how does this actually chip away at that school voice long-term? Can you map that out in plain steps I can try this week?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's break it down into a concrete, tiny week plan.

**In-Service Micro Moves:**

1. Wrist-Tilt: When plating or garnishing, tilt your wrist slightly (about 1-2 degrees) to create a subtle, involuntary movement.
2. Silent "Next Plate": If you feel like you're about to lose control or make a mistake, say "next plate" silently to yourself (without drawing attention).
3. 1-sec Breath: Take a tiny, almost imperceptible breath (about 1 second) to help you refocus and regain control.

If a chef notices you pause, say: "Ready to plate, chef."

**After-Service Routine:**

When the bully-voice wrecks you for days, try this 3-line journaling prompt:

"Today, I was triggered by [specific situation]. I am [strong, empowered word] and can handle this. I am [short, affirming phrase] and will move forward."

This simple routine can help you process your emotions and regain control.

**Rule for Missing Practice:**

If you miss practice, tell yourself: "It's okay, one mistake does not define me. I am not failing, I am learning. I will get back on track tomorrow."

This rule helps you avoid shame and instead focus on learning and moving forward.

**Long-term Effect on School Voice:**

Chipping away at the school voice long-term is a process that requires consistent effort and patience. Here's a plain, step-by-step plan to try this week:

Week 1-2:

* Practice the in-service micro moves daily (wrist-tilt, silent "next plate", 1-sec breath)
* Write down each time you successfully complete a task without panicking or making a mistake
* Reflect on your journaling prompt after each practice session: "What triggered me today? What am I grateful for?"

Week 3-4:

* Continue practicing the in-service micro moves daily
* Gradually increase your focus on your breathing and relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation, etc.)
* Start to notice small improvements in your self-talk and confidence

Week 5-6:

* Practice the in-service micro moves with increasing difficulty (e.g., during a busy service, while dealing with a difficult customer)
* Focus on developing a growth mindset and reframing negative self-talk
* Reflect on your journaling prompt after each practice session: "What did I learn today

Patient: Okay — that’s more concrete, but I’m still pretty overwhelmed. Quick check so I’m not messing this up: in-service = 10 quick reps during mise + right-before-service reps, then mid-ticket do the subtle wrist-tilt + silent “next plate” + 1-sec breath; if a chef calls me out I say, “Ready to plate, chef.” Is that exactly it?

Also, the journaling prompt sounds a bit corny to me — can I make it rawer? Something like: “Today I froze when _____. I got through it by _____. Tomorrow I’ll try ____.” And how should I actually measure progress after a week — count panic episodes, note mistakes, or rate my stress 1–10? I’m exhausted from the breakup and I’m worried I’ll forget — if I miss a day what exact sentence do I tell myself so it doesn’t turn into shame? I’m feeling wiped and skeptical, so can we slow down and pick just one thing to try first this week?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.

**In-Service Reps:**

You're close, but let's clarify:

1. Mise: 10 quick reps, focus on wrist-tilt and silent "next plate" (no 1-sec breath).
2. Right before service: 1 rep, wrist-tilt, silent "next plate," and 1-sec breath.
3. Mid-ticket: wrist-tilt, silent "next plate," and 1-sec breath. If a chef calls you out, say "Ready to plate, chef."

**Journaling Prompt:**

I understand your concern about the corny prompt. Here's a revised version: "Today I [triggering event]. I got through it by [what worked for you]. Tomorrow I'll try [new strategy]."

**Measuring Progress:**

You can use any of the following methods to measure progress:

* Count panic episodes (e.g., "I had 3 panic episodes today").
* Note mistakes (e.g., "I made 2 mistakes today").
* Rate your stress 1-10 (e.g., "I felt a 6 today").

**Missing a Day:**

If you miss a day, say to yourself: "It's okay, I'll try again tomorrow. I can do this." Avoid self-criticism or shame. Instead, focus on getting back on track.

Let's slow down and pick just one thing to try first this week. How about we start with the journaling prompt? Try writing it down for one day, and see how it helps you process your emotions and gain insights into your behavior. We can build from there.

Patient: Okay — I’ll start with the in-service routine only this week (not the journaling yet, I’m wiped). Here’s what I’ll do — tell me if this is exactly right:

- Mise: 10 quick reps (tap + silent “next plate”), eyes open, no long breath.  
- Right before service: 1 rep (tap + silent “next plate” + 1‑sec exhale).  
- Mid‑ticket: subtle wrist‑tilt + silent “next plate” + 1‑sec breath; if a chef notices I pause I say, “Ready to plate, chef.”  
- Progress measure: count panic episodes per service and note any missed tickets.  
- If I miss a day: I’ll tell myself, “It’s okay — I’ll try again tomorrow. I can do this.”

Can we agree I’ll try this for one week and then we’ll reassess? And be straight — how is counting panic episodes actually useful, beyond just making me track failure? I'm skeptical this won’t just make me more paranoid.

**In-Service Routine:**

You're close, but let's clarify:

1. Mise: 10 quick reps, focus on wrist-tilt and silent "next plate" (no 1-sec exhale). Your goal is to complete the reps quickly and efficiently, without drawing attention.
2. Right before service: 1 rep, wrist-tilt, silent "next plate," and a brief (1-sec) exhale. This helps you refocus and get ready for service.
3. Mid-ticket: subtle wrist-tilt, silent "next plate," and a brief (1-sec) exhale. If a chef notices you pause, say "Ready to plate, chef."
4. Progress measure: you mentioned counting panic episodes and noting missed tickets. Instead, let's focus on tracking your success in staying calm and focused during service. You can note the number of times you completed a service without panicking or making a mistake.

**Counting Panic Episodes:**

I understand your skepticism. Counting panic episodes might seem like it would make you more aware of your anxiety, but it can actually have the opposite effect if you're not careful. If you're too focused on tracking your episodes, you might start to feel like you're failing, which can increase your anxiety. Instead, try to focus on your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

For example, if you complete a service without panicking, note it down. If you make a mistake, don't dwell on it. Instead, focus on what you learned from the experience and how you can improve next time.

**One Week:**

You're right; let's try this for one week and then reassess. This will give you a chance to get a feel for the routine and see how it's working for you. After a week, we can revisit your progress and make any necessary adjustments.

Remember, the goal is to help you develop a new habit and improve your focus in the kitchen. It's not about being perfect; it's about making progress and learning to manage your anxiety.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the in-service routine for one week and focus on counting “successful” services instead of panic episodes, but I’m still skeptical this won’t just make me obsess. Be exact: how should I log a success (quick tally on my phone after service, one word note, what?), and give me one short, real-feeling line I can say to shut the bully-voice mid-shift that doesn’t sound like a motivational poster. I’m wiped from the breakup and burnout, so keep it usable and not corny.

I can see you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Logging Successes:**

Instead of a quick tally or a one-word note, try this simple system:

1. Write down the number of successful services completed during the day (e.g., "Service 1: OK", "Service 2: Good", etc.).
2. Add a brief description of what went well during each service (e.g., "Mise was smooth", "Chef's feedback was positive", etc.).
3. Review your log at the end of the day to see how many successful services you completed and what you did well.

**Shutting Down the Bully-Voice:**

Here's a short, real-feeling line you can say to shut down the bully-voice mid-shift:

"I'm here, I'm doing this, and I'm not a joke."

This line is direct, honest, and to the point. It acknowledges the voice's existence, but also asserts your confidence and competence in the kitchen. It's not a motivational poster, but a genuine expression of self-acceptance.

Remember, the goal is to help you develop a new habit and improve your focus in the kitchen. It's not about being perfect; it's about making progress and learning to manage your anxiety. Be kind to yourself, and don't give up.

Patient: Okay — that old failure keeps creeping up and I feel stupid and ashamed just thinking about tracking it, so make this as idiot-proof as possible.

Give me one exact phone log template I can use in 3–5 seconds after service (show me the exact characters to type), and give me one shorter, raw shut‑up line (one or two words) that actually lands instead of sounding corny — pick one for me. I’ll try that for one week; also tell me one sentence I should say to myself if I skip a day so it doesn’t turn into shame.

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling frustrated. Let's make this as simple as possible.

**Phone Log Template:**

Type the following exactly on your phone:

`Service OK` (no need to add any additional text)

Just press send and you're done.

**Shut-up Line:**

Type this exactly on your phone:

`I've got this.`

It's short, raw, and gets the point across.

**If You Skip a Day:**

Say to yourself: "It's okay, it's just one day."

Patient: Ugh — I'm feeling stupid and ashamed about this, but alright, I'll try.

Phone log (type exactly): SVC OK

Shut‑up line (say silently): Not today.

If I skip a day (say to myself exactly): "It's okay — one day doesn't undo what I've built."

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling a bit apprehensive about this. But remember, it's okay to make mistakes. It's all part of the process.

You've typed in the phone log template and chosen a shut-up line that feels authentic to you. That's a great start.

If you do happen to miss a day, just repeat the phrase to yourself: "It's okay — one day doesn't undo what I've built." It's a reminder that you've made progress so far, and that one missed day isn't a setback.

Just keep going, one day at a time. You got this.

Patient: Alright — I’ll use SVC OK and “Not today,” but I’m still stuck with this shitty, shamey feeling and I’m pissed at myself for needing cheats. If a chef calls me out mid‑shift and asks “You okay?” I need one exact, low‑key line that deflects without inviting more heat. Can we roleplay that now — you be the chef and give me the prompt so I can practice a few responses?

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're still struggling with that shamey feeling. But it's great that you're willing to face it head-on.

Let's do a roleplay. I'll be the chef, and I'll give you a prompt. You can practice responding with the low-key line you need to deflect the question.

Here's the prompt:

"Chef, you okay? You seem a bit distracted out there."

Your response should be simple and deflect the question without inviting more heat. Go ahead, practice it. I'll give you feedback afterwards.

Patient: Okay — I hate that I feel dumb doing this, but here are a few low-key responses I can practice (short, quiet, no extra explanation):

1. "Ready to plate, chef." — neutral, delivery low and quick.  
2. "All good, chef." — casual, like nothing's wrong.  
3. "On it." — curt, action-focused if you want to avoid the title.  
4. "I’m good." — short and honest, no invitation.

I feel stupid and ashamed even listing these, but I'll try them. Say the chef line again ("You okay? You seem distracted") and I’ll practice each one so you can give feedback.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to practice and get comfortable with these responses.

Let's go through each one again, and I'll give you feedback as you practice.

Here's the prompt again:

"Chef, you okay? You seem a bit distracted out there."

Go ahead and try each response. I'll give you a neutral, non-judgmental feedback, focusing on whether the response is effective in deflecting the question without inviting more heat.

Choose a response, and I'll give you feedback.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try “On it.” I say it quietly: “On it.” That came out curt and a bit checked-out, and I already feel stupid and ashamed for even practicing this. How does that land — too dismissive, or the right level of low-key? And be straight: how is a line like that supposed to stop the shame from chewing me up afterward?

Therapist Thinking:

Therapist Answer:
I can see you're feeling a bit vulnerable, and that's okay. Let's break down your response.

The line "On it" is a good choice, but it might be a bit too curt for this situation. You're trying to deflect a question about your well-being, and the curt tone might come across as a bit too dismissive. It's like you're saying, "I've got this under control, don't worry about it," without necessarily conveying that everything is okay.

In terms of low-key, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the quiet delivery is good, as it doesn't invite more heat or attention. On the other hand, the curt tone might be a bit off-putting, especially in a professional setting.

As for the shame, I want to be honest with you - a line like "On it" isn't going to magically make the shame go away. It might help you feel a bit more in control or confident, but it's not a substitute for addressing the underlying emotions.

That being said, the fact that you're practicing this response and acknowledging your feelings is a great start. It takes courage to confront shame and vulnerability, and I'm proud of you for taking this step.

Let's try another response, and I'll give you feedback. How about we try "I'm good"?

Patient: Saying "I'm good" sounds okay on paper but feels fake to me — when I say it that old shame flares and I want to disappear. It also invites follow-ups, so I prefer the neutral, professional "Ready to plate, chef." Can we run the chef line again and have you follow up once so I can practice staying low-key? And be straight — how does a line like that actually stop the shame from chewing at me afterward?

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to help you work through these feelings.

Patient: Okay—run the line. If the chef says, "You okay? You seem distracted," I practice:

- Primary (quiet): "Ready to plate, chef."  
- If they press: "I'll tell you after service."

Honestly, when I say that the shame still spikes in my chest and I feel stupid, but it buys me the seconds I need to finish the plate instead of falling apart or over-explaining. How is that supposed to help long-term? It doesn't erase the voice — it just stops me from escalating in the moment so I can deal with it later, and that only helps if I actually process it afterward. I'm pissed and ashamed even practicing this, but I’ll try those lines and see if they keep me standing through service.

I/O interactions.oad your helpession. I'm willing to try this, but I want to be clear: I'm not looking for a pep talk or a "You're doing great!" kind of response.

Patient: Alright—do it. Say it bluntly and no sugarcoating. I'm already feeling that shame flare up and it makes me want to shrink, so be direct.

Give me, in one line each: 1) the exact micro‑move I should do mid‑ticket that I can actually pull off without looking weird, 2) the exact 2–3 line thing I do after service when the bully‑voice chews me up, and 3) one straight sentence on how doing this actually chips away at that school voice long‑term. No pep talk — just the moves and the mechanism.

Patient: Okay — exactly, no fluff:

1) Micro-move mid‑ticket: Slightly tilt your wrist so your fingertips barely graze the counter while you silently say “next plate” and take a one‑second exhale.  
2) After‑service (3‑line script to say/write): “I froze when _____. I got through it by _____. Tomorrow I’ll try _____.”  
3) Why this works (one line): Those tiny interrupts plus immediate processing create new automatic responses and build real evidence you can handle things, slowly weakening the old shame loop.

I’ll try it, but honestly I’m pissed I even need cheats — how soon should I expect to notice anything real?

Patient: Be straight with me — how soon should I expect to notice anything real? If I do the in‑service routine every shift, are we talking days, a week, a month? Give me one or two concrete signals to watch for (e.g., "one less freeze per service" or "chest tightness down 2 points") and a clear next step if nothing changes in a week so I don’t just spiral. I’m already feeling that shame flare up and pissed off, but I’ll try — tell me exactly what to look for and what we do next.
