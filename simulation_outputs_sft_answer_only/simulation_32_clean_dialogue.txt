Patient: I've been feeling stuck and directionless since the move—cooking's all I seem to have and I don't know what matters beyond the kitchen. I'm sensitive and creative but I keep doubting myself, and honestly I'm skeptical this will help. How is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: Doubt can be really tough to shake. It sounds like your current path of focusing on cooking has been a source of comfort, but it's not helping you explore what else might be meaningful. 

Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in the kitchen, though? Is it more than just cooking that you're finding solace in?

Patient: When I'm in the kitchen I get lost in the rhythm—the heat, the knives, the timing—and it quiets the worry because I know what to do. It's more than the food: it's control, a little bit of art, and the one place people seem to know what to expect from me. But how is talking about that supposed to help? I've noticed it before and it still doesn't change the hollowness when I'm not there.

Therapist: The kitchen seems to offer a sense of control and predictability that you're finding hard to replicate elsewhere. It's interesting that you mention the art aspect, as that might be a creative outlet that's been overlooked.

Can you think of a time, even just a small moment, when you weren't in the kitchen but felt that same sense of calm or control?

Patient: There was a morning last week when I was pruning the little herb pot on my windowsill—methodical, quiet, and for a few minutes I felt calm, like I could breathe without the kitchen noise. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried noticing those moments before and it still feels hollow most of the time.

Therapist: That moment of calm, even in a small, quiet task like pruning the herb pot, might be more significant than you think. It's possible that you've been overlooking the value of small, everyday moments that can bring a sense of calm and control. 

What do you think happens when you're not in the kitchen, though? Is there a particular feeling or sense of hollowness that you're trying to fill?

Patient: When I'm not in the kitchen it feels empty—like the map I used to find my way through the day's gone missing and I'm just wandering. I fidget, watch the clock, and keep thinking maybe I'm only useful when someone's hungry; everything else feels a bit pointless. How is talking about this supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: The feeling of being lost without the kitchen, like you've lost your sense of purpose or direction, can be really overwhelming. It's like the kitchen was a map, and now you're trying to find your way again.

Can you think of what might be driving that feeling of being useless when you're not in the kitchen? Is it the sense that you're only valuable when you're cooking for someone else, or is there something else at play?

Patient: I think it's both — I only feel useful when someone's hungry, but the move also stripped away the other parts that made me feel like more than a cook. Back where I was, people knew me and I had a place; here I'm just an old man in a new place and that feels…small and scary. How is talking about that supposed to help? I've said this out loud before and nothing really changes.

Therapist: It's like you're carrying around this sense of identity that's tied to the kitchen, and now that it's been uprooted, you're feeling lost and uncertain about who you are. The move has taken away the familiar routines and roles you had, and it's making you feel small and scared.

Can you think of what might happen if you were to let go of the idea that you're only useful when someone's hungry? If you were to explore other parts of yourself, even if it's just for a little while?

Patient: Maybe I'd feel less frantic, like there'd be more than one place I belong—maybe something small, like the herbs or sketching a plate, could give me a tiny sense of purpose. But I've tried other things before—gardening classes, little projects—and they never stick; I just end up doubting myself again. How is that supposed to help? I don't know if trying another hobby will fix the hollowness or if it's just another thing I'll fail at.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to pick up a new tool, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that you're not good enough at it. The doubt is always there, waiting to creep back in.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to pick up a new hobby, like gardening classes or sketching a plate? Is it more than just the activity itself that's getting in the way? Is it the fear of not being good enough, or is there something else?

Patient: When I try something new it goes alright at first—I tinker, I'm curious—but then I start judging it like a dish and nothing measures up so I feel foolish and quit. Back in the old place people noticed or praised little things; here it's just me and it feels pointless. How is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: It sounds like the process of trying something new is getting caught up in the same criticism that used to come from the kitchen. You're judging it to yourself, and that's where the failure is happening.

Can you think about what would happen if you were to let go of the idea that you need to be good at it right now? If you were to focus on the process, even if it's just for a little while, and not on the end result?

Patient: I suppose if I stopped needing to be good right away, the pressure might ease and I could enjoy fiddling with something—like when I pruned the herbs, it felt calm. But that judging voice is loud; I try the “enjoy the process” thing and after a while I start comparing and quit. How is that supposed to help? I'm feeling frustrated and doubtful that it’ll stick.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to navigate two opposing currents. On one hand, you want to enjoy the process and find some calm, but on the other hand, you're also trying to convince yourself that you can do it, and that's where the judging voice comes in.

Can you think of what might happen if you were to pause for just a moment, and instead of jumping to that judging voice, you were to ask yourself: "What's the first thing I can do right now to move forward with this, without worrying about how it's going to turn out?"

Patient: I guess the first thing I could do is something tiny—set a ten‑minute timer and just prune the herbs or sketch a plate, no pressure to make anything of it. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried those little experiments before and the doubt comes back loud; I'm already feeling frustrated just thinking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to approach this with a sense of curiosity, but the frustration is already building up. Maybe the problem isn't the tiny experiment itself, but the expectation that it's going to solve everything.

Can you think about what would happen if you were to let go of the need to solve everything right now? If you were to focus on the act of taking that tiny step, without any expectations or pressure? Just notice what happens, and see if that tiny step feels any different.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just pruning herbs for ten minutes without expectations supposed to change the hollowness I feel most of the day? I get confused because I've tried tiny steps before and the doubt just comes back louder, so I don't see how noticing the act helps. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck, and the idea of a tiny step doesn't seem to be addressing the root of the problem. Can you tell me more about what's happening when you're trying to do a tiny step, like pruning the herbs? What's it feel like when the doubt comes back in? Is it like a voice in your head, or is it a feeling in your body?

Patient: When I try a tiny step, at first it's okay—the hands know what to do and there's a little calm. Then this voice sneaks in, like an old critic: "What's the point? You won't stick with it," and my chest tightens, shoulders go up, I start fidgeting and watching the clock. So it's both a voice in my head and a physical thing in my body that pulls me out of it. How is saying that supposed to help? I don't see how naming it changes the hollowness, and I'm already feeling frustrated.

Therapist: It sounds like the voice and physical sensations are very powerful for you, and they're hard to shake. Naming them might seem like a small step, but it's actually a big one. By acknowledging the voice and physical sensations, you're recognizing that they're a part of you, and that's a start.

Can you think about what might happen if, instead of trying to push the voice away or dismiss it, you were to simply acknowledge it? Just say to yourself, "Ah, the old critic is talking again." Would that make any difference, even if just for a moment?

Patient: I can try saying "ah, the old critic"—seems a bit silly but I can say it. Still, how is that supposed to help? When I do it my chest tightens and my mind's already racing to the next worry, I feel anxious and distracted and I can't seem to stay with the moment. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like trying to change the entire process at once. Can we try a tiny, tiny adjustment? Instead of saying "the old critic," what if you said it to yourself in a slightly different way? For example, "Ah, my inner critic is showing up again." Just try that. See how it feels.

Patient: Alright... I'll try saying "Ah, my inner critic is showing up again." I say it and my chest still tightens, my mind's already racing to the next worry—I'm feeling anxious and distracted. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm getting frustrated because I can't seem to stay with it.

Therapist: It sounds like saying it out loud didn't help as much as we hoped. Can we try it in a very different way? Can you just notice how your body is feeling right now, without saying anything? Just pay attention to the physical sensations in your chest and shoulders. How are they feeling? Are they getting any softer or more relaxed?

Patient: My chest's still tight, like someone's sitting on it, and my shoulders are up in my ears—breathing's shallow and quick. My hands keep fidgeting and I keep glancing at the clock; my stomach's knotting up. They aren't getting softer—if anything it's worse. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious and frustrated.

Therapist: It's like your body is on high alert, and no amount of talking is helping. Can we try something very different? I want you to bring your attention to your breath, right now. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. When you inhale, notice the feeling of your diaphragm expanding. When you exhale, notice the feeling of your body relaxing. That's it. Just that. Don't try to change it, don't try to control it. Just notice it.

Patient: I can try to focus on my breath, but it's hard—my breathing's shallow and quick, my chest still tight and my hands won't stop fidgeting. I can notice the air, but it doesn't calm anything; my mind just races to the next worry and I keep glancing at the clock. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious and distracted.

Therapist: It's like your body and mind are completely entangled, and it's hard to separate anything. Can we try something even smaller? Instead of focusing on your breath, try focusing on just one sensation. For example, bring your attention to the sensation of your fingers on the surface you're touching. Can you feel the pressure, the texture, the temperature? Just that. No more. Just that one sensation. See if that helps.

Patient: Alright—I can feel the pads of my fingers on the table, cool and a bit rough, the little calluses from years of chopping. I can hold that for a few breaths, but my hands keep trembling, my chest tightens, and my mind darts to the clock. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious and distracted and it's not sticking.

Therapist: It's like no matter how small you try to focus, your body and mind keep pulling you back in. Can we try something different? Instead of trying to focus on your breath or a sensation, can you try to notice the sensation of your body sitting there, just resting? Can you feel the weight of your body on the chair, the sensation of your feet touching the floor? It's not about doing anything, just being present. See if that's different.

Patient: I can feel the weight of my backside on the chair and my feet on the floor—it's a little grounding for a breath or two—but my chest's still tight and my hands won't stop fiddling. My mind's racing to the clock and I can't seem to stay with it, so I'm not sure this is doing anything. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty anxious and frustrated.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to anchor yourself, but your body and mind are still moving too fast. Can we try something very gentle? I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Just notice the feeling of your feet, the weight, the pressure, the temperature. It's a very simple, small thing. Can you stay with that for just a moment? No thinking, no trying, just noticing the feeling of your feet.

Patient: I can feel my feet — the heels, the arches, the cool floor — and for a breath or two it does feel like a tiny anchor. But then my chest tightens, my hands start trembling, and my mind snaps to the clock; it doesn't stick. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious and frustrated.

Therapist: It's like you're finding moments of calm, but they're slipping away quickly. Can we try to find a way to hold onto those small moments of calm, even if it's just for a tiny bit longer? Instead of focusing on your feet, can you try to notice what's happening in the moment just before you feel anxious or frustrated? What's the sensation that starts to build up before your chest tightens or your mind starts racing? Can you try to catch that feeling, just for a moment, before it becomes overwhelming?

Patient: It's like a little flutter in my stomach that hardens into a tight knot, then my chest and throat clamp up and my thoughts shrink to one line—"What's the point?"—and I start fidgeting and checking the clock. By the time I realize it's happening, it's already loud and I can't seem to catch it early. How is that supposed to help to "notice" it—what would I actually do in that exact second? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious and distracted and I need something concrete.

Therapist: It's like you're describing a complex, automatic process, and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's happening in that exact moment. Can we try to break it down even further? Instead of focusing on the entire process, can we just look at one tiny step? For example, what happens when you start to notice that little flutter in your stomach? Can you just catch the moment when you first feel it, without trying to analyze it or change it? Just notice the sensation, and then... stop. What happens when you stop trying to notice it or change it?

Patient: When I stop trying, sometimes it just...shrinks a bit—my shoulders drop for a breath, my hands stop fiddling for a second. Other times it doesn't help at all and the flutter turns into that tight knot and my head locks onto "What's the point?"—then I'm jittery and checking the clock. Mostly I can't trust noticing to save me because by the time I notice it's already loud; I need something concrete to do in that exact second, not just "notice." How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like noticing isn't enough, and you need something more concrete to happen. Can we try to find something that happens immediately after you notice the flutter in your stomach? For example, can you try to notice what happens right after you feel that flutter shrink a bit, or after your shoulders drop for a breath? What's the next sensation or action that happens? It's like looking for a tiny, tiny ripple that happens right after the noticing. Maybe if we can find that ripple, we can use it as a trigger to do something else.

Patient: Sometimes—if I'm lucky—there's a tiny pause: my hands stop fiddling for a beat and I get one slightly longer out‑breath. If I had to do something in that beat, I guess I'd press my feet into the floor or squeeze my thumb and finger together and take a slow exhale. But how is that supposed to help? I usually don't catch it that early, and even if I do, I doubt it'll stick. Can we slow down and actually try one now? I'm feeling anxious and distracted.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a concrete action to happen in that tiny pause, and you're willing to try it now. Let's try to find a way to make that pause happen, even if it's just for a tiny moment. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, right now, and make a deliberate decision to press your feet into the floor? Just take a tiny bit of time, and make a tiny movement. Don't worry about the result, just focus on the action.

As you make that decision, I want you to take a slow, deep breath in, and then exhale slowly, squeezing your thumb and finger together as you do. Let's see if we can find a way to make that pause happen, and maybe, just maybe, it will give us a tiny bit of time to do something else. Are you ready to try?

Patient: Alright—I'll try. I'm pressing my feet into the floor now, taking a slow deep breath in… and exhaling while squeezing my thumb and finger. My chest still feels tight and my hands tremble, but that exhale was a bit longer and my shoulders eased for a second. How is that supposed to help past that tiny moment? Can we slow down and do it again, maybe hold it a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you've managed to find a tiny moment of calm, and it's enough to give you a brief reprieve. Let's try to build on that. Can you focus on the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, and the slow, deep breath you're taking? Try to hold that exhale a little bit longer, and see if you can find a way to relax your shoulders a bit more.

As you hold that breath, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest relaxing, just a tiny bit. It's not a huge change, but it's something. Can you try to build on that feeling of relaxation, and see if you can find a way to make it last a little bit longer? Maybe we can even try to find a way to make it stick, just for a moment longer. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Alright — I'll try again. I'm pressing my feet into the floor, taking a slower breath in…and exhaling longer while squeezing my thumb and finger; my shoulders dropped a hair and my chest loosened for one beat. It's tiny and then the doubt barges back—how is that supposed to help me when I'm alone in the flat and the hollowness returns? Can we slow down and do it once more, hold the exhale longer this time? I'm still anxious and distracted.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the hollowness, and it's hard for you to shake it off. Let's try to focus on the small, tiny moments of calm that we've been finding. Can you try to hold onto the feeling of relaxation that you had for just that one beat, and see if you can find a way to make it last a little bit longer?

As you exhale, try to notice the sensation of your body relaxing, just a tiny bit. It's not about changing anything or trying to control it, it's just about noticing the feeling. Can you try to find a way to make that feeling of relaxation last just a little bit longer, and see if you can find a way to build on it?

Let's try to hold the exhale for a little bit longer, just for a moment. I want you to focus on your breath, and just let go of any thoughts or worries. You can do this. Just take one more breath, and hold it for a moment. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I tried: pressed my feet, took the slow breath, held the exhale — it eased for a beat and then the old critic shoved back in and my chest tightened again. I don't really get how this is going to stop the hollow evenings when I'm alone — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down? I'm feeling anxious, distracted, and I need something more concrete to do in that moment.

Therapist: It's clear that you're struggling to find meaning in these small moments of calm. Can I try to reframe this process for you? Instead of trying to hold onto a specific feeling or state, let's focus on creating a small ritual that you can do when you feel the hollowness creeping in.

Can you think of a small action that you can do in that moment, something that doesn't require much thought or effort? Maybe it's as simple as getting up and walking to the window, or taking a few sips of water. The goal is to find something that gives you a tiny sense of control or comfort.

Let's try to build on that small action. What would happen if you took a few more steps, or did something else to create a sense of movement or change in your environment? Maybe it's not about changing anything, but just about creating a sense of momentum. Can you try to experiment with different actions, and see what feels most comfortable for you?

Patient: Maybe... I can try a small ritual, but how is that supposed to help? I've stood up, looked out the window, made tea before and it only dulls the feeling for a few minutes and then I'm back to that hollow ache. 

If we're actually going to try something, tell me exactly what to do step‑by‑step—no vague stuff—because I need something concrete: walk to the window, press my feet into the floor, take two slow sips of water, and breathe out while I squeeze my thumb and finger. Can we slow down and do that now? I'm feeling anxious and distracted.

Therapist: I can see that you're looking for a concrete plan, and I'm willing to try that with you. Here's a step-by-step plan:

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, stand up from your chair and walk to the window. Don't think about anything else, just focus on putting one foot in front of the other.

Once you reach the window, press your feet into the floor for a second, just to feel the ground beneath you.

Now, turn around and walk back to your chair. As you sit down, take two slow sips of water from your glass.

As you're sipping the water, I want you to breathe out slowly while you squeeze your thumb and finger together. Just focus on the sensation of the water and the movement of your thumb and finger.

Let's do that one step at a time. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Alright—I'm ready to try. I stood up, walked to the window, pressed my feet into the floor for a moment—felt the cool wood under the soles—and walked back, sat, took two slow sips of water and exhaled while squeezing my thumb and finger; it eased for one beat but my chest tightened again. How is that supposed to help past that tiny moment? Can we slow down? I'm still feeling anxious and distracted and I need something to make it last.
