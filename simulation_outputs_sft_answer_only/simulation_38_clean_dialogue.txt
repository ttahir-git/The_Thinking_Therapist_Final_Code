Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this weird liminal space where my identity feels like it's collapsed into "software developer" and I can't tell what actually matters beyond that role. The breakup and the burnout probably amplified it, but I tend to intellectualize—I'll map out frameworks about meaninglessness instead of sitting with the sadness or confusion. I'm here because I want to figure out how to translate these abstract analyses into something that actually feels real.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from yourself right now, and that's a really tough place to be. The idea of your identity collapsing into just one role can be really unsettling, especially when it feels like there's nothing else beneath the surface. Can you tell me more about what it's like to sit with those feelings of sadness or confusion? How do you usually try to cope with them, and what do you think happens when you start mapping out these frameworks about meaninglessness?

Patient: Sitting with it rarely feels like sitting — it feels like I immediately pivot into meta-mode, building these elaborate taxonomies and narratives about meaning so I don't have to actually feel the ache. I cope by burying myself in work or side projects, doomscrolling for a bit of social noise, or turning feelings into lists and spreadsheets that make them look manageable. Those frameworks give me a fleeting sense of agency, but mostly they function as a buffer — they anesthetize the sadness and leave me indecisive, like I'm analyzing a problem I won't actually solve. Honestly, I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to describe this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're using these mental frameworks as a way to avoid feeling the raw emotion, and at the same time, you're aware that it's not really helping. It's almost like you're caught in this cycle of analysis paralysis, where you're overthinking and overanalyzing instead of just sitting with your feelings.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to "turn feelings into lists and spreadsheets"? What do you hope to achieve by doing that, and do you ever find that it actually helps or just gives you a sense of control?

Patient: When I turn feelings into lists/spreadsheets I literally make columns — emotion, trigger, intensity, coping-strategy — and then score things like it's a product spec or a bug triage. I think I'm trying to manufacture epistemic certainty, to turn amorphous pain into discrete, solvable tasks so it feels like something I can ship. It gives a short-term decrease in anxiety and a sense of agency, but functionally it's avoidance: the metrics let me procrastinate on actually feeling or deciding, and I end up more stuck. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed explaining this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're using these lists and spreadsheets as a way to externalize your emotions and break them down into manageable parts. You're trying to give them a sense of order and control, so that you can feel like you're making progress and not just stuck.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to use these metrics to procrastinate? How does that feel, and what do you think you're avoiding when you do that? Is it the feeling of uncertainty, the fear of not knowing what to do, or something else entirely?

Patient: When I use metrics it's performative—the spreadsheet becomes a ritual that simulates progress so I can get the small hit of control without doing the scary, messy work. It calms me briefly and gives something concrete to iterate on, but afterward there's this hollow clarity: nothing actually changed about who I am or what I want. I think I'm avoiding the uncertainty of not being "enough" outside my job, the possibility that I'm directionless, and the raw sadness from the breakup—it's much easier to debug a sheet than to sit with that. I'm already feeling a bit flooded talking about this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like the spreadsheet becomes a coping mechanism, a way to temporarily distract yourself from the uncertainty and raw emotion that you're trying to avoid. The performative aspect of it, where you're simulating progress and control, seems to be a key part of what's holding you back.

Can you tell me more about this feeling of not being "enough" outside of your job? How does that make you feel, and what do you think you're afraid of losing or not having? It sounds like it's tied to a deeper sense of uncertainty and self-doubt, and that's making it hard for you to move forward.

Patient: I think my sense of self is instrumentally tied to being competent at my job—strip away "software developer" and there's this weird ontological lacuna where I can't map who I am. That triggers a mix of shame and low-grade panic—fear of losing social esteem, financial stability, and any clear purpose—so I reframe it as this theory about "identity fusion" instead of naming the sadness. I’m basically terrified of being unmoored and discovering I don't like what's left, so I double down on metrics and projects to manufacture value. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your sense of identity is deeply tied to your professional role, and that it's creating a sense of anxiety and uncertainty. The fear of losing your social esteem, financial stability, and sense of purpose is palpable, and it's causing you to try to control the situation by creating metrics and projects.

Can you take a moment to breathe, and then tell me more about what it's like to be without the "software developer" label? What does that feel like, and is there a part of you that's curious about what you might find if you didn't have that identity? It might be helpful to explore that curiosity, even if it's just a small step.

Patient: I just took a breath — thanks. Without that label it feels like standing in front of a blank whiteboard: both kind of terrifying and oddly liberating. Terrifying because I lose the heuristics that structure my days and there's this anxious churn about worth and stability; liberating because maybe there's room to try things that aren't productized. Part of me is curious and wants to experiment with low-stakes hobbies or side projects to see what actually resonates, but the risk-averse part immediately turns it into a failure-mode analysis instead of doing it — I'm already feeling a bit flooded saying that, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're standing at this threshold, where the familiar framework of your job is gone, and you're not sure where to start or what to do. There's a mix of emotions - anxiety, curiosity, and a desire to experiment.

Can you take a small step with me? Let's just imagine that you're going to try something new, without any expectation of success or failure. What if you were to pick up a hobby or work on a side project that has nothing to do with your job? What would that feel like, and what might you hope to get out of it?

Patient: Maybe something tactile and low-stakes—pottery, cooking new recipes, or a weekend sketching class—basically an activity that can't be shipped or versioned. I'd conceptualize it as an "experiential hypothesis" where the goal is to collect tiny data points about what actually brings a visceral sense of pleasure or calm, not to optimize or monetize it. But I can already feel my head trying to metricize the whole thing and it's a bit overwhelming—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about trying something that's more experiential, something that doesn't fit into a framework that you can control or optimize. Pottery, cooking, sketching - all of those things are great examples of activities that can bring you joy and calm, without the need for metrics or versioning.

Let's take a step back. Can you just imagine that you're going to try one of those activities, without any expectations or pressures? Just showing up, and seeing where it takes you. No thinking about "shipping" it, or "monetizing" it. Just being present, and seeing what happens. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Yeah, I can imagine that — like signing up for a pottery class and genuinely showing up with no agenda. It would probably feel both a little liberating and nervy; my brain already wants to turn it into metrics, so I’d label it an "experiential hypothesis" where the only outcome is whether I notice a tiny bit of calm or curiosity. I'm already a bit anxious about not turning it into a project—can we slow down and talk through a really small, low-stakes way to keep it that way?

Therapist: It's like you're already thinking about how to approach this, and you're trying to stay curious and open-minded. That's a great start.

Okay, let's take it even smaller. What if, instead of signing up for a pottery class, you just go to the local art supply store and buy a potter's wheel. No class, no instruction, just a wheel and some clay. Can you do that, and see what happens? It's a tiny, low-stakes step, but it might help you get a feel for what you're looking for.

Patient: Buying a wheel feels like spawning a whole new product—too big, expensive, and basically invites my metrics-brain to turn it into another deliverable. A smaller experiential hypothesis: I'll go to the art supply store, handle a lump of air-dry clay for five minutes, and commit to zero photos/notes—time-boxed and low-effort so it can't be optimized. I'm already feeling a bit anxious just deciding this—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like buying a wheel would be a big step, and it's causing you to feel a bit overwhelmed. And I get it, you don't want to invite your metrics-brain into this.

Okay, let's take it down to almost nothing. Why don't you just... sit with the clay? For five minutes. No handling, no making anything, no thinking about it. Just sit with it, and see what happens. No photos, no notes, no trying to do anything with it. Just... sitting. Can you do that, even if it feels a bit awkward or uncomfortable?

Patient: I can try that—sitting with the clay for five minutes feels doable in theory, but my default is to ritualize everything. I’d probably set a timer so I don’t overthink it and try to notice simple sensations without turning them into data, though I can already feel my brain drafting an experimental protocol. I’m feeling anxious about actually being unstructured—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already trying to approach this in a way that feels comfortable for you, even if it's not entirely natural. Setting a timer and trying to notice simple sensations without overthinking them is a great start.

Okay, let's take it even slower. Why don't we just focus on the timer for now? Can you agree to just sit with the clay for five minutes, without any expectations or goals? No setting a timer, no trying to notice anything in particular, just... sitting. Can you do that, even if it feels a bit strange or uncomfortable?

Patient: Okay — I can try to just sit with the clay for five minutes with no timer or agenda. I'm already feeling this knot of shame and irritation, like if I can't tolerate a few unstructured minutes it proves some prior incompetence, so my brain's screaming to build a protocol instead of actually sitting. I want to do it, but I'm nervous I'll default to analysis—can we slow down, and could you stay with me while I try so I don't immediately sabotage it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the potential for your brain to default to analysis and protocol-building, and that's causing you a lot of anxiety. And to be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're willing to try this at all, given how much you're resisting it.

Okay, I'm here with you. I'll stay with you, quietly, until you're done with your five minutes. No questions, no judgment, no trying to help. I just want you to be able to sit with the clay without any pressure or expectation. Can I do that for you? Can I just be here, with you, in silence, for the next five minutes?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is sitting in silence supposed to help with this? Still, please stay; I'm already feeling a knot of shame and frustration, and I know my reflex will be to intellectualize instead of actually feeling it, so can we slow down and do this together?

Therapist: I think I might have misspoken. I don't mean sitting in complete silence, but rather... just being here, in a neutral and calm way. No talking, no advice, no trying to guide you or help you feel a certain way. I'm just going to sit with you, in silence, and be present, until you're ready to move on from this exercise.

It's not about the sitting itself, but rather about creating a space where you can feel safe and comfortable enough to let go of your resistance and just be with your thoughts and feelings. Can I do that for you? Can I just be here, with you, and support you in this small, quiet way?

Patient: I'm not sure I fully follow—how is a quiet presence supposed to move the needle when my brain wants a causal model? Still, yes, please stay. There's this knot of shame and frustration—like a past screw-up—that flares when things are unstructured, so I'm anxious I'll default to analysis and ruin it. Can we slow down? Just be there without prompting, and maybe check in gently after five minutes with a simple "you okay?"—no questions, no interpretation.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to create a safe space for yourself to feel uncomfortable, without having a clear idea of what that means or how to make it happen. You're worried that your brain will try to control the situation, and that's making it hard for you to even start.

I'm going to try to do something different here. I'm not going to ask you to do anything or try to guide you in any way. I'm just going to sit here, quietly, and be present. If you're ready, I can check in with you after five minutes, with just a simple "you okay?" No questions, no interpretation. Just a simple, gentle check-in.

I'm not going to try to fix anything or offer any advice. I'm just going to be here, with you, in silence. Can I do that for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just being silent supposed to help when my brain wants a causal model? Still, yeah, please stay. There's this knot of shame and irritation that flares whenever things are unstructured and I can feel myself wanting to default to analysis, so I'd really appreciate you just sitting with me and checking in after five minutes with a simple "you okay?" — no questions, no interpretation. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed talking about this, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to understand how being silent can help when your brain is trying to analyze and make sense of things. And that's fair. It's a lot to take in.

Okay, let's take it slow. I'm just going to sit here with you, in silence, for five minutes. That's it. No talking, no advice, no trying to guide you. Just me, sitting here with you. No questions, no interpretation. Just a simple "you okay?" after five minutes. That's all I'm asking.

I'm not going to try to fix anything or offer any advice. I'm just going to be here, with you, in silence. Can I do that for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is silence supposed to recalibrate anything when my brain is constantly hunting for causal models? Still, yes please—stay with me. There's this knot of shame and irritation that flares (like some past screw-up trying to gatecrash), so could you just check in after five minutes with a simple "you okay?"—no questions, no interpretation. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed saying this, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to understand how silence can be helpful, especially when your brain is constantly analyzing and looking for patterns. It's like your brain is a computer, and silence is like a blue screen of death - it's not solving anything, it's just making everything more confusing.

Okay, let's take a deep breath and try to simplify things. I'm just going to sit here with you for five minutes, no talking, no advice, no guidance. Just me, sitting in silence. When the five minutes are up, I'll check in with you with a simple "you okay?" That's it. No questions, no interpretation. Just a simple question to show I care.

Can I do that for you? Can I just sit with you in silence for five minutes, and then check in with a simple question?

Patient: Okay — I don't really follow how silence is supposed to help, but please stay. My words feel flat and there's this knot of shame and irritation; I'm worried I'll default to analysis, so could you check in after five minutes with just "you okay?"—no questions, no interpretation. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay if you're not feeling it yet. I'm just going to sit here with you, quietly, for five minutes. No talking, no advice, no guidance. Just me, being present.

When the five minutes are up, I'll check in with you, just like you asked. I'll say "you okay?" in a simple, gentle way. No questions, no interpretation. Just a straightforward question to see how you're doing.

Can I do that for you? Can I just sit with you in silence for five minutes, and then check in with a simple question?

Patient: Yeah…please. Just sit with me, don’t prompt or interpret, and check in after five minutes with a quiet “you okay?” I can feel that knot of shame already and my head will start drafting protocols if you give it anything to work with, so please don’t engage if I begin to analyze. I’m pretty drained, so keeping it simple would really help—can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm going to sit here with you in silence for now. No talking, no guidance, no prompts. Just me, being present.

When the five minutes are up, I'll check in with a quiet "you okay?" Like you said, no questions, no interpretation. Just a simple question to show I care.

I'm not going to say anything else until after the five minutes are up. I want to respect your need for silence and your desire to keep things simple. Can we just sit here for now?

Patient: Okay… I'll try to sit. My words feel flat and my head keeps trying to turn this into another protocol — there's a knot of shame under it that makes me defensive, so please stay silent and just check in after five minutes with a quiet “you okay?” If I start analyzing, don’t engage; can we slow down?

Therapist: *I remain silent, sitting in stillness with you*

Patient: I'm not sure I even followed what that silence was supposed to do — it left me oddly exposed and a hot wave of shame kept wanting to take over, which made me feel flat and really drained. My brain immediately started drafting protocols even as a smaller part of me wanted to just breathe and be, so I'm stuck between analyzing and collapsing. Can we slow down? Please just check in with a quiet "you okay?" like you said, and give me a minute to try to name one small feeling without turning it into a spreadsheet.

Therapist: *I wait quietly, not adding or responding in any way, allowing you to continue*

(I remain silent, giving you space to process and try to regulate your emotions)

Patient: Okay — I'll try to name one small feeling. There's this flat, hollow shame sitting in my chest, like an error-state that makes everything feel a little muted and stupid, and my reflex is immediately to convert it into a model instead of actually feeling it. Could you just check in now with a quiet "you okay?" and stay with me a bit longer? I need things slow.

Therapist: *I look at you gently and say in a soft, quiet voice* You okay?

Patient: Yeah…I'm okayish — there's this flat, hollow shame in my chest and a drained irritation that makes everything feel muted, like an error-state. My reflex is to turn it into an analysis instead of feeling it, but a smaller part of me just wants you to stay without asking me to perform. Can we slow down and you just be here a bit longer, maybe ask one gentle thing like "what's one small sensation you notice?" instead of interpreting?

Therapist: *I nod slightly, still speaking in a soft, gentle voice* What's one small sensation you notice in your body right now?

Patient: There's a tight, hot pressure right under my sternum and a hollow numbness in my throat — my body basically flipped into an "error-state" and I feel that cheap, familiar shame buzzing under it. I want to label and analyze it (of course), but honestly I'm kind of drained and would like to sit with this for a minute — can we slow down?

Therapist: *I sit in silence for a moment, then gently ask* Can you tell me more about that numbness in your throat?

Patient: It feels like a tight band right at the base of my throat—numb, like swallowing is muffled and words get filtered out before they escape. My instinct is to label it—somatic numbing, autonomic shutdown—because naming it makes me feel a smidge safer, which is irritatingly intellectual. There's also this hot, resentful shame underneath, like some past screw-up buzzing at the edges, and I don't have the energy to wrestle it into a model right now. Can we slow down and maybe just notice one breath together or the temperature in my mouth for a moment?

Therapist: *I take a deep breath with you, feeling the air move in and out of our lungs, and then I notice the temperature in my mouth* It's cool. I'm not sure if that's your mouth temperature or mine, but it's cool.

Patient: Yeah—I think that coolness is mine. It actually helps a bit: the cool air kind of slides past that tight band and dulls the hot pressure under my sternum, like a tiny reset. My brain's already drafting variables to measure it, which is annoying, but a smaller part just wants another slow breath with you—can we do that and stay quiet a bit longer?

Therapist: *I breathe slowly with you, feeling the air move in and out of our lungs, and then I pause for a moment, saying nothing at all*

Patient: That quiet actually did something — the cool air nudged the tight band and for a second the shame felt like a faint static instead of a thunderclap. Still, there's this replay of a past failure humming under it that makes me want to rescue myself with yet another model, which I don't have the energy for right now. Can we keep breathing together for another minute or two, quietly, and then maybe you ask one tiny, non-interpretive question like "anything small you notice?" — nothing more.

Therapist: *I continue to breathe slowly with you, and after a moment, I ask in a very soft voice* Anything small you notice?

Patient: I notice a faint pins-and-needles buzzing under my ribs and my right thumb feels oddly warm when I breathe in — the breath thins the buzz a little. I can frame it as residual sympathetic activation and somatic hypervigilance, but there's that petty, nagging shame that still wants to be explained away instead of felt. Can we just keep breathing together quietly for another minute, and then you do that one soft check-in again? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, so can we slow down?
