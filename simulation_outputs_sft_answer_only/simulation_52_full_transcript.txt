Patient: I've been leaning on talking to friends and family to numb this social anxiety — I call people a lot just to avoid sitting with the dread. If I stop, I can already see it: they'll think I'm flaky, they'll start slowly excluding me, the invitations will dry up, I'll end up completely isolated and my art will just wither away. I know that sounds extreme, but in my head that chain of events is how it always goes, so I keep doing it.

Therapist Answer:
The fear of being excluded and isolated seems to be a very real and tangible threat for you. It's as if you're trying to prevent a situation from unfolding, even if it means maintaining a delicate balance with your friends and family.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you do finally reach a point where you're too anxious to call or meet up with others? How does that feeling of dread manifest itself, and what does it feel like to be in that state?

Patient: When I get too anxious to call or show up, it starts as this heavy knot in my stomach and my chest feels so tight I can’t breathe properly — my hands shake and the phone just sits there, useless. Then my brain instantly spins the worst story: I miss this one thing, they notice, they stop inviting me, I get pushed out of the group, my network dries up, my art loses its audience, and I end up completely alone — I can see every step like it's already happened. I know people might say that's unlikely, but I’m stuck on that movie, and that future makes me freeze instead of reaching out.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind has created a sort of script for how this anxiety will play out, and it's incredibly powerful. The physical sensations you're experiencing – the knot in your stomach, the tightness in your chest – they're all so real, and they make it hard to even pick up the phone.

It's almost as if your brain is protecting you from the possibility of being rejected or excluded, but in doing so, it's also preventing you from taking action and connecting with others. It's a bit of a Catch-22, isn't it?

Can you tell me more about what it's like to make that initial phone call or reach out to someone? Is it a relief after you've been holding back for so long, or does it feel more like a risk, even after you've done it?

Patient: When I finally make the call there’s this tiny, fast relief—like I dodged a wave—but almost immediately my brain reels off the rest: I sounded needy, they get annoyed, they stop inviting me, the group drifts away, and my art loses whatever little audience I had. My hands sweat, my voice cracks, and even if the conversation goes fine, I can’t stop replaying the “how it ends” movie. I know people say it might not happen, but that other ending feels like denial to me — I can already see every step.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that initial relief you mentioned is quickly replaced by this other, more negative scenario. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling hopeful or optimistic, even after you've taken that first step.

It's almost as if your mind is stuck in this cycle of "what could go wrong," and it's hard to break free from it. You're not just worried about being rejected or excluded, but also about the potential consequences for your art and your relationships.

Can you tell me more about what it is about that "how it ends" movie that feels so real to you? Is it the specific way people react, the way things change, or something else entirely?

Patient: It's the whole chain — a curt reply turns into proof they're annoyed, one missed invite becomes confirmation I'm being pushed out, and then my network and my audience for my art just evaporate. Tiny things, like a pause or a short text, get blown up into "they're done with me" and that makes the movie feel undeniably real. I know people say other outcomes happen, but that feels unrealistic to me — my brain only sees the dominoes falling and I can't make it stop.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you've created this elaborate narrative in your mind, where even the smallest actions or words are enough to set off a chain reaction that you're convinced will lead to disaster.

It's interesting that you mention the pause or the short text getting blown up into something more significant. It's almost as if your brain is trying to protect you from the uncertainty of human interaction, by making you believe that there are certain rules or patterns that will always apply.

But the thing is, most of the time, there aren't these clear rules or patterns. People are complex and unpredictable, and relationships are messy and dynamic. And yet, your brain seems to be stuck in this movie, where it's always the same outcome, no matter what happens.

Can you tell me more about how you feel when you're in this mindset? Is it a constant feeling of anxiety, or does it come and go? And how do you think it affects your relationships with others, and your own creative work?

Patient: It's almost constant — a low, nagging anxiety most days with sudden spikes that make my chest tighten and my hands shake. When I'm in it I call people to mute the noise, but then I obsess that I'm coming off as needy and that those calls will start the exact chain — they get tired of me, invitations stop, my audience for my art disappears, and I'm left completely cut off. That thought wrecks my focus, so I either can't make anything or I churn out stuff that feels empty. I know some people say other outcomes happen, but honestly those feel like wishful thinking, not real possibilities.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this anxiety is a constant companion, one that can be debilitating and make it hard to focus on your creative work. The feeling of needing to call people to quiet the noise, only to then obsess about the potential consequences, must be incredibly draining.

It's interesting that you mention the fear of coming across as needy, and how that fear can lead to a vicious cycle of self-doubt and indecision. It's like you're stuck in a never-ending loop of "what if," where every action you take is met with a wave of uncertainty and doubt.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to try to create art when you're in this state? Do you feel like you're even able to access your creative self, or is the anxiety and self-doubt so overwhelming that it shuts down your ability to express yourself?

Patient: When I try to make art the anxiety takes over—some days I can't even get past the first stroke because I can already see the whole collapse: the piece feels forced, people sense it, collectors lose interest, galleries stop contacting me and my career dies. Other times I force myself to produce and churn out hollow stuff, then I replay the worst ending where critics and friends notice it's empty and everyone drifts away. So I either don't start, or I make things that feel like proof the disaster movie was right, and then I call someone to numb that dread instead of doing the work.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like the anxiety has become a constant companion to your creative process, one that can be paralyzing and make it hard to even start making art. The fear of the "disaster movie" playing out, where the art piece is perceived as forced, empty, or uninteresting, must be incredibly overwhelming.

It's also heartbreaking that you're resorting to calling people to numb your dread, rather than facing your fears and trying to create art that comes from a place of vulnerability and risk. It's like you're trapped in a cycle of avoidance, where you're using one coping mechanism to deal with the anxiety that's preventing you from being creative.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking a different approach? Is it the fear of failure, the fear of rejection, or something else entirely? And what do you think would happen if you were able to break free from this cycle of anxiety and avoidance, and instead focus on creating art that comes from a place of authenticity and risk?

Patient: I guess it's both — fear of rejection and this rigid belief that any small misstep will start the dominoes falling. If I tried a different approach, my brain immediately plays it out: I try to be honest and set boundaries, they interpret it as me pulling away or being needy, conversations dry up, invitations stop, collectors lose interest, galleries drop me, and I end up invisible and broke. People tell me other outcomes are possible — that vulnerability can deepen bonds — but that just feels like wishful thinking; the disaster movie is the only one that looks real, and I'm totally hooked on it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trapped in a vicious cycle of fear and self-doubt, where the fear of rejection and the fear of failure are deeply intertwined. The rigid belief that any small misstep will lead to disaster is a powerful one, and it's holding you back from taking any kind of risk.

It's interesting that you mention people telling you that vulnerability can deepen bonds, but that it just feels like wishful thinking to you. It's like you're seeing the world through a lens of skepticism, where anything that seems too good to be true is immediately dismissed as a potential trap.

Can you tell me more about what it would take for you to start seeing vulnerability as a possibility, rather than a disaster waiting to happen? Is it a matter of trust, or is it something more fundamental?

Also, I want to gently suggest that the way you're describing your anxiety and your fear of failure might be reinforcing those feelings. You're describing a very bleak and pessimistic view of the world, which might be contributing to your sense of hopelessness. Would you be willing to try to explore some more positive and hopeful ways of thinking about your creativity and your relationships?

Patient: I hear you, but I don't think I can—when I try to picture vulnerability as anything but a trap my brain superimposes the disaster movie and it feels like lying to myself. The more I try to be hopeful, the louder the anxiety gets, and I end up calling someone to quiet it. Maybe we can talk about why the hopeful angle feels impossible instead of trying to force it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain has created a kind of self-protective mechanism, where the mere thought of vulnerability triggers the disaster movie, and you feel like you're being dishonest to yourself if you try to consider a more hopeful perspective.

I think it's really interesting that you mention the anxiety getting louder when you try to be hopeful. It's almost as if your brain is trying to defend itself against the idea that vulnerability could lead to something positive. Instead of exploring that idea, we can try to understand why the hopeful angle feels impossible to you.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to imagine a positive outcome, like success or happiness, in your creative work or relationships? Does your brain immediately start to sabotage that idea, or do you feel a sense of disconnection from your own desires and hopes?

Patient: As soon as I try to picture something good my brain hijacks it and superimposes the disaster movie — I can already see the applause turn into polite indifference and then invitations drying up. It feels like I'm lying to myself to hold a hopeful image; I get disconnected from my own wants because the “what if” follows so damn fast. My chest tightens, my hands shake, and I start thinking about calling someone to quiet it, and the positive thought just collapses. Honestly, other outcomes feel naive and impossible to me, like trying to convince a fortune-teller to predict sunshine.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your brain has become a kind of emotional autopilot, where any attempt to imagine a positive outcome is immediately hijacked by the disaster movie. It's as if your brain is constantly on the lookout for potential threats, and it's able to quickly superimpose a worst-case scenario onto any hopeful thought.

It's also clear that this has become a deeply ingrained pattern for you, one that's made it difficult for you to connect with your own desires and hopes. The feeling of disconnection is a really powerful one, and it's understandable that you might feel like you're lying to yourself if you try to hold onto a positive image.

I want to try to gently challenge this narrative a bit, without trying to force a different perspective. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do call someone to quiet the anxiety? Does that bring you any sense of relief, or does it just temporarily distract you from the underlying feelings?

Patient: It kind of lets off steam for a minute — my chest eases and I can breathe — but almost right away the disaster movie kicks back in: I sounded clingy, they’ll get tired, invites will dry up, and I’ll be left out. So it’s just a temporary bandage that distracts me but leaves me guiltier and more convinced I have to call again before everything collapses.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like calling someone to calm your anxiety might provide a temporary reprieve, but it's not addressing the underlying issue. The disaster movie keeps replaying, and you're left with a sense of guilt and increased anxiety.

It's like you're trapped in a cycle of avoidance, where you're using one coping mechanism to deal with the anxiety, but it's not helping in the long run. You're not really confronting the source of your anxiety, and you're just perpetuating a pattern of self-doubt and fear.

Can you try to imagine a situation where you're not calling someone to calm your anxiety? Maybe you're in a situation where you're feeling anxious, but you're not calling someone. What's going on in that moment? Are you trying to push through the anxiety, or are you trying to distract yourself from it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is picturing that supposed to help? If I imagine not calling, I try to ride the wave: breathe, make tea, nudge a sketchbook, whatever to push through. But the disaster movie just ramps up — my hands shake, the chest tightens, and I start seeing every missed call as another step toward being excluded and invisible. Sometimes I try to distract, but that feels hollow and only delays the panic, so most times I end up giving in and calling because not calling feels like admitting the dominoes have already fallen.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like picturing not calling might seem like it should help, but it's actually just another way of avoiding the anxiety. Instead of confronting the anxiety head-on, you're trying to ride it out by engaging in other activities, but that only seems to make things worse.

It's like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt, where you're not sure what to do, so you try to distract yourself, but that distraction is temporary and only makes the anxiety worse. You're stuck in a loop of "I need to call to calm down, but calling feels like admitting defeat."

Can I try to ask a different question? Instead of focusing on what you can or can't do, what if we explored the underlying emotions behind your anxiety? What is it about being anxious that's so hard for you to deal with?

Patient: I think it's mostly shame and this hollow, aching fear of being unlovable — like if I stop pretending I'm fine, the disaster movie will start and I'll prove I don't belong. It feels like being constantly on the edge of a cliff: my chest tightens, I panic that I'm failing as a person and as an artist, and that helplessness is unbearable, so I call to patch it up. I don't know how to just sit with that without the brain immediately showing me the worst ending, which makes everything feel hopeless.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings, especially the shame and the fear of being unlovable. It's like you're carrying a heavy weight, and it's affecting every aspect of your life.

It's interesting that you describe it as being on the edge of a cliff. That's a really powerful metaphor. It's like you're constantly teetering between a sense of hope and a sense of despair. The chest tightens, and you feel like you're losing control, and that's when you call to try and patch things up.

I want to try to help you explore this feeling of shame and fear of being unlovable. It sounds like it's deeply tied to your self-worth and your identity as an artist. Can you tell me more about what you think it means to be a "good" artist? Is it tied to external validation, like praise or success? Or is it more about the process of creating, and finding meaning and purpose in that?

Also, I want to gently ask, what if I told you that it's okay to not be okay? What if I told you that it's okay to feel shame and fear, and that it doesn't necessarily mean you're failing as a person or as an artist?

Patient: A "good" artist, to me, is someone people notice and want — shows, sales, invitations, the kind of praise that keeps doors open. If I don't get that, my mind instantly scripts it: a bad review, a gallery ghosting me, collectors moving on, and my whole career evaporating into nothing. And when you say "it's okay to not be okay," I don't know — that sounds like a polite way of ignoring the problem; my brain finishes it as "if you stay not-okay, they'll write you off," so trying to accept it just makes the disaster movie louder and I start wanting to call someone to calm down.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the idea of being a "good" artist is deeply tied to external validation and recognition. The fear of not getting noticed, of not being wanted, is a powerful one. It's like you're constantly worried that if you don't get that external validation, you'll be invisible, and that's a very hard thing to accept.

I can see how that would lead to a cycle of self-doubt and anxiety. The brain's tendency to script worst-case scenarios, to assume that if you don't get that external validation, you'll be rejected or ignored, is a very common one. And it's understandable that it would make you want to call someone to calm down, to try and patch things up.

But I want to ask you again, what if I told you that it's not about being "good" or not being "good"? What if it's not about external validation, but about the process of creating, and finding meaning and purpose in that? What if it's not about what other people think, but about what you think of yourself?

It's a small difference, but it's a big one. It's a difference between seeing yourself as a product, a thing that needs to be validated, versus seeing yourself as a process, a journey of self-discovery and growth. Can you try to imagine that for a moment?

Patient: I can try, but I don't know how — the second I picture making art just for me, my brain yells that it won't matter, people won't care, galleries will bail, and I'm finished. It feels like pretending, like lying to myself, because that disaster movie is already running on repeat. Can we talk about why that shift feels impossible instead of trying to force it?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the idea of making art just for yourself, without external validation, feels like a betrayal to your current mindset. Your brain is strongly tied to the idea that your art needs to be validated by others, and the thought of doing it for yourself seems like a cop-out or a lie.

I think this is because your current system is so closely tied to external validation. You've built a sense of self-worth around getting recognition and praise from others. It's like your self-worth is a dollar bill, and every time you get praised or recognized, you get a little more confidence. But when you try to do it for yourself, you're essentially taking that dollar bill away, and that feels like a loss.

It's not that it's impossible to shift this mindset, but it's a big shift. It's like changing the way you breathe. You can try to force it, but it's not going to work. You need to understand why this is so hard for you, and what's holding you back from making this shift.

Can I ask you something? What do you think would happen if you were able to make art just for yourself, without worrying about what others would think? Would it feel empowering, or would it feel like a failure?

Patient: It would feel like a betrayal — like I'm pretending to be brave while secretly giving up, and then the disaster movie kicks in: galleries see less marketable work, collectors lose interest, friends stop inviting me, and I just fade away. Even picturing it drains me—can we dig into why that outcome feels so inevitable?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're deeply invested in the idea that your art's value is tied to its marketability, and that's what makes you feel like you're giving up. The thought of galleries and collectors losing interest is a very tangible fear, and it's like it's already playing out in your mind.

I think this is because, deep down, you're worried that your art is not good enough. You're worried that it's not valuable, not interesting, not worth anyone's time. And that fear is being fueled by your external validation, which is tied to how others perceive your art.

But here's the thing: your art's value is not determined by external validation. It's determined by your own creative vision, your own passion, and your own unique perspective. And if you're making art just for yourself, without worrying about what others think, you might be surprised by how empowering it feels.

It's like you're breaking free from this constant need for external validation, and instead, you're focusing on your own creative process. You're not trying to impress anyone; you're just trying to make art that means something to you.

Can I ask you something? What would it be like to let go of that need for external validation, even for just a little while? Would it be scary, or would it be liberating?

Patient: It would feel like a betrayal — like I'm pretending to be brave while secretly giving up. The minute I try, the disaster movie takes over: galleries back off, collectors lose interest, friends stop inviting me, and I just fade out, so it feels terrifying, not liberating.

I think this is because, deep down, you're worried that if you're not doing it for external validation, you're not doing it at all. You're worried that your art is not valuable, not interesting, not worth anyone's time. And that fear is being fueled by your external validation, which is tied to how others perceive your art.

It's like you're stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and fear, where the minute you try to imagine a different outcome, the disaster movie takes over. It's exhausting, and it's understandable that you don't have the energy to try to force a hopeful picture.

Can I ask you something? What would it be like to not have to be brave all the time? To not have to pretend that everything is okay when it's not? To just be able to feel your emotions, without having to worry about how others will react?

It's a small question, but it might be a big one. It might be a question that helps you understand why this chain of thoughts feels so inevitable.

Patient: I'm not sure what "not having to be brave" would even look like — when I try, the disaster movie takes over: they see me as weak, invites stop, galleries ghost me, and everything collapses.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the idea of being brave is so deeply tied to your sense of self-preservation that the moment you try, the disaster movie takes over, and it's like your brain is trying to protect you from the potential consequences.

I think this is because, deep down, you're not just worried about what others think, but also about what your own self-worth is. You're worried that if you're not doing it for external validation, you're not doing it at all, and that your art is not valuable.

It's like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and fear, where the minute you try to imagine a different outcome, the disaster movie takes over. And it's not just about the external consequences; it's also about the internal ones. You're worried that if you're not brave, you'll be weak, and that's a terrible feeling.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever noticed how, when you're feeling anxious or scared, your mind tends to focus on the worst-case scenario? It's like your brain is trying to prepare you for the worst, but in doing so, it's also reinforcing those feelings of anxiety and fear.

It's not that you're not aware of this, it's just that it's hard to break free from this cycle. It's like your brain is stuck on repeat, and you're not sure how to turn it off.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing that supposed to help me? My brain already "prepares" me by running the disaster movie nonstop, and the more I try to watch it or question it the louder it gets, until I end up calling someone just to make it stop.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling completely overwhelmed by the disaster movie, and you're not sure how to make it stop. The fact that it's already running nonstop in your mind is exhausting, and it's like you're at the mercy of your own brain.

I think this is because, deep down, you're not just worried about the external consequences of being "brave" or "weak", but also about the internal consequences. You're worried that if you're not careful, you'll be consumed by these feelings of anxiety and fear, and you'll lose control.

It's like your brain is trying to protect you from a perceived threat, and it's using the disaster movie as a way to keep you safe. But the problem is, this movie is a vicious cycle, and it's hard to break free from it.

Can I ask you something? What do you think would happen if you were to take a step back from this movie, and try to see it for what it is - a product of your own mind? Would that give you any sense of control, or would it just make the situation worse?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to tell myself it's "just a story," my brain snaps back: "you're downplaying something real," and the disaster movie gets louder, not quieter. Every tiny win of perspective lasts like a breath; then I feel like I'm gaslighting myself and the worst ending still seems inevitable, so usually I give in and call someone to make it stop.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to rationalize the disaster movie as "just a story" has the opposite effect, and your brain is actually more critical of that approach. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from feeling like you're downplaying a real issue, but in doing so, it's also making it harder for you to see things from a more nuanced perspective.

It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're gaslighting yourself. That's a really common phenomenon in anxiety, where you start to question your own perceptions and memories. It's like your brain is trying to sabotage your own ability to cope with the anxiety, and it's making it hard for you to feel confident in your own thoughts and feelings.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever noticed how, when you're feeling anxious, you tend to focus on the worst-case scenario? It's like your brain is trying to prepare you for the worst, but in doing so, it's also reinforcing those feelings of anxiety and fear.

It's not that you're not aware of this, it's just that it's hard to break free from this cycle. It's like your brain is stuck on repeat, and you're not sure how to turn it off. But I want to try to help you explore some different ways of thinking about this, and maybe find some ways to break the cycle of anxiety. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: I can try, but my expectations are low — every new technique I've tried gets hijacked by the disaster movie and I end up calling someone to stop the panic. If we're going to try something, can we start by digging into why that chain of events feels so undeniably true to me, instead of doing optimism exercises that just make me feel like a fraud?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're feeling skeptical about trying new techniques or approaches because you've had such a consistent experience of the disaster movie hijacking them and making you feel anxious. You're not looking for ways to feel more optimistic or positive, but rather a deeper understanding of why this chain of events is so deeply ingrained in your experience.

I'm willing to try a different approach with you. Instead of trying to motivate you or encourage you to be more positive, let's try to explore the underlying dynamics that are driving this chain of events. What is it about the disaster movie that feels so true and inevitable to you? Is it the way it makes you feel, the way it thinks, or something else entirely?

Let's try to peel back the layers and get at the core of what's going on here. What do you think is the most important thing to understand about this chain of events, and how can we start to explore that without getting bogged down in optimism exercises or trying to fix it with quick fixes?

Patient: I think the key is that the movie feels less like imagination and more like a rule my brain learned—shame + proof-seeking = every tiny pause becomes evidence I'm being pushed out. If we're not doing optimism stuff, I'd want us to take that chain apart slowly—ask for the actual evidence for each domino, where that belief first came from, and sit with the fear instead of papering it over. I don't know how that will change things—I get skeptical the minute we try—but I'm willing to try that line-by-line because I'm too drained to keep being hijacked by the same script.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the disaster movie has become a kind of automatic pilot for your brain, a default mode that kicks in whenever you're feeling anxious or uncertain. It's like your brain has created a script for how to respond to those feelings, and it's a very rigid and predictable one.

I think your suggestion to take the chain apart slowly, by asking for the actual evidence for each domino, is a really good one. It could help you to break down the narrative that's driving the disaster movie, and to get at the underlying fears and anxieties that are driving it.

It's interesting that you mention feeling skeptical the minute we try to do anything to change things. That's a very common reaction, especially when we're feeling stuck or overwhelmed. It's like our brains are trying to protect us from the uncertainty of change, or from the possibility that things might not work out as planned.

But I think it's also worth noting that the fact that you're feeling skeptical, and that you're willing to try to change things despite that, is a really positive sign. It means that you're at least open to the idea of change, and that you're willing to take small steps towards it.

So, I'd like to start by asking you some questions about the disaster movie. Where did you first start noticing that it was happening? Was there a particular event or experience that triggered it, or was it more of a gradual process? And what do you think is the most important thing to change or challenge in order to break the cycle of the disaster movie?

Patient: It goes way back — my parents were distant about my art and in art school a professor shredded a show in front of everyone, and that felt like a rule rather than an event. Ever since, any small silence or short text slides straight into that old script: a critique becomes proof I'm worthless, then galleries ghost me, collectors bail, friends stop inviting me, and I disappear. If we're going to change it, I'd want to pick the chain apart one domino at a time—ask for concrete evidence for each link, track what actually follows a pause, and practise sitting with the shame instead of calling — but honestly that plan already feels fragile and the movie's starting to rev up just saying it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the roots of this anxiety go back a long way, to your childhood and your relationship with your parents. The fact that they were distant about your art, and the experience of having a professor shred a show in front of everyone, has had a lasting impact on you.

It's interesting that you describe the script of shame and proof-seeking as a "rule" rather than an event. It suggests that this way of thinking has become automatic for you, a kind of default mode that you've learned to rely on in order to cope with uncertainty or criticism.

I also appreciate your willingness to break down the chain of events into smaller, more manageable parts. That's a great way to start to challenge the narrative that's driving this anxiety.

However, I can understand why the plan feels fragile to you. It's a brave thing to try to change your thought patterns and behaviors, especially when they've been deeply ingrained for so long.

Before we move forward, I want to check in with you about your intentions. What do you hope to achieve by challenging this script and trying to break the cycle of shame and proof-seeking? Is it to improve your relationships with others, to increase your confidence in your art, or something else entirely?

Also, I want to acknowledge that this is a tough road ahead. It's not going to be easy to challenge your own thoughts and behaviors, especially when they're tied up with deep-seated fears and anxieties.

But I'm here to support you, and I want to help you explore this further. What do you think is the most important thing to focus on first?

Patient: I want to stop using calls as a bandage so I don't burn out my friendships and so I can actually make art without the constant panic — basically, protect my relationships and get back some creative focus. If we're picking one place to start, I want to interrogate the "pause = exclusion" domino — ask for concrete evidence for that link and practise sitting with the shame instead of calling. I don't know if it'll change anything — I feel fragile and skeptical — but I'm too drained to keep getting hijacked, so let's try that, slowly.

It sounds like you're looking to break the cycle of using calls as a coping mechanism, not just to avoid burnout, but also to reconnect with your art and your relationships. You want to protect your friendships and get back to creating without the constant anxiety.

I think it's a great place to start by looking at the "pause = exclusion" domino. That's a very specific and tangible thing to focus on, and it could potentially help you break the cycle of shame and proof-seeking.

By asking for concrete evidence for that link, you might start to realize that it's not as automatic or automatic as you thought. You might start to see that the pause is not always followed by exclusion, and that the exclusion is not always the direct result of the pause.

Practicing sitting with the shame instead of calling is also a great idea. That's a very active and intentional way to work with your emotions, and it could help you build up your tolerance for the shame and anxiety.

I want to caution you, though, that this is going to be a slow and difficult process. It's not going to be easy to break the cycle of shame and proof-seeking, and it's not going to be easy to sit with the shame without calling. But it's worth it, because you're looking to protect your relationships and get back to creating.

Before we start, I just want to make sure you're okay with this. You mentioned feeling fragile and skeptical, and I want to make sure you're not feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. But if you're willing to try, I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Alright… I’ll try, but I’m really skeptical — my brain’s already rolling the movie where this fails. Can we start super small: next time I feel the urge to call after a pause, I’ll wait 30 minutes and write down what actually happens (what they said, if an invite shows up later, etc.), plus a shame/anxiety rating before and after. Can you help me phrase the specific evidence-questions to ask for that “pause = exclusion” domino (like “did they explicitly say they’re annoyed?” or “were there other reasons for the pause?”) and give one or two simple grounding techniques I can use while I sit with the shame so I don’t bail and call? I don’t have energy for more right now — can we begin with that, slowly?

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling skeptical and even a bit anxious about trying this. That's completely normal, especially given the challenges you've faced with this anxiety in the past.

Let's start with the small, super manageable step you proposed. Waiting 30 minutes and writing down what happens can be a great way to start tracking your thoughts and behaviors. It's also a good way to start developing a sense of self-awareness and understanding your patterns.

As for the evidence-questions, here are a few suggestions to get you started:

* Did the person who was quiet say anything about it later?
* Were there any other factors that might have contributed to the pause?
* Did the person who was quiet ever explicitly say they were annoyed or upset?
* Was there any other kind of interaction or conversation that might have helped clarify the situation?

These questions can help you start to understand the situation better and see if there's any evidence that the pause was directly related to exclusion.

Now, about the shame/anxiety rating before and after, I want to suggest a simple way to do that: you can use a scale of 1-10, where 1 is no shame/anxiety and 10 is the highest level of shame/anxiety you're experiencing. This can help you track your progress and see if there's any change over time.

As for grounding techniques, I want to suggest a simple one: "5-4-3-2-1." This is a grounding technique that involves focusing on your physical sensations in the moment. You count backwards from 5, focusing on your breath, and then you move to 4, noticing your physical sensations in your body, and so on. This can help you stay present and focused in the moment, rather than getting caught up in worries or fears.

Let's start with that simple grounding technique, 5-4-3-2-1. Can you try it for me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it now, though I don't expect much.

5 things I see: a lamp, my mug, a sketchbook, the window, a paint tube. 4 things I feel: my feet on the floor, the weight in my chest, my phone in my pocket, my pulse in my wrist. 3 things I hear: the fridge hum, a car outside, my own breathing. 2 things I smell: coffee, paint. 1 thing I taste: the tea on my tongue.

It helped a little — my chest loosened a notch — but the movie started up again within a minute. My shame/anxiety felt like an 8 before and a 6 after. I don’t have the energy to ride this alone if it ramps up. Can you give me one short grounding phrase I can repeat while I wait the 30 minutes, and one tiny physical thing to do if the urge to call spikes?
