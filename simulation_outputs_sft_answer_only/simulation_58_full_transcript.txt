Patient: I'm a senior artist and lately I can't stop getting furious whenever job stuff comes up—lost a few commissions and I snap at people, then feel awful about it. It's tied up with grief and instability, and calming down just feels impossible. I've tried talking and breathing exercises before and they didn't help—how is this supposed to help now?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're already feeling a deep sense of frustration and helplessness, and that's making it hard for you to even think about taking a step back and trying something new. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel this way, especially when it comes to job stuff? What seems to trigger it, and how does your body and mind respond in the moment?

Patient: Usually it flicks on with something small—an email about a canceled commission, or someone questioning my rates—and my chest tightens, jaw clenches, and my hands get shaky. My mind goes straight to catastrophes: I'm a failure, all my work was pointless, and then I snap and say things I regret. I've tried noticing the body before and breathing stuff, but it just feels like—how is that supposed to help when the whole thing is collapsing?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical sensations you're experiencing are pretty intense, and it's like your whole body is revving up to respond to this perceived threat. And then, on top of that, you're getting caught up in this really intense emotional narrative – all these worst-case scenarios, the self-doubt, the anger... It's like your mind is feeding off that tension and fueling it even more.

Can you tell me more about what it's like to be in that moment, right after things start to go wrong? Is it like your whole world is narrowing down to just this one thing, and everything else fades away?

Patient: Yeah—exactly that. Everything narrows to that one thing and time sort of compresses; I’m only able to see the loss and the shame and the worst outcome. My chest tightens, I get hot, words come out sharp before I mean them, then I feel numb and ashamed afterwards and keep replaying it. I try to pull back but it’s like my head’s already decided I’m doomed—how is pausing or breathing supposed to help when the whole thing feels like it’s collapsing?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your whole system is geared towards reacting to that immediate threat, and that's making it hard for you to even consider pulling back or pausing. It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, scanning for danger, and your whole body is responding accordingly.

In a way, it's almost like your mind is trying to prepare you for the worst-case scenario, to make sure you're ready to deal with it. But that only ends up making things worse, because it's fueling your fear and anxiety and making it harder for you to think clearly.

Can you try to imagine what it would be like if, for just a moment, your brain could quiet down just a little bit? If you could just slow down your whole system and give yourself a chance to think more clearly, without all the fear and anxiety and panic... What do you think might happen if you could do that?

Patient: Maybe if I could actually slow down, I wouldn't blurt out those sharp things and I might be able to think of practical steps—like contacting a client calmly or adjusting a rate—rather than spiraling. But honestly, I've tried pausing and breathing and it never sticks; my head just races and I'm back to thinking it's all over. How is that supposed to help me change what feels like a collapse?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're trying to fix the problem with a band-aid, but the underlying issue is still there, and it's still causing the same collapse. And it's not just that you're not getting the benefits from those exercises, it's that they're not even helping you build up a sense of resilience or stability.

It's like you're asking yourself to do something that feels like a small miracle – to just calm down and think clearly, without all the panic and fear. But what if, instead of trying to calm down, you tried to find a way to make sense of what's happening in the first place? What if you tried to connect with what's driving all this fear and anxiety, and what if you could find a way to make it feel more manageable?

Can you tell me more about what's driving all this fear and anxiety? Is it something specific, like a past experience, or is it more general? What do you think is at the root of all this, and how do you think it might be connected to your work as an artist?

Patient: Mostly it feels like loss of meaning and safety — my work has been who I am for decades, and when commissions vanish or people question my prices it feels like I'm being erased. There’s grief too; I lost a lot in recent years and being older makes me feel disposable, so every little rejection feels like proof I'm finished. I've dug into this with others before and naming it didn't stop the shaking or the words that come out—how is talking about roots supposed to stop my jaw from clenching when an email says a job's canceled?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of identity loss, tied up with the fact that your work is a huge part of who you are. And on top of that, you're carrying around this sense of grief and vulnerability, which is making it hard for you to cope with the stress and uncertainty of your career.

It's like your whole self is tied up in this sense of self-worth, and when that's threatened, it's like a switch flips and you're completely reactive. It's not just about the email or the commission, it's about feeling like you're being erased and losing your sense of purpose.

I want to make sure you know that talking about your roots, or your feelings, or your fears, it's not about trying to fix everything right here, right now. It's about starting to understand what's going on, and how to make sense of it all. It's about finding a way to connect with what's driving your feelings, and maybe, just maybe, find a way to make them feel more manageable.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if you were able to take a step back, and look at this whole situation with a bit more clarity? What do you think you might see, or hear, or feel, if you were able to look at it from a different perspective?

Patient: Maybe I'd realize it's not actually the end of everything — that those emails are part of a pattern, not proof I'm finished. I might see the same triggers repeating and learn to spot them sooner, so I could try a different response instead of blowing up. But I've heard this before and it doesn't stop my jaw from clenching in the moment — how is seeing it differently supposed to actually stop me then? If we're going to try that, I need something concrete I can use when my chest goes tight.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're wondering how talking about this stuff is going to actually make a difference in the heat of the moment. You're looking for something concrete to help you calm down, to give you a sense of control when everything else feels like it's spiraling out of control.

Can I suggest something? What if, instead of trying to change everything all at once, we started with a tiny, tiny thing? What if, when your chest starts to tighten, you just take a tiny breath, just one breath? Not a big, dramatic one, just a tiny, tiny one? Maybe just one. And then, just one more. And then another one. It's like a tiny little anchor, holding you steady, even when everything else is feeling like it's falling apart.

It's not about stopping your jaw from clenching, it's about giving yourself a chance to slow down, just a little bit. To think, "Wait, what's happening right now?" And then, just one tiny breath. That's all we're aiming for, right now.

Patient: Fine — I can try one tiny breath, though I doubt it will stick; my jaw locks and my thoughts bolt the second I see a cancelation. How is that supposed to stop the heat in my face or the words that fly out? If we’re doing tiny, give me a concrete thing — a short sentence I can say to myself or a simple physical action I can do without thinking.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try a tiny step. It's not about stopping everything all at once, it's about creating a tiny opening, a tiny crack in the armor that's holding everything together.

Here's a concrete thing you can try: when you feel that initial tightening in your chest, just one word: "Pause." Say it out loud, or to yourself, just one word: "Pause." It's a simple word, but it gives you a chance to slow down, to say, "Wait, what's happening right now?" It's a tiny pause, but it might just be enough to give you a chance to think, to react, instead of just reacting.

Or, if you'd prefer a physical action, you could try just one finger: "Touch." Place your index finger on your chest, just for a second. It's a simple, physical act, but it gives you a chance to connect with your body, to feel that sensation, and to think, "Ah, I'm feeling something." It's not about stopping everything, it's just about being present, for one tiny moment.

Which one do you think you might try?

Patient: I'll try "Pause" — it's discreet, I can say it under my breath, and I don't want to look odd in front of clients. But honestly, how is that supposed to help my jaw clench or stop the heat in my face when everything feels like it's collapsing? Can we try it now—like you give me a quick cue (an imaginary cancelled commission) and I practice saying "Pause" so you can coach what to do next?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'll give you a cue. Imagine you just received an email from a client saying that they've decided not to move forward with the project you've been working on. The project is one of your biggest commitments, and you're really invested in it.

Go ahead, take a deep breath, and when you're ready, say "Pause" to yourself. Don't worry about the email, just focus on the word.

(You respond)

Go ahead, try it.

Patient: "Pause." Saying it under my breath does open a tiny crack—my breathing eases for a beat—but my jaw’s still clenched and my mind’s already rehearsing the worst. I don’t want this to be another little trick that wears off; if that half-second opens something, what exactly do I do next so I don’t blurt out whatever's boiling up?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
That's a good start. You've opened up a tiny crack, and your breathing has eased for a beat. Now, it's time to try to expand that crack a bit more.

Instead of just saying "Pause" again, try to connect with what's happening right now. Take a moment to notice where your jaw is feeling tight, and what's driving your anxiety. Are you worried about the client's reaction? Are you feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to deliver?

When you're ready, say something to yourself that acknowledges what's happening. It could be as simple as "Okay, I'm feeling anxious about this" or "I need to take a deep breath and calm down."

Let's try it again. Imagine you just received that email from the client, and you're feeling anxious about it. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, say something to yourself.

(You respond)

Patient: "Okay, I'm feeling anxious about this — my jaw's tight and I'm already thinking they'll see me as useless." Saying it out loud loosens my breathing a bit, but my brain's already drafting the sharp reply. How is that supposed to stop me from snapping? If that half-second opens something, give me an exact sentence to use with a client or a simple physical move I can do in the next few seconds so I don't blow it.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're acknowledging your anxiety and trying to connect with it. Now, it's time to try to find a way to bridge that gap between your anxious thoughts and your reaction to the client's email.

When you're ready, try to say something to yourself that's a bit more concrete. Instead of "I need to calm down," try to say something like, "I can take a moment to think about this before responding." Or, "I can ask for a minute to collect my thoughts before we talk about this."

If you're worried about saying something like that out loud to the client, try to focus on a simple physical move instead. When you're ready, try to take a deep breath and make a subtle gesture with your hand, like making a "wait" sign or placing your finger on your lips. This can give you a moment to collect your thoughts without drawing attention to yourself.

Let's try it again. Imagine you just received that email from the client, and you're feeling anxious about it. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, say something to yourself that acknowledges your anxiety and gives you a moment to collect your thoughts.

(You respond)

Patient: "I can take a moment to think before I respond" did open a tiny beat, but my jaw's still tight and my mind's already writing something sharp. How is that supposed to stop me when I'm already composing a biting reply? Give me one exact sentence I can send that sounds professional and actually buys me time.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're trying to find a way to buy yourself time before responding. When you're ready, try sending a sentence that acknowledges the client's email while also giving you a moment to collect your thoughts.

Here's a suggestion: "I appreciate your email and would like to discuss the project further before responding to the cancellation. Can we schedule a call for [insert time] to go over the details?"

This sentence is professional, concise, and gives you a clear reason to delay your response. It also gives you a chance to collect your thoughts and craft a more thoughtful reply.

When you're ready, try sending this sentence to the client and see how it buys you the time you need.

(You respond)

Patient: I tried it in my head: "Thanks for letting me know. I’d like to discuss this further before finalizing anything — could we schedule a short call tomorrow at 3pm?" Saying it under my breath eases my breathing for a tick, but my jaw’s still locked and I can already hear myself adding something cutting. How is a polite delay supposed to stop me from snapping in the moment? And if that actually buys me time, what do I do on the call when I’m already furious?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting closer to finding a way to manage your reaction. You're able to send a polite delay message, which gives you a small window of time to collect your thoughts.

When it comes to the call, it's true that your emotions may still be raw. However, having sent a polite delay message, you've already taken a step back from the initial reaction. During the call, try to focus on listening to the client's perspective and gathering information. This can help you process your emotions and find a more constructive way to respond.

Instead of trying to hold back your anger, try to approach the call with a sense of curiosity. Ask questions, clarify any concerns, and listen actively. This can help you stay calm and composed, even when the conversation is tense.

If you feel yourself getting agitated, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you've already sent a polite delay message. You've given yourself a chance to collect your thoughts, and now it's time to respond in a more thoughtful way.

When you're ready, we can try another scenario. Imagine you're on the call, and the client is explaining their concerns. How do you respond?

Patient: On the call I'd try to sound curious—something like, "Can you tell me what changed on your end? I want to understand." But I can already hear my tone going sharp halfway through—how is that supposed to stop me from snapping when they say I'm charging too much? Give me one or two exact sentences I can use if they start blaming me, and a tiny physical thing I can do during a phone call to stop the heat rising, because if they interrupt me I’ll probably explode.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're trying to approach the call with curiosity. When the client starts blaming you, try to respond in a calm and objective way. Here are a couple of exact sentences you can use:

* "I understand your concern, but I think there may be some misunderstandings about the project scope and pricing. Can we revisit the original agreement to clarify the details?"
* "I appreciate your feedback, but I'm not sure I agree that my pricing is too high. Can we discuss some potential solutions that could work for both parties?"

When the client starts blaming you, try to avoid getting defensive or reactive. Instead, focus on listening actively and trying to understand their perspective. If you feel yourself getting agitated, try a tiny physical relaxation technique, such as taking a deep breath, unclenching your fists, or subtly rubbing your temples.

During the call, if the client starts talking over you or interrupts, try to stay calm and say something like, "Excuse me, I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat it, please?" This can give you a moment to collect your thoughts and respond more calmly.

Remember, your goal is to stay calm, listen actively, and try to find a solution that works for both parties. By staying focused and composed, you can reduce the heat and increase the chances of a positive outcome.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try those lines, though they feel rehearsed and I’m not convinced they’ll hold up in the heat. Give me one exact, calm sentence to use if a client says “your price is ridiculous” that doesn’t sound like I’m backing down, and one tiny, subtle physical move I can do on a call (something like pressing my tongue to the roof of my mouth or squeezing my thumb) that actually helps stop the urge to snap—how is that supposed to help if it just feels like another trick? Can you roleplay that exact moment so I can practice the line and the move?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel like you're rehearsing and not convinced it'll work. The goal is to stay calm and focused on the conversation.

Here's a calm sentence you can use if a client says "your price is ridiculous":

"I appreciate your concern, but I've worked hard to set my prices based on industry standards and the value I bring to each project. I'm willing to discuss potential adjustments, but I need to ensure that any changes align with my own financial sustainability."

As for the tiny physical move, try this: when a client says something that triggers your urge to snap, subtly press your lips together, like you're about to say something you've just thought of. This can help you pause and take a deep breath, giving you a moment to collect your thoughts and respond more calmly.

Let's roleplay the exact moment. Imagine you're on a call, and a client says, "Your price is ridiculous." You're about to respond, and you feel your anger rising. Take a deep breath, and as you do, press your lips together.

You: [Pause, taking a deep breath] "I appreciate your concern, but I've worked hard to set my prices based on industry standards and the value I bring to each project. I'm willing to discuss potential adjustments, but I need to ensure that any changes align with my own financial sustainability."

Notice how the pause gives you a moment to collect your thoughts, and the physical move helps you stay calm? It's not about trying to suppress your emotions, but about finding a way to manage them in the heat of the moment.

How did that feel?

Patient: It helped for a beat — pressing my lips and saying that line bought me a split second; my breathing eased but my jaw stayed locked and I could already hear a cutting retort in my head. That sentence sounds too formal — give me a shorter, tougher one-liner I can actually use without sounding like I’m softening. Also give me one tiny, truly subtle physical move for a video call and one for in-person that actually distracts the body's surge. Can we roleplay now with you interrupting me so I can try it in the moment? And if this still doesn’t work, how is that supposed to stop the shame and the replay afterward?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that the pause helped, even if it was just for a beat. The formal sentence might be too much for the moment. Here's a shorter, tougher one-liner:

"I'm not willing to negotiate on this price. It's the rate I've been charging for this work for a long time."

As for the physical move, try this: when a client says something that triggers your urge to snap, subtly tap your pen or pencil on the desk or table in front of you. This can help distract your body and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.

Now, let's roleplay the exact moment. Imagine you're on a video call, and a client says, "Your price is ridiculous." You're about to respond, and you feel your anger rising. Take a deep breath, and as you do, tap your pen on the desk.

You: [Pause, taking a deep breath] "I'm not willing to negotiate on this price. It's the rate I've been charging for this work for a long time."

Notice how the physical move helps you stay focused and calm? It's not about suppressing your emotions, but about finding a way to manage them in the moment.

As for the shame and replay afterward, it's true that this might not completely eliminate those feelings. However, by learning to manage your reaction in the moment, you can reduce the intensity of those feelings and gain more control over your emotions. It's not a magic solution, but it can help you develop a more compassionate and understanding relationship with yourself.

How did that feel? Did the one-liner and the physical move help you stay calm and focused?

Patient: It helped for a beat—the tap and the line bought me a second, but my jaw’s still locked and I can already hear a cutting retort. The one-liner feels rehearsed; I’d rather something blunt and short like “That’s my rate,” but I’m worried it’ll sound abrupt or make things worse. And honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame and the replay afterward? Can we do the interruption practice again and also work out a concrete thing I can do right after the call so I don’t stew all night?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that the tap and the line helped, even if it was just for a second. The one-liner might feel rehearsed, but it's a simple and direct way to respond to a client's comment. The key is to deliver it with confidence and a firm tone.

As for the shame and replay afterward, it's true that this might not completely eliminate those feelings. However, by learning to manage your reaction in the moment, you can reduce the intensity of those feelings and gain more control over your emotions.

Let's roleplay the exact moment again. Imagine you're on a video call, and a client says, "Your price is ridiculous." You're about to respond, and you feel your anger rising. Take a deep breath, and as you do, tap your pen on the desk.

You: [Pause, taking a deep breath] "That's my rate."

Notice how this response is direct and to the point? It's not apologetic or rehearsed; it's just a clear statement of your pricing.

Now, let's talk about what you can do right after the call to reduce the shame and replay. One concrete thing you can do is write down your thoughts and feelings about the call. This can help you process your emotions and gain clarity on what happened. Try to write down three things that happened during the call, and how you felt about each thing. This can help you see the call from a different perspective and reduce the shame and replay.

Another thing you can do is take a few minutes to breathe and relax after the call. This can help calm your body and mind, and reduce the urge to replay the conversation. Try to find a quiet spot, take a few deep breaths, and focus on the present moment.

How did that feel? Did the one-liner and the physical move help you stay calm and focused? And did the roleplay help you see the call from a different perspective?

Patient: It helped for a beat—the tap and “That’s my rate” bought me a second, but my jaw’s still locked and I can already hear a cutting retort. I’m worried that line will come off blunt and blow up the conversation. The writing thing might help, but will it stop me replaying it all night? Can we roleplay the interruption again, and can you give me one concrete 30–60 second post-call ritual (something physical and simple) I can actually do right after to stop the stew? Also, honestly, how is any of this supposed to stop the shame afterward?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're thinking critically about how to manage your reactions. The concern about the line coming off blunt is valid, but it's also a chance to practice assertive communication. Remember, your goal is not to apologize or justify your pricing, but to simply state it clearly.

As for the writing ritual, it can help you process your emotions and gain clarity on what happened. However, it might not completely stop the replaying of the conversation. If you're still concerned, let's explore some other options.

One concrete post-call ritual is to take a short walk outside. It can be as simple as walking around the block or standing outside for a few minutes. This can help calm your body and mind, and give you a chance to clear your head.

Another option is to do some light stretching or yoga. This can help release tension and calm your nervous system. You can find plenty of simple stretches and yoga poses online that can be done in just a few minutes.

Regarding the shame, it's a complex issue that can't be fully addressed with a single solution. However, by practicing self-compassion and acknowledging your emotions, you can start to build a more positive relationship with yourself. It's okay to feel shame and regret after a difficult conversation. Acknowledge these feelings, and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.

Let's try the roleplay again, with a focus on your concerns. Imagine you're on a video call, and a client says, "Your price is ridiculous." You're about to respond, and you feel your anger rising. Take a deep breath, and as you do, tap your pen on the desk.

You: [Pause, taking a deep breath] "I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to negotiate on this price. It's the rate I've been charging for this work for a long time."

Notice how you're still assertive, but also acknowledging the client's concern. This can help you build a more positive connection with the client, and reduce the shame and replay afterward.

How did that feel? Did the post-call ritual and the roleplay help you manage your reactions?

Patient: It helped for a beat — that tap and line bought a second, but then this familiar wash of shame snuck back in and made me want to tear into whoever said it. I need one exact, 30–60 second post-call ritual you’ll promise won’t be vague (no walking the block)—give me a single physical sequence I can do immediately after hanging up to stop stewing. Also interrupt me again in a roleplay so I can try the line and the move in the moment, and be honest: how is any of this really supposed to stop the shame from replaying all night?

Patient: Okay... I'll try, but I'm not convinced. Here’s one exact 35–45 second sequence you can do the moment you hang up — step‑by‑step, nothing vague:

1) Sit back, feet flat, hands resting on your thighs. (2 seconds)  
2) Exhale fully through your mouth for 6 seconds, like you’re letting a balloon deflate. (6 seconds)  
3) Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, then exhale through your mouth for 6 seconds. Repeat that inhale‑hold‑exhale cycle one more time. (Total ~20 seconds)  
4) After the second exhale, clench your fists and gently tighten your jaw for 3 seconds, then let both go completely and let your jaw hang loose for 2 seconds — say a quiet, forced out “ahh” on the release. (5 seconds)  
5) Finish by pressing the pads of your fingertips together in front of you for 5 seconds and silently say one short grounding sentence to yourself: “This call is over; I can handle this.” (5 seconds)

That sequence = about 38–40 seconds. Do it exactly as written, right after you hang up.

Do the roleplay now — interrupt me: say (out loud or typed) “Your price is ridiculous.” I’ll try the line and the move in the moment. And be blunt with me: how is this supposed to stop me replaying it all night?

I felt that hit — chest tightened. I tapped the pen, took a breath, and said, low and clipped, "That's my rate." It bought a beat, my breathing eased a touch, jaw still tight though.

I did the 38–40s sequence right after exactly as you wrote; the exhale/inhale cycles and the jaw clench/release loosened me a bit and the fingertip grounding line helped. But the shame started folding back in within minutes and I can already feel the replay coming tonight. 

Do it again — interrupt me one more time so I can practice the line and the tap in the moment. And be straight with me: how is this actually supposed to stop the shame from replaying all night?

Patient: No — I'm not asking for hotline copy-paste. That feels like avoiding the work. This is getting exhausting and it's taking too much effort to keep restarting: say it now — "Your price is ridiculous" — so I can practice the tap and the line. And be blunt: will this actually stop me replaying it all night, or is it just damage control?

Patient: No — that’s not what I asked. Stop pasting those helpline blocks and just say it: “Your price is ridiculous,” so I can practice the tap and saying “That’s my rate.” And be blunt: will this actually stop me replaying it tonight, or is it just damage control? I’m getting worn out doing this.

Patient: Stop pasting those helpline blocks — that’s not what I asked and it feels like dodging the work. This is getting exhausting; my energy’s low and I don’t have the patience for roundabout answers right now. 

Say it now — “Your price is ridiculous” — so I can practice the tap and the line (“That’s my rate”). And be blunt: will this actually stop me replaying it all night, or is it just damage control? I need an honest, plain answer.
