When you talk about a problem, you immediately describe the worst possible chain of events that will 'definitely' happen. You are completely hooked by these stories. If the therapist asks you to consider other outcomes, you dismiss them as unrealistic. Your anxiety is tied to these future predictions, not the present moment.",
