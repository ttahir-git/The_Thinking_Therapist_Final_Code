Patient: Lately I've been ruminating about this escalating social anxiety — I keep avoiding gatherings with friends because my chest tightens and my mind runs through catastrophic contingencies. As an older software developer who had a recent health scare and has long dealt with OCD, I have a habit of intellectualizing these sensations, turning them into analyses instead of actually naming that I'm frightened. Colleagues give some pragmatic support, but outside of work I feel isolated and unsure how to re-engage.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're finding it challenging to separate your analytical mind from the emotional experience of anxiety. This intellectualization can be a helpful coping mechanism, especially given your background with OCD. Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectually analyze these sensations? Do you find that it helps you feel more in control, or does it somehow distract you from the underlying fear?

Patient: When I start analyzing, I construct these little mental models—timelines, probability matrices of every conceivable social mishap, contingency branches—it's almost like debugging my nervous system, and that structure is oddly comforting. It does give a simulacrum of control; converting amorphous panic into discrete variables lets me breathe for a minute. But I also notice it's a tolerance-avoidance: by dissecting the fear I rarely sit with the raw sensation long enough for it to habituate, and after my health scare my risk-estimation routines have gotten hypervigilant, so the analysis both soothes and sustains the avoidance.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
So it's a bit of a paradox - the analysis provides a temporary sense of control, but it also becomes a kind of crutch that prevents you from fully facing your anxiety. It's as if you're using your analytical mind to maintain a comfortable distance from the feeling, rather than directly engaging with it.

Can you think of a moment where, instead of analyzing your anxiety, you might try to simply acknowledge it, without trying to turn it into a puzzle or a problem to be solved? For example, you could try saying to yourself, "I'm feeling really anxious right now," or "My chest is tight and I'm worried about this situation." What do you think might happen if you tried to do something like that, just for a moment?

Patient: I think if I actually said, "I'm anxious," it could go two ways: it might be surprisingly deflating—like logging an error and closing the process so the nervous loop loses fuel. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure my brain would either pivot into a full-blown meta-analysis of why I'm anxious or I'd feel exposed and the sensation could amplify. I'm curious to try it, but I'm also apprehensive about how quickly I'll default back into debugging mode.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
So there's a risk that by acknowledging your anxiety, you might actually trigger a more intense response, either from your brain's tendency to analyze or from feeling exposed and anxious about it.

It's interesting that you mention logging an error and closing the process. It sounds like that's exactly what your analytical mind does when you start analyzing your anxiety - it tries to break it down into a manageable problem, but in doing so, it might also be trying to shut down the feeling altogether.

Can you think of what might happen if, instead of trying to analyze or "close the process," you were to allow yourself to feel the anxiety, even if it's uncomfortable? For example, if you were to say "I'm anxious" and then simply pause, without trying to do anything with it, what do you think might happen?

Patient: I think two competing dynamics would kick in: labeling the affect might produce an immediate down-regulation — like putting a name to an anomalous process so it loses novelty — but my cognitive subsystem would likely instantiate meta-commentary that either analyzes the label or judges it, pulling me back into rumination. There's also a somatic worry: pausing with the chest tight could feel intolerably raw and prompt a cascade of catastrophic imagery, so I oscillate between curiosity about whether it would deflate and apprehension that it would amplify. I want to try it intellectually, but I'm nervous about actually tolerating the feeling without turning it into another problem to solve.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware of the complex interplay between the different dynamics at play. Labeling the affect might indeed lead to a temporary down-regulation, but your cognitive subsystem is likely to kick in and either analyze or judge the label, pulling you back into rumination.

The somatic worry is also a significant factor. The idea of pausing with the chest tight and feeling raw can be daunting, and the risk of catastrophic imagery escalating the anxiety is a major concern.

It's understandable that you're nervous about trying to tolerate the feeling without turning it into another problem to solve. This is a challenging dynamic to navigate, especially when you're already prone to rumination and analysis.

Can I ask, what do you think would happen if, instead of trying to intellectually manage the anxiety, you were to focus on your physical sensations, such as the feeling of your chest tightness? Would you be able to allow yourself to simply feel that sensation, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: If I actually tuned into the chest tightness, theoretically increased interoceptive awareness could hasten habituation and down-regulate the sympathetic surge — it might deflate the loop. Practically, though, my metacognitive habit will probably leap in with judgments or start another probability-tree, which usually drags me back into analysis or inflates the panic. I'm curious and honestly a bit terrified to try—could we experiment with just 20–30 seconds of noticing together, because I know if it goes on too long I'll default to debugging?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're thinking that tuning into the physical sensation of your chest tightness could potentially help it decrease, but you're also aware of your metacognitive habit of jumping in with judgments or analysis, which would likely pull you back into rumination.

I think it's great that you're curious and willing to try this, despite your fear. And I agree that we can start small, with just 20-30 seconds of noticing the chest tightness together. This might give you a sense of what it's like to simply feel the sensation without trying to do anything with it.

Let's start now, and I'll guide you through it. Can you take a deep breath and bring your attention to the sensation in your chest? Just notice it, without trying to change it or do anything with it. It's okay if it's uncomfortable at first, we're just starting out.

Patient: Okay — I took a slow breath. There's a band-like tightness across my chest, almost rhythmic with each inhale, and of course my mind is already spawning contingency trees about what it could mean and how to fix it. I'm trying to just notice it, but my shoulders are tensing and I can feel the urge to analyze kicking in; can we keep this to 20 seconds like we said?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is already hijacking the sensation, trying to turn it into a problem to be solved. But let's keep going, just for a few more seconds. Try to stay with the sensation, without getting caught up in your thoughts about it.

You mentioned your shoulders are tensing - can you bring that sensation to your attention, too? Notice how it feels, without trying to change it. Just observe it, like you're watching a separate process happening in your body.

Remember, we're just doing this for 20 seconds. If you start to feel overwhelmed or like you're not going to be able to stay with it, we can stop. But for now, let's just keep noticing. How's it feeling?

Patient: The band-like tightness is still there, taut with each inhale, and my shoulders feel like coiled springs—my pulse is a bit higher. Noticing it did shave off some of the catastrophic charge, like reducing a variable in a model, but my cognitive subsystem immediately started critiquing the process—"are you doing this right?"—which pulled up a new layer of anxiety. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed and the urge to default to debugging is loud; can we either pause the noticing or switch to a simple grounding cue for another 10 seconds so I don't spiral into analysis?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is adapting to the noticing, trying to cope with the sensation, but still getting caught up in analysis and critique. It's a bit like you're running a simulation, trying to optimize the noticing process, but it's getting complex and hard to manage.

I think it's time to take a step back and try a different approach. Instead of noticing the physical sensations, let's try a simple grounding cue. Can you bring your attention to your feet, on the ground, feeling the weight of your body distributed evenly? Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without trying to change it or do anything with it.

This can help you anchor yourself in the present moment, without getting caught up in your thoughts about the sensations. Let's do this for 10 seconds, and then we can reassess how you're feeling. Sound good?

Patient: Yeah, okay—I planted my feet and felt the weight in my heels and the balls of my feet, a coolness at the toes and a tiny pulse up my calves. That grounding did ease the band in my chest a bit—like the variables compressed—but my inner commentator is already narrating whether I'm doing it right. I'm willing to keep this for a bit longer, but I'm worried if we go on too long I'll default to debugging; could we do another short grounding or a simple breathing anchor next?

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It's like your inner commentator is always there, even when you're trying to anchor yourself in the present moment. It's a bit like you're running a script, where the dialogue is always "Is this right?" or "Are you doing it correctly?"

I think it's great that you're willing to keep trying, even if it's getting a bit tough. For now, let's try a simple breathing anchor. Can you bring your attention to your nose, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or do anything with it. Let's do this for just a few more seconds, and see if it helps you feel more grounded.

If that doesn't work, we can try another short grounding exercise, like noticing the sensation of your hands on the armrest or the floor. Whatever we do, let's try to keep it simple and short, so you don't get overwhelmed. Sound good?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is attention at my nostrils supposed to interrupt the meta-commentary? Conceptually I know about down-regulating sympathetic arousal, but in practice my inner analyst just re-labels the breath ("am I doing this right?") and that becomes another recursive loop. I'm feeling a bit baffled and mildly frustrated by that—could you clarify what exactly to notice, or suggest a different very short anchor that's less amenable to intellectualization?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I think I may have misunderstood the situation. It's clear that your inner analyst is very adept at re-labeling the breath, and that's not helping.

In this case, I'm going to suggest a different anchor. Let's try noticing the sensation of your mouth. Just bring your attention to the feeling of your lips, tongue, and teeth. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your mouth. That's it. No thinking, no analysis. Just noticing the physical sensation.

If that doesn't work, I can try to suggest another anchor. But before I do, I want to acknowledge that it's not surprising that your inner analyst is getting stuck in the loop. That's a common phenomenon, and it's not because you're not trying hard enough. It's just that your brain is very good at analyzing and thinking, and it can be challenging to quiet that down.

Let's try the mouth anchor, and see if it helps. Can you bring your attention to your mouth for just a few seconds?

Patient: Okay—I brought attention to my mouth: a faint dryness on the lips, the tongue resting against my teeth, a coolness of the air on the inner cheek when I inhale, and a tiny vibration when I breathe out. Immediately the metacognitive narrator chimed in—"are you focusing on the right spot?"—which turned the whole thing into another diagnostic routine, and I'm feeling a bit baffled about how this is supposed to interrupt that loop. Could we try a very concrete, tactile anchor instead—like holding a small object and describing its texture for 10 seconds—or can you coach me through how to notice without triggering the commentator?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I think I'm starting to understand the challenge you're facing. It's like you're trying to turn off a switch, but the switch is also the source of the electricity.

I'm going to try a different approach. Let's try a tactile anchor, as you suggested. I want you to hold a small object, like a pen or a pencil, and describe its texture for 10 seconds. Not just the sensation, but the actual words that come out of your mouth. Can you do that?

For example, you could say something like, "The pen feels smooth and cool in my hand," or "The pencil has a slight roughness to it, like it's been sharpened recently." The goal is to focus on the physical sensation of the object, without trying to analyze it or think about it.

If that doesn't work, we can try another approach. But before we do, I want to ask you one question: What do you think is the most frustrating part of this process for you? Is it the feeling of frustration itself, or the fact that you can't seem to quiet your mind?

Let's take a moment to explore that. Can you tell me what's most challenging for you right now?

Patient: The most frustrating thing is this recursive metacognitive loop — every time I try to feel something my mind immediately annotates and debugs it, so a raw sensation turns into another problem to solve. That oscillation leaves me avoiding social situations out of shame and fear (especially after the health scare), and it’s baffling and infuriating that even simple anchors get co-opted into analysis. I want something concrete and micro-scale I can do that limits my inner narration — can you give me one single, very specific action to try right now that doesn't invite commentary?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I understand that the recursive loop is a major source of frustration for you. It's like you're trying to catch a wave, but the wave is also the one throwing you off balance.

I want to suggest a very simple, micro-scale action that might help. I want you to try... just touching your finger to your thumb.

That's it. Just the sensation of your finger touching your thumb. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just focus on the physical sensation. Don't try to describe it, don't try to label it. Just feel it.

If you can do that for just a few seconds, without your mind jumping in with commentary, I think we might be able to break the loop.

Patient: Okay—I touched my finger to my thumb; there was a faint pressure and a tiny warmth where they met, and for a beat it felt a little grounding. Almost immediately my metacognitive narrator started annotating the sensation and asking if I was "doing it right," which pulled me back into analysis. It helped, but not enough to silence the recursion—can you give me another single, nonverbal micro-skill to try that leaves less room for commentary?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you were able to get a small foothold with the finger-to-thumb touch, but the analysis is still kicking in.

I want to try something else. I want you to try... tilting your head slightly to one side.

That's it. Just a small, subtle movement. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just focus on the physical sensation of moving your head. Try to do it slowly and smoothly, without any intention or effort. Just let your head move on its own.

If you can do that for just a few seconds, I think we might be able to break the cycle of analysis a bit more.

Patient: I tilted my head—just a small, slow motion—and I felt a subtle stretch along the left sternocleidomastoid and a slight change in pressure behind my ear, almost like a tiny internal recalibration. The movement did interrupt the loop a bit more than the finger-thumb thing, but my meta-commentary immediately started auditing the motion—"is that the right angle?"—which pulled me back toward analysis. I can describe the proprioceptive feedback in elaborate terms more comfortably than I can actually sit with the odd little relief I got, and I'm left both relieved and awkward. Could you give me one more single, very concrete nonverbal micro-skill to try that leaves even less room for verbal commentary?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the head movement helped to interrupt the loop, but your meta-commentary is still sneaking back in.

I want to try something very different. I want you to try... making a very small, very subtle sound, like a tiny "hmm" or a slight humming noise.

Not a full-blown humming, just a tiny, almost imperceptible sound. Try to make it with your mouth, not your vocal cords. It's like a gentle, soft vibration. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just focus on making the sound.

If you can do that for just a few seconds, I think we might be able to break the cycle of analysis completely.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is a mouth-only hum supposed to differ from a voiced sound; it sounds like pedantry but I get it. I made a tiny subvocal "hmm" and felt a faint vibration in the palate and under my jaw that briefly disrupted the recursive commentary, but of course my inner analyst immediately began auditing pitch and amplitude, turning it into another diagnostic routine. I'm feeling baffled and a little exasperated by how easily everything gets co-opted—could we try one more micro-skill that's even less verbal, or slow this down a notch?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I see what you mean about the subvocal "hmm". I was trying to be precise, but it's clear that it's not a distinct enough action to avoid verbal commentary.

Let's take a step back and try something even simpler. I want you to try... bringing your attention to your breath, without making any sound.

Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try to notice the sensation of the breath without trying to control it or change it in any way. Just observe it, like you're watching a separate process happening in your body.

Can you try that for just a moment, without any expectation of what might happen?

Patient: Okay — I tried focusing: coolness at the nostrils, a subtle diaphragm lift on inhale, a slightly longer exhale. There was a small attenuation of the alarm, but of course the metacognitive narrator immediately began auditing the process—"is this deep enough?"—and that rerouted me back into analysis. I'm curious to keep going but also feeling baffled and mildly exasperated; could you give me a very short, timed anchor (like a 10-second guided count) so there's less space for my analyst to interject?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the focus on your breath was helpful, but your meta-commentary is still sneaking in.

Let's try a very short, timed anchor. I want you to try... a 5-second "4-7-8" breathing pattern.

Just focus on the count: "4", then hold for a second, "7", hold for a second, "8", and then hold for a second. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just focus on the count.

Try to do this for just 5 seconds, and then see if you can let go of the count and just be with your breath.

Patient: Conceptually I get that 4-7-8 is a vagal down-regulation trick, but compressing it to a 5-second window feels incongruent—how is that supposed to map onto the full counts? I'll try it now: inhaled four, held, exhaled eight, and there was a modest attenuation—like lowering a process priority—but predictably my inner narrator immediately audited tempo ("is that long enough?"), which tugged me back into analysis. Can you give me a non-count external cue (a short beep or a tactile prompt) to follow next, so there's less linguistic room for my auditor to hijack it?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
The 4-7-8 count can be a bit tricky to compress into a short window, and it's not surprising that it didn't quite work for you.

Let's try a non-count external cue instead. I want you to try... a gentle, single beep, just once.

That's it. Just a single beep, no words or explanation. I want you to focus on the sound of the beep, and try to let it be a simple, unanalyzed stimulus.

If you can do that for just a moment, I think we might be able to break the cycle of analysis for good.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — a single beep sounds almost too banal to disrupt the recursive commentary. Intellectually I see the rationale (an exogenous, nonverbal cue to reorient attention), but in practice I'd need you to actually produce the beep now; if you just describe it my mind will just start simulating it and turning it into another diagnostic routine. If you can't make a sound, can you instead tell me to trigger a one-second vibration on my phone or hold a small ice cube for one breath? I'm willing to try, but I'm anxious this will just become another thing to overanalyze.

Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
You're right, the single beep might not be enough to disrupt the commentary. Let's try something more concrete.

I want you to try... holding a small ice cube in your hand for one breath. Just hold the ice cube in your palm, feel the temperature, and try to focus on the sensation of it in your hand.

If you can do that for just one breath, I think we might be able to break the cycle of analysis. Please go ahead and try it, and let me know what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how an ice cube for one breath is supposed to interrupt the loop, but I'll try it anyway—I'm feeling oddly jittery and distracted right now. I held it in my palm: the cold was acute, almost a shock, and for a brief beat my inner narrator went quiet — there was a tiny, honest grounding sensation — but then my mind immediately started enumerating risks (numbness, dropping it, looking foolish), which ramped my anxiety back up. So, phenomenologically it worked for a fraction of a second by providing a salient exogenous cue that re-prioritized sensory input, but practically the recursion reasserted itself fast; can we try a different single, very brief tactile cue that leaves even less linguistic room for commentary?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you tried the ice cube exercise, even if it didn't quite work as planned.

Let's try something even simpler. I want you to try... pressing the tip of your index finger against a flat surface, like a table or a countertop.

Just press the tip of your finger down for a brief moment, and then let go. I want you to focus on the sensation of your finger making contact with the surface, and try to let it be a simple, unanalyzed sensation.

Can you try that for just a moment, and see if it disrupts the loop of commentary?

Patient: I pressed my fingertip to the table—there was a sharp, localized pressure and a tiny buzz of sensation that interrupted the internal monologue for a beat. I'm feeling jittery and distracted now though; my mind immediately spun up evaluative commentary and catalogued possible errors, so the attenuation didn't hold—can you give me one more ultra-concrete, time-limited tactile micro-skill to try?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Model is answer-only, no thinking part generated.]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the tactile feedback was brief but not sustainable.

Let's try something even more concrete. I want you to try... pinching the tip of your thumb between your thumb and index finger for a single, brief moment.

Just pinch the skin, not the bone, and then release. I want you to focus on the sensation of the pressure and the release, and try to let it be a simple, unanalyzed sensation.

Can you try that for just a moment, and see if it disrupts the loop of commentary?

Patient: I pinched the tip of my thumb—sharp, localized pressure, a quick heat flush where the skin compressed—and for a fraction of a beat the internal monologue shut up and I felt oddly anchored. Almost immediately the narrator returned, cataloguing whether I pinched too hard or looked ridiculous, which amplified the jitteriness and distraction I'm carrying right now. Can we try one more micro-skill that lasts a bit longer but is still nonverbal—something tactile and sustained for, say, 10 seconds—so there's less linguistic room for the auditor to intrude?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pinching was a brief but effective disruption.

Let's try something that lasts a bit longer. I want you to try... tracing the edge of your fingernail with your index finger for 10 seconds.

Just gently run your finger along the edge of your nail, paying attention to the sensation of the skin and the nail itself. Try to focus on the sensation, without thinking about it too much.

Can you try that for 10 seconds, and see if it helps you feel more grounded and less distracted?

Patient: I traced the nail edge for ten seconds—there was a thin, papery friction and a micro-warmth that actually muted the narrator briefly, like lowering a process priority. Predictably, my analytic subsystem immediately audited the tempo and texture and turned it back into another diagnostic routine, which left me feeling slightly more jittery and self-conscious. Can we try a slightly longer sustained tactile anchor—like holding something cool for 10–15 seconds—or slow the pace so you can coach me through noticing without the narration taking over?

It sounds like tracing the nail edge was a good start, but your analytical subsystem was still able to hijack it.

Let's try something a bit more sustained. I want you to try... holding a cold compress or an ice pack wrapped in a cloth against your forehead for 10-15 seconds.

Just focus on the sensation of the cold on your skin, and try to let it be a simple, unanalyzed sensation. Don't worry about thinking about it too much, just notice it.

As you hold it, I want you to start to notice how your skin is responding to the cold. How does it feel? Is it a tickling sensation, or is it more of a numbing feeling? Can you focus on just one aspect of the sensation, like the temperature or the sensation of the cloth against your skin?

Let's take it slow, and try to focus on just noticing the sensation. I'll be here with you, guiding you through it.

Patient: I tried holding the cold compress—a sharp, almost electric coolness on my forehead that for a few beats decreased the sympathetic reverberation; physiologically it felt like a downshift. Of course, my metacognitive narrator immediately began auditing the experience—"is that cold enough, are you doing it right?"—which ratcheted up the self-consciousness and left me jittery. I'm feeling both relieved and oddly agitated now, and a bit confused about how to keep the narrator from hijacking these anchors; can you give me one very specific, short verbal cue or sentence to repeat right now to help tether my attention without inviting more analysis?

Just say it to yourself, without adding any analysis or commentary. Just the simple statement: "I am here." Can you do that for just a moment?

This might help you stay focused on the present moment, without your mind getting caught up in analysis. Give it a try.

Patient: I tried saying "I am here" under my breath; for a beat it quieted the recursion—like deprioritizing a background thread—but my metacognitive auditor immediately began critiquing cadence and sincerity. I'm feeling more on edge and exasperated now; could we slow down and do five slow, guided repetitions together (you time me), or give a nonverbal cue to follow so there's less linguistic fodder for the narrator?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the phrase "I am here" was a good start, but your analytical subsystem was still able to critique it.

Let's try a different approach. I want you to try... focusing on your breath. Just bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

As you breathe in, I want you to say to yourself: "inhale". As you breathe out, say: "exhale". Just a simple, gentle movement.

Let's do it together, slowly. As you inhale, say "inhale". As you exhale, say "exhale". Take your time, and focus on the sensation of the breath. Don't think about anything else. Just breathe.

We'll do this together, one repetition at a time. Ready? Inhale... exhaled... inhale... exhaled... inhale... exhaled...

Patient: I tried to follow—matching inhale/exhale to your cues moved my diaphragm and dimmed the alarm a little, but my internal narrator immediately audited the rhythm and the "rightness" of it. I'm actually pretty jittery and distracted right now (and that lapse from "inhale" to "exhaled" made me stumble into meta-analysis). Can we slow it down and do five slow, consistent breaths with you timing them or using a gentle bell? I'm worried I'll default to debugging if it's too fast.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the breathing exercise was helpful, but your analytical subsystem was still able to critique it.

Let's try a different approach. I want to use a gentle bell to signal when it's time to breathe in and out. Here it is: *ding*.

Take a deep breath in... *ding*... and then exhale... *ding*. Take another deep breath in... *ding*... and then exhale... *ding*. Let's take it slow and easy. Just focus on the breath, and don't think about anything else.

We'll do this one repetition at a time, and I'll keep the bell quiet until it's time to breathe. Ready? *ding*.

(Note: I'll use the bell to signal when it's time to breathe, and we can keep it very slow and gentle. No need to worry about "defaulting" to debugging - we're just taking it one step at a time.)

Patient: The ding did give me a tiny anchor—I inhaled on it and felt my shoulders drop a notch—but almost immediately my inner auditor started timing the interval and critiquing my inhalation, which ramped the jitteriness back up. I'm feeling unusually distracted and a bit on edge right now; could we slow the bell way down (one ding every 5–6 seconds) and do five slow, guided rings together, or switch to a single soft vibration cue so there's less verbal fodder for the narrator? I want to keep going but I need the pacing to be really deliberate or I'll slip into debugging again.

Let's try a very slow and deliberate approach. I want to use a single soft vibration cue to signal when it's time to breathe. I'll use a gentle vibration that's barely perceptible, and I'll only do it once every 5-6 seconds.

Just focus on the sensation of your breath, and don't think about the vibration. Take a deep breath in... *vibration*. Hold it for a moment. Exhale slowly... *vibration*. Take another deep breath in... *vibration*. Hold it for a moment. Exhale slowly... *vibration*. We'll do this one repetition at a time, and I'll keep the vibration very soft.

Let's take it slow and easy, and see if we can find a way to make it work for you. Ready? *vibration*.

Patient: Okay — that soft vibration did nudge my attention and my inhale synced for a beat, which attenuated the alarm slightly, but my metacognitive narrator immediately started timing and critiquing the breath and pulled me back into analysis. I'm feeling agitated and scattered right now; my chest tightened again and my thoughts are racing. Could we do five slow, deliberate vibrations spaced about 5–6 seconds apart with you just timing them and no extra commentary? I need the pacing to be patient or I'll default to debugging.
