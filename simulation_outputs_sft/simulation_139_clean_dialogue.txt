Patient: Hi, I'm an older data scientist and lately I've been worrying constantly about my performance at work. I find myself procrastinating because I'm scared of not being good enough, and then that makes the worry worse. I guess I'm just tired of feeling stuck like this.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start working on a task at work? What's the first thing that goes through your mind, and how does that affect your ability to focus?

Patient: When I start a task, the first thought is usually that I’m going to mess it up or it won’t be good enough. That makes me hesitate — I’ll keep fiddling with small parts, reopen old analyses, or get lost in my inbox instead of making progress. I guess that just feeds the worry and makes it harder to focus. I don't know, it's like the more I try to force it, the more everything scatters.

Therapist: It sounds like the more you try to control the task, the more your mind is spinning. What if, instead of trying to control every detail, you were to give yourself permission to just start working on the task, even if it's just for a minute or two? What would happen if you were to commit to working on that one part of the task, without any specific outcome in mind, just for the sake of making progress?

Patient: I don't know — I guess in theory that sounds okay. If I tried it, I'd probably still stall, tell myself a minute isn't enough, or get pulled into my inbox. Maybe it would help a bit to break the perfectionism, but I worry it would just feel like slacking. Can you help me figure out how to actually stick to one minute without spiraling?

Therapist: Let's start with something even simpler than one minute. Can you commit to just opening up your project folder or turning to the next slide for the next 30 seconds, without doing anything else? Just getting your eyes on the task for that brief moment. What would you have to do to make yourself stop after 30 seconds? Would you look away, or try to focus on something else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could at least open the project folder for 30 seconds. I'd probably set a timer on my phone so there's a clear stopping point, and then look away or make a cup of tea when it rings. But I'm worried it'll feel pointless and I'll just drift to my inbox instead; I don't know if that would actually help.

Therapist: It sounds like having a clear stopping point with the timer could help you feel more grounded. Instead of worrying about it feeling pointless, what if, for the first 30 seconds, you simply told yourself, "I'm going to open this project folder and look at what's here. I'm not going to do anything else yet." Just observe what's in front of you, without judgment. Can you commit to that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try opening the folder and setting a 30‑second timer. I'm worried I'll just drift to my inbox though. Could you stay with me while I do it, or give me something small to focus on so I don't wander?

Therapist: Let's take a minute to get you set up. I'll be right here beside you. When you open the folder and set the timer for 30 seconds, I'll ask you a simple question every 10 seconds to help you stay focused. We'll start with this: Just look at the first thing that catches your eye. What's the first thing you see when you open the folder?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the first thing is a Jupyter notebook called "modeling.ipynb" and a folder named "old_runs." Seeing them makes my chest tighten and I already want to check my inbox.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and just acknowledge that feeling of tension. It's okay to feel that way when seeing familiar things that might be triggering. Now, I want you to notice just one thing more about that "modeling.ipynb" Jupyter notebook. What's the first thing that stands out to you about the title of this notebook?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's the word "modeling." It sounds imposing, like there's an expectation to produce something perfect, and that just makes me freeze up a bit.

Therapist: Let's just observe that thought for a moment. Can you notice how your body is responding to that word "modeling"? How are you sitting, breathing? Just take a moment to explore that physical sensation. What if, for just one more second, you didn't have to think about the word "modeling" being imposing? What if you could just observe it as a word, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow when I see "modeling." My shoulders hunch and my hands curl, and I immediately want to look at something else, like my inbox. Can we slow down? I don't know if I can stay with this for long, it feels kind of overwhelming.

Therapist: Let's slow down, take a deep breath together. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. We can take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Can we stop the timer for just a second and take a few more deep breaths together? When you're ready, we can start again, even if it's just for a short moment. We don't have to try to do a lot at once. What do you need in this moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I need you to just stay with me and keep it simple. Maybe guide me through a few slow breaths and ask one small, easy thing every ten seconds so I don't drift to my inbox.

Therapist: Let's take a slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... How are you feeling right now, just physically? Is there anything you notice in your body, like a sensation or a feeling?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest feels tight and my breathing's shallow. My shoulders are hunched and my hands feel a bit clenched. Can you keep guiding the breaths? I'm worried I'll check my inbox if you stop.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice that, for a second. No need to think about anything else.

Patient: I don't know — my feet feel planted but kind of heavy, like I'm bracing. There's this sudden shame and frustration under it that makes me want to run to my inbox, and my chest is still tight. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? I don't want to drift away from this.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you gently acknowledge the sensation of shame and frustration that you're feeling right now, without trying to push it away or judge it? Just notice that it's there, for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how just noticing it helps. I guess I can feel the shame and frustration — a tightness in my chest and this hot knot that makes me want to escape to my inbox. It's uncomfortable and I don't like staying with it. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? I don't want to drift away, but this is getting a bit overwhelming.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... As you breathe out, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm feeling this." Just say it, "I'm feeling this." It doesn't matter what it is, just say it. Can you do that for me, just for one more second?

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how saying that helps, but... I'm feeling this. It’s like a hot knot in my chest and I get this rush to check my inbox, and honestly it makes me want to look away. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? This is getting a bit heavy and I need you to stay with me.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... As you breathe out, I want you to bring your attention to your feet, just for a moment. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on the ground. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth. Can you feel that for a second?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my feet feel planted but heavy. The roots image makes me oddly embarrassed and that hot knot in my chest tightens, like I should just run to my inbox. I'm not sure I follow how imagining roots helps. Can we just keep doing slow breaths and have you ask one small thing every now and then so I don't drift?

Therapist: Let's take a slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... As you breathe out, can you think about the sensation of your chest for a second? Is it heavy, light, warm, cool? Just notice that feeling, for now.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's heavy and tight, kind of warm, like a hot weight sitting on my chest. There's this shame and frustration under it that makes me want to bolt to my inbox. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that helps, but can we keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small thing every now and then so I don't drift?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you bring your attention to your breath for just this one question: What is the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body right now? Just notice that, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: I don't know — I guess the air feels shallow, cool going in and a bit warm coming out, but it's all a bit tight, like it's stuck against that hot knot in my chest. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing it helps; there's a shame and frustration that keeps pulling me toward my inbox. Can we just keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small, easy thing every now and then so I don't drift?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you see the space in front of you? Is it empty, or is there something in it? Just notice that, for now.

Patient: I don't know — I guess the space looks mostly empty, but it feels crowded by that hot knot of shame and frustration I keep carrying. I'm not sure I follow how noticing the space helps. Can we just keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small, easy thing every now and then so I don't drift to my inbox?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you find one place on your body where you don't feel the hot knot of shame or frustration right now? Just one spot, even if it's just a small area. Notice how that feels, for a second.

Patient: I don't know — I guess my fingertips feel a little cool and numb, like a tiny pocket away from that hot knot of shame and frustration. It's faint and I'm already worrying it'll vanish, so can we keep doing the slow breaths and you ask one small, easy thing next?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Notice the sensation in your fingertips again, just for a second. Can you focus on the feeling of it being there, without thinking about it disappearing or when it will come back? Just observe it, as it is.

Patient: I don't know — I guess my fingertips are still a bit cool, like a small quiet spot away from that hot knot. But the shame and frustration flares up as soon as I notice it and makes me want to check my inbox. Can we keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small, easy thing next?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you observe what happens when you notice the sensation of calm in your fingertips? What does the shame and frustration feel like when you notice it? Try to stay with it for just a moment, without trying to push it away or move on to something else.

Patient: I don't know — I guess when I notice the calm in my fingertips, the shame and frustration gets louder, like a hot knot pressing harder next to that quiet spot. It feels hot and tight and makes me want to bolt to my inbox. I'm not sure I follow how staying with it helps, but can we keep the slow breaths and have you ask one small thing so I don't drift?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you describe the sensation of the shame and frustration when it gets louder, like a hot knot pressing harder next to the quiet spot in your fingertips? What does it feel like in your body, exactly? Try to use as many details as you can, without thinking about what to do with them.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it feels like a hot knot right under my breastbone, like something tightening and pulling my breathing shallow. My face gets warm, my hands curl up like they're trying to hold something in, and there's this sick, metal taste in my mouth with a rush of thoughts — like error logs scrolling and telling me I'm failing. It's... it's getting a bit much, honestly; can we keep the slow breaths and small questions so I don't bolt to my inbox?

Therapist: Let's take a pause together for just a moment. 1... 2... 3... I want you to know that you're doing a great job of describing this intense feeling. It's completely normal to feel like you're getting overwhelmed right now. Can you just take one more slow breath with me? 1... 2... 3... As you exhale, allow yourself to feel the sensation of the breath leaving your body. Notice how your body feels for just a second, before we continue.

Patient: I don't know — I took the breath. For a moment it felt a bit lighter, but my chest's still heavy, my shoulders are tight, and that metallic taste is back. It's getting a bit much, so can we keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small, easy question every now and then so I don't bolt to my inbox?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 5... Can you observe the metallic taste in your mouth right now, without trying to think about it or what it means? Just notice how it feels, where it is, and what it's like. No need to change it or do anything with it, just observe it as it is.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's a sharp, coppery taste at the back of my tongue, a bit bitter and drying my mouth. It makes my stomach flip and that hot knot of shame feel louder, and honestly I want to run to my inbox. Can we keep the slow breaths going and have you ask one small, easy thing next so I don't drift?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 5... Can you notice where your body feels the most tense right now? Is it in your shoulders, chest, or somewhere else? Just acknowledge the sensation, without trying to change it or move on to something else. Notice it exactly as it is.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's mostly my chest and shoulders. My shoulders are hunched, my chest feels like that hot knot, my jaw's clenched and my hands curl up, my stomach's flipping with this shame buzzing under it. Can we keep the slow breaths and you ask one small thing so I don't drift to my inbox?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 5... Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now, without thinking about anything else? Just the feeling of your feet, the weight of your body, and the sensation of the ground beneath you. No need to do anything with it, just observe it.

Patient: I don't know — I guess my feet feel planted but kind of heavy, like I'm bracing. There's that hot knot of shame under everything and I'm not sure I follow how noticing my feet helps, so can we just keep the slow breaths and you ask one small, easy thing now so I don't drift to my inbox?

Therapist: It's okay if you're not sure how noticing your feet helps right now. Sometimes, it's just about paying attention to what's happening in the present moment. Can you just look at me for a second, without thinking about your feet or anything else? Just a glance, and then we can go back to your breath and body sensations if you'd like.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can look for a second. My eyes meet you and my chest tightens; it feels embarrassing and makes me want to check my inbox. Can we go back to the slow breaths and have you ask one small, easy thing now so I don't drift?
