--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an older student and lately I feel totally stuck — like my identity is just "student" and after a recent health scare I can't figure out what matters beyond that. I’m creative and sensitive but riddled with self-doubt, and I keep circling the same thoughts without any direction. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses feeling stuck and uncertain about their identity, with a recent health scare as a trigger. Core emotion seems to be self-doubt. Goal: Explore how the patient's skepticism might be connected to their current state of being stuck.

Therapist Answer:
Your skepticism is understandable, especially given the complexity of your concerns. It's natural to wonder how talking about these feelings will change anything. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "circling the same thoughts" without direction? Are there any specific thoughts or emotions that come up for you when you're feeling stuck?

Patient: Mostly it's this replay in my head: "Am I only useful as a student? What happens after this degree? Am I just wasting time?" When that starts I get hollow and anxious, or numb, and I can't commit to anything because I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop after the health scare. I've tried lists, hobbies, even therapy before — how is talking about it supposed to actually change those automatic loops?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a recurring thought loop centered around their perceived usefulness as a student and the fear of uncertainty after graduation. This has led to feelings of anxiety, numbness, and avoidance. The goal is to understand how the patient views the potential benefits of discussing these thoughts. Goal: Introduce an ACT process to help explore and challenge the automatic loop.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're not looking for a way to avoid these thoughts, but rather a way to break free from their grip. Can you try something with me? When you notice that loop starting, where you're thinking "Am I only useful as a student?", I want you to pause for just a second before jumping into that place. Just notice the thought as it arises, without judgment. Then, take one small step back and ask yourself: What would it take, just for this one moment, for you to do something other than worry about that? Maybe it's just taking a deep breath, or getting up to get a glass of water. What's the smallest thing you can do to create some space from this loop?

Patient: I can try pausing — maybe just one slow breath — but honestly, how is that supposed to help when I've replayed the same panic for months? Getting up for water or taking five seconds away feels almost performative, like I'm pretending to feel better. Still, I can try a single breath and see if it breaks the spiral for one moment, though I really doubt it'll fix anything long-term.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is skeptical about the effectiveness of pausing for a single breath, feeling that it might be more performative than helpful. They've been stuck in this cycle for months, and it's hard to see how one moment of respite will change anything. Goal: Introduce the concept of "defusion" to help the patient develop a different relationship with their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your skepticism, and it's natural to feel that way, especially after months of struggling. The goal isn't to make you feel better immediately or to magically "fix" everything. It's to explore how you can develop a different relationship with your thoughts, particularly the one that says "I'm pretending to feel better." Can you try to notice that thought, just for a moment, without judging it? Notice how it arises, how you experience it, and what it sounds like. Try to defuse it, just a little bit, by acknowledging it without trying to change it or get rid of it. You can say to yourself, "Okay, my mind is having this thought right now, 'I'm pretending to feel better.' That's an interesting thought. It's showing up, and I can acknowledge it." No more, just a tiny acknowledgment. What happens when you do that?

Patient: When I try that, one slow breath sometimes loosens the tightness for a second, but almost immediately the thought sneaks back and the panic ramps up again. It feels like a tiny, temporary pause — not a real solution. How is that supposed to help when this has been going on for months and I keep sliding back?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a temporary respite, but it's quickly followed by the return of the thought loop and increased panic. They feel like this is not a sustainable solution and are struggling to make progress. Goal: Introduce the concept of "value-based action" to help the patient re-engage with their goals and values.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the pause might be small, but it's something. It's a start. Instead of trying to make the pause last or focusing solely on getting rid of the thought, let's talk about what you're trying to achieve here. What matters most to you right now? What's driving this sense of panic? Can you think about what you want to create more space for, in this moment? What's the smallest, most important step you can take to move towards what's meaningful to you? Not necessarily getting rid of the thought, but taking an action that feels connected to your values and goals. What's one tiny step you could take in this moment to start moving in a direction that feels more aligned with what's important to you?

Patient: I think what matters is feeling like I'm more than a student — having some sense of creativity and connection, not just surviving exams and appointments. The panic comes from the uncertainty after the health scare and this nagging fear that if I'm not constantly productive as a student I won't matter. Maybe a tiny step is spending ten minutes today doing something creative — sketching or writing one paragraph about something I'd like to try after graduation — though honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'm skeptical it'll stick, but I can try it and tell you how it goes.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a sense of purpose and connection as what matters most, feeling unfulfilled as a solely student-focused individual. They've also acknowledged the root cause of their panic: uncertainty and fear of not being productive after graduation. A small, creative step has been proposed to help re-engage with their goals and values. Goal: Encourage the patient to commit to taking action, even with skepticism, and explore how this small step might be a starting point for change.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're willing to give this a try, even with some skepticism. That's a great starting point. I'm not expecting you to magically change or stick to it, but I want to help you understand what might happen if you take this small step. Before we go, I just want to say that it's okay to take a small risk like this. It's not about making a huge commitment, but rather taking a tiny step into a new direction. If you're feeling overwhelmed, we can always explore other options, but for now, let's try this small creative step. Can you commit to spending just 10 minutes today doing something creative, like sketching or writing about something you'd like to try after graduation? It doesn't have to be perfect, it's just about taking a tiny step in a new direction. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the ten minutes today — I’ll set a timer and either sketch or write a paragraph. But I’m really skeptical it’ll help long-term; how is ten minutes of making something supposed to change this constant panic about purpose? And what if I sit down and can’t do anything — what do I do then? I don’t want to just fail at this too.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is cautiously committing to taking a small creative step, but still harbors skepticism about its long-term impact. They're also worried about potential failure, which could exacerbate their anxiety. Goal: Introduce a gentle, ACT-inspired response to help the patient build confidence and develop a more flexible mindset.

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel skeptical, especially when it comes to something like this. But here's the thing: it's not about creating a masterpiece or achieving perfection. It's about taking a tiny step into a new direction, just for 10 minutes. What if, instead of feeling overwhelmed, you started to feel something else? Like curiosity, or interest, or even just a slight sense of calm? That's not failing, that's just showing up. What if, after 10 minutes, you're still stuck, and that's okay? What if you take a deep breath, and instead of getting frustrated, you say to yourself, "It's okay, I'm not going to create something now. I'm just going to take a deep breath, and be with this feeling for a moment"? You can do that, right there. And then, after a moment, you can look at the timer, and say, "Okay, I've done 10 minutes. What now?" That's not failing, that's just moving forward.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the ten minutes, I really will, but I’m still doubtful it’ll change anything meaningful. If I sit down and nothing comes — blank page, can’t sketch, just more panic — what do I do in that moment besides get frustrated? And more broadly, how is doing ten minutes a day supposed to lead to feeling like more than a student — where’s the bridge from tiny steps to real identity change?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling with skepticism and doubt, despite their commitment to taking the small creative step. They're worried about feeling stuck and frustrated, and are looking for a clear bridge from tiny steps to meaningful identity change. Goal: Introduce a more nuanced understanding of the process, emphasizing the importance of acceptance and exploration.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel stuck, and to worry that nothing will come out. That's not a failure, that's just being present. When you sit down and nothing comes, instead of getting frustrated, try to notice what's happening in your body. Where are you feeling the tension? Take a deep breath into that tension, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm exactly as I am right now." Don't try to force anything, just be with what is. And then, after a moment, gently ask yourself, "What's the one thing I'm feeling right now?" It might be something small, like a hint of curiosity, or a tiny sense of calm. That's okay. That's a start. Now, how do you take this tiny insight and what you're feeling right now, and use it to inform your next step? You don't need to create a masterpiece, but you can start to explore what's emerging for you, and how you can use that to move forward. The bridge from tiny steps to real identity change isn't about finding a specific solution, it's about being open to the process itself, and allowing yourself to be shaped by it.

Patient: Alright — I can try noticing the body and being with the blankness instead of forcing something, but honestly that sounds like permission to do nothing and I’m terrified it’ll just become another thing I beat myself up over. If I do sit there and nothing comes, can you give me a concrete fallback — like a simple prompt or a tiny, specific task to do in that moment instead of “be with it”? And one more thing: how long am I supposed to keep doing these tiny steps before I should expect to feel like more than just a student — weeks, months? I’m skeptical, but I’ll try if there’s a clearer plan.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the idea of simply "being with" the blankness, feeling it might be too passive or even a form of avoidance. They're also looking for a more concrete fallback plan, and are wondering when they can expect to see meaningful change. Goal: Introduce a more specific, grounded approach to help the patient build confidence and momentum.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concerns, and it's natural to want a more concrete plan. Here's what I want to offer: when you sit down and feel stuck, instead of just "being with it", try this: take one small, deliberate breath, and then look at the blank page or paper. Just look at it. Not at the clock, not at your hands, just at the page. Take in the texture, the color, the shape of the blank space. Then, I want you to write a single word. Just one word. It can be anything: "begin", "pause", "start", or even just a single letter. Write it down, and then stop. That's it. One word. One small action. And if you're worried that this is still too much, or that you're just going through the motions, then take it a step further: when you write that word, take a small, physical action. Like, pick up a pen, or a pencil, or even just tap your foot. Just something small, tangible, and physical. This isn't about creating art, or producing something meaningful right now. It's about taking one small, concrete step, and acknowledging that you're taking action. As for how long to keep doing these tiny steps, I want you to focus on the process, not the outcome. There's no specific timeline for when you should expect to feel like more than just a student. It's not about achieving some sort of specific goal, but about showing up, day after day, and taking small, deliberate steps towards exploring your creativity and identity. Can you try that, and see how it goes?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the one-word thing today and do a tiny physical action with it, timer set. I’m still doubtful it’ll change anything, but I can force myself to look at the page. If after a week or two I feel the same, what should I do differently? And how will I even know if it’s helping — what small signs should I watch for so I don’t just keep beating myself up about “not improving”?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is committed to trying the one-word approach, and is considering their next steps if they don't see improvement. They're also wondering how to measure success and avoid self-criticism. Goal: Introduce a flexible, iterative approach to help the patient build confidence and develop a growth mindset.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try the one-word approach. Remember, it's not about achieving some specific goal or outcome. It's about showing up and taking small, deliberate steps towards exploring your creativity and identity. If, after a week or two, you're feeling the same way, don't worry. That's not a failure. That's just an opportunity to reflect on what's working and what's not. Here's what I want you to do: take a step back, and ask yourself some questions. What's been the most challenging part of this process so far? What's been working for you, and what's been feeling like a struggle? What's one thing you could try differently? Maybe it's changing the physical action, or the type of word you write. Maybe it's trying a different prompt, or a different environment. Maybe it's taking a break, and coming back to it later. The point is, you need to be willing to experiment, to try new things, and to adapt. And as for how to measure success, I want you to focus on small signs, not big ones. Don't wait for some grand, dramatic transformation. Look for tiny, subtle changes. Are you feeling more confident? More curious? More open to new ideas? Are you enjoying the process more, or feeling more frustrated? These are the signs that you're on the right track. Not that you're some kind of "expert" or "success", but that you're showing up, and taking small, deliberate steps towards exploring your creativity and identity. Can you try that, and see how it goes?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the one-word thing and the tiny action for a week, timer set. But I’m still worried about how I’ll actually notice progress — what exactly should I look for day-to-day so I don’t just beat myself up for “not improving”? If two weeks passes and I feel the same (or worse), can we have a concrete plan B — like a different kind of prompt, or a short social thing to try — because I don’t want this to just become another checklist of failures. Also… how is this supposed to help me stop feeling like time’s slipping and I’ll never be more than a student?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is committed to trying the one-word approach and is concerned about how to measure progress. They're also worried about how the process will help them address their feeling of time slipping away. Goal: Introduce a more nuanced understanding of progress and a concrete plan B to help the patient stay motivated and focused.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concerns about measuring progress. It's natural to feel that way, especially when it comes to something as personal as your creativity and identity. Here's what I want you to know: progress isn't always linear. It's not about making some grand, dramatic change from one day to the next. It's about small, subtle shifts that can add up over time. So, instead of looking for some specific outcome, try to focus on your day-to-day experience. Are you feeling more present? More engaged? More curious? Are you enjoying the process more, or feeling more frustrated? These are the signs that you're on the right track. Not that you're some kind of "expert" or "success", but that you're showing up, and taking small, deliberate steps towards exploring your creativity and identity.

As for how to notice progress, try to focus on how you're feeling, rather than what you're doing. Ask yourself, "How am I feeling right now?" or "What's the most interesting thing that's happened to me today?" Try to tune in to your emotions, and see if you can identify any patterns or shifts. Are you feeling more anxious, or more relaxed? Are you feeling more creative, or more stuck?

Now, about plan B. If two weeks pass and you're feeling the same (or worse), we can definitely explore some new options. Here's what I want to suggest: try a different kind of prompt. Instead of a one-word prompt, try a short phrase or a sentence. Something like, "I wonder what it would be like to...", or "I'm curious about...". Try to come up with something that genuinely interests you, and see where it takes you.

Another idea is to try a short social interaction. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something small. Try to connect with someone you know, whether it's a friend, family member, or even just a stranger. It could be as simple as sending a text message, making a phone call, or meeting up for a coffee. Sometimes, just being around other people can help us feel more connected, more engaged, and more inspired.

As for how this is

Patient: Okay, but I need a clearer answer — how is trying different prompts or a quick coffee with someone actually going to stop that gnawing feeling that time’s slipping and I’m only a student? Give me two concrete fallback prompts I can use if the one-word thing fails, and one very low-risk social task I could realistically do this week (like exact wording for a text). Also, if after two weeks nothing shifts, what exactly will we change — what measurable things should I track so I’m not just beating myself up? And in the moment my panic spikes or my health anxiety flares, can you give me a 15–30 second script or grounding step I can use that feels less like performative breathing and more actually useful? I’m trying to stay open but I’m honestly overwhelmed and skeptical — can you be specific right now?

[Thinking and Answer keywords missing]

Therapist Answer:
I apologize if my previous responses were unclear or overwhelming. I'm here to help you in a concrete way.

First, let's address your question about how trying different prompts or a quick coffee with someone can help with the feeling of time slipping away. It may seem unrelated at first, but here's the idea: when you're feeling stuck or uncertain about your future, it's easy to get caught up in catastrophic thinking about what might happen if you don't make progress. These thoughts can create a sense of anxiety and unease that's hard to shake.

By engaging in activities that help you feel more present and connected to the moment, you can begin to break free from these negative thought patterns. This can include trying different prompts, which can help you think more creatively and gain new insights. It can also include social interactions, which can help you feel more connected to others and less isolated.

Now, here are two concrete fallback prompts you can use if the one-word thing fails:

1. "What's the most interesting thing I've noticed about this place/this activity/this moment so far?"
2. "What's one thing I'm looking forward to doing/achieving/exploring in the next hour/day/week?"

And here's a low-risk social task you could realistically do this week:

"Hey Sarah, I'm grabbing a coffee on my way to class. Want to meet me at 10 am in the student union? Just thought it would be good to catch up and chat about something other than exams."

As for what to track if after two weeks nothing shifts, here are some measurable things you could consider:

* How many times per day do you notice yourself thinking "I'm only a student" or "Time is slipping away"? Write it down each time.
* How many days in a row do you feel anxious or on edge? Track it.
* How many times per week do you engage in creative activities (e.g. drawing, writing, etc.)? Track it.

If your panic spikes or your health anxiety flares, here's a 15-30 second script or grounding step you can use:

"Okay, I'm here. I'm standing. I'm breathing. I can feel my feet on the ground. I can see my hands. I'm not going anywhere. Just one breath. In. Out. In. Out. I'm going to focus on this breath. I'm going to bring my attention to it. I'm going to let go of the thought. Just for 10

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the two prompts and that coffee text, but I'm still dubious it’ll stop the panic about time slipping. The grounding script cut off — can you finish a 15–30 second version I can actually say when panic spikes, something short and concrete that doesn’t feel fake? Also, can you give me one even lower-risk social text (like, “Hey — grabbing a coffee, 10 min? No pressure”)? And about tracking the “I’m only a student” counts — am I trying to reduce the number, or just notice them? I’m worried tracking will just make me obsess more.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking and Answer keywords missing]

Therapist Answer:
I apologize for the incomplete grounding script. Here's a revised 15-30 second version:

"I'm here. I'm now. I'm breathing. Where's my hand? (looks down) Where's my foot? (looks down) I can feel my feet on the ground. I can see my hands. I'm here. I'm present. Just this moment."

This script aims to help you focus on the present moment, using your senses to bring you back to reality.

For a lower-risk social text, here's an example:

"Hey, just wanted to grab a coffee and chat for a bit. No agenda, just conversation."

This text is even more casual and low-pressure than the previous one.

Regarding tracking the "I'm only a student" counts, I apologize for the confusion. Your goal is not to reduce the number, but to simply notice when you think the phrase. You can track it as a frequency (e.g., how many times you think it per day), but focus more on the act of noticing rather than trying to change the frequency. If you start to obsess more, try to take a step back and remind yourself that you're just trying to be more aware of your thoughts, not to change them.

Remember, the goal is to build awareness and develop a more compassionate relationship with your thoughts, not to try to control or eliminate them.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try the prompts and the casual text, but I’m worn out by all this and still skeptical — how is a 10‑second grounding line really going to stop the panic when my body flips into health-anxiety?

Give me an even shorter 10‑second script I can say silently that feels real (something like “feet down — breath in 3 — out 3 — I’m here”), plus one single-sentence response I can use right after I notice “I’m only a student” so I don’t get stuck obsessing about the tally.

If after two weeks nothing shifts, give me two concrete plan‑B options — one super low‑risk social thing I can actually do (exact wording for a text) and one activity-based experiment (exact steps, time, and what counts as “done”) — name them so I don’t have to decide in the moment.

Finally, tell me exactly what to track each day (two simple numbers max) and how we’ll look at them so I don’t turn tracking into another thing to beat myself up about.

Therapist Answer:
I'll provide you with a concise response.

**10-second grounding script:**
"Feet down, breathe in, out. I'm present."

This script is short, simple, and focused on bringing you back to the present moment.

**Single-sentence response to "I'm only a student":**
"I've got this. One task at a time."

This response aims to help you refocus on the present moment and the task at hand, rather than getting stuck on the thought.

**Plan-B options:**

1. **Low-risk social text:** "Hey, need a ride home tonight? I'll pick you up at 7."
2. **Activity-based experiment:** "Mindful drawing exercise: Spend 20 minutes drawing an object without thinking about it. Track the time and whether you felt focused or distracted."

**Tracking:**

1. **Core emotional state:** 1 (0: Anxious, 1: Not anxious)
2. **"I'm only a student" thoughts:** 1 (0: Not present, 1: Present)

These two numbers will help you track your core emotional state and the frequency of "I'm only a student" thoughts. You'll review these numbers once a week, not every day, to avoid obsessing about them. The goal is to identify patterns and trends, not to obsess over the numbers themselves.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try the 10‑second line and the one‑sentence reply, though I’m still doubtful. Quick questions so I actually can do this without spiraling:

- If my heart’s pounding or I feel dizzy and the 10‑second line doesn’t slow it, what exactly do I do in the next 30 seconds? (Sit, sip water, put head between knees—be specific.)
- Swap that “need a ride” text — I don’t want to ask that. Can we use this super low‑risk one instead: “Hey, want a 10‑min walk today? No pressure.” — yes/no?
- Make the drawing experiment exact so I can follow it: choose one small object, set a 20‑min timer, draw continuously without judging, stop when timer ends — that counts as done, right?
- For tracking, I don’t want to obsess: can we track two simple things daily and review weekly — (1) Anxiety 0–3, (2) Minutes spent on any creative thing? If I forget a day, we just skip it — no judgment?

And tell me plainly — how is this going to stop the feeling that time’s slipping and I’m only a student? I’m worn out and need something that won’t just become another thing to fail at.

Therapist Answer:
I'll provide you with concise answers to your questions.

**If 10-second line doesn't slow down heart rate or dizziness:**

If you're feeling extremely anxious or lightheaded, and the 10-second line isn't helping, please:

* Sit down on a chair or a cushion on the floor, whichever feels more stable.
* Sip a small amount of water to help calm your body.
* Place your hand on your heart or your stomach to help you focus on your physical sensations.
* Breathe deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
* When you feel able, slowly stand up and take a few deep breaths.

**Low-risk social text:**

Yes, we can use the "Hey, want a 10-min walk today? No pressure" text.

**Drawing experiment:**

Yes, the drawing experiment counts as done when the 20-minute timer ends. Here's a more detailed outline:

* Choose a small object, such as a pen, a coin, or a small figurine.
* Set a 20-minute timer on your phone or watch.
* Draw continuously without judging or stopping to think about your drawing.
* Do not worry about creating a masterpiece or perfecting your technique.
* When the timer ends, stop drawing and take a deep breath.
* Review your drawing, if you'd like, but do not critique or judge it.

**Tracking:**

Yes, we can track two simple things daily and review weekly. Here are the two things we'll track:

* Anxiety: 0 (not anxious), 1 (somewhat anxious), or 2 (anxious)
* Minutes spent on creative thing: The number of minutes you spent on any creative activity, such as drawing, writing, or thinking creatively.

If you forget to track one of these things, it's okay. We'll just skip that day and review the other days the next week.

**Will this stop the feeling that time's slipping and I'm only a student?**

Honestly, I don't have a magic solution that can stop this feeling entirely. However, this approach aims to help you develop a more present-focused mindset, reduce your anxiety about the future, and increase your sense of control over your life.

By practicing mindfulness, drawing, and engaging in low-risk social interactions, you may find that you're better able to tolerate the feeling that time's slipping and that you're only a student. Additionally, by

Patient: Additionally, by repeatedly taking very small, non‑threatening actions you build counter‑evidence to that story “I’m only a student.” Over time those little acts (showing up for 10 minutes, sending a low‑pressure text, noticing a thought without acting on it) change how your brain predicts outcomes: you gain tiny bits of agency, curiosity, and new experiences that slowly reshape your identity from the inside out. It’s slow and imperfect, but it’s the practical route out of a loop.

What to expect (realistic)
- Short term (1–2 weeks): more moments of noticing the thought instead of instantly spiraling; some 10‑minute tasks completed.
- Medium (4–6 weeks): panic spikes may lessen in intensity or recover faster; curiosity shows up more often.
- Longer (8–12 weeks+): a gradual shift in how you describe yourself — more than a student shows up in small ways.

Tonight — exact next steps (do these)
1. Set a timer for 10 minutes. Do the one‑word + tiny physical action, or do a 10‑minute creative stretch (sketch or write one paragraph). Stop when timer ends. That counts.
2. Send the low‑pressure text: “Hey, want a 10‑min walk today? No pressure.”
3. Track two things for the week: Anxiety 0–2 (0 = calm, 1 = some anxiety, 2 = anxious) and Minutes spent on creative activity (0 if none). If you forget a day, skip it — no judgment.

If panic spikes and the 10‑second line doesn’t help, do this next 30 seconds exactly:
- Sit down. Sip a small amount of water. Put one hand on your chest or belly.
- Breathe slowly: in for 4 counts, out for 6 counts, repeat twice.
- Name two things you can see in the room, and one sound you can hear.
Those steps stabilize you physically and bring attention back to the present.

If after two weeks you feel the same (Plan B options)
1. Super low‑risk social: Text option — “Hey, grabbing a quick coffee, want to join for 10 mins? No pressure.” (you can change “coffee” to “walk”)
2. Activity experiment: “Focused 20‑min drawing” — choose one small object, set a 20‑min timer, draw continuously without judging; stop when timer ends. That’s ‘done.’

How we’ll use the tracking without obsessing
- Review once weekly. Look for direction of change (more creative minutes? lower average anxiety?), not perfect days.
- We’ll count missed days as neutral — not failure. If the weekly review shows no trend toward improvement after two weeks, we switch to Plan B; if still no hint of change after another 2–4 weeks, we adapt again (different prompts, short social goals, or discuss medical review for heightened health anxiety).

Quick signs it’s helping (so you don’t wait for a big miracle)
- You notice “I’m only a student” and it doesn’t immediately lead to a spiral.
- You complete at least 3 short creative sessions in a week.
- Panic episodes recover faster (minutes rather than an hour of stuckness).

You’re allowed to be skeptical and worn out while trying this. We’ll treat the exercises as experiments, not tests of your worth. Keep it simple, track two numbers, and we’ll change things if they don’t help.

Therapist Answer:
Thank you for providing a detailed and realistic explanation of what to expect from this process. I understand that it's not a magic solution, but rather a practical approach to help you build counter-evidence to the negative thoughts about being a student.

To confirm, I'll summarize the next steps:

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes and do the one-word + tiny physical action (10-second grounding line) or a 10-minute creative stretch (sketch or write one paragraph). Stop when the timer ends.
2. Send the low-pressure text: "Hey, want a 10-min walk today? No pressure."
3. Track two things for the week: Anxiety 0–2 (0 = calm, 1 = some anxiety, 2 = anxious) and Minutes spent on creative activity (0 if none).

If panic spikes and the 10-second line doesn't help, follow the 30-second stabilization steps:

* Sit down.
* Sip a small amount of water.
* Put one hand on your chest or belly.
* Breathe slowly: in for 4 counts, out for 6 counts, repeat twice.
* Name two things you can see in the room, and one sound you can hear.

These steps are designed to stabilize you physically and bring attention back to the present.

If after two weeks you feel the same, we'll consider Plan B options:

1. Super low-risk social text option: "Hey, grabbing a quick coffee, want to join for 10 mins? No pressure."
2. Activity experiment: "Focused 20-min drawing" - choose one small object, set a 20-min timer, draw continuously without judging; stop when the timer ends.

We'll track progress without obsessing, reviewing once a week and counting missed days as neutral. If the weekly review shows no trend toward improvement after two weeks, we'll switch to Plan B; if still no hint of change after another 2–4 weeks, we'll adapt again.

Please note that it's okay to be skeptical and worn out while trying this. We'll treat the exercises as experiments, not tests of your worth. Keep it simple, track two numbers, and we'll change things if they don't help.

How do you feel about moving forward with these next steps?

Patient: Okay. I’ll try the 10‑minute one‑word/creative stretch, send the “10‑min walk” text, and track Anxiety (0–2) and Minutes creative this week — I’m not enthusiastic, just willing to try. I’m worn out thinking about it and I’ll probably be skeptical or forget some days; can we agree to review after one week and switch to Plan B without framing it as failure? Also, if my health anxiety spikes and the 30‑second / 30‑second stabilization steps don’t help, be ready to help me tweak them in the moment — I’ll likely need that.

Therapist Answer:
I'll summarize our agreement:

1. You'll start by trying the 10-minute one-word + creative stretch, and then send the "10-min walk" text.
2. You'll track two things this week: Anxiety (0-2) and Minutes spent on creative activity (0 if none).
3. We'll review your progress after one week, and if you're not seeing improvement or progress, we'll switch to Plan B. We won't frame Plan B as a "failure" or "giving up", but rather as a natural next step.
4. If your health anxiety spikes and the 30-second stabilization steps don't work, I'll be prepared to help you tweak them in the moment.

I'll help you tweak the stabilization steps if needed, and we'll review your progress after one week. Don't worry about being worn out; we're just getting started. Take it one step at a time.

Are you ready to take the first step (10-minute exercise)?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it now, though my energy’s low and I’m still doubtful it’ll change much. Give me the one-word prompt to write this minute and tell me the tiny physical action to pair with it, and say the 10‑second grounding line one more time so I can use it if I start to spiral. Can we agree you’ll check in after the 10 minutes and we’ll switch to Plan B if it doesn’t help?

Therapist Answer:
'll focus on one thing at a time. We'll review after one week, not at the end of the week. We'll switch to Plan B if necessary, not at the end of the week. We'll adjust the 30-second stabilization steps in real-time if needed.

How does this sound? Does this alleviate your skepticism or help you feel more at ease? Is there a particular area you'd like me to focus on, perhaps specific stressors or perhaps a certain kind of response you'd like to receive?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try it now, though my energy’s low and I’m not sure this will help. Write the word "begin" and then tap your pen twice (or tap your foot once) as the tiny action. Use this 10‑second line if I start to spiral: "Feet down — breathe in 3 — out 3 — I’m here." Check in with me after 10 minutes and we’ll switch to Plan B if it doesn’t help — I’m skeptical, but I agree.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try now.

Patient: I did the 10 minutes — wrote “begin,” tapped twice, and used the 10‑second line once when my chest tightened. It only eased things for a breath or two and then the same panic slid back; honestly, how is that supposed to change anything long‑term? Okay — switch to Plan B now: give me the exact one‑sentence text to send, and repeat the precise 20‑minute drawing steps (what objects are okay, timer, and exactly what counts as “done”). Also, if my heart races and the 30‑second stabilization doesn’t help, tell me exactly what to do and what to say silently in the next 30 seconds, and then check in after I try Plan B.
