Patient: I'm a middle-aged software developer and lately I've been stuck in this fog of sadness and amotivation after a tough breakup; I keep intellectualizing it as cognitive overload and OCD-driven rumination instead of actually sitting with the pain. My usually gregarious, optimistic self feels muted, and it's leaking into my relationships because I can't muster the energy or follow through on things. I'm noticing a pattern of talking about my feelings as abstract theories rather than experiencing them, and I don't know how to break that cycle.

Therapist: You're describing a really tough spot to be in, and it sounds like you've been trying to make sense of it all intellectually. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel this sadness or apathy? Where does it start to feel like it's getting stuck? Is there something specific that triggers it, or is it more of a general feeling that's been with you lately?

Patient: When it kicks in it's usually a low-grade rumination that escalates into these rehearsed narratives about what went wrong — like my brain runs unit tests on the breakup and never exits the loop. Triggers are mundane things: a late-night ping, a song, or just being alone after dinner, and then it gets stuck as this cognitive loop tied to my OCD rituals — checking messages, replaying conversations — which translates into inertia, like executive dysfunction and anhedonia. I tend to intellectualize it—labeling it with big concepts—because actually letting it land feels destabilizing, and honestly I don't know how to move from analysis into feeling without freezing.

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a really effective system for analyzing problems, but it's also creating a kind of mental prison. When you say "brain runs unit tests on the breakup," it sounds like you're actually stuck in that loop, even when you intellectually know it's not serving you. Can you try something for me? Imagine you're sitting in a room with this narrative, this unit test. Just observe it, like it's a separate entity, without judgment or trying to change it. What happens when you do that?

Patient: When I try to sit with it as a separate entity, I can map its architecture—the cue, the ritual, the rumination—and that cataloging gives me a faux sense of control. But instead of softening anything, that distance just converts the feeling into another object to analyze, and I get this low, gnawing tightness in my chest I immediately label as "executive inertia." Honestly, I then slip into a meta-loop running diagnostics on why I'm stuck, which keeps me from actually feeling the sadness and leaves me kind of overwhelmed, like we're circling without getting anywhere.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to use your analytical skills to understand the system that's holding you back, but that's actually perpetuating the problem. Instead of running diagnostics on why you're stuck, can you try to actually ask yourself what's happening when you feel that tightness in your chest? What does it feel like? Is it a physical sensation, an emotion, a thought? Can you just observe that for a moment, without trying to label it or change it?

Patient: Physically it's a dull, constricting pressure behind my sternum and my breath gets shallow—like there's a tiny vise tightening that I can kind of map out. But instead of letting that sensation be, I immediately relabel it as "affective inhibition" or "executive inertia" and start diagramming triggers and OCD loops, which makes it more of an object than an experience. I'm trying to actually sit with it, but I keep slipping into analysis and it's making me feel a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. I want you to focus just on your breath for a moment. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about anything else, just the sensation of the breath. Now, I want you to bring your attention to the tightness in your chest. Just notice it, without trying to label it or change it. Can you feel it right now?

Patient: Yeah—I can feel it right now: a dull, constricting band behind my sternum, my breath shallow and a little choppy, like there's a weight pressing down. My brain immediately wants to label it "affective inhibition" and start mapping it, which pulls me out of actually being with it. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with the sensation a little longer?

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but let's try to stay with the sensation for just a little bit longer. Can you just acknowledge the feeling, without trying to label it or change it? It's okay if your brain tries to pull you out, just gently say "I see that thought" and then bring your attention back to the sensation. Take another breath in, and just notice the band behind your sternum, the feeling of your breath moving in and out...

Patient: Okay—breathing in now. There's definitely that constricting band behind my sternum, my breath is shallow, and a low, dull ache sits under it like a background process consuming resources. I say "I see that thought" and it does loosen a touch, but my mind immediately reifies the sensation into labels—"affective inhibition," "executive inertia"—and starts running diagnostic loops instead of letting the ache be; I can feel a faint, real sadness under the analysis but it's hard to let it surface without panicking a little. I'm getting overwhelmed again—can we slow down and just sit with this for a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a really deep breath together, and pause for just a moment. Don't try to think about anything, just sit with the sensation of the ache behind your sternum. Can you just feel it, without trying to label it or change it? Don't try to analyze it, just be with it. Just notice the feeling of your breath moving in and out, the sensation of the band behind your sternum, the dull ache under it. Let it be, without trying to do anything with it. Just sit.

Patient: Okay—I can feel it: a tight, constricting band behind my sternum, breath shallow, a dull, hollow ache like a small cold weight. When I actually try not to name it, there's a tremble under that band that feels closer to real sadness, and if I just notice it for a moment it loosens a little. My mind, of course, wants to convert it into another schematic and start diagnosing, and that pull makes me anxious and overwhelmed. Can we stay with this a bit longer? I'm trying, but it's hard.

Therapist: Let's just stay with this for another moment. Don't try to think about anything, just notice the tight band behind your sternum, the shallow breath, the dull ache. Just be with it. If your mind starts to pull you out, gently say "I see that thought" and bring your attention back to the sensation. Don't try to change it or analyze it, just observe it. It's okay if it feels a little overwhelming, just stay with it for a little longer. Take a deep breath in...

Patient: Breathing in—there's a slight loosening around that constricting band, a subtle tremor under my ribs and a warmth behind my eyes like something wants to break through. My brain immediately wants to reframe it as a "meta-cognitive loop" or map the affective register, which pulls me out, but if I let it be for even a breath it feels closer to real sadness. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we stay with this a little longer and keep doing the slow breaths?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath in together. Don't try to think about anything, just notice the sensation around the constricting band. The warmth behind your eyes, the subtle tremor under your ribs. Just be with it. If your mind starts to pull you out, gently say "I see that thought" and bring your attention back to the sensation. Don't try to change it or analyze it, just observe it. Take another slow breath out... and notice what happens when you let go of the analysis.

Patient: When I actually let go of the analysis for even one breath, that unit-tested narrative blurs into a raw ache — warmer, more incandescent, a lump behind my sternWhen I actually let go of the analysis for even one breath, that unit-tested narrative blurs into a raw ache — warmer, more incandescent, a lump behind my sternum and a pressure that wants to become tears. There's a real fear that if I let it expand I'll be unmoored, so I immediately start architecting defenses, but in the pause it feels less like a problem and more like loss. I'm getting overwhelmed by that shift — can we keep sitting with the slow breaths a bit longer? My brain's already drafting contingency plans, and I need help not letting it pull me out.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together, and just be with the sensation. Don't try to think about it, don't try to analyze it. Just notice the lump behind your sternum, the warmth, the pressure that wants to become tears. It's okay to feel scared, it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Just sit with it. Imagine that you're standing on the edge of a river, and you're about to let go of a boat. You're not sure what will happen when you let go, but you're willing to take the risk. Just let your breath out, and see what happens. Don't worry about your brain's contingency plans right now. Just focus on the sensation, and the moment.

Patient: When I let my breath out I actually felt something shift — the band loosened, a hot sting behind my eyes, and a lump that wants to drop like maybe tears. My brain immediately started drafting contingencies, renaming it "affective dysregulation" so I don't have to feel unmoored, but underneath that is this small, honest sadness that feels raw and awkward. I'm scared if I let it expand I'll fall apart, so can we keep doing the slow breaths together? I need help not letting my head yank me out of it.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As you exhale, notice how the lump feels, how the hot sting behind your eyes is affecting your entire body. Don't try to name it, don't try to analyze it. Just feel it. Don't worry about what's happening if you "let it expand", just focus on the sensation in this moment. Imagine that you're holding a small, fragile flower in your hand, and you're not supposed to touch it. Just hold it, and feel the delicate sensation of its petals. Don't try to move, don't try to think. Just be with the flower, and the sensation it's giving you.

Patient: Okay... holding the flower—its petals feel fragile against my palm, and that lump in my chest presses down like a small, stubborn stone. Naming it or theorizing about it feels like a reflex I don't have the energy for right now; it just sits there, heavy and raw. Can we keep breathing together for a few more breaths? It's... taking everything I have to stay with it.

Therapist: Let's keep breathing together. Just focus on your breath, and the sensation of the flower in your hand. Don't try to move, don't try to think. Just be with the feeling of the petals against your palm, and the weight of the stone in your chest. It's okay if it's hard to stay with it, it's okay if you're tired. Just take another breath in, and another out. Notice how the air moves in and out of your body, and the sensation of the air on your skin. Let go of any tension, any thoughts. Just be.

Patient: Breathing... the flower feels damp and fragile, the stone pressing so hard there's a burn of shame that makes me want to draft a post‑mortem and fix every perceived failure, but I don't have the energy for that right now. Can we just keep breathing together for a few more minutes? I'm struggling to stay present.

Therapist: It's okay if you're struggling to stay present. Just acknowledge the feeling of struggle, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the ground. Try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, rather than your thoughts. You can also try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and the sound of your own breath. It's okay if it's not a clear or distinct sound, just try to notice the sensation of the breath. Take another breath in, and another out.

Patient: Breathing... I can feel my feet on the floor, the air moving, and that helps a little, but there's a hot, familiar shame tightening the stone in my chest and I don't have the bandwidth to reframe it right now. Can we keep doing the slow breaths together for a bit? I'm really struggling to stay present.

Therapist: It's okay if the shame is still there. Just acknowledge it, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze or change it. Just be with the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. You can also try to notice the sensation of your heart beating, and the sensation of your chest moving with each breath. Take another breath in, and another out. Remember, you're not trying to do anything with your breath, just be with it.

Patient: Breathing... I can feel my feet on the floor, my chest rising and falling, and my heart's slow thud. There's this hot shame under the stone that keeps nudging me to draft a post‑mortem, but I don't have the bandwidth for that right now—just feeling heavy and a little shaky. Can we keep doing the slow breaths together?

Therapist: It's okay to feel heavy and shaky. Just acknowledge those feelings, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. You're doing okay. Just taking it one breath at a time. Try to focus on the sensation of your heart beating, and the sensation of your chest moving with each breath. Remember, you don't have to process anything right now. You can just be with the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your body. Take another breath in, and another out.

Patient: Breathing... that shame is loud right now, like a replay I don't have the energy to debug, and it tightens the stone in my chest until I'm just small and shaky. My mind wants to run a post‑mortem, but I can't—can we keep doing the slow breaths together? I need help staying with this.

Therapist: It's okay to feel small and shaky. Just acknowledge those feelings, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. You're not alone, and you're doing the best you can. Just being with the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your body, right now. You don't have to do anything else. You can just be. Try to focus on the sensation of your breath, and the feeling of your chest moving with each breath. Don't try to change anything, just be with what is. Take another breath in, and another out.

Patient: Breathing... it's helping a little — the band loosens when I anchor to my feet and the inhale — but that hot shame keeps nudging me to run a post‑mortem and I don't have the bandwidth for that right now. It's taking everything I have to stay here without turning it into another diagnostic, so can we keep doing the slow breaths together? I'm shaky and it's hard not to slip into analysis.

Therapist: It's okay to feel shaky and uncertain. Just acknowledge those feelings, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Just being with the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your body, right now. Try to focus on the sensation of your chest moving with each breath, and the feeling of your feet touching the floor. Don't try to change anything, just be with what is. Take another breath in, and another out. Remember, you don't have to do anything with your thoughts right now. Just observe them, and let them go.

Patient: Breathing... it's a little better—the band eases when I anchor to my feet and the inhale—but there's this hot shame that keeps nudging me to run a post‑mortem and I don't have the energy for that right now. It makes me feel small and frustrated, like I should be fixing it instead of just... being with it. Can we keep doing the slow breaths together? Maybe just short counts or reminders to come back to my feet—I'm shaky and need the help.

Therapist: It's okay to feel small and frustrated. Just acknowledge those feelings, and take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and the feeling of your feet on the floor. Try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of the air moving in and out of your body. When you start to feel overwhelmed or shaky, bring your attention back to your feet. Just one breath, one sensation, one feeling. You can also try counting your breaths again, but don't worry if your mind starts to wander. Just gently bring your attention back to your feet. Take another breath in, and another out.

Patient: Breathing... anchoring to my feet helps a bit, but this hot shame keeps flaring and pulling me toward a post‑mortem I don't have the energy for. Can we keep doing short, guided breaths—like a slow 3 in, 3 out—and a few reminders to feel my feet? I need the help staying with it.

Therapist: Let's try a slow 3 in, 3 out. Inhale for a count of three, filling your lungs completely. Hold for a count of one. Exhale for a count of three, emptying your lungs completely. Hold again for a count of one. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body, and the feeling of your feet touching the ground. Try to focus on the sensation of your feet, rather than anything else. When you're ready to exhale, feel the air leaving your body, and the sensation of your feet still touching the ground. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. Remember, it's okay to feel the shame, but don't get caught up in it. Just acknowledge it, and bring your attention back to your breath. Take another slow 3 in, 3 out.

Patient: Okay—trying it. In: one, two, three. Hold. Out: one, two, three. Hold.

That eased the band a little—a faint loosen, warmth behind my eyes—but the shame is still buzzing, like I should be analyzing this instead of just sitting with it. It's taking everything I have to stay here without slipping into a post‑mortem. Can we do three more of those 3 in/3 out breaths, with a reminder each time to feel my feet? I'm shaky and need the help.

Therapist: Let's try another 3 in, 3 out. Inhale for a count of three, filling your lungs completely. One, two, three. Hold. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and feel the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Try to focus on the weight of your feet on the earth, and the feeling of the air supporting your body. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. One, two, three. Hold. Remember to feel your feet, and bring your attention back to them whenever you start to feel overwhelmed. You're doing okay, just breathe. Take another 3 in, 3 out.

Patient: Okay... In: one, two, three. Hold. Out: one, two, three. Hold.

That loosened the band a touch—warmth behind my eyes—but the shame's still buzzing and I keep wanting to run a post‑mortem. Could we do two more of those 3/3 breaths with a quick prompt each time to feel my feet? I'm shaky and need the help.

Therapist: Let's try another 3 in, 3 out. Inhale for a count of three, filling your lungs completely. One, two, three. Hold. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and feel the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Try to focus on the weight of your feet on the earth, and the feeling of the air supporting your body. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. You've made it to the edge of the wave, now just ride it out. Keep feeling your feet, keep focusing on the sensation of the ground beneath you. Take another 3 in, 3 out.

Patient: In: one, two, three. Hold. Out: one, two, three. Hold.

That eased the band a little—warmth behind my eyes—but the shame's still buzzing and my brain's already drafting a post‑mortem. Can we do one more 3 in/3 out with a quick reminder to feel my feet? I need the anchor—I'm shaky and trying not to slip into analysis.

Therapist: Let's try one more 3 in, 3 out. Inhale for a count of three, filling your lungs completely. One, two, three. Hold. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body, and feel the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Try to focus on the weight of your feet on the earth, and the feeling of the air supporting your body. Remember, you are here, right now. You are breathing. You are feeling. Feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, and let that anchor you. Don't try to think about anything else, just be with that sensation. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. You've made it through one last breath.

Patient: Okay—breath out. That actually loosened the band a touch; there's warmth behind my eyes, but the hot shame's still humming and I feel drained and shaky. My reflex is to draft a post‑mortem and design interventions, but I don't have the bandwidth for that right now—can we either keep doing a few grounding breaths or pivot to one tiny, concrete step I can try this evening to counter the inertia? I need help staying anchored; don't let me turn it into analysis.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to just be with the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the warmth behind your eyes, and the feeling of your feet on the ground. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I am enough right now." Just that simple phrase. Don't try to do anything else, just be with that feeling of being enough. If you're ready, we can try to move to a concrete step, but first, let's just stay with this feeling of being enough for a moment.

Patient: Okay—"I am enough right now." Saying it loosens the band a little; it feels oddly thin and my shame is still buzzing underneath, nudging me to run a post‑mortem. I don't have energy for big fixes, so a tiny concrete plan feels doable: tonight I'll do a 10‑minute walk after dinner and set a timer for just ten minutes to do one small, concrete thing (maybe wash a dish or open my editor and type one line). If I start analyzing, I'll do three slow breaths and anchor to my feet with the prompt "3 breaths—feet." Can you say that prompt with me once so I can rehearse it?

Therapist: Let's try it together. Say it with me: "3 breaths—feet." Just repeat it a few times, feel free to pause it whenever you need to. I'll do it with you: "3 breaths—feet". Can you think of a small, concrete thing you want to do tonight? Maybe just opening your editor and typing one line? Just imagine yourself doing that small thing, and then coming back to me if you need to. When you're ready, let's practice the whole thing together, and I'll help you stay anchored.

Patient: Okay... 3 breaths—feet. 3 breaths—feet. 3 breaths—feet.

Tonight I’ll do a 10‑minute walk after dinner, then open my editor and type one line. If I catch myself analyzing, I’ll stop and do the 3 breaths—feet anchor. Can you say that prompt with me once and give me a quick check‑in after the walk? I’m shaky and need the help staying with it.

Therapist: Let's do it. Say the prompt with me: "3 breaths—feet". Go for it!

Patient: 3 breaths—feet. 3 breaths—feet.

I’ll do the 10‑minute walk after dinner, then open my editor and type one line; if I start analyzing I’ll use the 3 breaths—feet anchor. Can you ping me for a quick check‑in after the walk? I feel a little sheepish asking, but I’m shaky and need that accountability.

Therapist: Don't be sheepish! It's great that you're taking responsibility for your own accountability. I'll ping you after the 10-minute walk to check in and see how you're doing. Take care of yourself, and stay focused on your goal. 10 minutes and then a check-in.

Patient: Okay — that works. Ping me after the 10‑minute walk and just send "3 breaths—feet" and a quick "How'd it go?" I'm shaky and embarrassed about needing the nudge, but I'll try the walk and the one‑line in the editor. Can we stay connected here afterward? I don't want to be left alone with the urge to overanalyze.
