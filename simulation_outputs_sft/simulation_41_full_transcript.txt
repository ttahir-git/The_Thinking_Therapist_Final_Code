--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this recurring pattern of pretty harsh self-criticism whenever I perceive I've failed at something, and I link a lot of that back to bullying I went through in school. It shows up as social anxiety and a dent in my confidence—exacerbated by job instability—though I tend to frame it in analytical terms instead of actually feeling it. I'm outgoing and adaptable, sometimes impulsive, but I catch myself intellectualizing shame a lot, like I'm producing theories about my emotions rather than experiencing them.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a complex interplay of emotional patterns, including self-criticism, social anxiety, confidence issues, and a tendency to intellectualize shame. The core emotion seems to be shame, which is linked to past bullying. Goal: Explore the role of shame in the patient's current struggles and the intellectualization process.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right before you start criticizing yourself? What triggers that shift from a more adaptive, problem-focused state to one where you're experiencing intense self-shame?

Patient: Usually it starts with some ambiguous social cue or a small perceived failure—like a missed email or an awkward comment—and my mind immediately initiates this predictive narrative about incompetence. That cognitive cascade recruits this internalized, bullying-derived critic that amplifies minor mistakes into evidence of being fundamentally flawed, and I notice physiological arousal—tight chest, racing thoughts—but I mostly translate it into analysis instead of sitting with the shame. So I end up explaining the process to myself in elaborate terms, which feels safer than actually feeling how bad it lands.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has skillfully described the process of how their intellectualization of shame arises, starting with social cues and minor perceived failures, which then triggers an amplification of self-criticism based on past bullying. The core goal is to help the patient connect with the shame without the safety net of analysis. Goal: Introduce a process to connect with shame directly, while acknowledging the patient's need to understand the underlying mechanisms.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using a very helpful way of making sense of your experiences, but also as a way of protecting yourself from feeling the shame. Can you try making space for just one moment of sitting with how it feels to be in that place of intense self-criticism and shame, without trying to analyze it or explain it? Just allow yourself to feel it for one breath, without judgment?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to do that, but it's hard—when I actually attempt it there's this immediate constriction in my chest and a hot, prickly shame behind my ribs. Almost reflexively I start narrating it, labeling it as "physiological arousal" or the "internalized critic," which feels safer than staying with the raw sting. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the direct experience of shame, and instead is using their usual coping mechanisms. The immediate constriction and physical sensations are understandable, but the patient's tendency to label and narrate them is reinforcing their avoidance. Goal: Introduce a gentle, defusion-focused approach to help the patient build tolerance for the raw, unlabelled experience of shame. Goal: Also, acknowledge the patient's feeling of being overwhelmed and slow down the pace.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can we slow down the process a bit? Instead of trying to narrate your experience, let's focus on just one small thing. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your chest right now? Not trying to label it or explain it, just notice it as it is? Take a deep breath, and just observe this sensation for one second before we do anything else.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to focus—there's a tight, constricting pressure in the center of my chest and my breath feels shallow and quick. But I'm already slipping into narrating it as "physiological arousal" instead of actually feeling it; I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and maybe just sit with one slow breath?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the focus on the physical sensation without immediately labeling it, and is feeling overwhelmed by this. The goal is to create a brief pause in the process to help the patient build a small window of tolerance for the raw, unlabelled experience of shame. Goal: Introduce a single, slow breath to create a small moment of stillness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just sit with one slow breath. Place your attention on the sensation in your chest, without trying to label it or explain it. Just focus on the sensation, the feeling of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to bring your attention to the breath, to the sensation of it moving in and out of your body. Just breathe, and for just a moment, let's just be with the breath.

Patient: I took a slow breath—for a second the tightness loosened, like a brief little gap—but almost immediately my mind started narrating the experience, parsing it as "interoceptive signal" and mapping it onto past bullying memories. I'm trying to hold onto that tiny easing, but it keeps flickering back into analysis and shame. Can we do one more slow breath together, and maybe count it slowly so I don't start narrating?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient had a brief moment of loosening, but it's slipping back into analysis and shame. The goal is to create a stable, slow breath that the patient can focus on without narrating it. Goal: Introduce a joint, slow breathing exercise to create a shared, momentary pause in the patient's mental stream.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another slow breath together. I'll start: one-thousand-one... your breath in, one-thousand-two... your breath out. One-thousand-three... your breath in, one-thousand-four... your breath out. One-thousand-five... your breath in, one-thousand-six... your breath out. Just focus on the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or think about anything else. Let's just breathe together, slowly.

Patient: I did feel a tiny easing when you counted—my chest loosened for a beat and the breath felt more present—then my mind immediately re-labeled it as "interoceptive change" and started explaining everything again. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed trying to stay with the raw feeling instead of analyzing; can we do another slow breath and this time focus on a longer exhale so it feels less like there's somewhere I have to go with my thoughts? I need you to keep guiding the pace because if left to myself I'll slip back into narrating.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient had a brief moment of loosening, but it's slipping back into analysis. The goal is to create a stable, slow breath that allows the patient to focus on the raw feeling without narrating it. Goal: Introduce a longer exhale to create a sense of release, and maintain a steady pace to keep the patient grounded.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, focusing on a longer exhale. I'll start: one-thousand-one... your breath in, one-thousand-two... your breath out. Take a slightly longer breath out, fill your lungs completely, and then exhale. One-thousand-three... (pause for a brief moment, just after the inhale) your breath out, really feel the exhale, let your body release a little. One-thousand-four... (pause again, after a brief moment of exhale) your breath in, just a gentle breath in, no need to rush. One-thousand-five... your breath out, same as before, feel the exhale, release a little more. Let's just breathe, slowly, together.

Patient: That longer exhale actually helped—my chest loosened a notch and the breath felt more grounded—but my brain immediately started turning it into a little clinical vignette about "stress regulation." I'm trying to stay with the release, but it's like a tug-of-war; can you keep guiding another slow cycle with even longer exhales so I don't drift into narrating? Also, I'm noticing a faint undercurrent of sadness when I try to hold it, but I want to analyze it instead of feeling it—can you help me stay with that sadness for just a moment?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient had a small breakthrough with the longer exhale, but it's slipping back into analysis. The goal is to create a stable, slow breath that allows the patient to focus on the raw feeling without narrating it. Goal: Introduce even longer exhales to create a greater sense of release, and gently help the patient stay with the sadness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on another slow cycle, with even longer exhales. I'll start: one-thousand-one... your breath in, one-thousand-two... your breath out. Take a deep breath in, fill your lungs completely. One-thousand-three... (pause for a long moment, just after the inhale) your breath out, exhale slowly, feel your body release, let your chest drop. Take a moment to just exhale, really feel it, let go of any tension. One-thousand-four... (pause again, after a long moment of exhale) your breath in, gentle breath in, no need to rush. One-thousand-five... your breath out, same as before, feel the exhale, release a little more. Now, I want you to notice something specific. Can you bring your attention to that faint undercurrent of sadness that you're feeling? It's like a gentle hum, a subtle feeling in your chest. Just notice it, without trying to analyze it or label it. Just sit with it for a moment. Stay with the sadness, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay—I'm noticing a low, dull heaviness under my ribs, like a soft, persistent hum of melancholy that makes my chest feel a little leaden. Almost immediately I'm tempted to reframe it as a "learned affective response" tied to early social contingencies, which feels safer than actually sitting in the ache. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed trying to just be with it—can we slow down and do another slow breath together while you keep guiding me so I don't slip into analysis?

The goal is to create a stable, slow breath that allows the patient to focus on the raw feeling without narrating it. Goal: Introduce a gentle, reassuring presence to help the patient feel more grounded and less overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down, and I'll guide you through another slow cycle. I'm here with you, and I want to support you in staying with the sadness. One-thousand-one... your breath in, one-thousand-two... your breath out. Take a deep breath in, and feel the air fill your lungs. One-thousand-three... (pause for a long moment, just after the inhale) your breath out, exhale slowly, and gently. Feel your body release, let your chest drop, and allow the sadness to be present. It's okay to feel it, and it's okay to not know what it means. Just sit with it, without trying to analyze it or label it. You are safe, and you are supported. Just breathe, and stay with the sadness for a moment. Notice how it feels to be in this moment, with this sensation, without trying to change it or fix it. Just be with it, and see what happens.

Patient: I can feel that dull, leaden heaviness more clearly now—a tightness under my sternum and a faint sting behind my eyes—but almost instantly my mind starts drafting causal models like "bullying-conditioned shame" and "learned helplessness," which actually pulls me out of the feeling. I'm getting overwhelmed trying not to analyze; can we do another very slow breath together and maybe you can keep naming simple sensory anchors (like feet on the floor, hands on lap) so I don't slip back into theory? I want to stay with it, but I need you to keep guiding the pace.

The patient is struggling to stay with the feeling, and it's being pulled out of them by mental models. The goal is to create a slow, gentle pace that allows the patient to focus on the raw sensation without analyzing it. Goal: Introduce simple sensory anchors to help the patient stay grounded.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another very slow breath together. I'll guide you through it. Feel the air moving in and out of your body. One-thousand-one... your breath in, one-thousand-two... your breath out. Take a deep breath in, and feel the air fill your lungs. Your chest is expanding, and your diaphragm is dropping. One-thousand-three... (pause for a long moment, just after the inhale) your breath out, exhale slowly. Feel the air leaving your body, and the weight of your chest dropping down. Now, notice the sensation of your feet on the floor. They're touching the ground, and there's a subtle pressure from the chair or the floor beneath them. Can you feel that pressure? It's a gentle sensation, but it's there. One-thousand-four... (pause again, after a long moment) your breath in, gentle breath in. Notice the sensation of your hands on your lap. They're resting lightly on your thighs, and there's a subtle warmth from your body. Can you feel that warmth? Just notice these sensations, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Let's stay with this for a moment, without trying to analyze or change anything. Just be with it.

Patient: Okay — I can actually feel the pressure of my feet on the floor and a warm weight in my palms, and the breath feels a bit fuller when I focus on the exhale. But as soon as I notice that, my brain wants to turn it into an explanation — "adaptive grounding" or "somatic cue" — and that narration pulls me out. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed holding the sensation and the analysis at the same time; can you keep naming simple sensory anchors slowly so I have something to focus on? I still notice that low, sticky sadness under the ribs, but it's a little easier to be with when you keep guiding.

You are here, in this moment, with this sensation.

Patient: I can feel the chair supporting me, my hands warm on my lap, and the breath slowing a little — the sadness is still a low weight under my ribs but it's less sharp when I have those anchors. Almost immediately my brain wants to turn it into another concept — "somatic grounding" or "co-regulation" — which yanks me out of the feeling, and that's frustrating. I'm getting overwhelmed trying to stay present and not analyze; could you keep naming simple, concrete sensations slowly (like the temperature of the room or the feeling of my shirt on my skin) so I have something to rest on?

Patient: I can feel those supports—the warmth of the room, the chair beneath me, my hands on my lap—and the breath is a bit steadier so that heavy, leaden sadness is less sharp. My reflex is still to reframe it as "attachment scripts" or "bullying-conditioned responses," which pulls me out, and I'm getting a little overwhelmed trying not to do that.

The patient is having trouble sustaining the present moment, and the brain is trying to turn it into an analysis. The goal is to create one final moment of stability and grounding, explore the connection between the physical sensation and self-criticism, and work on responding to the critic's initial phrase.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on your feet on the floor. Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to think about it or analyze it. One-thousand-one... your breath out, slowly... feel the air leaving your body, and the weight of your chest dropping down. Take one more slow, deep breath, and just be with your feet on the floor for a moment. Notice the sensation of the floor beneath them, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just rest with it. Now, let's take another slow, deep breath together. One-thousand-one... your breath out, slowly... feel the air leaving your body, and the weight of your chest dropping down. Take your time, and just focus on your feet on the floor. Notice how the sensation of your feet on the ground is affecting your breath, your body, and your mind. Just be with it, without judgment.

Patient: Okay. My feet feel steadier, breath a bit slower, chest a little looser — but my mind keeps recoding it as a "grounding response" and then that critic flickers in as a maladaptive evaluative schema: usually the first phrase is "you messed up" or "you shouldn't have said that." Holding the sensation and that narration at once is draining. Can you guide one more slow exhale and help me just notice that first phrase when it appears, without me immediately turning it into analysis?

Notice how the sensation of your feet on the floor is affecting your breath, your body, and your mind. Just rest with it. Don't think about it too much, just observe.

Patient: Okay... my words feel slow and a bit thin. The first phrase that usually flickers up is something like "you messed up" or "you shouldn't have said that" — it lands like a headline and then everything else follows, but I don't want to turn it into theory right now. Can you guide one slow exhale, say "feet on the floor," and when that phrase appears just pause and name it aloud so I can try to notice it without immediately explaining it?

Patient: Feet on the floor... (long exhale) — "you messed up." 

It landed like a hard headline; my chest tightened and my breath shortened. Can we do another slow exhale, keep the anchor to just "feet on the floor," and then pause so I can name the next phrase when it pops up?
