--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Yeah, I'm a construction guy who just started this new, kinda demanding program and it's been harder than I thought. I keep leaning on jokes and sarcasm to dodge feeling overwhelmed — feels safer than actually sitting with it. I don't know, I don't really like talking about this stuff, but it's been stuck in my head.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient acknowledges difficulty with new program, leaning on jokes and sarcasm to cope. This avoidance is rooted in discomfort with intense emotions. Goal: Explore how avoiding emotions impacts current experience and introduce a process to build emotional tolerance.

Therapist Answer:
Those jokes and sarcastic comments sound like they've become a protective shield for you, helping you avoid feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're not using them? What's the first thing you notice, the first sensation, when you start to lean on them less?

Patient: I guess the first thing is this tightness in my chest and my jaw kinda gets clenched — like I want to crack a joke but it doesn't come out right. Then I get quiet, fidgety, maybe start talking about something else because sitting with it feels... wrong. I don't know, it's awkward to actually feel it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient describes physical sensations (chest tightness, clenched jaw) and avoidance behaviors (quickly changing subject, talking about something else) when not using jokes and sarcasm. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore and tolerate these physical sensations without avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you try to sit with these feelings, your body reacts with physical tension. Can you imagine taking just one breath, one moment, without trying to make a joke or change the subject? Just notice the tightness in your chest, the feeling of your jaw clenched, and the urge to shift the conversation. What's the first thing you're willing to observe about this moment, without judgment or trying to fix it?

Patient: I guess the first thing is the tightness in my chest and my breaths getting kind of shallow — like I'm holding onto them. My jaw clamps down and my hands start fidgeting, and then my brain hunts for a joke to throw out. I don't know, it feels dumb to just sit with that, like everyone's waiting for me to lighten up, so I almost want to move on.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient describes a complex interplay of physical sensations (tight chest, shallow breaths, clenched jaw, fidgeting hands) and mental avoidance strategies (hunting for a joke, feeling like everyone's waiting, wanting to move on). Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and interest in their physical sensations, rather than avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like there's a lot happening in your body right now, and your mind is trying to help you cope with it. Can you imagine that your body is doing the best it can, with this tightness in your chest, shallow breaths, and clamped jaw? It's like your body is saying, "I'm trying to tell you something." What if, instead of trying to fix it or move on, you just started to ask your body, "What's going on here? What are you trying to tell me?"

Patient: I don't know...when I actually try to ask it, it kinda snaps back like "move on" — like my whole body's telling me to keep cracking jokes so nobody sees me slow down. My jaw and hands feel like they're saying "don't be soft," and my brain immediately starts fishing for a punchline. I guess it feels embarrassing to sit with that, so can we...I don't know, maybe keep it simple for now?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses difficulty in asking body about sensations, as body responds with avoidance strategies. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and interest in their physical sensations, even if it feels difficult or embarrassing.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you try to ask your body what's going on, it feels like there's a strong resistance to that. That resistance can be really powerful, and it's understandable that you might feel like you're being "told" to move on or to be a certain way. Can we try something different? Instead of asking your body directly what's going on, let's try noticing how you're feeling when you're not trying to ask it anything at all? Just observe the sensation in your chest, the sensation in your hands, the feeling of your jaw. What's happening in this moment, without trying to do anything or ask anything?

Patient: I guess right now my chest's tight, my breaths are shallow, and my jaw's clamped — my hands want to fidget and my brain's already hunting for a joke. I don't know, it feels embarrassing to just sit with it like everyone's waiting for me to lighten the mood. Can we keep it simple?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient describes physical sensations and mental avoidance strategies, feeling embarrassed about sitting with them. Goal: Introduce a small, manageable step to increase comfort with physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of tension right now. Can we just focus on your breath for a moment? Let's bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of each breath, without trying to control it or change it in any way. You can say to yourself, "I am breathing in," or "I am breathing out," whatever feels comfortable. Just one breath, one moment. That's it.

Patient: Alright—I'm breathing in, breathing out, but it's shallow and feels like nothing's really moving. My jaw's clamped, my hands want to fidget, and my brain's already lining up a dumb joke to break the silence. I don't know, this feels awkward and embarrassing—can we keep it simple?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to increase comfort with physical sensations, feeling awkward and embarrassed. Goal: Introduce a very small step to increase focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're trying to focus on your breath, but your mind is wandering. Can you try to bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath just for one second? Just one second. When you're ready, say to yourself, "I'm here." That's it. No need to do anything else. Just say, "I'm here."

Patient: I'm here. I guess my breath's still shallow and my chest feels tight, my jaw's clamped up. It feels dumb to just sit with it—my brain's already hunting for a joke. I don't know, can we keep it simple?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient acknowledges presence with brief moment of focus, but mental avoidance strategies resurface. Goal: Encourage patient to explore the physical sensations, not necessarily to "get past" them.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a bit of courage to just be here, even if it feels uncomfortable. Can you try to notice the sensation of your jaw being clamped up, rather than trying to change it? Just observe it, without judgment. What does it feel like to notice that sensation?

Patient: I guess it feels like a hard, tight clamp — like my teeth are pressed together and there's a little knot under my cheek. Noticing it makes me feel exposed and kinda stupid, so my first move is to toss out a joke or change the subject. I don't know, can we keep this simple?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has made progress in noticing physical sensations, but mental avoidance strategies are resurfacing due to feelings of exposure and self-consciousness. Goal: Encourage patient to explore the physical sensations and emotional responses without judgment or avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that noticing the sensation makes you feel exposed. Can you try to explore that feeling a bit more? What does it mean to you to feel exposed, right now, in this moment? Try to understand the emotional tone of that sensation, without trying to change it or hide it.

Patient: I guess it means I'm scared they'll see I'm not as together as I pretend—like someone's gonna notice I'm soft or can't handle it. It stings—shame, a little panic, and the immediate urge to toss out a joke so nobody looks too close. I don't know, it's embarrassing to say out loud, so can we keep this simple?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has made significant progress in exploring emotional responses to physical sensations, revealing deep-seated fears and shame. Goal: Introduce a process to help patient develop a sense of acceptance and self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
Those are really powerful emotions. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge them. Can you try to offer yourself some kindness, just for a moment? Say to yourself, "It's okay to feel scared. It's okay to feel ashamed. It's okay to not be okay." Just those words, right now. No need to do anything else. Just be with those feelings, and offer yourself some compassion.

Patient: Alright—"It's okay to feel scared. It's okay to feel ashamed. It's okay to not be okay." Saying it out loud feels kinda cheesy, like I'm reading a greeting card. I don't know, it still makes me feel exposed and like I oughta slap a joke on it.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has begun to verbalize self-compassion, but is still struggling with feelings of exposure and mental avoidance. Goal: Introduce a process to help patient integrate self-compassion into their physical experience.

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel a bit silly or cheesy when we try something new. That's okay. Can you try to bring the kindness towards yourself into your body? Notice how your jaw feels when you say those words. Does it soften? Does it relax? Try to hold that feeling for just one more second, before you move again.

Patient: I guess my jaw loosens a little — not much, like a millimeter. Saying those words felt kinda cheesy, but I do feel it unclench a bit and my breath's a hair deeper. My brain's already lining up a joke to fill the silence. I don't know, can we keep it simple — give me one small thing I can do on the job when this hits?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has made progress in reducing physical tension, but mental avoidance strategies are resurfacing. Goal: Introduce a very small, specific action that patient can take when feeling the urge to laugh or avoid.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel that urge to laugh or avoid, can you just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? That's it. Just bring your attention to your breath, and notice its sensation. No need to do anything else. Just observe the breath.

Patient: I guess I can try that—just notice my breath. At work I'll probably do a quick, quiet breath or rest a hand on my chest before I toss out a joke so I don't blurt something I don't mean. I don't know, feels kinda dumb, but maybe it's simple enough to actually do—can we keep it like that?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient has accepted a small, specific action to take in the moment, which could help reduce avoidance behaviors. Goal: Evaluate whether this is a sufficient goal for the current session, or if further exploration is needed.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're willing to try something small to help manage your urges. Let's keep it simple for now. Take it one step at a time. We can assess how it goes at work and see if we need to explore anything further. For now, just commit to taking that small step.

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try that — one quiet breath and a hand on my chest before I toss out a joke. But right now my head's all over the place, my chest feels tight and jittery, and I'm worried I'll forget or it'll look dumb, so my first instinct is to bail into sarcasm. I don't know, can we keep checking on this and maybe give me one more tiny thing to do if I'm already mid-joke?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is experiencing a mix of anxiety and self-consciousness, but is still willing to try small steps. Goal: Introduce a secondary process to help manage the anxiety and self-consciousness, while reinforcing the primary goal.

Therapist Answer:
It's normal to feel a bit anxious about trying something new. Let's acknowledge that feeling for a moment. Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious right now." Just those words. Then, gently bring your attention back to the task at hand, the quiet breath. Try to focus on your breath, rather than your anxiety. And if you're already in the midst of a joke, can you pause for just one second before delivering it? Take a brief pause, just to collect yourself.

Patient: "I'm feeling anxious right now."

Okay — chest's tighter, hands jittery, breath shallow and my head's racing; the quiet breath helps a little but I still worry I'll blurt out some dumb joke. I guess I can try to pause for a beat before a punchline, but if I'm already halfway through, I don't know — what's one tiny thing I can do in that split second to stop it?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is making progress with anxiety management, but still needs help with handling the immediate urge to joke. Goal: Introduce a specific physical action to help pause the joke mid-stream.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the urge to deliver a punchline, can you gently press the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth? Just the tip, just for a second. This small physical action can help create a brief pause, giving you a moment to collect yourself and choose a different response. It's a tiny trick, but it might be just what you need in those tight moments.

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try that — press the tip of my tongue to the roof of my mouth for a second. Right now my chest's tight, my hands are jittery, and I'm worried it'll look ridiculous out on the site. I don't know, if I'm already halfway through a joke, will that actually stop me? And what if I forget in the moment — can we pick one more tiny, discreet backup I can do with my hands or feet that folks won't notice?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is refining their strategy, seeking more specific tools to manage the urge to joke. Goal: Introduce a backup action that is discreet and easy to perform, while also reinforcing the primary goal of pausing and collecting themselves.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concern about forgetting the tip-of-the-tongue trick in the moment. Let's add a simple backup action you can use with your hands. Can you make a small, brief fist with one hand, just for a second? Not a tight fist, just a small, relaxed clench. This can help you pause and collect yourself without drawing attention to it. If you're already halfway through a joke, this might give you a brief moment to reassess and choose a different response. The goal is not to make a big show of it, but to use a small, subtle action to help you regain control.

Patient: Alright — I can try the tongue thing and the little fist. Right now my chest's tight and my head's all over the place, so I worry I’ll forget or it’ll look ridiculous. I don't know — if I'm already halfway through a joke, will those actually stop me? Maybe a backup like rubbing a coin in my pocket or a single toe-tap would be less obvious; which one do you think would work better?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is seeking more backup actions, but also considering the potential for these actions to be noticed. Goal: Introduce a backup action that is discreet and has a good chance of success, while also reinforcing the primary goal of pausing and collecting themselves.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the toe-tap as a backup action. Rubbing a coin in your pocket can draw attention, and a single toe-tap is more likely to go unnoticed. It's a subtle action that can help you pause and collect yourself without drawing attention to it. Try it in conjunction with the tongue trick and the little fist. Remember, the goal is not to make a big show of it, but to use a small, discreet action to help you regain control.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the tongue, the little fist, and the toe-tap together — I guess that sounds doable. Right now my chest’s racing and my hands are jittery and I’m worried I’ll freeze or forget and blurt a joke anyway. I don’t know…can you give me one quick, tiny phrase I can say instead of a punchline if I start to go there?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is seeking a final backup plan to prevent joking out, but also struggling with anxiety and self-consciousness. Goal: Introduce a tiny phrase that can help patient pause and collect themselves, while also reinforcing the primary goal of using the tongue trick, little fist, and toe-tap.

Therapist Answer:
Can you say to yourself, "Pause, please"? Just those two words, spoken softly, but firmly. It's a simple phrase that can help you pause and collect yourself, without giving in to the urge to joke. Try it, and remember that it's okay to pause, and that it's a temporary strategy. If you're able to get to this point, you'll have made significant progress.

Patient: "Pause, please."

I'm not sure I follow — how's that supposed to help? Saying that out loud feels weird, like who am I asking to pause? My chest's tight and my hands are jittery and I keep thinking I'll blurt a joke anyway. I don't know, maybe I could mouth it or say it quietly to myself, but if I'm already halfway through a punchline, will that do anything? I guess can we pick one more tiny, discreet backup that actually fits being on the site?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand the value of the "Pause, please" phrase, and is seeking a more tangible backup action. Goal: Introduce a simple, discreet action that can help patient pause and collect themselves in a moment of crisis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple nod. Instead of saying "Pause, please", can you just nod your head slightly? It's a tiny, almost imperceptible movement, but it can help you pause and collect yourself in a moment of crisis. You can do it even if you're halfway through a joke, just nod once and then pause. It's a small, discreet action that can help you regain control.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's a tiny nod gonna stop me when my head's already gone to a punchline? My chest's tight and my hands are jittery, so I worry a nod won't even register before I blurt something. I guess I could try an almost invisible downward nod or a quick throat-clear, but I don't know — what would that actually look like out on the site?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is skeptical about the effectiveness of a nod, especially in a high-stress environment. Goal: Introduce a backup action that is less noticeable but still can help patient pause and collect themselves.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of a nod, can you try a brief, almost imperceptible "tongue release"? It's when you release your tongue slightly, just for a millisecond, without pursing it. It's a very subtle movement, and it might not even register with the others around you. It's a tiny trick that can help you pause and collect yourself, without drawing attention to it. Try it in conjunction with the toe-tap and the little fist. It might be just what you need to regain control.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — what's a "tongue release" actually look like? I don't know how that tiny movement's gonna stop a punchline once I'm halfway through it; my chest's tight and my hands are jittery so I worry I won't even notice to do it. Can we just pick one single thing—something I'll actually remember and that won't look weird on the site—and go over how I should practice it so it becomes automatic?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand and execute the "tongue release" action. Goal: Introduce a single, straightforward action that patient can easily remember and practice to become automatic.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the toe-tap. It's a simple, discreet action that you can do even if you're halfway through a joke. Practice tapping your left toe lightly on the ground, just for a second, and then releasing it. Start with small increments, like a few times a day, in front of a mirror or with a friend who won't mind. Try to focus on the sensation of your toe touching the ground, rather than thinking about the action itself. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the frequency and duration of the toe-tap. The goal is to make it automatic, so it becomes a natural part of your reaction to feeling stressed or anxious. Can you commit to practicing the toe-tap just a few times a day for the next week, starting now?

Patient: I guess I can try the toe-tap a few times a day, but I'm already anxious I'll forget when I'm out there — my chest's tight just thinking about it. Can we tie it to something I already do on the site, like when I set my boot down or grab my first tool, so it's less likely I'll miss it? Can you walk me through one quick practice right now so it's not just theory? I don't know, it feels dumb, but I want something that might actually stick.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is anxious about forgetting the toe-tap, and wants to tie it to something more familiar on the site. Goal: Introduce a practical exercise to help patient incorporate the toe-tap into their daily routine.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice the toe-tap while you're standing in front of a specific object on the site. Choose something that's a natural part of your work, like a toolbox or a workbench. Now, stand in front of it and notice your feet. As you're about to reach out to touch the object, quickly tap your left toe on the ground. Hold it for just a second, and then release. Don't worry about doing it perfectly – just focus on the sensation of the toe touching the ground. Try it like this: "I'm going to grab my tool now... tap, tap, tap..." Tap your toe now, just once. That's it. Just one tap. Now, let's try it a few more times, and then we'll stop for now. Ready?

Patient: Alright... I guess I'm ready. (I tap my left toe once.) Okay — I did that. Felt kinda dumb but there was a tiny pause and my breath eased a hair. My chest is still tight and my hands are jittery though, so can we run it a few more times and then link it to grabbing my tool so I actually remember on the site? I don't know, I don't want to mess this up.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has made a good start with the toe-tap exercise, and is ready to build on that. Goal: Introduce a new exercise to help patient link the toe-tap to a specific action on the site.

Therapist Answer:
Let's run the toe-tap exercise a few more times, and then we'll try to link it to grabbing your tool. I want you to focus on the sensation of your toe touching the ground, and try to pause for just a fraction of a second before releasing. As you're doing this, I want you to start thinking about grabbing your tool. Imagine yourself reaching down to pick it up, and how your body is going to move to do that. Now, let's try it again: "I'm going to grab my tool... tap, tap, tap..." Tap your toe, and then think about reaching down for your tool. Remember to pause for just a second before releasing. Go ahead and try it again.

Patient: Okay — I tapped my toe again like you said, right before I pretended to grab the tool. It gave me a tiny pause and my breath eased a hair, but my chest's still tight and I'm worried I'll forget or it'll look stupid on the site. I guess I can try to tie it to setting my boot down or grabbing the first tool, but what if I'm on a ladder or both hands are full — what tiny thing can I do then? I don't know, I want something that actually fits those moments.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is concerned about the practicality of the toe-tap exercise in different situations on the site. Goal: Introduce a backup plan that is more flexible and adaptable to various situations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's talk about what to do when your hands are full or you're on a ladder. Instead of tapping your toe, can you try to subtly shift your weight onto the balls of your feet? It's a tiny movement, but it can help you pause for a fraction of a second and regain control. When you're grabbing the first tool, try to shift your weight onto your feet just as you're lifting the tool. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and try to pause for just a second before putting the tool down. It's not about tapping your toe, but about using your feet to create a tiny pause in your movement. Can you commit to trying this backup plan when you're on the site, and see how it goes?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's shifting my weight gonna help when I'm up on a ladder or both hands are full? My chest's tight and I'm jittery just thinking about it, so I worry about doing something that'll throw me off or look dumb. I guess I can try it, but can you give me one single, safe, really tiny thing I can do in those moments and a quick way to practice it so I actually remember on the site? I don't know, I don't want to mess this up or make it unsafe.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is concerned about the practicality and safety of shifting weight as a backup plan. Goal: Introduce a single, simple, and safe action that can be practiced in various situations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on a very small action that can be done even when your hands are full or you're on a ladder. Can you try to blink slowly just once, just before you're about to lift the tool or put your weight on your feet? It's a tiny movement, and it might just give you a brief moment to pause and collect yourself. Try it in front of a mirror, just once: "I'm going to blink..." Blink your left eye, just once, and then continue as normal. That's it. Just one blink. Now, let's try it a few more times, and then we'll focus on practicing it on the site.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — blink my left eye? Okay, I tried it once just now and it felt weird, like I'm doing a magic trick. My chest's still tight, hands jittery, and I keep thinking it'll look obvious or I'll forget. I don't know — can we just pick one single thing (maybe the toe-tap tied to setting my boot down) and walk through a clear, step-by-step practice so it actually becomes automatic on the site?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to incorporate the blinking action into their practice. Goal: Introduce a clear, step-by-step practice plan for the toe-tap tied to setting boot down.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the toe-tap tied to setting your boot down. We're going to practice it in a very specific and controlled way. Here's how:

1. Find a quiet spot on the site where you can stand with your boot down, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Look down at your boot and take a deep breath.
3. As you exhale, lift your left foot off the ground, just slightly, so that the ball of your foot is off the ground.
4. As you do this, tap the toe of your left foot on the ground, just once.
5. Hold that tap for a second, and then release.
6. As you lift your foot back down, take another deep breath.
7. Repeat this process, tapping your toe, holding, releasing, and repeating.

Let's practice this 5-10 times, slowly and carefully. I want you to focus on the sensation of your toe touching the ground, and the feeling of your foot lifting off the ground. Just do this, one step at a time, and try to let go of any thoughts about how it looks or feels. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay… I guess I’ll try. I’m feeling kinda jumpy and a bit confused about doing 5–10 reps — can we just do three slow ones first so I don’t freak out? Alright, I tap my toe once — felt stupid, but there was a tiny pause and my chest eased a hair. Can we do two more like that, and then figure out a really short phrase or cue I can use so I don’t forget on the site? I don’t know, I’m trying not to mess this up.
