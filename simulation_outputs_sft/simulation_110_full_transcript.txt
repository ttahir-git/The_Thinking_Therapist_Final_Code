--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in this cycle of tearing myself down over every perceived failure, especially after a string of difficult relationships. My brain immediately jumps to the worst — that I'll ruin any chance at companionship, never find steady work again, and end up lonely and invisible. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but I can't make myself believe it — I'm hooked on these disaster stories.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is deeply entrenched in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, which is significantly impacting their mental state. Core emotion is the intense anxiety and hopelessness stemming from these negative outcomes. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion as a way to start gently disrupting this cycle of self-destruction and help the patient begin to develop some mental distance from these thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Those thoughts can be really vicious, can't they? It's like your mind is painting a picture of the worst-case scenario, and it's hard to shake off. Can you imagine if you just allowed these thoughts to exist for a moment, without judgment, without trying to change them? Just acknowledge them as they are? Sometimes, that small act of observing our thoughts without getting caught up in them can help us start to feel a bit more grounded. Would you be willing to try that for just one sentence, and then we can see where it takes us?

Patient: Okay, I'll try: I'm noticing the thought that I'll end up alone and ruined, that my failures will pile up until nobody wants me and I never work again, but I can't make myself believe anything else.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has begun to notice their thoughts without judgment, but is still struggling to shift their focus away from the catastrophic scenarios. Goal: Introduce the concept of values-based action as a way to break the cycle of avoidance and despair. Specifically, aim to help the patient identify a small, low-stakes action that can be taken in the present moment to start reconnecting with valued aspects of themselves.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that you're noticing this thought pattern more clearly now. What's going through your mind when you consider the possibility of not working out or finding companionship? Is there anything that feels more important to you than this fear of failure right now? For example, is there something you've always wanted to try or explore that would bring you a sense of joy or fulfillment? It might seem like a small thing, but taking a tiny step towards something that matters to you could be a powerful way to start feeling more grounded and connected to what's truly important.

Patient: Honestly, my head jumps straight to the worst: if I try something like a community art class or volunteering to feel useful, I'll say the wrong thing, everyone will notice I'm unemployed and judge me, I'll freeze, they'll avoid me, and I'll end up more lonely than before. Part of me really wants to try painting or a small writing group — that would feel good — but I can't make myself believe it's anything but a setup for humiliation. Right now the fear of failing and being rejected feels bigger than any of those little hopes; it just swallows them.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's fears are intensifying, and they're becoming stuck in a cycle of avoidance and self-doubt. The goal is to help the patient recognize that their fears are not only unworkable but also suffocating their desire for connection and creative expression. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion as a means to create some distance between the patient's fears and their core values. Justify introducing a metaphoric approach to help the patient gain a new perspective on their fears and desires.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your fear of failure has created a huge void that's swallowing up all your other desires, including the ones that bring you joy. It's like you're trying to cram a square peg into a round hole – it just doesn't fit. Can you imagine if you treated these fears like they were temporary visitors in your life, rather than permanent residents? Sometimes, when we give something space to breathe, it loses its power over us. I want to introduce a bit of a mind trick to help you see your fears in a new light. Imagine your fears are like a strong wind that's blowing through a forest. The trees are bent and twisted, but if you stand back far enough, the wind loses its strength, and the trees begin to straighten up again. Let's imagine that your fears are like that wind, and you're standing back, watching them blow through your life. What would you see if you gave yourself some space to breathe?

Patient: If I stand back, I still see the wind tearing my plans apart — the art class turning into people noticing I'm unemployed, whispering, me freezing up, embarrassing myself, and getting pushed out until I'm back to being invisible. I want to believe the trees could straighten, but that feels like wishful thinking; I can't make myself trust that outcome.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has begun to visualize their fears, but is still struggling to shake off the sense of helplessness and hopelessness. The goal is to help the patient recognize that their fears are not fixed, but rather can be influenced by their willingness to take small, experimental actions. Introduce the concept of small, committed action as a way to build confidence and develop a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're caught in a feedback loop, where every time you try to imagine a better outcome, your fears bring you right back down to earth. But what if, instead of trying to imagine a better outcome, you tried to take a small step towards one? It's like taking a tiny seed and planting it in the ground. It's not going to grow into a tree overnight, but it's a start. If you plant that seed and take care of it, you might be surprised at how it begins to grow. Would you be willing to try planting a tiny seed, just for one minute, and see what happens? Not to change anything, not to make any promises, but just to plant it and see what happens?

Patient: I really don't think I can — the minute I try, I'll freeze, everyone will notice I'm unemployed and judge me, and it'll all blow up. But... okay, fine, I'll do the one-minute thing: I'll spend one minute looking up a local beginner art class link, even though I'm sure it'll just prove I'm out of place.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has agreed to take a small, experimental action, which is a crucial step towards building confidence and developing a sense of control. Goal: Focus on the process of taking the action, rather than the potential outcome. Help the patient stay present and focused on the task at hand.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the present moment. You're sitting here, you've agreed to look up a local art class, and you're going to do it for just one minute. That's it. You don't have to commit to anything more than that. Just look up the link, take a look, and then we can talk about it. No judgments, no expectations. Just the process of taking that one small step. As you do this, bring your attention to your breath. Feel the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Stay present, stay focused on this one minute. Are you ready to take that first step?

Patient: Okay, I'm ready, though my chest is tight and I can already see them noticing I'm unemployed and whispering. I spent a minute and found a beginner art class at the community center next Tuesday — it looks affordable, but I'm convinced it'll be full of people who'll judge me and I'll freeze. I'm surprised I managed to do it, but I still feel shaky and sure it's going to go horribly wrong.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken the first step, but is still struggling with their catastrophic thinking and self-doubt. The goal is to help the patient recognize that their fears are not justified, and that the act of taking action in itself is a positive step, regardless of the outcome. Introduce a gentle, encouraging approach to help the patient build confidence and develop a more positive relationship with their fears.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling a lot of anxiety and self-doubt, and that's understandable given what you're thinking about. But I want to gently challenge that for a moment. Can you tell me exactly what you're thinking right now, when you think about showing up to this class? What's the worst that could happen, exactly? Is it really just that everyone will notice you're unemployed and whisper about it? That's not even what you said was going to happen earlier, when you were just looking up the class. You're still thinking about that, aren't you? It's like your mind is trying to prepare you for something that might happen, but it's not even focused on the actual class itself. You're worried about what might happen in the future, but what about the present moment? What do you think will happen when you show up to the class, right now? What's the first thing you'll notice, or do? Let's focus on that for a moment.

Patient: Right now I keep seeing myself push open the door and everyone glance up, then whisper — someone gives me that pitying look like they can tell I'm unemployed, the instructor hesitates like I don't belong, and I freeze, my mouth goes dry and I can't answer when someone tries to make small talk. Then I mutter something stupid, leave early, and that proves to me I'm hopeless and nobody will ever take me seriously again. I know you might say that's unlikely, but I can't make myself believe it — my brain just fast-forwards to that exact humiliation every time. Honestly, it's exhausting to even picture going, but I keep getting hooked by the replay of that worst-case loop.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still deeply entrenched in their catastrophic thinking, with a vivid and detailed mental rehearsal of the worst-case scenario. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental exploration of the patient's emotional response to this mental rehearsal, with the aim of helping them recognize that their thoughts are not necessarily reflective of reality.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling to shake off this worst-case scenario, and it's taking a lot of mental energy to even think about going to the class. I want to gently explore this with you, without trying to change anything. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you, right now, when you're imagining this scenario? What emotions are you feeling? Is it anxiety, shame, embarrassment, or something else? Don't try to rationalize or justify your thoughts - just observe them as they are. How do you feel when you're imagining yourself freezing up, or making a mistake, or getting that pitying look? Is there anything in your body that's feeling tense or tight? Let's just explore this moment, together.

Patient: When I picture it I get a tight knot in my chest, my face heats up, and my hands go clammy — it's mostly panic with this deep, sinking shame. My shoulders hunch and I feel like I should just disappear, and that inner voice immediately narrates the humiliation like it's already happened. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop replaying that worst-case loop and it leaves me exhausted.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's emotional response to the catastrophic thinking is intense and overwhelming, with a strong sense of shame and panic. Goal: Introduce a gentle, validating approach to help the patient acknowledge and accept their emotions, rather than trying to suppress or avoid them.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the replay of the worst-case scenario is having a really profound effect on you, both emotionally and physically. The knot in your chest, the heat in your face, the clamminess of your hands - it's like your whole body is responding to this mental rehearsal in a very real way. And the shame... oh, the shame is just so palpable. It's like this inner voice is merciless, replaying the humiliation over and over again. I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I'm not going to try to tell you that this isn't a big deal, or that you should just be stronger. Because the truth is, it is a big deal. It's a huge deal. Your body is responding in a way that's totally understandable, given what you're thinking. And your emotions... oh, your emotions are valid. They're real. They're not just something you need to "toughen up" about. They're just... they're just there. Let's just sit with this for a moment, okay? Let's just be with the shame, the panic, the knot in your chest. We'll explore it together, if you want to.

Patient: Okay, I'll try to sit with it, but it's already heavy — my chest tightens and my head floods with the same replay: if I stay here it'll spiral into full-blown panic, I'll start crying, everyone will think I'm pathetic, they'll whisper, I'll bolt, and that'll prove I never belong. I don't see how sitting with it helps; it just feels like rehearsing the humiliation. Honestly, I'm overwhelmed — can you tell me what to do right now so it doesn't spiral?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to sit with their emotions, and the situation is spiraling out of control. Goal: Introduce a gentle, directive approach to help the patient take a small, practical step towards managing their anxiety and preventing a full-blown panic attack.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's completely understandable given what you're thinking. It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle, and it's hard to know how to break free. But here's what I want you to do right now. I want you to take one tiny breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am safe." Just one word. "Safe." Say it out loud, if you need to. Say it in your head, if that's more comfortable. But say it. Because in this moment, that's all you need to focus on. You need to create a tiny sense of safety, a tiny sense of control. And then, I want you to take another small step. I want you to get up from this chair, and I want you to walk over to a window. Yes, just stand by the window. Look outside for a second. Feel the breeze on your face, if you can. Just stand there for a minute. That's it. Just one minute. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I took a breath and told myself "I am safe" — it felt oddly silly but it loosened the knot a tiny bit. I walked to the window and looked out for a minute; I felt the breeze and saw a couple of neighbors and a bus go by, but honestly my brain keeps saying this is just a calm before the storm — that any second I'll start shaking, everyone will notice, and it'll blow up into the full panic I keep predicting.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a small step towards managing their anxiety, but their catastrophic thinking is still present and dominant. Goal: Introduce a more specific, actionable approach to help the patient challenge their negative predictions and build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're still feeling that sense of impending doom, but I want you to try something for me. I want you to notice the thoughts that are popping up right now. Say them out loud, if you need to. Just acknowledge them, like you're having a conversation with yourself. What's the first thought that's coming up? "This is just a calm before the storm"? Go ahead and say it. Then, I want you to challenge that thought. Ask yourself, "Is that really true? Is this really going to be a panic attack? What makes you think that?" Don't try to rationalize or justify your thoughts - just observe them as they are. And then, I want you to ask yourself, "What's the evidence for this thought?" What is it about your situation that's leading you to believe this is going to blow up? Is it a specific event, a particular memory, or just a general feeling? Let's examine that evidence together. Can you do that for me?

Patient: The first thought is literally "this is the calm before the storm" — I can hear that voice right away. The evidence I see is the pattern: last time I tried something new I froze and left early, an ex told me I was unbearable and that stuck, interviewers have looked at me like I'm not hireable — those memories pile up and feel like proof it'll happen again. I know you want me to look for counter-evidence, but those hopeful scenarios feel like pretending — I can't make myself believe them. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? Give me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now that doesn't feel like a setup for humiliation.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to challenge their negative predictions, and their catastrophic thinking is becoming overwhelming. Goal: Introduce a more gentle, concrete approach to help the patient manage their anxiety in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed, and that's completely understandable. Let's take a step back and focus on something very simple. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just feel the weight of your body distributed on your feet. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you just focus on that for one second? Just notice how your feet feel right now, without trying to think about anything else. Don't worry about your thoughts, just your feet. And if you need to, you can just take one small breath in, and then just notice your feet again. That's it. Just one tiny thing to focus on. Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: I tried — my feet felt heavy and a little cold, and for a second it loosened the knot, but then my brain immediately yelled that it's the calm before the storm and I started picturing freezing in that class and everyone noticing. I'm jumpy and distracted now, my hands are tingly, and it feels like my focus evaporated. Can you give me one other tiny, concrete thing to do right now that doesn’t feel like a setup for humiliation?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty sustaining a present-moment focus, and their catastrophic thinking is resurfacing. Goal: Introduce a simple, grounding exercise to help the patient refocus and regain a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're getting jumpy and distracted again, and that's okay. Let's try something even simpler than focusing on your feet. I want you to notice the sound of your breath. Just listen to the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you hear it? It might be a soft hissing sound, or a gentle whooshing sound. Just listen to that right now. Don't try to think about anything else, just listen to the sound of your breath. And then, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath right now. Just feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: I could hear the soft whoosh for a moment, but it didn't last — my chest is still tight and that same voice is already shouting that any minute I'll start gasping, hyperventilate, everyone will notice and I'll bolt and ruin whatever little chance I had. I'm really jumpy and distracted now; I need one other tiny, concrete thing to do right this second that doesn't feel like a setup for humiliation.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a present-moment focus, and their catastrophic thinking is becoming overwhelming again. Goal: Introduce a final, gentle, and concrete exercise to help the patient regulate their anxiety and take a small step forward.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're really struggling right now, and I want to try one more thing. I want you to take one tiny, small step. Not a big step, just a tiny one. I want you to move your right hand up one inch. Just one inch. That's it. Just move your right hand up one inch. Don't think about anything else, just focus on moving that hand up one inch. And then, I want you to hold it there for just one second. Just one second. Can you do that for me right now? Just one tiny, small step.

Patient: Okay — I moved my right hand up one inch and held it for a second; it's a little shaky and my fingers feel tingly. My chest is still tight and my brain's already yelling that the tremor proves I'll start shaking in public, everyone will notice, and I'll bolt. I'm really jumpy and distracted now — can we slow down? Give me one other tiny, concrete thing to do that won't feel like a setup for humiliation.

The patient is having difficulty sustaining the small step forward, and their catastrophic thinking is resurfacing. Goal: Introduce a gentle, concrete exercise that focuses on the physical sensation, without adding more cognitive load.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're getting jumpy and distracted again. Let's focus on your physical sensation for a moment. I want you to notice the sensation of your right hand right now. Just feel it. It's a bit shaky, and your fingers feel tingly. That's okay. Just notice that sensation. Don't think about anything else, just feel the sensation of your hand. Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the air on your hand. Is it cool? Is it warm? Just notice the sensation of the air on your hand. Can you do that for me right now? Just focus on your hand.

Patient: It's cool on my hand and my fingers are still tingly, but my brain won't let me rest — it's already yelling that this tremor means I'll start shaking in public, everyone will see I'm fragile, that'll prove I'm unemployable and I'll be humiliated.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is becoming increasingly overwhelmed by their catastrophic thinking, and is struggling to maintain any sense of control. Goal: Introduce a final, gentle, and concrete exercise that focuses on grounding the patient in the present moment, without adding more cognitive load.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're really struggling right now. I want to try one last thing. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just feel the weight of your body distributed on your feet. Don't think about anything else. Just feel the sensation of your feet. When you're ready, we can try to do something else. But for right now, just focus on your feet. Inhale... exhale... Can you do that for me? Just for a second.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried the breath and felt my feet, but my chest is still tight and that voice is already screaming that I'll start shaking and everyone will notice. I don't see how feeling my feet stops the replay; it just feels confusing and kind of useless right now. I'm getting jumpy and distracted — can you give me one tiny, concrete thing to do that actually feels safe instead of like a setup for humiliation?


--- Turn 16 ---

The patient is becoming increasingly frustrated and jumpy, and the previous exercises are not providing the sense of safety and grounding they need. Goal: Introduce a very simple and concrete action that may provide a sense of control and calm.

Patient: I closed them for a second, but it made me lightheaded and my chest slammed shut — the instant I closed my eyes my brain screamed that I'll start gasping, fall over, people will swarm, someone will notice I'm unemployed and it'll be a spectacle. I'm not sure I follow how that helps; it just feels like setting me up to panic. Can you give me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now that actually feels safe — like put my hand on my heart and count to five or squeeze my fingers together — something I can do without everyone noticing?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a high level of distress and is unable to tolerate any further surprises. Goal: Introduce a very simple, gentle, and concrete action that allows the patient to feel a sense of control and calm, while minimizing the risk of escalating their anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
I'm sorry it felt like that. I just want to try something very simple. I want you to put your hand on your chest. Just rest your hand on your heart. Don't try to do anything else, just rest your hand there. And I want you to take a slow, deep breath in. Just breathe in for a second. And then, I want you to exhale slowly. Just breathe out for a second. That's it. Just breathe and rest your hand on your chest. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest and breathed in and out slowly; my palm felt warm and my heart was racing but the tightness eased a tiny bit. But already that voice is yelling that I'm just calming before a collapse — "you'll start gasping, everyone will stare, they'll see you're unemployed and it'll be a spectacle," — I don't see how this helps, it just feels like practicing the panic. Can you give me one other tiny, private thing to do right now that won't feel like a setup for humiliation — like squeeze my fingers or count backwards quietly?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to break the cycle of catastrophic thinking, and the gentle exercises are not providing the sense of control and calm they need. Goal: Introduce a very small, private, and concrete action that may help the patient focus on the present moment and distract them from their racing thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
I'm sorry it's not working. I just want to try something very small. I want you to gently pinch the pads of your fingers together. Just squeeze them slightly, just for a second. Don't think about anything else, just squeeze them. And then, release. Just let go. That's it. Just pinch and release. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I pinched the pads of my fingers together and released; my fingers felt a hair steadier and the knot eased a tiny bit, but of course my brain's already yelling that the tremor proves I'll start shaking in public and everyone will notice and it'll confirm I'm hopeless. I'm not sure I follow how this helps — can you give me one more tiny, private thing to do right now, like quietly count backwards from five or press my thumb into my palm, something nobody could possibly see?

I'm sorry it's not working. I want to try something very simple. I want you to press your thumb gently into the palmar surface of your hand, just below your wrist. Just press it down, just for a second. Don't think about anything else, just feel the sensation of your thumb pressing into your hand. It's a very subtle feeling, but it might be enough to distract you from your thoughts for a second. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I pressed my thumb into my hand and it steadied me for a second, but now my head's racing and I'm even jumpier than before. My brain's already shouting that this is just a trick and that I'll start trembling in public, everyone will notice, and it'll prove I'm hopeless. Can you give me one more tiny, private thing to do right now — like silently count backward from five while keeping my thumb pressed — something nobody could possibly see?

The patient is experiencing a high level of distress and is having difficulty sustaining any sense of calm or control. Goal: Introduce a final, very small, and private action that may help the patient focus on their physical sensations and calm their racing thoughts, while minimizing the risk of escalating their anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to silently count backwards from five, keeping your thumb pressed into your hand. Just focus on the numbers, one at a time. Five... four... three... two... one. As you count, just feel the sensation of your thumb pressing into your hand, and the sensation of your body on the chair. Don't think about anything else. Just focus on the counting and the physical sensations. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I did it: five, four, three, two, one, pressed my thumb the whole time. It loosened the knot a hair and my fingers felt steadier, but I'm still jittery and my brain's already screaming that this is just a pause before the collapse — that any second I'll start shaking in public, people will see I'm weak, and it'll prove I'm hopeless. I'm not sure I follow how counting from five actually helps; it just feels like a weird band-aid.


--- Turn 21 ---

The patient is struggling to understand how the small action of counting backwards from five is helping them, and is experiencing a high level of distress despite the slight loosening of their physical tension. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental acknowledgment of the patient's experience, and a final, brief attempt to help them feel more grounded before ending the session.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and like no matter what I say or do, you're still stuck in this feeling of impending collapse. I want you to know that I believe you, and that I'm here with you. It's okay to feel this way, and it's okay to be scared. But I also want to acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, right here, right now, with the tools and resources you have. And that's something to be proud of. I'm going to take one final deep breath with you, and then I'm going to wrap this up. Are you ready to bring this to a close?

Patient: No — I'm not ready to close. That idea of wrapping up just makes me more panicky, like if we stop now I'll go home and replay the humiliation on loop until I convince myself I'm ruined. I'm feeling jumpy and overwhelmed and I need us to slow down — give me one concrete, private thing to do right now that I can keep using when the worst-case loop starts (something like a 30-second grounding I can do quietly).


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still highly anxious and resistant to ending the session. Goal: Introduce a brief, concrete grounding exercise that the patient can use to calm themselves when they start to feel overwhelmed again.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving out of your body. Just focus on the sensation of the breath leaving your body. As you breathe out, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the weight of your body distributed on your feet. Feel the sensation of the air on your skin. Just focus on that for 10 seconds. When you're ready, you can take another deep breath in. Just take it one step at a time. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I tried — I breathed in and out for ten seconds like you asked, and it loosened the knot a hair, but now I'm actually jumpier and my head's flooded with the same image that I'll start gasping and everyone will notice and it'll be a spectacle. I'm not sure I follow how that really helps beyond a second — it just feels confusing. Give me one concrete, private 30‑second grounding I can do quietly when the worst‑case loop starts (something like a specific counting or pressure pattern I can use without anyone seeing), and please don't try to wrap up — I need us to keep going.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a high level of distress and is having difficulty sustaining any sense of calm or control. Goal: Introduce a brief, concrete grounding exercise that the patient can use to calm themselves when they start to feel overwhelmed again, and continue the session without wrapping up.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try a specific counting pattern. Bring your attention to your left hand, and count to five slowly. As you count, notice the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're resting on. Now, bring your attention to your right hand, and count to five again. As you do this, notice the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're resting on. Continue to alternate hands, counting to five in each hand, and focusing on the sensation of your fingers. This should help you focus on the present moment, and calm your racing thoughts. Can you do this for me, even if it feels a little silly? Just focus on the counting, and the sensation of your fingers.

Patient: I did it — left hand one to five, right hand one to five, alternated a few times — and it calmed me for maybe twenty seconds, but of course my brain's already yelling that it’s just postponing the collapse: I’ll be counting and then suddenly start shaking, someone will notice my hands, ask if I’m okay, and that’ll out me as unemployed and hopeless. My fingers are a bit steadier but my chest’s still tight and I’m jumpy. I don’t really believe any of this will stop the loop, but please give me one very specific, private 30‑second grounding I can do when the worst‑case story starts (exact steps I can do quietly, like pressing my thumb and counting backwards), and don’t try to wrap up — I need us to keep working on this.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a high level of distress and is having difficulty sustaining any sense of calm or control. Goal: Introduce a brief, specific, and concrete grounding exercise that the patient can use to calm themselves when the worst-case scenario starts.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try a specific pressure pattern on your hand. Press your thumb into the webbing between your thumb and index finger, just below the knuckle. Hold it there for a second. Now, slowly count backwards from ten, starting from ten: ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. As you count, notice the sensation of your thumb pressing into the webbing, and the sensation of the air on your skin. Just focus on the counting and the sensation of your thumb. Don't think about anything else. Can you do this for me when you start to feel overwhelmed again? Just try to focus on the counting and the pressure on your thumb.

Patient: I can try that. I pressed the webbing and counted down from ten — it calmed me for maybe twenty seconds, but my brain's already screaming that it's just a pause before I start gasping and everyone will notice. I'm jumpy and distracted and honestly not sure I follow how pressing my thumb stops the replay — it feels like a weird band‑aid. Give me one more private 30‑second thing I can do if the counting starts to fail, and don't try to wrap up; I need us to keep working on this.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Close your eyes and bring your attention to the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without thinking about anything else. Try to notice the sensation of the air as it enters, fills the lungs, and then leaves the body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the sensation of the breath. Don't try to control your breathing or change it in any way. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Can you do this for me when you start to feel overwhelmed again? Just try to focus on the sensation of the breath.

Patient: I can try to focus on my breath when I get overwhelmed, but I'm already picturing it being the "calm before the collapse" — I'll start, then suddenly gasp and everyone will see me falling apart. My chest's still tight and I'm jumpy, so I'll do the breath thing, but please give me one more private, 30‑second fallback (something tactile and quiet) I can use if the breathing starts to fail.
