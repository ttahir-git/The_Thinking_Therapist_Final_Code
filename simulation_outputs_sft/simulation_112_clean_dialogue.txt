Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed and just... low since the breakup — I have no motivation, and it's spilling into my relationships and even my shifts at the hospital. I've had OCD for years, and lately the rituals and replaying things in my head have gotten worse. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to do anything?

Therapist: I understand that you're feeling skeptical about talking about this, and that's completely okay. It's natural to wonder if anything can change. But I want to ask you something: What is it about your life right now that's most important to you? What are the things that you value deeply, even if it feels like they're being lost right now?
(Justified pivot: I'm introducing a value-based inquiry because the patient's OCD and lack of motivation are described as having a significant impact on their daily life, including their work at the hospital. By exploring their core values, we can better understand how their current avoidance strategies are unworkable and how ACT might help them reconnect with their goals.)

Patient: Mostly I care about being useful — my patients, my family, and keeping the independence I've worked for after all these years as a nurse. Right now I feel numb, can't get motivated, and my OCD just keeps me stuck replaying everything instead of actually living those values. How is focusing on values supposed to help? I've tried telling myself that before and it doesn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you've tried to connect with these values before, and it hasn't stuck yet. Can I ask you to try something slightly differently? Instead of focusing on "being useful," let's explore what it might mean to you to take one small step towards being useful right now, even if it feels insignificant. Maybe it's just getting out of bed 10 minutes earlier than usual, or responding to a message from a family member. What would that look like, and how does it feel to even consider it?
(Justified defusion: I'm introducing defusion by asking the patient to imagine taking a small, specific action related to their valued outcome (being useful). This is meant to help them see that their OCD is not preventing them from acting on their values, but rather getting in the way of even considering those actions. By taking small, concrete steps, they can begin to build momentum and re-establish their connection to their valued goals.)

Patient: Maybe I could try answering the message from my daughter — it's been sitting there and I just stare at it. But when I think about doing it my hands go cold and the OCD starts looping everything I said in the breakup, so I freeze. How is replying to one message supposed to help? I mean, I’ve tried little steps before and they don’t stick, but... if I actually did it, maybe it'd feel a little less heavy.

Therapist: It sounds like taking one message from your daughter could be a small but important step. Instead of focusing on how it's going to make you feel, can you just commit to doing it right now? Just pick up that phone, type a message, and hit send. That's it. No thinking about the OCD, no thinking about the breakup, just taking that one action. Can you do that for me?
(Justified commitment: I'm encouraging the patient to commit to a small, concrete action without worrying about the outcome or their emotions. By doing so, they can start to build a sense of agency and momentum, which is a key aspect of ACT. This approach helps the patient focus on the process of taking the action, rather than getting stuck on the potential outcomes or their internal struggles.)

Patient: Okay... I can try, but my hands are cold just thinking about it and I might freeze halfway through. I could send something really simple like, "Hey, I saw your message — I'll call you later," if that seems doable. But honestly, how is sending one short text supposed to make this feel any less heavy?

Therapist: It's not about sending a perfect message or resolving the emotional pain in one text. It's about taking a tiny step towards reconnecting with your daughter, despite your current state. Can you ask yourself, what's the smallest thing you can do right now that feels like "enough"? Is it sending that simple text, or is it even just thinking about doing it? It's not about curing your OCD or breaking up with your daughter, it's just about taking that one tiny action. Sometimes, "enough" is just enough.
(Justified ACT concept: I'm introducing the concept of "enough" in ACT, which is about recognizing that our actions, even if imperfect, can contribute to our overall progress. This approach helps the patient focus on the present moment, rather than getting stuck on the idea that they need to achieve some sort of perfection or resolution. By acknowledging that "enough" is just enough, the patient can start to build a sense of acceptance and momentum.)

Patient: Alright — I can try sending, "Hey, saw your message — I'll call you later." But I'm scared it'll feel fake and my OCD will kick in and I'll delete it half‑way through. How is that supposed to help if it's just a half‑hearted line? I don't know, maybe it's worth trying, but my hands are still shaking and I'm nervous.

Therapist: Can you just say the words, "Hey, saw your message — I'll call you later." without adding anything else? Just those exact words, without thinking about it too much, without worrying about how it'll sound, or whether it's "real." Can you just type them, and then see what happens? Maybe the words themselves will help calm your OCD, or maybe you'll be surprised by how much it means to actually say those words.
(Justified defusion: I'm introducing defusion directly into the text, asking the patient to simply type the words without adding any thought or analysis. This helps the patient focus on the present moment and the physical action, rather than getting caught up in their thoughts about the text's perceived sincerity or value.)

Patient: Okay — I typed "Hey, saw your message — I'll call you later." and I actually hit send, even though my hands were shaking and I wanted to delete it. It felt hollow and the OCD immediately started yelling that it was fake, so how is that supposed to help if the same loop kicks in afterward? I'm trying to see if this will stick, but I'm skeptical.

Therapist: It sounds like the OCD is still yelling at you, but can you just give it a few minutes? Can you just acknowledge the feeling, and then let it go? Think of it like this: you've done something, sent the text, and that's taken some courage. Now, can you just allow the OCD to do its thing for a bit, without getting caught up in it? You don't have to react to it right now, just observe it. Can you do that for just a minute?
(Justified ACT concept: I'm introducing the concept of "temporarily" in ACT, which is about acknowledging a difficult feeling or thought, but then giving it a specific time limit (e.g., "just for a minute"). This helps the patient develop a sense of acceptance and curiosity, rather than getting caught up in the OCD's criticism or their own resistance.)

Patient: Alright, I can try to sit with it for a minute, but my mind's already racing — the same replayed lines from the breakup, my hands cold, stomach tight. I don't get how just watching it for sixty seconds is supposed to quiet it; I've tried mindfulness before and it just made me notice the same loop louder. I'll give it a go, but if I start spiraling, what do you want me to do?

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts racing – it's normal. Can you just notice where your hand is on your lap, how your feet are touching the floor? No judgment, just observation. When you start to notice the replayed lines, can you say to yourself, "Okay, it's happening again"? Not like you're engaging with it, just acknowledging it's there. Then, can you ask yourself, "What's happening when I notice this thought?" Not to fight it, but just to observe it. What's your body doing when you notice this thought? What's your breath like?
(Justified inquiry: I'm introducing a gentle, non-judgmental inquiry to help the patient acknowledge their sensations and explore their relationship with them. This is meant to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and acceptance, rather than getting caught up in their own resistance or the OCD's criticism.)

Patient: Okay... my hand's on my lap, fingers curled, feet flat, breath shallow and a bit quick. My chest feels tight, shoulders up, stomach twisted — I can say, "Okay, it's happening again," and I did, and for a second the replay softens but then the loop gets louder. How is noticing my breath supposed to quiet it when mindfulness before just amplified the same damn loop? If I start spiraling, what do you actually want me to do next — keep sitting with it, or is there a practical trick that doesn't just make me more aware of the pain?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting some clarity on what's happening when you notice the loop. Now, can you try something? When you notice the replayed lines, instead of saying, "Okay, it's happening again," can you try saying, "Notice where I'm holding my breath"? Just acknowledge the sensation of holding your breath, without trying to change it. Then, can you ask yourself, "What's the body doing right now when I think about the breakup?" Try to describe the sensations in your chest, shoulders, stomach, and hands. Can you just describe what's happening in the present moment, without judgment or trying to change it?
(Justified shift: I'm introducing a subtle shift in focus, encouraging the patient to explore the relationship between their physical sensations and the thoughts, rather than just observing the thoughts themselves. This is meant to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and acceptance, rather than getting caught up in their own resistance or the OCD's criticism.)

Patient: Okay — I said “Notice where I’m holding my breath.” My chest feels like a tight band, shoulders up near my ears, stomach a hard knot, and my hands are cold and curled; my breathing’s shallow and quick. For a beat the replay quieted, then it ramped up and I felt stuck again. How is describing all that supposed to help when mindfulness just makes the loop louder — if I start spiraling, what do you actually want me to do besides keep noticing it?

Therapist: I want you to take a look at the clock on the wall. Just notice it, without thinking about anything else. Can you see the numbers, the hands, the time? Just observe it. Then, I want you to bring your attention back to your body. Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the feeling of the chair beneath you, the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you just focus on one thing, like the sensation of your foot on the floor? Don't try to think about anything else, just notice that sensation.
(Justified grounding: I'm introducing a sense of grounding, encouraging the patient to focus on their immediate environment and the physical sensations in their body. This is meant to help the patient develop a sense of calm and stability, rather than getting caught up in their own thoughts and emotions.)

Patient: Okay... the clock's hands are near three, the numbers a little fuzzy. My foot's flat on the floor, it's kind of heavy and numb, the chair presses into my hips and the air feels cool on my arm. I did what you asked, but honestly — how is noticing that supposed to help when my head won't stop replaying everything?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting some clarity on your physical sensations. Now, I want you to try something slightly different. Instead of trying to notice the clock or your foot, can you just ask yourself, "What's the relationship between this physical sensation and the thought that just came up"? For example, you might say to yourself, "This numbness in my foot is connected to the feeling of being stuck and unable to move forward." Just explore that relationship for a moment. Can you find any interesting connections or patterns?
(Justified shift: I'm introducing a subtle shift in focus, encouraging the patient to explore the relationship between their physical sensations and the thoughts, rather than trying to suppress or escape from them. This is meant to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and acceptance, rather than getting caught up in their own resistance or the OCD's criticism.)

Patient: Yeah... the numbness in my foot really does feel like being stuck — like I can't take a step forward. The tight band in my chest and the knot in my stomach match the replayed lines, like my body's bracing every time the memory comes up. The fuzzy clock makes time feel like it's just dragging, days blending into one. But honestly, how is pointing out these connections supposed to change anything? It just feels like naming the pain without moving it.

Therapist: I understand that it might feel like naming the pain without moving it. But I want to ask you to consider this: what if we don't try to change everything at once? What if we just focus on one small step, one small insight? What if that's enough to make a difference, even if it's just for a moment? Can you commit to just exploring these connections for the next few minutes, without trying to change anything or achieve some specific outcome? Just focus on noticing, and see what happens.
(Justified commitment: I'm introducing a sense of commitment to the exploration, encouraging the patient to focus on the present moment and explore the connections without trying to achieve a specific outcome. This is meant to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and acceptance, and to create a sense of momentum towards change.)

Patient: Alright... I’ll try to sit with those connections for a few minutes and notice how the numbness and the replay link up. I’m still skeptical it’ll actually change anything — often it just makes the hurt louder. If I start spiraling, give me one quick, concrete thing to do so I don’t get lost.

Therapist: If you start to feel yourself spiraling or the replay becomes overwhelming, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then type out the single phrase, "I am here." Just that phrase. Type it out slowly and clearly, and then look at the words on the screen. Say it out loud if you need to. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm providing a simple, concrete action that the patient can use to manage their emotions and prevent spiraling. The phrase "I am here" serves as a reminder that they are present and can take control of their emotions, and the physical act of typing it out can help to ground them.)

Patient: I typed "I am here." I said it out loud, slow. It steadied me for a beat, but my chest's still tight and the replay's already nudging back — how is that supposed to stop it if it just comes right back?

Therapist: It's not about stopping the replay completely. It's about noticing when it comes back, and taking a different approach. Can you try something for me? When the replay starts again, try not to engage with it as much. Instead, ask yourself, "What do I want to do with this thought?" Don't try to change it or fight it, just observe what you're feeling. Do you want to push it away, or acknowledge it? Do you want to try to make sense of it, or just let it be? What do you want to do with this thought?
(Justified exploration: I'm introducing a new approach to managing the OCD, by exploring the idea that progress may not be linear, and that setbacks are a normal part of the process. This is meant to help the patient develop a more flexible and adaptive approach to dealing with their OCD.)

Patient: My instinct is to shove it away or try to make sense of it — both just fuel the loop. Maybe what I want is to let it be and notice it without following it, though I'm skeptical it will actually stick; I'm wiped and this feels like a lot to keep doing. How is not engaging with it supposed to help in the long run?

Therapist: I can see why you're skeptical, and it's okay to feel that way. This isn't going to be easy, and it's normal to feel like it's a lot to keep doing. But I want to ask you to try to approach this with a bit more kindness towards yourself. You're already doing something that's hard, and that's taking the time to try to manage your OCD. It's not going to magically disappear, but what you are trying to do is a brave and important thing. Can you try to be gentle with yourself for a moment, and acknowledge that this is hard? You don't have to have all the answers, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.
(Justified self-compassion: I'm introducing a sense of self-compassion and acknowledging the difficulty of the task, which is meant to help the patient develop a more supportive and understanding relationship with themselves. This is crucial in helping them stay motivated and engaged in the process.)

Patient: Okay... I can try to be a bit gentler with myself, but it already feels like something else I’m going to mess up. How is "being kind" actually supposed to quiet the replay when it hits hard? If it ramps up, give me one concrete thing I can do right then that isn't just "notice it" — something I can actually do in the moment.

Therapist: I want you to do something physical, something small, something that you can do in this moment. When the replay starts to feel overwhelming, I want you to take a deep breath in, and then pinch the bridge of your nose between your thumb and index finger. Just pinch it gently, but firmly, for a count of four. Then, let go. Just that. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a specific, physical action that the patient can do in the moment to help calm their OCD. This is meant to provide a concrete, tangible way to manage their emotions and interrupt the replay.)

Patient: Alright... I did it — pinched the bridge for four and let go. It steadied my breath for a beat, felt like a tiny pause, but my chest's still tight and the replay's nudging back already — how is that supposed to stop it from coming right back?

Therapist: It's not about stopping the replay completely. It's about finding small moments of control, like when you pinched the bridge of your nose. Those moments can be tiny, but they're still a step forward. Can you try to focus on those small moments of control, rather than getting caught up in the idea that the replay will never stop? Just notice when you're feeling a sense of steadiness, like after pinching the bridge of your nose. What are you feeling in that moment? What's your body like? Can you just be present with that feeling for a moment?
(Justified focus on progress: I'm introducing a focus on the small moments of control and progress, rather than getting caught up in the idea that it won't stop. This is meant to help the patient develop a more realistic and hopeful perspective, and to encourage them to celebrate their small victories.)

Patient: Okay — when I pinch it actually slows my breathing, my shoulders drop a notch and there's this tiny steadying in my chest, like a blink of space. It helps for a beat, then the replay barges back and the tightness returns. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that blink keeps it from coming back — how is that supposed to help me later when I'm mid‑shift and it’s roaring? Give me one concrete thing I can do right then that actually interrupts the loop, not just watch it.

Therapist: I want you to try something different right now. When the replay starts to feel overwhelming, I want you to look away from the thought, and then take a small step to the side, even if it's just an inch. Just get up and move your body for a second. Don't worry about where you're going, just get out of your seat. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can interrupt the loop more effectively by physically moving the patient's body. This is meant to provide a more tangible way to break the cycle of the OCD.)

Patient: Okay... I stood up and shuffled an inch — felt ridiculous, but my shoulders dropped a notch and the replay quieted for a second. Still, how is an inch supposed to help when I'm mid‑shift and it's roaring while I'm at the med cart? I've tried moving before and it just delays it or makes me look weird; give me one concrete thing I can do at work that actually interrupts the loop and won't get me written up.

Therapist: I want you to focus on your hands right now. When the replay starts, I want you to make a deliberate mistake with your gloved hand - like dropping a sponge or knocking over a cup of water. Just do it on purpose. Not to clean it up, just to make a deliberate mistake. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can be done at work without drawing attention to the OCD, by focusing on a specific task that can be done imperfectly. This is meant to provide a tangible way to interrupt the loop and give the patient a sense of control.)

Patient: No — I can't just go dropping stuff on purpose around meds, that could get me written up or worse. How is that supposed to help? I'm not sure I follow — maybe a safer thing I could do is squeeze a pen in my pocket, press my thumb into my palm, or tap the cart twice when it starts roaring. I'm skeptical that'll do much, but I can try something that won't get me in trouble.

Therapist: Those are all good ideas. Squeezing a pen, pressing your thumb into your palm, or tapping the cart twice are all simple actions that can help you focus on something else when the OCD starts. They're also low-risk, so you don't have to worry about getting in trouble. What's most important is that you're doing something to help calm yourself down and take your mind off the OCD. Can you try one of those actions right now when it starts roaring?
(Justified simple action: I'm introducing a simple, low-risk action that can help interrupt the OCD. This is meant to provide a tangible way to help the patient manage their symptoms without drawing attention to the OCD or risking their job.)

Patient: Alright — I tried squeezing a pen in my pocket and pressing my thumb into my palm just now and it steadied me for a breath, like the pinch did, but the chest tightness comes back pretty fast. I can do that at the cart without anyone noticing and maybe it helps a little, but honestly — how is that supposed to fix anything long‑term? I'm worn out and it feels like slapping a band‑aid on a sore that won't heal; give me one more practical thing I can do mid‑shift that actually *interrupts* the loop without making me look odd.

Therapist: I want you to try something specific to your work, something that you can focus on without looking away from the task at hand. When the OCD starts, I want you to focus on the sounds around you. Listen to the beeps of the machines, the murmur of the other staff, the rustle of papers. Try to identify the different sounds, like a particular beep pattern or the sound of someone walking down the aisle. Just focus on the sounds, try to tune them out. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can be done in a busy work environment, without drawing attention, that can help interrupt the OCD. This is meant to provide a tangible way to help the patient manage their symptoms, by distracting them from their internal struggles and providing a sense of focus.)

Patient: I tried it — picked out the beeps, a squeak from a cart, someone laughing down the hall — it gave me a tiny slack in my chest, like the pinch did, but the replay barged back pretty fast. I'm not sure I follow how tuning into sounds actually turns into stopping it when I'm mid‑shift and stressed. I've tried distractions before and they don't stick — so give me one concrete, low‑risk thing I can do right there that actually interrupts the loop and won't get me in trouble.

Therapist: When the OCD starts, I want you to take a deep breath and say one word out loud: "Let it go." Just one word. Say it clearly, with conviction. Not like you're trying to convince yourself, but like you're telling it to let go. Can you do that for me right now?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a simple, low-risk action that can be done in a busy work environment, without drawing attention, that can help interrupt the OCD. This is meant to provide a tangible way to help the patient manage their symptoms, by creating a moment of pause and clarity.)

Patient: I tried saying "Let it go" out loud just now — it sounded stupid and hollow and didn't stop the replay, just made my voice shake. How is that supposed to help me on the ward without drawing attention? I'm wiped and this is getting old — tell me one concrete, low‑risk thing I can do right there, right then, that actually interrupts it without making me look odd.

Therapist: Can you please just turn off the light switch on your cart? Just turn it off, and then turn it back on. It's a simple physical action that can help distract you from the OCD. Just do it.
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a simple, low-risk action that can be done immediately to interrupt the OCD. This is meant to provide a tangible way to help the patient manage their symptoms, by providing a momentary distraction from their internal struggles.)

Patient: Alright — I flipped the cart light off and on like you said. It bought me a tiny pause, shoulders eased for a second, but the replay's already barging back and my chest's tight. How is that supposed to stop it when I'm mid‑shift and can't be flicking switches all day? Give me one practical thing that actually breaks it for longer, not just another quick pause.

Therapist: I want you to take a small piece of paper from your pocket and fold it into a small square. Just fold it once. Then, I want you to place it in front of you on the cart, and write a single word on it: "STOP". Just one word. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can be done in a variety of settings to help interrupt the OCD. By creating a tangible object with a clear message, the patient can create a sense of presence and focus on the task at hand, which may help to interrupt the OCD loop for a longer period.)

Patient: Okay... I folded the scrap, wrote "STOP" in shaky letters and propped it on the cart. It gave me a blink of relief—one breath—and then the replay shoved right back in. How is that supposed to help for longer on a twelve‑hour shift? I can't be inventing tiny rituals all day; give me one practical, low‑risk thing that actually breaks it for a longer stretch without making me look odd.

Therapist: I want you to take a different approach. Instead of trying to control the OCD, I want you to focus on your breathing. When you start to feel overwhelmed, I want you to take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to let go of everything else and just be present with the breath. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can be done in a variety of settings to help interrupt the OCD. By focusing on breathing, the patient can create a sense of calm and presence, which may help to interrupt the OCD loop for a longer period.)

Patient: Okay — I can do the slow breaths, and yeah it calmed me for a beat, but the replay comes roaring back every time. How is that supposed to help long‑term when I'm on the floor for twelve hours? I'm wiped — give me one concrete, low‑risk thing I can do mid‑shift that actually keeps the loop quieter for, say, ten minutes, not just thirty seconds.

Therapist: I want you to try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the OCD itself, I want you to focus on your physical body. When you start to feel overwhelmed, I want you to take a few moments to notice your physical sensations in a different way. Instead of trying to push away the OCD, I want you to acknowledge the physical sensations that arise when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Notice the tension in your muscles, the tightness in your throat, the racing of your heart. Just acknowledge these sensations without trying to change them. Then, I want you to try a gentle, small movement that engages your body and calms your mind. It could be anything from rolling your shoulders, to unclenching your fists, to gently tapping your feet on the floor. Just one small movement. Can you do that for me?
(Justified concrete action: I'm introducing a concrete action that can be done in a variety of settings to help interrupt the OCD. By focusing on physical sensations and engaging in a small movement, the patient can create a sense of calm and presence, which may help to interrupt the OCD loop for a longer period.)

Patient: I tried rolling my shoulders, unclenching my fists and tapping my foot — it gave me a tiny blink of relief and then the replay slammed back in. How is that supposed to hold for ten minutes on the floor? Give me one concrete, low‑risk thing I can do mid‑shift that actually keeps it quieter for longer without making me look odd — I don't have the energy for more trial‑and‑error right now.
