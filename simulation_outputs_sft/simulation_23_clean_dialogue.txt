Patient: Lately I've been caught in a repetitive loop of harsh self-criticism after any perceived failure, which I can trace back to a history of difficult romantic relationships that taught me to distrust myself. The financial stress I'm under amplifies the anxiety, and it's maddeningly ironic because I'm pragmatic and organized enough to map the pattern out in detail yet unable to disrupt it emotionally. I also notice I default to intellectualizing—using theoretical language about attachment and rumination—rather than saying plainly that I'm anxious or afraid.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right after you notice that self-criticism loop starts? What's the first thing that feels most connected to the present moment? For example, do you notice any physical sensations or a specific thought that you're thinking? We can start exploring what's just beneath the surface, without needing to name it exactly, and see if we can make some small space for it.

Patient: Right away there's an internal narrator that kicks in—an evaluative, almost clinical-sounding voice that says things like "You messed up again" or "Of course you couldn't handle that," and that feels like the root of the loop. At the same time I notice a subtle constriction in my chest and my breathing gets shallower, but instead of sitting with the discomfort I mentally categorize it as an "anticipatory error-detection response" and start analyzing why it happened. So the present moment feels split: a loud critical thought and a quiet physiological tightening, and my defense is to translate the feeling into theory rather than name it as shame or fear.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing a bit of a split, with this critical inner voice and the physical tightening. One of the things I want to try is to gently bring your attention back to the physical sensation, without immediately trying to label it or explain it away. Can you try to just notice the feeling of the breath moving in and out, the sensation of the chest, for just a moment? Let's see if we can bring that to the surface, without getting too caught up in thinking about what it means.

Patient: Okay—when I try to follow my breath it's shallow, mostly in the upper chest, a small tightness just under my sternum, and my shoulders tense up. Almost immediately I catch myself narrating it—"anticipatory error-detection," "sympathetic arousal"—and that commentary pulls me out of the sensation. I'm feeling a bit impatient and self-conscious about not being able to stay with it; can we slow down?

Therapist: It can feel really frustrating when we try to stay with something and it slips away, right? It's like we're getting caught up in the effort to focus, rather than just being with what's happening in the moment. Can you try to let that feeling of frustration be what's present, for just a second? Not try to push through it, not try to change it, just be with it? And then see if we can take just one small breath together, without trying to narrate it or analyze it. Just breathe, together.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Breathing in now: it’s shallow, high in the chest; breathing out, there’s a tiny loosening but the tight spot below my sternum stays. Of course my inner narrator immediately labels it "anticipatory error-detection" and I get annoyed and a little embarrassed that I can’t just stay with it. Can we take one more slow breath together, a bit slower this time?

Therapist: Let's take just one more slow breath together. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out, without trying to analyze it or label it. Just notice the sensation of the breath in your body, without judgment. And when your narrator tries to chime in, gently acknowledge it, "Ah, I see I'm thinking 'anticipatory error-detection' again," and then just let it go. Don't try to push it away, don't try to change it, just let it be what it is. Just breathe, together.

Patient: Ah—I see I'm thinking "anticipatory error-detection" again. I took that slower breath: chest still pretty high, a tiny loosening on the exhale but the tightness under my sternum persists. I can name the thought, but as soon as I do I start dissecting it—attachment hypervigilance, conditioned self-monitoring—which makes me feel embarrassed and stuck. Can we slow it down even more? I'm not sure I'm doing this right.

Therapist: It's okay to feel stuck, it's okay to not know what to do. Let's just slow down even further. Can you focus on the physical sensation in your body, just for a second? Notice the tightness under your sternum, notice the feeling of the breath moving in and out. Don't try to think about it, don't try to analyze it, just notice. Just be with it. We'll take one more slow breath together, and then we'll see where we are. Just breathe, together.

Patient: Okay—breathing in now: still shallow, shoulders lift a bit; breathing out, there's a slight release but the tightness under my sternum stays. My internal commentator immediately labels it "anticipatory hypervigilance," and that makes me feel prickly and a little humiliated that I can't just be with the sensation. Can we slow down even more? Maybe a very slow count or a pause after each breath, because if I don't get that structure I default to analysis.

Therapist: Let's try a very slow count, just one breath at a time. Inhale for a count of four: one... two... three... four. Hold for a count of four. Five... six... seven... eight. Exhale for a count of four: one... two... three... four. Hold for a count of four. Five... six... seven... eight. Let's focus on just the breath, and let's leave the thinking alone for now. Just breathe, and then we'll check in again. Ready? Inhale...

Patient: Inhale... one... two... three... four. Hold... five... six... seven... eight. Exhale... one... two... three... four. Hold... five... six... seven... eight.

That gave a tiny loosening, but the tightness under my sternum is still there. My narrator immediately labeled it "physiological correlate of shame," which made me feel embarrassed and sort of stuck in analysis. Can we try a slower cycle—maybe six-count inhale with a longer pause—because if there isn't more structure I default to dissecting everything.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. For the inhale, we'll still use the six-count: one... two... three... four... five... six. But this time, let's pause for a slightly longer time before exhaling. Let's hold for a count of ten. Then, exhale for a count of six: one... two... three... four... five... six. Hold again for a count of ten. See if we can create a bit more space between the breaths, and if we can slow down the internal commentary. Just breathe, and let's focus on the sensation in your body. Inhale...

Patient: Inhale... one... two... three... four... five... six. Hold... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Exhale... one... two... three... four... five... six. Hold... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten.

There's a tiny unclenching on the exhale but the tightness under my sternum stays, and my inner narrator immediately tags it as an "embodied shame signal," which makes me feel prickly and a bit humiliated. Can we slow it down more or add a simple anchor—like placing a hand on my chest—because without extra structure I default to dissecting everything.

Therapist: Let's try a slightly different approach. I want you to place your hand gently on your chest, just under the sternum. Notice the sensation of your hand touching your body, notice the feeling of the skin, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Just be with that sensation for a moment. Now, let's try the same slow count as before. Inhale... one... two... three... four... five... six. Hold... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Place your hand on your chest again, just to remind yourself to focus on your body. Exhale... one... two... three... four... five... six. Hold... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Just breathe, and focus on the sensation in your body.

Patient: Hand on my chest — it's warm and a little clammy; the tightness under my sternum feels sharper and my breathing's gone tinier and quicker, like my heart's nudging toward a faster tempo. My mind keeps producing meta-comments — "somatic hyperarousal," "catastrophic cascade" — which only amps the jitteriness and makes me feel embarrassed and oddly irritable. I think I need a simpler anchor than long counts right now; could we try a brief five-senses grounding or a one-minute guided muscle relax instead?

Therapist: Let's try a brief grounding exercise. I want you to close your eyes for just a second, and focus on your five senses. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Notice the sounds around you, even if they're faint. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the chair beneath you. Notice the sensation of your hand on your chest, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out. Just notice these sensations, without trying to think about them. Take one deep breath, and then I'll guide you through a short muscle relaxation exercise.

Patient: I closed my eyes and did the five-sense scan: air at my nostrils, a faint hum of traffic, feet planted, chair under me, hand warm on my chest—but my breath stayed shallow and my heart felt like it wanted to speed up. My mind immediately went into meta-cognitive chatter—“somatic hyperarousal,” “catastrophic cascade”—which just makes me feel prickly and a bit humiliated, like I should be able to regulate this myself. Can we slow down and do a very brief, structured muscle relaxation—just shoulders and jaw, one minute—so I have a concrete task instead of spiraling into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try a very brief, structured muscle relaxation exercise. I want you to bring your attention to your shoulders, just for a second. Imagine that you're slowly letting go of any tension, any stress, any tightness, as you exhale. Starting from the base of your neck, bring your attention down to your shoulders, and as you inhale, imagine that you're filling them with a sense of relaxation. As you exhale, imagine that you're letting go of any remaining tension. Just focus on your shoulders for a moment, and let them relax. Now, bring your attention to your jaw. Imagine that you're letting go of any clenching, any grinding, any tension, as you exhale. Starting from the center of your jaw, bring your attention down to your chin, and as you inhale, imagine that you're filling it with a sense of relaxation. As you exhale, imagine that you're letting go of any remaining tension. Just focus on your jaw for another moment, and let it relax. You're doing great. Just breathe, and let's take a moment to collect ourselves. Take one more deep breath, and when you're ready, we can slowly come back to the present. Ready?

Patient: I took that deep breath—there was a very small unclenching, but the tightness under my sternum and a fast little heartbeat stayed, and my breathing feels tinier and more high-up than before. My mind has already re-engaged in meta-analysis—“autonomic hyperarousal” and “critic reactivation”—which makes me feel embarrassed and oddly jittery, like I'm failing at calming down. I could use more concrete structure right now—maybe a two-minute body scan from feet to head, or an exercise where we simply name the inner critic aloud together so it loses some power—can we try one of those?

Therapist: Let's try a two-minute body scan. I want you to bring your attention to your toes, starting at the base. Notice how they feel, notice any sensations, any sensations of tension or relaxation. As you inhale, imagine that you're filling your toes with a sense of relaxation. As you exhale, imagine that you're letting go of any remaining tension. Slowly scan up through your body, noticing each part as you go. Your feet, your ankles, your calves, your knees, your thighs, your hips, your lower back, your upper back, your shoulders, your arms, your hands, your neck, and finally, your head. Take a deep breath, and notice how each part feels. As you exhale, imagine that you're letting go of any remaining tension. Let's take a moment to focus on our bodies, and let's let go of any thoughts or distractions. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, we'll slowly come back to the present. Ready?

Patient: I started the scan but my attention splintered after the toes—my chest tightened more, my heart felt fluttery, and every small sensation immediately gets filed by my inner narrator as "somatic hyperarousal" so I start theorizing instead of feeling. I'm more anxious and distracted than a minute ago, like there's an internal alarm about running out of time or money, and that makes it hard to settle into a two-minute scan. Can we slow down and try shorter chunks—say 30 seconds per area—or do a guided naming aloud so I have a concrete cue to follow? I'm feeling embarrassed and a bit stuck about not being able to just do this.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of the full body scan, let's break it down into smaller chunks. I want you to focus on just one area for 30 seconds at a time. We'll start with your toes. Just notice how they feel, without trying to change anything or analyze it. Just breathe, and notice. When you're ready, we'll move on to the next area. If you find it hard to focus, just acknowledge that thought, and gently bring your attention back to the sensation. We'll do 30 seconds, then take a breath, and then move on to the next area. We'll do this for each part of the body, slowly and gently. Ready to start with the toes? Take a deep breath, and just notice how they feel.

Patient: Okay—toes: they feel a bit heavy and muted, a faint tingling more than distinct sensation; my mind immediately labels it "peripheral paresthesia" and I slip into analysis, which is…a bit wearing. If that's fine, can we move on to the ankles now? I need the shorter chunks.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. You said you felt a bit heavy and muted in your toes, and that's okay. Just acknowledge that thought, and gently let it go. Instead, bring your attention to the sensation in your toes. Can you just notice the sensation of your toes touching the ground, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice. You're doing fine. Now, let's move on to the ankles. Take a deep breath, and just notice how they feel. Notice the sensation of your ankles moving slightly as you breathe. Just focus on that sensation. Ready?

Patient: Ankles: a vague warmth and a faint rolling with each breath, but my inner narrator already labeled it "peripheral tension" so my attention keeps skittering away. I'm pretty drained right now—can we move to the calves and keep it short?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. You said you felt a vague warmth and a faint rolling in your ankles. Can we try something different? Instead of focusing on the sensation, I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out. Just notice the sensation of the breath, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you just focus on that for a second? Let's keep it short, and then we'll move on to the calves. Ready?

Patient: Okay—breath: shallow, high in the chest; exhale gives a tiny loosen but the tightness under my sternum and a quick little heartbeat stay. My inner narrator already calls it "thoracic restriction," which just makes me feel embarrassed and kind of drained. Can we move to the calves now, just a short 30 seconds?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. You said you feel a shallow breath in your chest, and that's okay. Just acknowledge that thought, and gently let it go. Instead, I want you to focus on the sensation in your calves. Notice how they feel as you sit here, without trying to change anything or analyze it. Just breathe, and notice. Can you just focus on the sensation of your calves for 30 seconds? Just notice how they feel, without trying to do anything with that feeling. Ready?

Patient: Calves: a low, dull tightness, like they're slightly braced; a faint restlessness under the skin. My brain immediately labels it "postural tension from chronic stress" and then skitters off to other worries, so I'm kind of scattered and it's hard to sustain focus. Could we do 15 seconds on the calves and then move on—I'm running low on the energy to hold a long stretch of attention.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. You said you feel a low, dull tightness in your calves, and a faint restlessness under the skin. I'm going to ask you to focus on the sensation in your calves for just 15 seconds. Can you just notice how they feel, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice. Try to let go of any thoughts, and just focus on the sensation in your calves. I'm going to count down from 15, and when you're ready, we'll move on to the next area. Ready? 15...

Patient: 15...14...13...12...11...10... my calves are that same dull, braced feeling—restless under the skin. 5...4...3...2...1... done. Can we move on to the thighs now?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. Now, I want you to bring your attention to your thighs. Notice how they feel, without trying to change anything or analyze it. Just breathe, and notice. Try to let go of any thoughts, and just focus on the sensation in your thighs. Take your time, and stay present. Ready?

Patient: Thighs feel heavy and a bit dull, like they're holding on to a low-grade fatigue; pressure more than a sharp sensation. My narrator's already calling it "somatic load from chronic stress" and I can feel myself slipping into analysis, which is...wearing. Can we do just 15 seconds on the thighs and then move to the hips?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. You said your thighs feel heavy and dull, holding onto a low-grade fatigue. I'm going to ask you to focus on that sensation for just 15 seconds. Can you just notice how they feel, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the pressure in your thighs. Try to let go of any thoughts, and just stay with the sensation. I'm going to count down from 15, and when you're ready, we'll move on to the hips. Ready? 15...

Patient: 15...14...13...12...11...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... done. The pressure stayed—dull, persistent—and my mind kept annotating it as "somatic load," then skittering to worries about money and deadlines, so I couldn't really settle. I'm low on energy—can we move to the hips for 15 seconds, and please keep it brief and structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your hips for just 15 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your hips, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice. I'm going to count down from 15, and when you're ready, we'll take a final break. Ready? 15...

Patient: 15...14...13...12...11...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... done. Hips: a dull, anchored pressure—like a low knot—and my mind immediately tags it "somatic bracing" then skitters to bills and deadlines, so I can't really settle; my energy's thin and this feels like an effort. Can we move to the lower back for 15 seconds, and please keep it brief and structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your lower back for just 15 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your lower back, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the pressure, the feeling of being anchored. Try to let go of any thoughts, and just stay with the sensation. I'm going to count down from 15, and when you're ready, we'll take a final break. Ready? 15...

Patient: 15...14...13...12...11...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... done.

Lower back: a dull, weighted pressure, like it's bracing to keep me upright. My breath's still shallow and my mind's already calling it "chronic postural tension," which makes me feel a bit embarrassed and drained—this is starting to feel like more effort than I have. Can we move to the upper back for 15 seconds, and keep it brief and very structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your upper back for just 5 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your upper back, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the pressure, the feeling of being supported. Ready? 5...

Patient: 5...4...3...2...1.

Upper back: a steady, dull pressure between the shoulder blades—like it's scaffolding holding me upright. Breathing stays high and shallow; my inner narrator already tags it "dorsal constriction" which makes me feel a little embarrassed and frayed. My energy to keep doing this is thin—can we do the shoulders next, just 5 seconds and very structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your shoulders for just 5 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your shoulders, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the pressure. Let it be just that - the pressure. Ready? 5...

Patient: 5...4...3...2...1.

Shoulders: they're up near my ears, a tight band across the traps, breath still high and a little shaky; my inner voice labels it "tonic trap activation," which only makes me feel more self-conscious and frayed. I don't have much energy left—can we do 5 seconds on the arms next, very structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your arms for just 5 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your arms, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the feeling in your hands, your arms, and your shoulders. Try to let go of any thoughts, and just stay with the sensation. I'm going to count down from 5, and when you're ready, we'll take a final break. Ready? 5...

Patient: 5...4...3...2...1.

Arms: a leaden, low-voltage heaviness, forearms a bit tingly and hands cool to the touch. My narrator already tags it "sensorimotor bracing," which makes me feel oddly jumpy and distracted—it's all effort right now. Can we do the hands and head next, very brief and structured?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your hands for just 5 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your hands, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the feeling in your fingers. Ready? 5...

Patient: 5...4...3...2...1.

Hands: cool, fingers a little trembly, palms slightly clammy. Of course my brain tags it as "catecholaminergic activation" which makes me feel flustered and oddly depleted. Can we do the head next, very briefly?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath. I'm going to ask you to focus on your head for just 5 seconds. Can you just notice the sensation in your head, without trying to change anything or analyze it? Just breathe, and notice the feeling in your scalp. Ready? 5...

Patient: 5...4...3...2...1.

Head: a dull, diffuse pressure across the temples and a thin buzzing behind the eyes; scalp feels taut. My inner narrator immediately calls it "ruminative cortical activation," which makes me feel embarrassed and frayed—my energy to keep doing long exercises is pretty thin. Could we switch to something very brief and concrete next?
