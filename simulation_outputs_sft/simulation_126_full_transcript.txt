--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an artist in my late twenties and lately social situations make my anxiety so intense that I avoid gatherings with friends, which has been isolating and hurt my already unstable work situation. I mostly rely on myself and have OCD that makes social things feel overwhelming, and I'm pretty skeptical about therapy because I've tried techniques that didn't stick. How is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've shared the core of your struggle with social anxiety and avoidance, as well as your concerns about therapy given your skeptical past. The goal is to gently establish a connection to values despite the current difficulties. You've also mentioned OCD, which needs to be acknowledged.
Goal: Introduce the concept of values and introduce ACT as a means of exploring difficulties.

Therapist Answer:
I can only imagine how tough it must be for you to navigate social situations with OCD. At the same time, it's remarkable that you're willing to think about trying therapy again. For you, what matters most in life, when it comes down to it? Is it having a fulfilling career, maintaining your independence, or something else?
Your art is a source of expression and meaning; can you explore how these aspects of your life are impacted by your current situation? It's okay to not have all the answers now; we can start by examining the values that might be driving your actions.

Patient: Mostly it's my art — making things that feel true — and having enough independence to keep doing it without depending on people I don't trust. I also want some real connections, but the anxiety and the OCD just make social stuff feel like a threat, so I pull back and lose gigs, feedback, chances to collaborate. How is talking about values supposed to stop the actual panic I get in a room full of people? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed going over all this — can we slow down?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've shared more about your values and the importance of your art, as well as the anxiety and OCD driving your social avoidance. You're expressing frustration with the immediate experience of panic, which is understandable. The goal right now is to help you feel a bit more grounded without trying to tackle the panic directly.
Goal: Introduce mindfulness as a way to cope with immediate anxiety without trying to change it right away.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you take just one deep breath with me right now, and let's focus on that breath for a second? Feel the air moving in, and then out of your body. Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it. It's like being in the space of your art, where you're not thinking about the end result, just the process of creating. Can we try to bring that kind of attention to the present moment here, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Okay, I took a breath with you — it calmed me a tiny bit, but honestly it feels temporary. When I'm in a crowded room my heart just races and my thoughts spiral, and I've tried mindfulness and grounding before and they don't stop the panic. How is practicing a breath supposed to help me in those moments? I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right, mindfulness and grounding techniques may not provide long-lasting relief from panic, and you're feeling a bit frustrated with the temporary nature of the calming effect. The goal now is to gently acknowledge your experience without dismissing the temporary reprieve provided by the breathing exercise.
Goal: Validate the experience of temporary relief without making promises or promises of more.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why it feels like the calming effect was temporary. It's normal for these techniques to give us a brief reprieve from the overwhelming feelings, even if they don't last. It's okay that it didn't stop the panic entirely. What's interesting is that we did get a tiny bit of calm for a second. Can you try to notice that tiny bit of calm again, even if it's just for a second? Maybe that tiny bit can give you a chance to reassess what's happening right now.

Patient: Yeah — I noticed it for a second, like my shoulders loosened a tiny bit. But it vanishes fast; in a crowded room my heart just spikes and the thoughts take over, and I don't see how a brief pause helps when everything's racing. I've tried leaning on that tiny calm before and it didn't change the panic — honestly, how is that supposed to give me space to reassess when I'm mid‑spiral? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're sharing the experience of the brief calming effect vanishing quickly, which is understandable given the intensity of the panic. You're also expressing frustration with the idea that a brief pause can't provide space to reassess when everything is racing. The goal now is to gently acknowledge the difficulty in integrating the breathing technique into the midst of a panic attack.
Goal: Explore the challenge of integrating the technique during a panic attack.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you're struggling to find space to reassess during a panic attack. It's like the breath is there, but the panic is overwhelming it. It's not that the technique is failing, it's just that it's hard to hold onto anything when everything is racing. Can we try something a bit different for a moment? Instead of focusing on the breath, can we talk about what happens when the panic does start to subside, even just for a second? What can you notice then, that might be helpful in understanding what's going on?

Patient: When it fades I notice my shoulders drop, my breathing evens out, and there's this weird mix of relief and shame — like "okay, I'm fine" but also "you messed up again." Then I get exhausted and just want to disappear or avoid the next thing. How is noticing that supposed to help when it spikes again? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're sharing a more nuanced experience of the aftermath of a panic attack, including the mix of relief and shame, which is a crucial aspect to acknowledge. The goal now is to explore how this nuanced understanding can be used as a tool to cope with the panic attack itself.
Goal: Introduce the concept of acceptance and the importance of working with the emotional complexity of the experience.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why noticing that mix of emotions feels overwhelming. It's like you're being asked to process and make sense of something that's already really hard to handle. But what if, instead of trying to change how you feel or how the panic attacks make you feel, you just tried to accept them for what they are? Not just the panic itself, but the whole experience – the relief, the shame, the exhaustion. Can you try to imagine what it would be like to accept all of that, not just the panic, but the whole emotional landscape of it? Sometimes, accepting what is, without judgment, can be a way to create space for something new to emerge. Would you be willing to try that, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I can try, I guess — but I'm skeptical. Accepting the shame and the panic sounds...kind of abstract; how is sitting with those feelings supposed to stop my heart from racing when I'm in the middle of it? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and try a concrete, one‑step thing I could actually use in the moment?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing skepticism about the abstract concept of accepting shame and panic, which is natural. The goal now is to ground the conversation in a more concrete, immediate action that can help you cope with the panic attack.
Goal: Introduce a concrete, small-step action that can be taken in the midst of a panic attack.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that it's hard to see how accepting shame and panic can help right now. Let's take a step back. One thing you can try, even just for a second, is to notice where your feet are planted on the ground. Can you feel the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Just take a tiny moment to notice that. It's a very small thing, but sometimes it's the smallest things that can help us feel more connected to our body. Can you try that for me? Just take a deep breath and notice your feet for a second?

Patient: Okay, I noticed my feet — there was a tiny bit of anchoring, like my weight shifted and my head cleared for a second. But it vanishes as soon as my heart spikes; I've tried grounding before and it usually doesn't hold up in the middle of a panic. How is that supposed to help me when I'm already spiraling? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down and try one concrete, in‑the‑moment tool I can actually use?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're sharing that grounding had a temporary effect, but it's not lasting in the midst of a panic attack. The goal now is to identify a single, concrete action that can be used in the immediate moment to help cope with the panic.
Goal: Introduce a simple, in-the-moment technique to reduce the intensity of the panic attack.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that grounding didn't hold up this time. Let's try something else. When your heart spikes and you feel like you're spiraling, what can you do with your voice? Can you try making a very simple sound, just one syllable, like "ah" or "oh"? It's a tiny action, but sometimes it can help distract you from the panic for just a second. Can you try making that sound with me, just for a second?

Patient: Okay, I'll try it: "ah." It loosened my jaw a little and gave a tiny sliver of space, but in a real spike my chest still races and those little sounds feel useless. How is that supposed to help when everything's spiraling? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're sharing that the vocal sound helped momentarily, but it's not providing sustained relief in the midst of a panic attack. The goal now is to acknowledge that the current technique may not be effective and explore an alternative approach.
Goal: Validate the experience and introduce a new perspective.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the vocal sound didn't provide the relief you were hoping for. It's okay. Sometimes, the things that help in small moments can feel like they're not working when we're in the midst of a full-blown panic attack. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Can we try something different for a moment? Instead of focusing on the panic itself, let's look at the sensations in your body. Can you bring your attention to your breath, just for a moment? Notice how it feels to breathe in and out.

Patient: Okay... I can feel the breath — it's shallow and kind of tight, and when I notice it it loosens a little. But it still feels useless when everything else is racing. How is focusing on my breath supposed to help me when the panic is full‑blown? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing frustration that focusing on the breath hasn't provided significant relief yet, and the panic feels overwhelming. The goal now is to acknowledge the intensity of the experience and explore a way to approach it.
Goal: Introduce a pause in the attempt to help, acknowledging the overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. It's like the panic has reached a point where it's hard to think clearly, let alone focus on your breath. Let's just pause for a moment. I'm not asking you to try to do anything else, just to acknowledge that you're feeling this way. Can you just sit with that feeling of overwhelm for a second? Sometimes, taking a break from trying to help can actually be helpful. We can come back to this later, when you feel a bit more centered. Would that be okay with you?

Patient: Sitting with it for a second did ease things a tiny bit, but I'm worn out and not convinced that "pausing" will actually stop a full spike. I don't want to stop the session — can we slow down and try one concrete, repeatable thing I can actually do in the moment that isn't just breathing or grounding? I've tried those and they don't hold up.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a desire to continue the session despite feeling worn out, but also needing a more concrete and effective technique. The goal now is to find a small, repeatable action that can be taken in the midst of a panic attack.
Goal: Introduce a new, concrete action to complement the existing techniques.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're looking for something more concrete. One thing you can try is to make a small, voluntary movement with your arm or leg. Not necessarily something big, just a tiny one. Can you try raising your arm just a little bit, or moving your foot slightly? It's not about trying to calm down or stop the panic, just about doing something small and deliberate in the moment. This can help take the focus away from the panic and give you a tiny bit of space to think. Would you like to try that?

Patient: Okay... I raised my arm a little. It gave a tiny weird click in my head and a second of distance, then it just slid back into the panic. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps more than the other stuff — in a real spike it still feels useless. Can you give me one concrete, repeatable thing I can do in the moment that isn't breathing, grounding, or making noises?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of the movement and the click in your head, and wanting a clear, concrete action that can be taken in the moment. The goal now is to identify a simple, repeatable technique that can provide a tangible benefit.
Goal: Introduce a single, concrete action to help cope with the panic attack.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something simple: touch something. Reach out and touch a nearby object, like your chair, a pillow, or a wall. It doesn't have to be a big gesture; just a small, intentional touch. The goal is not to try to calm down or stop the panic, but simply to focus on the sensation of touching something. This can help take the focus away from the panic and provide a tiny bit of distraction. Can you try touching something for just a second?

Patient: I touched the arm of my chair — felt the weave under my fingers and it gave a tiny anchor for a second, then my chest spiked and my thoughts just leapt away. I'm not sure I follow how that helps in a full spiral — it only ever buys me a sliver of space that disappears. I'm jumpy and distracted right now; can you give me one concrete, repeatable thing that actually works when I'm mid‑panic?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing frustration that the tactile experience didn't provide lasting relief, and feeling jumpy and distracted. The goal now is to identify a concrete action that can be taken in the midst of a panic attack, providing a tangible benefit.
Goal: Introduce a single, concrete action that can help when the panic attack is intense.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to ask you to do something that's very different from what we've tried so far. When your chest spikes and you feel like you're spiraling, I want you to look at the panic itself. Yes, I know it sounds strange, but hear me out. I want you to look at the physical sensations in your body, like the rising of your chest, the tightness in your throat, or the rapid heartbeat. Can you do that for just a second? Look at the panic, not at your thoughts or worries. Just observe it.

Patient: I tried to look at it — my chest rises, my throat feels tight, there's this buzzing behind my eyes — but the second I focus I get yanked into thoughts like "I can't handle this." I'm not sure I follow how just observing that actually helps when it's already taking over; how is that supposed to help? I'm jumpy and scattered right now, can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing that observing the physical sensations didn't help, as it led to thinking and worries, which are exactly what you're trying to avoid. The goal now is to acknowledge the confusion and take a step back.
Goal: Re-evaluate and re-orient the therapeutic approach.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that looking at the physical sensations didn't provide the relief you were hoping for. It's clear that this approach isn't working for you right now. I think we need to take a step back and re-evaluate what we're trying to achieve. Let's start fresh. Can you tell me, what is it that you hope to achieve in our session today? What is it that you're trying to accomplish?

Patient: What I want today is practical: one concrete, repeatable thing I can do in the middle of a full panic that actually prevents the spiral so I can stay at events and not keep losing gigs or connections. I also want to figure out how to apply it specifically in social settings, and how to handle the shame afterward. I'm skeptical—I've tried lots of techniques that felt useless—so you'll need to show me how this would actually change things. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a clear desire for practicality, specificity, and a focus on immediate relief from panic attacks in social settings. The goal now is to address your skepticism, offer a concrete alternative, and introduce a plan for social setting application and shame management.
Goal: Introduce a new, concrete action with a focus on practicality and specific application in social settings.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're looking for a concrete, repeatable action that can help you cope with panic attacks in social settings. I want to propose an action that's different from what we've tried before. Instead of focusing on your breath, grounding, or observing physical sensations, I want you to focus on your intentions. When you feel a panic attack rising, I want you to ask yourself: "What is the worst that could happen if I panic right now?" Often, our worst fears are not as dire as we think. Can you try asking yourself this question when you feel the panic starting? Take a moment to consider it. Then, take a deep breath, and tell yourself: "I've got this. I can handle this." Repeat this phrase to yourself, and try to focus on the physical sensations in your body. You can say it out loud if it helps. This action is not about avoiding the panic or avoiding social situations; it's about learning to cope with the panic in the moment, and building confidence in your ability to handle it. Can you try this action for just a minute?

Patient: Okay — I tried it in my head just now: I asked “what’s the worst that could happen?” and the answers that popped up were the usual — humiliation, losing a gig, being seen as weird. Saying “I’ve got this” felt kind of hollow and only bought a sliver of distance before my heart kept racing. I’m not sure how that actually stops a mid‑panic spiral in a crowded room; can we do a concrete role‑play or step‑by‑step of exactly what I’d say and do there? I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing that the introspective exercise didn't provide lasting relief, and you're concerned about its practicality in a crowded room. The goal now is to adapt the approach to a more concrete, step-by-step role-play.
Goal: Introduce a role-play exercise to help you practice the new action in a simulated social setting.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're looking for a more concrete approach. Let's try a role-play exercise to help you practice the new action in a simulated social setting. Imagine that we're at a crowded event, and you're standing in line waiting to order food. I'll play the role of someone you're having a conversation with. We'll go through a scenario where you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, and then you'll try using the new action: asking yourself "what's the worst that could happen?" and repeating the phrase "I've got this."

Let's start with the role-play. I'll start by saying something to you, and then you can respond. Remember, the goal is to focus on the physical sensations in your body and the thought "I've got this." Don't worry too much about what you're saying; just focus on the physical sensations and the phrase.

As we go through the role-play, I'll give you feedback and ask you questions to help you refine your approach. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay... I can try, I guess, but I'm low on energy and not convinced this'll work. Start the scene and give me the exact words to say and exactly when to say “I’ve got this” — and if my heart spikes mid‑sentence, what do I do then? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a desire for a structured and slow-paced role-play, with specific instructions and a focus on managing your energy. The goal now is to create a safe and realistic simulation of a social setting, while also teaching you the new action.
Goal: Introduce a step-by-step role-play exercise with exact words and timing for the new action.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start the role-play slowly and deliberately. Remember, the goal is to focus on the physical sensations in your body and the phrase "I've got this." Don't worry if you make mistakes or if your heart spikes during the role-play; we'll work through it together.

Here's the scene: We're standing in line at a crowded coffee shop. I'll start by saying something to you.

"Hey, how's your day going so far? I love your scarf, where did you get it?"

Your task is to respond to this question, and then, when you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, you'll ask yourself "what's the worst that could happen?" and repeat the phrase "I've got this."

You can start now. Just say something in response to the question. You can say anything. Take your time.

(Note: Please respond as naturally as possible, and don't worry about saying exactly the word "I've got this". If you need a moment, pause and take a breath. If your heart spikes during the response, take a deep breath and try to continue. We'll work through it together.)

Patient: "Oh—hey, thanks. Day's been weird, lost a small gig this morning so I'm running on fumes." 

(Feeling my chest tighten) Okay, what's the worst that could happen? People notice I fumble, they think I'm awkward, maybe I lose a contact — right, I've got this. 

That felt flat — my heart's still racing and my words feel forced. If my chest spikes mid‑sentence, what exactly am I supposed to say or do then? How is that supposed to help? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down and do this step‑by‑step?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing frustration with the role-play exercise, feeling like it's not working as intended. The goal now is to acknowledge your concerns and adapt the approach to better support your needs.
Goal: Re-evaluate the role-play exercise and provide a more supportive and flexible approach.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the role-play exercise is not going as smoothly as we'd like. Your anxiety is still present, and you're feeling frustrated with the experience. Before we continue, I want to take a step back and re-evaluate our approach.

Let's take a deep breath and start again from the beginning. Instead of trying to push through your anxiety, let's focus on creating a safe and supportive space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings.

Can we try something different for the next iteration of the role-play? Instead of having me ask you a question, let's start with a simple prompt. I'll give you a scenario, and you can respond however you'd like. We'll take it slow and focus on your physical sensations and emotional state.

Here's the prompt:

"You're standing in line at a crowded coffee shop, and you've just lost a small gig. What do you need right now?"

Take a moment to think about your response. You can say anything, and we'll go from there. Remember, the goal is to support your emotional state and provide a safe space for exploration.

Patient: Right now I think I need something that actually keeps me there — one exact, repeatable action I can do the moment panic starts so I don't just bolt or disappear. My energy's low and I'm jumpy, so this is hard to explain, and honestly I'm not sure I follow how saying what I need becomes a real coping step in the middle of a spike — how is that supposed to help? Can you give me one precise sentence to say and the exact physical move to make if my heart spikes mid‑sentence? Also, can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a clear need for a specific, concrete action to manage panic, and you're struggling to understand how simply stating what you need can be a helpful coping step. The goal now is to provide a clear, actionable suggestion that can be applied in the moment, while also acknowledging the complexity of the situation.
Goal: Introduce a simple, yet specific, action that can be taken in the midst of a panic spike.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on a single, concrete action that can help you manage panic in the moment. When you feel your heart spiking and you're ready to bolt, I want you to say:

"I need to get through this minute."

At the same time, make a gentle, relaxed gesture with your dominant hand, like a soft fist or a slow wave. This action can help calm your nervous system and provide a tangible focus point.

Remember, the goal is not to "cure" the panic or make it go away completely, but to provide a small, manageable moment of calm in the midst of a larger storm. By repeating the phrase and making the physical gesture, you can create a tiny sense of control and stability.

Take a deep breath, and let's try this together. When you're ready, say "I need to get through this minute" and make the gentle gesture. We'll start with a slow, gentle pace, and see how it goes from there.

Patient: Okay — I said it out loud, "I need to get through this minute," and made a soft fist. It bought me maybe three seconds of slack, then my chest slammed back up and I felt dumb for clenching my hand. How is that supposed to stop me from bolting when the spike hits full force, especially mid‑sentence or if people notice? I'm already feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down and do a step‑by‑step for exactly when, where, and how to use this so it actually works in a real crowd?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing frustration that the action didn't provide more lasting relief and that it's not helping in the midst of a full-force panic spike. The goal now is to acknowledge the limitations of the current approach and introduce a more nuanced understanding of how to apply the action in a real-world scenario.
Goal: Introduce a more detailed explanation of how to apply the action in a specific context.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the action of saying "I need to get through this minute" and making a soft fist is not providing the level of relief you're looking for, especially during a full-force panic spike. Let's take a step back and break down what's happening when you use this action.

When you say "I need to get through this minute," you're acknowledging your immediate need to cope with the panic. This phrase can help you focus on the present moment and create a sense of urgency to manage your anxiety. However, it's essential to understand that this phrase alone may not be enough to stop you from bolting, especially in a crowded space.

Here's a critical aspect to consider: when people notice you clenching your hand or saying "I need to get through this minute," they may perceive you as anxious or overwhelmed. This can lead to increased scrutiny, judgment, or even attention that could make the situation worse.

To address this, let's focus on a more specific scenario: Imagine you're standing in a crowded coffee shop, and you suddenly feel the panic spike. As you feel your heart racing, you notice a person standing nearby who you recognize from a previous social interaction. You can't see their face, but you know they might overhear you.

In this situation, it's crucial to use the action in a way that minimizes drawing attention to yourself. When your chest starts to slam back up, take a deep breath and say the phrase "I need to get through this minute" under your breath, rather than out loud. At the same time, make a gentle, subtle gesture with your hand, like a slight flex of your fingers or a quick tap on your leg. This should be a discreet action that doesn't draw attention away from you.

Remember, the goal is not to "hide" your anxiety but to manage it in a way that minimizes the impact on those around you. By using the action in this more nuanced way, you can create a sense of control and stability in the midst of a panic spike.

Can you try this revised approach in a controlled environment, like a quiet

Patient: Okay... I can try that in a quiet spot, but I'm skeptical it’ll do more than buy a few seconds. I need exact timing and wording: when exactly do I whisper the phrase, how quietly, and what precise, subtle gesture (press thumb to forefinger? a quick leg tap?) — and what do I do if my heart spikes mid‑sentence? Can we practice it right now, step‑by‑step and slow? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a clear need for precise timing and instruction to apply the action effectively. The goal now is to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide for practicing the action in a controlled environment.
Goal: Introduce a slow, step-by-step practice exercise with exact timing and wording.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with a slow, controlled practice exercise. We'll focus on a quiet, private space where you can practice without distractions.

Please sit comfortably, with your back straight and feet planted firmly on the ground. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your body to relax slightly.

We'll practice the action in three stages. Stage 1: Breathing and Relaxation (30 seconds)

* Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely.
* Hold the breath for a count of 5.
* Slowly exhale through your mouth, emptying your lungs completely.
* As you exhale, allow your body to relax slightly, starting from the crown of your head and working its way down to your toes.

Repeat this process several times, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Stage 2: Trigger and Response (30 seconds)

* Imagine that you're standing in a quiet space, and suddenly you feel a slight increase in your heart rate or a sense of tension in your body.
* As soon as you notice this increase, take a deep breath in and say the phrase "I need to get through this minute" under your breath, as quietly as possible.
* At the same time, make a subtle gesture with your hand, such as pressing your thumb gently against your forefinger or tapping your leg quickly.
* Focus on the sensation of the gesture, and allow yourself to relax slightly as you perform it.

Repeat this process several times, focusing on the timing and subtlety of the gesture.

Stage 3: Practice with a Timer (1 minute)

* Set a timer for 1 minute, and during this time, practice the action several times.
* Start with the breathing and relaxation stage, then move on to the trigger and response stage.
* Focus on the timing and subtlety of the gesture, and try to maintain a steady pace throughout the exercise.

Remember, the goal is not to perform the action perfectly, but to practice and refine it over time. Take your time, and don't be afraid to adjust the timing or wording as needed.

Can you try this practice exercise now, starting with the breathing and relaxation

Patient: Okay... I did the breathing — held for five, exhaled — and it loosened my shoulders a little, but my chest’s still tight. I’ll try Stage 2, but I need exact timing: the second I notice the first tug in my chest, do I whisper the phrase right away or after the inhale/exhale? And if my heart spikes mid‑phrase, what do I physically do with my hand so it doesn’t look weird? I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a clear need for precise timing and clarification on the physical actions during Stage 2. The goal now is to provide exact instructions for when to whisper the phrase and how to handle the hand during the middle of the phrase.
Goal: Introduce precise timing and physical actions for Stage 2.

Therapist Answer:
Let's revisit Stage 2, with a focus on precise timing and physical actions.

**Timing:**
When you notice the first tug in your chest, wait for a brief moment (about 0.5 seconds) after you exhale. This allows you to process the physical sensation and prepare for the verbal cue.

**Whispering the phrase:**
Whisper the phrase "I need to get through this minute" immediately after the brief pause. Try to start whispering as soon as you exhale, and aim to complete the phrase within about 1-2 seconds.

**Hand movement:**
If your heart spikes mid-phrase, you can subtly adjust your hand movement to minimize any visible tension. Instead of pressing your thumb against your forefinger, try a gentle, relaxed "flick" with your thumb, almost as if you're flicking a small object away. This should be a very subtle movement, and you should aim to keep your hand still for most of the phrase.

Remember, the goal is not to draw attention to the hand movement, but to create a subtle, calming gesture that can help you focus on the breath and the phrase. Practice this movement several times, focusing on the subtlety and relaxation.

Can you try Stage 2 again, using the revised timing and physical actions?

Patient: Okay — I tried it exactly like you said: waited the half second after exhale, whispered “I need to get through this minute,” and did a tiny thumb-flick. It gave me maybe three seconds of slack, then my heart jumped and the phrase cut off and my hand felt like a nervous tic. I don't know, it just feels like paperwork for panic — how is that supposed to stop me from bolting if it chops off mid‑phrase or someone glances over? I'm jumpy and distracted right now, can we slow down and do a step‑by‑step for what to do if the spike happens mid‑phrase or someone notices?

You're expressing frustration that the technique isn't working as expected, especially when it cuts off mid-phrase or draws attention. The goal now is to introduce a step-by-step approach to managing a spike mid-phrase or when someone notices.
Goal: Introduce a step-by-step plan for managing a spike mid-phrase or when someone notices.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and focus on a specific scenario: What if you notice your heart spiking mid-phrase or someone glances over? Here's a step-by-step plan to help you manage the situation:

**Step 1: Accept the spike**
Acknowledge the spike, even if it feels like a failure. Recognize that your heart is racing and that the phrase cut off. Accept this moment, rather than trying to fight it.

**Step 2: Take a deep breath**
Take a slow, deep breath in, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Allow yourself to relax slightly, even if it feels like a tiny movement.

**Step 3: Refocus on the breath**
Bring your attention back to the breath, rather than the phrase or the spike. Focus on the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

**Step 4: Gradually re-engage**
Once you feel more centered, gradually re-engage with the phrase or the conversation. Start with a small step, like acknowledging the person or responding to a question.

**Step 5: Refine and adapt**
As you practice, pay attention to how you respond to spikes mid-phrase or when someone notices. Refine and adapt your approach as needed, focusing on what works best for you.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate spikes or avoid drawing attention, but to develop a more nuanced understanding of how to manage them in a way that feels natural and effective for you.

Can you try this step-by-step approach to managing spikes mid-phrase or when someone notices?

Patient: Okay — I can try to follow that sequence in my head: accept, breathe, refocus, re‑engage. But I need it spelled out exactly or it falls apart when I'm mid‑panic. What exactly do I say to myself for Step 1 (one short sentence)? How long is the breath in Step 2 (seconds), and what exact, tiny thing do I say or do to re‑engage in Step 4 if someone’s watching me? Can we do a slow role‑play right now where you simulate someone noticing and I walk through those exact lines and timing? I'm jumpy and confused, and I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

If the spike happens mid-phrase, your goal is to acknowledge the spike, refocus on the breath, and gradually re-engage with the phrase. If someone notices, take a deep breath, accept the spike, refocus on the breath, and re-engage with the situation. What happens next depends on the specific situation, but these steps should guide you through your interactions.

Patient: Alright — here’s the exact, short plan I can actually try in the moment, spelled out so it won’t fall apart when I’m panicking:

- The moment I notice the first tug in my chest: exhale fully, pause ~0.5s, then whisper under my breath, “I need to get through this minute” (aim to finish the whisper in 1–2 seconds).  
- At the same time, do a tiny, subtle thumb‑flick with my dominant hand (very small, like flicking an imaginary crumb) or press thumb to forefinger if that feels less twitchy.  
- If the phrase cuts off or my heart spikes mid‑phrase: say one short sentence to myself, “I can handle one minute,” then take a slow breath (inhale ~4s, exhale ~6s) and focus on that breath for 2–3 cycles before gently re‑engaging.  
- If someone glances over, keep the whisper and flick so quiet they won’t notice; if they do, shrug inwardly and reapply the “I can handle one minute” + breath sequence.

I can see how your advice might help — small, discreet, repeatable moves could buy me those slivers of time I need so I don’t bolt and lose gigs or connections, which matters because my art and independence depend on staying present. I’m still skeptical it’ll be enough in a full spike, but I’m willing to practice it a few times. I’m already feeling pretty worn and jumpy though — can we slow down and role‑play the “someone notices” version step‑by‑step now?

Patient: Your last message was...really confusing — felt like static. I need just one ACT technique, nothing else, spelled out exactly: the exact sentence(s) to say, when (after exhale? at first tug?), how quietly, how many seconds, and one tiny physical move to pair with it — step‑by‑step so it won't fall apart mid‑panic. Then I want to role‑play it slowly here, with you simulating someone noticing me and guiding the exact timing. I'm worn out and skeptical — how is this actually supposed to stop me from bolting? Can we slow down?

Patient: Okay — one thing, very clearly: give me a single ACT move, nothing else. Spell out the exact sentence(s) to say, exactly when to say it (e.g., “at first tug” or “immediately after exhale”), how quietly (a whisper under my breath? volume level?), how many seconds to spend saying it, and one tiny physical move to pair with it (press thumb to forefinger? light tap on leg?). Include exactly what I do if the phrase cuts off mid‑phrase and exactly what to do if someone glances at me. 

Then let’s role‑play slowly: you start the scene (crowded coffee shop, someone looks over) and talk me through the timing step‑by‑step while I try it. I’m worn out and skeptical — how is this actually supposed to stop me from bolting? Can we slow down?
