--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately, as an older student dealing with burnout after a health scare, I've been snapping in conversations about it and getting flooded with anger. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine — the moment I think about it I see the worst possible chain of events and I'm sure they'll come true. If anyone suggests a less dire outcome I just dismiss it, so the anxiety keeps spiraling and fuels more frustration.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is overwhelmed by burnout and health anxiety, leading to anger outbursts and a pattern of catastrophizing. Their core emotion appears to be anxiety. Goal: Explore the anxiety-fueled cycle and how it affects interactions, especially conversations about the burnout.

Therapist Answer:
When you start to feel overwhelmed or think about the burnout, your mind goes into a pretty intense state, seeing the worst-case scenario. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you see that worst-case chain of events? It's like your mind is already reacting to the possibility, even before you have all the facts. How does it feel to have that kind of intense anxiety before you even start talking about it?

Patient: It’s like a little movie that starts the moment I think about the health scare — first it worsens, then I miss classes, then I fail, then I lose my savings and everyone I care about drifts away, and I'm left alone and sick. My chest tightens, my hands go cold, my jaw clenches, and anger surges so fast I snap before I even realize it. When people say it might not go that way, I just hear denial — those outcomes feel impossible, like pretending the train won't hit the bridge. It’s exhausting and makes me irritable all the time, which just fuels more worry and shame.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking loop is fueled by intense anxiety, leading to a cycle of worsening emotional state, increased physical tension, and explosive anger. Their core emotion is anxiety, but it's also deeply intertwined with shame and frustration. Goal: Introduce a process to disrupt this cycle and explore its functional impact on the patient's life.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the worst-case scenario is incredibly vivid for you, and it's hard to shake off. I want to gently challenge that for a moment: what would happen if, for just one conversation, you could let go of that worst-case scenario and imagine it might not be true? Not because it's likely, but because it's possible. You mentioned feeling like denial when others suggest a better outcome. What if, instead of denying, you tried to explore what might happen if that better outcome actually came true? Could you, just for a second, imagine it's possible?

Patient: I can't really do that — as soon as I try to picture something less awful it feels like I'm putting on rose-colored glasses and pretending the train won't hit the bridge. My mind immediately fills in that awful chain: it gets worse, I miss everything, I lose money and people, and I'm left alone and sick, so imagining a nicer ending just feels dishonest. It makes me prickly and angrier, like someone's asking me to deny reality, and then I snap even more.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to imagine a more optimistic outcome, feeling like it would require them to deny reality or pretend the worst-case scenario hasn't already occurred. Their anxiety is deeply tied to a sense of shame and frustration, leading to defensiveness and further escalation of negative emotions. Goal: Introduce a defusion process to help the patient acknowledge the discomforting thoughts without becoming overly identified with them.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like when you try to imagine a different scenario, it feels like you're not being honest about your fears. That can be really uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about what happens when you snap, and what you're trying to protect yourself from right then? It feels like you're trying to prevent something really painful. Is that a useful way to protect yourself, or does it actually make things worse?

Patient: When I snap it's like a door slamming — my voice goes sharp, I cut people off, and then I feel furious and ashamed all at once. I tell myself I'm protecting myself from being ignored or blindsided — if I make it urgent and scary maybe they'll take it seriously and I can stop the disaster I see coming. Mostly it backfires: people pull away, I feel worse, and that just feeds the worst-case story, so the cycle keeps going, and honestly I'm getting frustrated because it feels like we're circling the same tired loop.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's defensiveness and anger are closely tied to feelings of shame and vulnerability, leading to a cycle of escalating emotions and ineffective coping strategies. Their goal is to protect themselves from perceived threats, but this approach only seems to worsen the situation. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore the underlying values and goals that are driving their behavior, rather than just their emotional state.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself by being intense and urgent, but that's not working as well as you'd like. It's like you're using that approach because you're not sure what else to do, or because you're not ready to admit that maybe your worst-case scenario isn't actually going to happen. Can we take a step back and explore what's driving your desire to protect yourself right now? What's most important to you in this situation? What values are you trying to uphold?

Patient: Mostly I'm trying to keep control and protect my independence — I want people to take me seriously, not see me as a burden, and stop the catastrophe I keep predicting. If I don't act urgent I immediately see the chain: illness worsens, I miss everything, lose my savings, everyone drifts away, and I'm left alone and helpless, so being sharp feels like the only way to stop that. I know it often backfires, but picturing a softer approach feels like pretending the train won't hit the bridge, and that makes me angry and unsettled.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is driven by a strong desire for control and independence, which is closely tied to their fear of being a burden and losing their autonomy. Their need for control is rooted in their anxiety about being overwhelmed by the potential consequences of their health scare, and their anger is a defense mechanism against feeling vulnerable and helpless. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore the importance of vulnerability and connection in their life, rather than just control and independence.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like for you, being in control means feeling like you can protect yourself and your independence. It's like you're trying to keep the disaster at bay by being sharp and urgent. Can I ask you something? How important is it for you to feel like you're not a burden to others? Is that something that's always been important to you, or is it something that's come up more recently with this health scare? It might be helpful to explore what would happen if you could let go of that need for control just for a little while, and see if you can connect with others in a more vulnerable way.

Patient: It's huge — that's been drilled into me my whole life: don't be a burden, handle your own problems. Since the health scare it's blown up — if I let people in I see it all happening: they start deciding for me, treating me like fragile, my savings get tied up, I lose autonomy, people drift away, and I'm left alone and worse off. So the idea of loosening control feels like surrender and makes me angry and defensive; I can't make myself believe it's safe to try.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's deep-seated need for control and independence is closely tied to their fear of being a burden and losing autonomy. Their anxiety about the health scare has intensified this fear, leading to a rigid and defensive approach to relationships and seeking help. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore the possibility of a more vulnerable and interconnected approach to life, while also addressing the fear of being a burden.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like for you, the idea of letting go of control is really scary because it feels like it's the same as surrendering to the very worst-case scenario you're trying to avoid. It's like you're seeing it all happening over and over, and that's making it impossible for you to even consider taking a different approach. Can I ask you to consider something differently for just a moment? What would happen if you could find a way to connect with others and be helped by them without feeling like you're losing control or autonomy? Is that even possible for you to imagine, or does that feel like a total lie?

Patient: I can't picture that without feeling like I'm lying to myself — the moment I try I see the chain: I let someone help, they start deciding, my savings get tied up, I'm treated like fragile, people drift away, and I'm left dependent and worse off. It makes my chest tighten and I get furious, like they're stealing my last bit of control, so I snap and push them away. Honestly, it feels like a total lie to even try — I don't know how to test a different outcome without it feeling like betrayal.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to imagine a different outcome where they can receive help without feeling a loss of control, autonomy, or identity. Their fear of being a burden is deeply ingrained, and the potential consequences of seeking help are so dire that they become paralyzed by anxiety. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore the possibility of defusing their catastrophic thinking, rather than getting stuck in a cycle of avoidance and defensiveness.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like for you, the moment you try to imagine a different outcome, it feels like a total lie because it's so closely tied to the catastrophic thinking that you're used to. You're seeing the chain reaction of how things could go wrong, and that's making it impossible for you to even consider taking a different approach. Can I suggest something for just a moment? What if, instead of trying to imagine a completely different outcome, we started with just one tiny, tiny step? What if, instead of trying to change everything, we just tried to make room for one small thing, just for one moment? Would that be enough to give you a different perspective, or would it just feel like more of the same?

Patient: It would mostly feel like more of the same — even a tiny step flips on the movie in my head and I see that same train wreck, which makes me furious because it feels like pretending. I'm tired of the loop, but the idea of trying something small already feels dishonest and makes me want to snap. Maybe I could try one controlled, very limited step, but I'm pretty sure it'll just feed the disaster story and blow up anyway.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to even consider taking a small step, feeling that it would be dishonest and trigger their catastrophic thinking. They're caught in a cycle of defensiveness and avoidance, where even the smallest attempt at change feels like a betrayal. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient explore the concept of "just showing up" in the present moment, rather than trying to control the outcome or pretend.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like for you, the idea of taking a small step already feels like it's a recipe for disaster. The moment you try to take that tiny step, it flips on the movie in your head, and you see the train wreck play out. That's making you furious, and it's making you want to snap. Can I ask you to try something with me for just a second? What if, instead of trying to control the outcome or pretend that everything is okay, we just showed up together, right here, right now? Just with each other? No agenda, no expectations, no trying to change anything. Can we just be present with each other for a second?

Patient: I can't just "be" like that — the moment I try my head fires up the movie and right now it's worse: chest tight, thoughts racing, everything scattered, and I keep seeing that same chain — relaxing means losing control, losing money, losing people. Trying to sit here calmly just flips the worst-case on and makes me furious and snappy. Can we slow down a bit? I need something more concrete than "just be present" because that just feels like pretending.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is finding it impossible to just "be" present, as their catastrophic thinking immediately kicks in. They need something more concrete and tangible to help them feel grounded. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on the physical sensations in their body, rather than getting caught up in their racing thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like for you, the moment you try to relax, it's like a switch flips, and you go into high gear again. Your chest is tight, your thoughts are racing, and you're seeing that same chain of events. Trying to calm down just makes you feel more anxious and snappy. Can I ask you to try something different for just a second? Can you bring your attention to your body, just for a second? Notice how you're sitting, how your feet are on the ground, how your hands are resting. Just notice the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them or do anything with them. Just observe. Can you do that for me, just for a second?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try, but I’m really jumpy and distracted. My feet are on the floor and feel cold, my hands are numb, my jaw’s clenched, and my chest is tight — my breath’s shallow, and even as I notice it my head’s already replaying the worst chain of events and I’m getting furious. I need something concrete to do—like counting breaths or naming things in the room—because “just notice” feels like pretending and makes me more agitated.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is finding it difficult to focus on their physical sensations due to their intense jumpyness and distraction. They need a concrete activity to help them ground themselves. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on the present moment using a concrete, repetitive task.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're having a tough time focusing on your breath, and your head is already jumping to the worst-case scenario. That's understandable. Instead of trying to focus on your breath again, can we try something a bit more concrete? Can you notice the sounds in the room right now? Just listen to the sounds around us. Can you name three things you hear? It might be the hum of the heater, the sound of the clock ticking, or the distant traffic. Just say them out loud: "I hear the hum of the heater," "I hear the sound of the clock ticking," and "I hear the distant traffic." Can you do that for me? Try to focus just on naming those sounds, and see if that helps you feel a bit more grounded.

Patient: "I hear the hum of the heater." "I hear the ticking of the clock." "I hear distant traffic." 

Okay — even saying that, my mind's already racing, my chest's tight, and the worst-case movie's started again, so I'm getting prickly. Can we slow down? I need something more concrete than this or I'll snap.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble calming down despite the attempt to focus on the present moment. They need a more concrete and calming activity to help them regulate their emotions. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a calming and concrete sensation, such as the sensation of their feet touching the ground.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying the words is helping for a moment, but then you're right back where you started. That's okay. Can we try something even more concrete? Can you look down at your feet right now? Just at your feet. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed onto your feet. Is there any sensation in your feet that stands out to you? Is it warm, cool, tingling, or numb? Can you focus just on that sensation for a second? Try to let go of any thoughts or worries about the worst-case scenario. Just be with the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you do that for me?

Patient: They're cold and kind of numb, like my weight's there but my feet feel unreal. Even as I notice that, the worst-case movie's already playing — chest tight, jaw clenched, and I can feel anger rising. I need something concrete to do with my feet right now (pressing them hard into the floor? counting presses?) or can we slow down, because I'm about to snap.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble grounding themselves in their physical sensations, and their emotions are escalating rapidly. They need a more concrete and interactive way to engage with their feet to help calm their body. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a specific, tangible action involving their feet.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like saying that your feet are cold and numb is actually making you feel worse, because then the worst-case movie starts again. That's okay. Instead of just noticing your feet, let's try something concrete to do with them right now. Can you press your feet firmly into the floor, and then keep pressing them down, one by one, starting with your left foot? Just press down on the floor, and keep the pressure there for a second. Don't worry about anything else, just the feeling of your foot pressing down. Then, bring your left foot up, and press down on the right foot. Keep doing that, left foot down, right foot up. Just focus on that sensation of pressing your feet into the floor, and try to let go of anything else. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I did it — left down, right down, left down — and for a split second it felt steadier, but the movie slammed back on almost immediately and my chest's tighter than before. I feel jumpy and furious, like this is just a pointless trick that won't stop the disaster I know is coming, and I'm on the verge of snapping. Can we try something more concrete and firm (press both feet and stomp three times, or count the presses out loud)? I need something I can do that feels real, or please slow down.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble sustaining the calmness brought on by the physical action, and their emotions are escalating rapidly again. They need a more concrete and powerful way to engage with their body to help regulate their emotions. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a specific, intense physical action that can help calm their body and reduce their emotional distress.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like the previous actions aren't working, and you need something more concrete. Let's try something that might feel more powerful. Can you press both feet firmly down into the floor, and then stomp down three times, really forcefully? Try to let go of anything else and just focus on the sensation of your feet pressing down and stomping. Do it three times, and then take a deep breath. Can you do that for me? If that doesn't feel real enough, we can try something else. But I want to give you a chance to try this first. As you stomp, I want you to pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the sound of your stomping. Try to let go of the worst-case movie and just focus on the physical sensation. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I stomped down three times, hard. For a breath it felt a little sharper and steadier — the sound cut through the movie — but it slid back almost right away and now my chest's tighter and I'm angrier than before. Can we try something firmer or slower? Maybe keep stomping slowly until I say stop, or give me a clear, concrete thing to do next, because I'm about to snap.

Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a specific, repetitive physical action that can help calm their body and reduce their emotional distress.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something a bit different. Can you keep stomping down three times, but this time, I want you to slow it down. Take a deep breath, and then stomp down slowly, one time. Pause. Take another deep breath, and then stomp down slowly, one time. Pause again. Keep going like this, stomping down one time, pausing, and taking a deep breath. Don't worry about anything else, just focus on the sensation of your foot pressing down, and the sound of the stomping. As you're stomping, I want you to notice the sensation of your body moving, and the sensation of your breath. Try to let go of the worst-case movie, and just focus on the physical sensations. Keep going until you're ready to stop, and then we can talk about what's next. Can you start?

Patient: I did the slow stomps like you said — one breath, one stomp — and for a blink it cut through the movie, but it slid back and now my chest's tighter and I'm angrier and jumpier than before. I need something firmer and very concrete right now — tell me exactly what to do (count, how many stomps, or another physical action) and keep giving me instructions until I say stop, because if you pause or get vague I'll start snapping. Please slow down and guide me step-by-step; I can't handle open-ended stuff right now.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling overwhelmed and needs a clear, concrete, and repetitive action to help them regulate their emotions. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a specific, controlled physical action to calm their body and reduce emotional distress.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to give you a very specific instruction. I want you to do the following: I want you to stand up, and then I want you to take three steps forward with your left foot, and then take three steps backward with your right foot. Repeat that process: three steps forward with your left foot, and then three steps backward with your right foot. Just focus on taking those specific steps, and don't think about anything else. Just the sensation of your feet moving, and the sound of your feet hitting the floor. Do that three times, and then we'll stop. Can you start with the first step?

Patient: Okay — I stood up and did it: three slow steps forward with my left, then three slow steps back with my right, and I repeated that three times like you said. For a breath it cut through the movie, but now my chest's constricted, my hands are numb, and the worst-case chain is screaming back — I’m getting prickly and furious. Keep giving me exact, step-by-step counts and don’t pause, because if you go vague I’ll start snapping — tell me exactly what to do next.

I want you to say the numbers out loud: "50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45". Just focus on counting and saying the numbers out loud. Don't think about anything else. Don't worry about your hands or your chest or anything else. Just the counting and saying the numbers. When you reach 1, I want you to stop counting and we'll talk. Can you start with the counting? Say "50" out loud.

Patient: 50. My head's already racing but I'll keep going — 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40. My chest's tight and the movie's screaming, but I'm doing it.

I want you to say "50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39". Just take a little deeper breath and say the next number slowly. Don't rush it. Focus on the counting and saying the numbers out loud. When you get to "39", I want you to take another deep breath and then continue counting. Can you do that for me?

I want you to focus on your feet again. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without looking at anything else. Just focus on the sensation of your feet, the weight of your body, and the sensation of the floor beneath you. Say "feet on floor" out loud as you start to focus on them. Then, I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils again. Specifically, I want you to notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils, just as it's about to enter your lungs. Say "in" out loud as you notice this sensation, and then exhale slowly without thinking about it too much. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you do that for me?

Patient: "Feet on floor."  
"in... out."

It helped for a blink, but the movie's back — chest tight, jaw clenched, I'm prickly and about to snap. Give me the next exact thing to do, step-by-step, and don't go vague.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the calmness brought on by the physical action, and their emotions are escalating rapidly again. They need a clear, concrete, and repetitive action to help regulate their emotions. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient focus on a specific, controlled physical action to calm their body and reduce emotional distress.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to take a closer look at your hands. I want you to notice the sensation of your hands on the surface they're on, without looking at anything else. Just focus on the sensation of your skin touching the surface, the feeling of your fingers spread out, and the sensation of your palms pressing against the surface. Say "hands on surface" out loud as you start to focus on them. Then, I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body again. Specifically, I want you to notice the sensation of the air leaving your body, just as it's about to enter your lungs. Say "out" out loud as you notice this sensation, and then take a slow, deep breath in without thinking about it too much. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you do that for me?

Patient: hands on surface.  
out.  
in.

It pierced the movie for a second, then it slammed back — chest tight, jaw clenched, hands numb, and I’m prickly and furious. I’m running out of steam; tell me the next exact thing to do, step-by-step, and don’t go vague or I’ll start snapping.
