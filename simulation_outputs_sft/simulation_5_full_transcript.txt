--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been having a hard time since starting this demanding new role at the firm — I keep throwing myself into hobbies and projects to avoid feeling the stress. I'm an accountant and thought I could handle the change, but it's hit me harder than I expected. I don't know, when I try to talk about it I get really uncomfortable, so I just keep busy instead.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the transition to a new, demanding role, using avoidance as a coping mechanism ("threw myself into hobbies and projects"), and feels uncomfortable discussing their emotions. Goal: Explore the avoidance and its underlying functions.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to talk about the stress of your new role? What's the first thing that comes up for you?
Note: The goal is to explore the avoidance and its functions, not to directly discuss the patient's emotions or the specific stress of their new role. The question encourages the patient to reflect on their avoidance behavior and how it relates to their emotions, without putting pressure on them to disclose more than they're comfortable sharing.

Patient: I don't know — when we start talking about it my chest tightens and I get a blank, like I can't find the words. I guess the first thing I do is grab a hobby or start some little project to keep my hands and head busy so I don't have to sit with whatever's coming up. It dulls things for a while, but then I end up feeling guilty and kind of... stuck.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing physical discomfort ("chest tightens") and a sense of being unable to process their emotions when discussing the stress of their new role ("blank"). They use avoidance as a coping mechanism ("grab a hobby" or "start some little project"), but this leads to feelings of guilt and being "stuck". Goal: Explore the feelings of guilt and being stuck to understand how they relate to the avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the guilt you feel after trying to avoid the discomfort of talking about the stress is really tight, like a knot. Can you imagine what would happen if you allowed yourself to just sit with that feeling for a moment, without trying to distract yourself? What do you think you might discover?

Patient: I don't know — if I actually sat with it my chest would tighten and I'd start thinking of a hundred little things to do so I wouldn't have to stay with it. Maybe I'd cry or feel kind of small, and that scares me, so I grab a hobby to make it go away. I guess sometimes when I do let it in a bit, it doesn't feel as huge as I thought, but then the guilt comes and I try to bury it again.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is avoiding the emotional discomfort of their feelings ("chest tightens", "thinking of a hundred little things to do") and is scared by the potential sensations ("feel kind of small"), so they resort to distraction ("grab a hobby"). Goal: Introduce a sense of willingness to explore the emotional discomfort without avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of avoidance and guilt. I want to gently suggest something: what if, instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, you could try to bring it into your awareness with a little more curiosity? Instead of grabbing a hobby to distract yourself, you could ask yourself, "What's happening right now? What's this feeling in my body?" Would that be something you'd be willing to try for just a moment?

Patient: I don't know — okay, I can try for a moment. My chest gets tight and my hands start itching to do something else, like I'm waiting for a cue to move. I guess if I stay with it a bit it sometimes eases, but then I get scared and want to grab a hobby to make it stop.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to stay with their physical sensations for a brief moment ("chest gets tight", "hands start itching"), but is still driven by avoidance ("scared", "want to grab a hobby"). Goal: Gently challenge the avoidance response and encourage brief, small steps towards defusion.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that feeling tightness in your chest and hands, and to try to stay with it for a moment. I want to ask you a question: what would happen right now if you simply stopped trying to do something else with your hands for just one more second? Would your chest tightness ease at all, or even just a little bit? Can you just observe your hands for one more breath, without trying to grab a pen or do anything else?

Patient: I don't know — okay, I'll try. My chest loosens just a tiny bit when I watch my hands; they're kind of warm and a little shaky, like they want to fidget. I guess noticing that makes the urge to grab something quieter, but my mind immediately starts listing things I could be doing instead. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed talking about this — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having a brief moment of defusion ("chest loosens just a tiny bit"), but is quickly pulled back by the avoidance response ("mind immediately starts listing things I could be doing instead"). Goal: Introduce a gentle pause to help the patient process their emotions and manage overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to slow down. It sounds like trying to think about all the things you could be doing is really triggering right now, and that's okay. Let's take a deep breath together and pause for just a moment. Can you find a comfortable place to sit, and just notice the breath moving in and out of your body? No thinking, no doing, just the breath. Let's stay here for just a minute, and then we can try to bring it back to talking about what's going on.

Patient: I don't know — I tried the breathing like you said. My chest feels a little less tight and my hands are calmer, but my mind's already listing things I should be doing. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed, so can we keep this slow?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a brief respite from physical tension ("chest feels a little less tight", "hands are calmer"), but is again struggling with the avoidance response ("mind's already listing things I should be doing"). Goal: Introduce a gentle pause to allow the patient to reassess their emotional state.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if your mind starts listing things you should be doing again. It sounds like that's a pattern for you right now. Can you just acknowledge that feeling, without trying to do anything with it? Just say to yourself, "I'm thinking about all the things I should be doing," and then... just let it go? Let's not try to act on it right now. Can you stay with that feeling, without trying to do anything, for just one more minute?

Patient: I guess I can try to stay with it for a minute. My chest's a bit looser and my hands are calmer, but my mind's already racing through a to-do list and I'm getting kind of panicky. I don't know — it's getting a bit much, can we slow down and maybe stay on something a little less sharp for now?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble sustaining defusion ("mind's already racing through a to-do list"), and is becoming overwhelmed ("getting kind of panicky"). Goal: Introduce a clear request to slow down and transition to a less intense topic.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like we've been moving a bit too fast, and that's starting to feel overwhelming for you. Can I suggest something? Let's take a step back and talk about something that's been on your mind recently, something that's not as pressing or intense. How's your relationship with your partner been lately? Is there something specific that's been going on, or just a general feeling? Let's try to explore that for just a minute, and see if we can shift the focus a bit.

Patient: I don't know — my partner and I are mostly okay, I guess. Some days we're fine, but lately I come home wound up from the new job and just dive into a hobby instead of talking, and that makes small arguments pop up. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable digging into this, can we keep it slow?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is trying to explore their relationship dynamics, but is experiencing discomfort and resistance ("feeling a bit uncomfortable digging into this"). Goal: Validate the patient's discomfort and gently encourage small steps towards exploration.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that talking about this might be uncomfortable for you right now. It's like there's a lot of tension already in your day from work, and the last thing you want to do is add more conflict to the mix. Can you just acknowledge that feeling to yourself, for a moment? It's okay to feel that way. Let's just focus on one small step right now. What's one thing you could say to your partner when you come home from work that might help ease things a bit? Maybe just something simple, like "Hey, I'm feeling a bit frazzled today" or "Can we catch up later and talk about something else?" Just one small step to try to make things a bit easier.

Patient: I don't know — maybe something small like, "Hey, I'm feeling frazzled from work; can we have dinner quietly and talk later?" I guess it's short and doesn't invite a big conversation, so it feels safer. I'm already nervous about actually saying it though, can we stay on this a bit?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is exploring a simple communication strategy (""Hey, I'm feeling frazzled from work; can we have dinner quietly and talk later?"") to reduce conflict and ease tension. Goal: Encourage the patient to take action and practice this small communication skill.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great starting point. It's a small, specific statement that acknowledges your emotions and sets a clear expectation for how you'd like to interact for the rest of the evening. It's not an invitation to dive into a big conversation, which makes it feel safer for you. Before we move on, I want to ask: What would happen right now if you just took a deep breath and said those words to your partner? Just one sentence, no fuss. What would you say, and how would you say it?

Patient: I don't know — I'd probably take a breath, walk in, and say quietly, "Hey, I'm feeling frazzled from work; can we have dinner quietly and talk later?" I'd say it low, a little shaky, avoid eye contact, and then I'm sure I'd go straight to a hobby so I don't have to sit with whatever comes next. I'm getting kind of anxious about actually doing it — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble imagining themselves taking action with the new communication strategy, and is experiencing anxiety about doing it. Goal: Help the patient build confidence and create a plan for practicing this new skill.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel anxious about taking action, especially when it comes to something as personal as communication with a partner. Let's take a step back and break it down even further. What's one tiny part of the process that you're most anxious about? Is it saying the words, avoiding eye contact, or something else entirely? Let's focus on just that one tiny part, and see if we can make it feel more manageable. Can you just imagine yourself taking one small step towards saying those words, without thinking about the rest of the process? Just focus on the single action, and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know — I can picture myself at the door, taking a breath, and saying quietly, "Hey, I'm feeling frazzled from work; can we have dinner quietly and talk later?" I guess my voice would be a little shaky and I'd probably look down, and then I'd want to disappear into a hobby right after. I'm already getting kind of overwhelmed, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in imagining themselves taking action with the new communication strategy, but is becoming overwhelmed by their own anxiety and physical sensations. Goal: Introduce a pause to help the patient process their emotions and manage their anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. It's like your body is responding to the anxiety of actually saying those words, and that's a natural reaction. Let's take a deep breath together, and pause for just a moment. Can you just notice how your body is feeling right now, without judgment? Is there any tension in your shoulders, any racing thoughts? Just be with it for a moment, and see if we can calm down just a bit. When you're ready, we can try to pick up where we left off, but for now, let's just take a pause.

Patient: I don't know — I'm trying to breathe and pay attention. My shoulders are tight, my stomach's in a knot, and my hands keep wanting to fidget, but the breath makes it a little quieter. I guess I'm a bit calmer, but can we keep this slow? I'm not sure what to do next.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is slowly gaining a sense of calm and presence, but is still uncertain about what to do next. Goal: Encourage the patient to explore their next steps with a gentle and supportive approach.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're feeling a bit calmer, and that the breath is helping to quiet your body. Take a moment to notice that feeling, without trying to change it or do anything else. Just be with it for a moment. Now, let's think about what's next. You've had a conversation with your partner about how you're feeling, and that's a good start. What kind of things might you like to talk about in that conversation? Are there any specific things that are on your mind, or any patterns that you've noticed in how you interact with your partner? Let's explore those things together, one small step at a time.

Patient: I don't know — maybe things like how to stop work from taking over evenings, like agreeing on a quiet dinner and a short check-in later. I guess I'd want to admit I feel guilty for disappearing into hobbies instead of talking, which makes me feel like I'm failing, and that shame makes me clam up. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed — can we stay on this slowly for a moment?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is exploring specific communication patterns and feelings related to work, guilt, and shame, which is a crucial step towards understanding and addressing these issues. Goal: Validate the patient's emotions and help them build confidence in expressing their feelings.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely understandable that you'd want to explore ways to stop work from taking over your evenings, and that you'd want to admit to feeling guilty about disappearing into hobbies instead of talking to your partner. It's a brave thing to acknowledge those feelings, especially given how they can make you feel like you're failing. It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now, but let's try to break it down just a bit more. Can you imagine talking to your partner about this, and saying something like, "Hey, I feel really guilty when I'm done with work and I just disappear into my hobby. It feels like I'm failing because I'm not spending enough time with you." What do you think would happen if you just took a deep breath and said that to your partner? Would it feel any less overwhelming, or would it be a completely new experience?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I said that they'd probably be understanding and we'd have a quiet dinner, but right after I'd feel ridiculous and ashamed, like I'm failing again. That shame tightens my chest and makes my hands twitch — I get mad at myself for always stumbling, and then I just want to disappear into a hobby after dinner. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed just imagining it, can we slow down and stick with something a bit less sharp for a moment?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to articulate their feelings about expressing guilt and shame, and how it affects their behavior. The goal is to help them find a way to process these emotions without becoming overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a calming influence to help the patient regulate their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now, and it's understandable that the thought of expressing those feelings to your partner is causing you distress. Let's take a step back and focus on just one aspect of that experience. Can you imagine sitting down to dinner with your partner, and you take a deep breath before speaking? You say those words, "I feel really guilty when I'm done with work and I just disappear into my hobby." What's the first physical sensation you notice in your body right after you say those words? Is it tightening, relaxing, or something else? Let's just be with that sensation for a moment, without judgment.

Patient: I don't know — right after I say it my chest clamps down and my face goes hot, like that old shame rushes back and I get mad at myself for even saying it. My hands start fidgeting and my jaw tightens, and there's this sharp little frustration that makes me want to bail into a hobby. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a strong emotional response to expressing guilt and shame, characterized by physical sensations of shame, anger, and frustration. The goal is to help the patient regulate these emotions and find a way to manage them. Goal: Introduce a gentle pause to help the patient catch their breath and reflect on their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you say those words, all these old feelings come rushing back, and it's like you're hitting a brick wall. Take a deep breath with me, right now. Just focus on the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to push the feelings away or fight them, just be with the breath. When you're ready, let's take a moment to acknowledge those feelings without judgment. You've got the chest tightening, the face getting hot, the hands fidgeting... just notice them, right now. What do you think might help you to feel a little more grounded, just for a moment?

Patient: I don't know — maybe just feeling my feet on the floor and taking slow breaths could help. I guess squeezing my hands or rubbing my wrists might calm the jitters, though it feels kind of ridiculous that I need that. The shame makes me snap at myself and get irritated, so can we slow down and stay on something a bit less sharp for a while?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is looking for ways to calm their physical sensations and regulate their emotions, but is also struggling with self-judgment and shame. The goal is to introduce a calming influence without exacerbating the patient's self-criticism. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental approach to help the patient calm their physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal that you're reaching for physical sensations to calm down, like squeezing your hands or rubbing your wrists. It's not ridiculous at all. Let's just acknowledge that for a moment. You're trying to manage some intense physical sensations, and your body is responding in ways that feel helpful right now. Instead of judging yourself for that, let's focus on just taking one small step back. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor? Let's just stay with that sensation for a moment, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: I don't know — my feet feel kind of heavy and steady on the floor, like they're the only part that isn't buzzing. I guess that helps a little, but my chest's still tight and that sharp shame keeps poking at me, so it's hard to stay with it. Can we keep this slow?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has found a small sense of grounding with their feet, but is still struggling with the physical sensations of shame and tightness in their chest. The goal is to maintain the slow pace and help the patient stay with their emotions. Goal: Introduce a gentle inquiry to help the patient explore their emotions in a non-judgmental way.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that your feet feel heavy and steady on the floor. That can be a good anchor, right? Can you just acknowledge that sensation for a moment? Now, let's gently explore the sensation in your chest. Can you imagine that tightness in your chest as a separate thing from the rest of you? What's it like to be in your chest right now? Is it like a knot, or a warmth, or something else entirely? Let's just observe that sensation without trying to change it or do anything with it. Just be with it for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — it's like a tight, heavy knot right under my ribs, like something's closing in. I guess it makes me feel small and stupid, like I messed up again, and that shame makes me want to grab a hobby and disappear. It's getting a bit much to keep talking — can we slow down and stay with something a little less sharp for a moment?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing intense physical and emotional sensations, including a sense of shame and smallness. The goal is to maintain a slow pace and help the patient stay with their emotions without becoming overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a gentle pause and reassurance.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. That knot under your ribs can be really intense, and it's understandable that you're feeling small and stupid. Can you just acknowledge those feelings for a moment, without judgment? You've been doing the best you can, and it's okay if things aren't perfect. It's okay to feel scared or uncertain. You don't have to push through these feelings right now. Just take a deep breath, and let's pause for a moment. Can you just focus on your breath, and let's go from there?

Patient: I don't know — I'm trying to pay attention to the breath and my feet feel steady, and that helps a little. The knot in my chest is still there and that old shame keeps nudging me, makes me want to crawl into a hobby and hide. I guess I'm getting worn out talking about it — can we just stay with the breath for a bit longer, slowly?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to focus on the breath and their feet, which is helping to calm them slightly. However, the knot in their chest and shame are still present, causing them to feel overwhelmed. The goal is to continue supporting the patient in this moment. Goal: Maintain the slow pace and focus on the breath.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to take things slow. You've been doing a good job of focusing on your breath, and that's helping to calm you down a bit. Just take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation of your feet on the floor. Let's just stay with this sensation for a moment longer, without trying to do anything else. You can keep talking if you need to, but we can also just keep focusing on the breath if that feels more comfortable.

Patient: I don't know — the breath helps a little and my feet feel steady, but that shame keeps poking at me like a familiar weight and it makes me want to vanish into a hobby. I guess I'm getting pretty worn out talking about it. Can we just keep with the breath and the feet for a bit longer, slowly?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a sense of relief with the breath and their feet, but the shame is still present and causing them to feel overwhelmed. The goal is to continue supporting the patient in this moment. Goal: Maintain the slow pace and focus on the breath and feet.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to keep going at this pace. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Just focus on your breath for a moment longer, and notice the sensation of your feet on the floor. Don't worry about the shame right now, just be with the breath. You can take things one step at a time, one breath at a time. Just keep going, slowly.

Patient: I don't know — the breathing and feeling my feet help a little, but that old shame keeps poking at me and it feels heavy. Can we just stay with the breath and my feet for a bit longer, slowly? Maybe after that we could talk about something less sharp, like a small thing that felt okay today.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is seeking a gentle transition from the current intense emotional state to a more manageable one. The goal is to maintain the slow pace and focus on the breath and feet. Goal: Gradually introduce a new theme.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit more grounded with the breath and your feet. Let's just stay with that for a moment longer. You can keep focusing on your breath and notice how your feet feel on the floor. Take your time, don't rush. When you're ready, we can try to introduce something else. Maybe we can talk about something small that felt okay today, like a good cup of coffee or a nice walk outside. Just one small thing that didn't feel too overwhelming. Let's see how that feels.

Patient: I don't know — today I had a nice cup of coffee before work; it was warm and steady and that felt...okay for a minute. Then I started feeling guilty for enjoying it, like I shouldn't be relaxed, so I went back to thinking about all the things I haven't done. Can we keep this slow?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to recall a small, positive experience from the day, but is quickly pulled back into negative thoughts and feelings of guilt. The goal is to maintain a slow pace and help the patient explore their emotions. Goal: Introduce a gentle inquiry to help the patient reflect on their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that you mention the coffee, because it sounds like it was a small moment of comfort. What was it about the coffee that felt okay for a minute? Was it the taste, the warmth, or something else? Try to stay with that feeling for a moment. Notice how it was different from the rest of your experience today. It's okay to acknowledge the guilt and worries that came up afterwards, but let's just focus on the coffee right now. How does it feel to remember that small moment of relaxation?

Patient: I don't know — it was just warm and steady, a small normal thing that felt okay for a minute. Then the guilt crept in, like I don't deserve it, and that old shame makes my chest tighten and my hands want to fidget so I can disappear into a hobby. Can we keep this slow and stick with something a bit less sharp for now?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a positive focus on the coffee, and is quickly becoming overwhelmed by guilt and shame. The goal is to maintain a slow pace and focus on a less intense theme. Goal: Introduce a calming influence.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to acknowledge the guilt and shame right now. It sounds like they're really intense feelings for you. Let's just take a deep breath together and focus on the sensation of our feet on the floor. Can you just notice the feeling of your feet, without trying to change it or do anything with it? Just be with the sensation of your feet for a moment. Let's try to calm down and take things one step at a time. We can come back to the coffee or anything else later. For now, just focus on your breath and your feet.

Patient: I don't know — I'm trying to keep my attention on the breath and the weight of my feet. They feel steady, but that old shame keeps poking at the chest and making everything feel messy. Can we just stay with the breath and feet a little longer?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to maintain focus on the breath and feet, but is still being pulled back into the shame and emotional pain. The goal is to provide a gentle, calming presence. Goal: Continue to offer a calm, non-judgmental space for the patient to explore their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel the shame and emotional pain right now. It's like it's really overwhelming you. Can you just acknowledge that feeling for a moment? Notice how it's affecting your body and your breath. Don't try to push it away or change it, just be with it as it is. You can stay with the sensation of your feet on the floor and the breath moving in and out of your body. Just take your time, and let things be as they are for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — the breathing and my feet help a bit, but that same stupid shame keeps poking at me, like I messed up again, and it makes my chest clamp down. I'm kind of worn out talking about it. Can we keep this slow and just stay with the breath a little longer, or maybe talk about something small and not so sharp, like that coffee?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a sense of relief in wanting to talk about something small and not as sharp, like the coffee. The goal is to validate this desire and explore its potential for offering comfort and distraction. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of the idea of using a small, positive experience as a coping mechanism.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel worn out from talking about this. It sounds like the shame and guilt are really taking a toll on you. Can we try to find something else to focus on for a moment? You mentioned the coffee earlier, and it seemed like a small moment of comfort. Let's just explore that for a moment. Can you tell me more about what it was about the coffee that felt okay for you? Was it the taste, the warmth, or something else? Let's just see if we can find some small sense of comfort in that for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — it was the warmth and the quiet, a tiny routine I, as an accountant, could control for a minute. I guess it made me feel normal for a bit, but then the guilt sneaks in and I tell myself I don't deserve it, so I end up disappearing into a hobby. Can we keep this slow?
