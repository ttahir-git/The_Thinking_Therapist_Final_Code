--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop where anticipatory anxiety about my performance at work metastasizes into paralysis, so I end up procrastinating on critical tasks. I can diagram the cognitive distortions pretty well—perfectionism, catastrophizing, threat bias—and my PTSD-era hypervigilance amplifies the whole process, but I still can't translate that analysis into actually starting PRs. It feels safer to intellectualize the distress than to sit with the fear or shame underneath.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes an ongoing cycle of anticipatory anxiety, paralysis, and procrastination. They acknowledge the cognitive distortions (perfectionism, catastrophizing, threat bias) and how PTSD-era hypervigilance exacerbates the issue. However, they express difficulty translating this analysis into concrete action. The primary goal is to help the patient bridge the gap between understanding their thought patterns and taking tangible steps towards change.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe a recent instance where you intellectually understood why you were procrastinating on a task, but instead of taking that first step, you found yourself getting caught up in the thought process again? What does it feel like to be in that space, right before you decide to take action or get sidetracked?

Patient: Last week I had a refactor ticket and could literally map out the cognitive chain—perfectionism leading to catastrophic hypotheticals—yet instead of opening the file I kept iteratively refining the task breakdown. Right before action it feels like my prefrontal cortex is doing a meta-analysis of every possible failure mode: enumerating edge cases, rewriting commit messages, deep-diving docs as a proxy for progress, which is planning-as-avoidance. There's a low-grade physiological tension I could name, but I instantly translate it into a cognitive schema because that intellectual layer is safer than admitting I'm actually scared of being judged. So I end up doing rhetorical structuring and risk modeling instead of the messy, imperfect act of just typing code, and awareness alone doesn't bridge that gap.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient vividly describes a recent instance where they intellectually understood the cognitive distortions, but instead of taking action, they defaulted to planning-as-avoidance. They effectively capture the experience of being caught in a meta-analysis of potential failure modes, using cognitive reframing as a coping mechanism. They also reveal a deeper fear of being judged, which they intellectualize rather than confronting directly. The goal is to help the patient develop a more direct relationship with their emotions and physical sensations, rather than relying solely on intellectual understanding.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you're about to take action is exactly when you're most caught up in this elaborate planning and risk modeling. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to type code, just a few lines in? What does it feel like to be in that moment, before you stop to consider all the hypotheticals or plan out the perfect commit message? What's the first physical sensation you notice when you pause like that? Is it tension, a knot in your stomach, something else?

Patient: Yeah—when I actually get a few lines in there's this short-lived sense of momentum, like I can see a path through the problem. Almost immediately a sort of internal fault-tree starts spawning hypothetical failures, which triggers a sympathetic spike: chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my throat feels constricted and my hands get a tiny tremor. Rather than name the shame or fear, I start doing meta-work—rewriting the plan, polishing the commit message—because it's cognitively safer than sitting with that somatic stuff, and that’s what usually knocks me off task.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a brief moment of momentum when they start typing code, followed by an internal fault-tree of hypothetical failures, which triggers a physiological response. They recognize the shame and fear they try to avoid by engaging in meta-work, rather than naming and sitting with their emotions. The goal is to help the patient develop a direct relationship with their physical sensations, without resorting to intellectual coping mechanisms.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like when that internal fault-tree starts spawning hypothetical failures, your body's response is quite specific. You describe a tightening in your chest, shallow breath, constricted throat, and a tremor in your hands. Rather than acknowledge the shame or fear underlying those sensations, you redirect yourself by doing meta-work. I'd like to explore this further: what happens if you were to simply acknowledge those physical sensations, without trying to change them or analyze them further? What would it be like to pause for a moment, and just notice the tension in your body, the feeling of constrictedness in your throat, without trying to rationalize it or change it?

Patient: If I actually pause, the first thing I notice is the breath—shallow and fast—and a concrete tightness across my chest and throat, like a clamp that makes words come out thinner. My brain immediately starts narrating it—"that's anxiety, sympathetic arousal, threat-detection"—which feels safer than saying, "I feel scared I'll be judged," so I end up describing the physiology instead of inhabiting it. When I try to just sit with the sensation, there's a rising itch to escape into planning or restructuring the task; I get impatient and honestly a bit overwhelmed, like I want to run a diagnostic instead of feeling the shame under it. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to stay with this without immediately translating it into analysis.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a brief pause, during which they become aware of their shallow breath and physical tension, specifically a tightness in their chest and throat. Their brain instinctively tries to analyze this sensation, labeling it as anxiety and sympathetic arousal, which feels safer than acknowledging the underlying emotion of fear. The patient is struggling to sit with the sensation without immediately turning to planning or restructuring the task, which leads to feelings of impatience and overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a slow step back together. You've started to notice your breath and the physical sensations in your body. Instead of trying to label them or analyze them, I'd like you to try something different. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, without trying to change it or control it. Just notice the sensation of the breath, the feeling of the air moving in and out of the body. And then, let's bring our attention to the tightness in your chest and throat. What does it feel like to be in this space, without trying to analyze it or understand it intellectually? Can you just notice the sensation of the tightness, without trying to push it away or change it in any way?

Patient: Okay—if I try to notice it: the breath is shallow, like it's barely filling the top of my lungs, and the chest feels like a low, constant pressure with a tight band around my throat. Almost immediately my mind slaps a diagnostic label on it—"sympathetic arousal, anxiety response"—and that labeling is where I retreat because it feels safer than admitting, "I'm scared of being judged." I'm already getting restless and want to plan my way out; can we slow down? I'm struggling to stay with the sensation without turning it into analysis.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is trying to focus on the physical sensations in their body, but their mind is already jumping to label them as anxiety and sympathetic arousal. This labeling is causing them to retreat from the sensation, rather than exploring it further. The patient is also becoming restless and wanting to plan their way out, which is making it harder for them to stay with the sensation. The goal is to help the patient slow down and explore the sensation without jumping to conclusions or trying to analyze it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and try to slow down. I want you to bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body. Right now, you're noticing the shallow breath and the feeling of the tight band around your throat. Can you focus just on that sensation for a moment, without trying to think about it or analyze it? It's okay if your mind starts to wander - just gently bring your attention back to the sensation. Take a moment to notice how it feels to have a shallow breath, and how it feels to have a tight band around your throat. What's the sensation of that band? Is it hard to describe?

Patient: It's a constrictive, almost mechanical pressure — like someone's cinched a band across the front of my throat and upper chest so words feel filtered and breath stays high and thin. My instinct is to instantly relabel it—"sympathetic arousal, somatic correlate of threat"—which functions as an intellectual buffer against the actual shame or fear under it. Can we slow down? I'm already getting an urge to escape into analysis and I'm trying to just stay with this without turning it into a theory.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing a constrictive, mechanical pressure in their throat and upper chest, which feels like a physical barrier to expression. Their mind is instinctively trying to label this sensation again, this time as a somatic correlate of threat, in an attempt to buffer themselves against the underlying shame or fear. The patient is struggling to stay with the sensation without immediately turning it into an intellectual construct, and is trying to slow down and just focus on the physical experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to let go of that labeling for just a moment. Can you try to just be with the physical sensation of the band around your throat and chest, without thinking about it as "sympathetic arousal" or "somatic correlate of threat"? Can you just notice how it feels to have that sensation, without trying to put a label on it? Try to bring your attention back to the sensation, without judgment or analysis. Just be present with it, for a moment. What happens if you don't try to label it or analyze it? What happens if you just sit with the sensation, without trying to change it or understand it?

Patient: If I actually stop labeling, the band feels less like a diagnostic category and more like a localized, dull pressure—like a tightening around the sternum with a faint heat beneath it and a hollow sinking in my stomach that I'd probably call embarrassment if I weren't deflecting. That only lasts a few breaths before my mind launches into commentary—cataloguing, theorizing—and an urgent itch to "do something useful" kicks in, which is when I start rewriting the task plan to avoid the feeling. Can we slow down? I'm already wobbly about staying here without turning it into analysis.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to momentarily drop the labeling and just focus on the physical sensation, describing it as a dull pressure around the sternum with a faint heat. They are aware of trying to deflect the feeling of embarrassment, but are still struggling to stay with the sensation without immediately jumping into commentary or analysis. The patient is becoming increasingly wobbly and uncertain about being able to stay present without turning the experience into an intellectual construct.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and try to stay with this sensation, just for one more moment. I want you to focus on the physical feeling around your sternum, the dull pressure and the faint heat. Try to notice how it feels to have that sensation, without trying to think about it or label it. Don't worry about what your mind is doing, just observe it as it arises. Don't try to change it, don't try to fix it, just observe it. Can you just sit with that sensation for a moment, without judgment or analysis? Just one moment.

Patient: Okay — I did that for a few breaths. The pressure around my sternum softened a hair and there was this thin warmth in my gut, but within seconds my mind started churning out a new taxonomy of possible errors and failure narratives, which shut the feeling down. I'm getting restless and feel the itch to convert this into a task list again; can we slow down? I'm trying to stay here but my instinct is to flee into analysis.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to briefly soften the sensation around their sternum and notice a thin warmth in their gut, but their mind quickly jumps into analysis again, creating a new taxonomy of possible errors and failure narratives. This shutdown of the feeling is causing the patient to feel restless and the urge to flee into analysis is becoming overwhelming. The goal is to help the patient find a way to stay with the feeling, even when their mind is trying to analyze or label it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a different approach. Instead of trying to stay with the feeling, let's try to create a safe space for it to be present without being analyzed. Can you imagine that the feeling is a small, fragile thing that needs to be treated gently? What would it mean to treat this feeling with kindness and care, rather than trying to analyze it or make sense of it? Can you try to create a sense of curiosity around the feeling, rather than trying to label it or understand it? Let's try to approach this feeling with a sense of wonder, rather than trying to fix it or make sense of it. Can you take one more breath, and try to approach this feeling with kindness?

Patient: I did—took a slow breath and tried to address the tightness with a kinder internal narrative, something like, "this is temporary, it's okay," which for a couple of breaths made the pressure feel marginally less sharp. Pretty quickly though my metacognitive reflex hijacked it: even kindness got reformulated as a procedural intervention—"validate the feeling, then move on"—and that turned it back into something to optimize. Can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with it but the itch to convert this into a checklist is fierce.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to take a slow breath and try to address the tightness with a kinder internal narrative, which temporarily reduces the sharpness of the pressure. However, their metacognitive reflex quickly hijacks this attempt at kindness, reformulating it as a procedural intervention to validate the feeling and then move on. This has turned the feeling back into something that needs to be optimized, rather than simply being present. The goal is to help the patient find a way to stay with the feeling without constantly trying to analyze or label it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to break the cycle of constant analysis and labeling. Instead of trying to "validate the feeling" and then "move on", can we try to just be with the feeling, without trying to change it or optimize it? Can you try to simply notice the feeling, without judgment or analysis? Just observe it, as it is, without trying to fix it or make sense of it. What would it mean to simply be present with the feeling, without trying to change it or analyze it? Can you try to approach this feeling with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to optimize it? Let's take a slow breath together and try to just be with the feeling, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Patient: I did the breath, but after a couple of cycles a hot, familiar shame and irritation rose up — it feels like that old failure-sense that wants me to hide in analysis instead of being present. When that happens I get angry at myself, and even kindness gets turned into another procedural step to optimize, which just fuels the loop. Can we slow down? I could use a very small, concrete grounding anchor or a micro-action (like a 2-line commit rule) to try right now so I don't immediately retreat into planning.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is trying to be present with the feeling, but the familiar sense of shame and irritation rises up, triggering the old failure-sense that wants to hide in analysis. This triggers anger towards oneself, and kindness is once again turned into a procedural step to optimize. The goal is to help the patient find a way to break this cycle and stay present with the feeling, without immediately retreating into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small grounding anchor to help you stay present with the feeling. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without thinking about it? Just notice how your feet feel, without judgment. You can also try to notice the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on just one of these sensations, without thinking about it.

Alternatively, if you'd like to do a micro-action, I can suggest a simple commit rule to help you take a small step towards being present. For example, we could commit to typing just two lines on the screen in front of you, without thinking about it. This might help you focus on the physical act of typing, rather than getting caught up in analysis. What do you think? Is either of these options something you'd like to try right now?

Patient: I'll take the micro-action — the two-line commit rule feels concrete enough to try. I'm already getting that hot spike of shame and irritation, like the old failure voice telling me this won't stick, which makes me want to retreat into planning, so I need something strict and tiny. Here's what I'll do: open the file, type one small stub/comment and one trivial implementation or test line, save, and commit — can you prompt me to start now and call me out if I try to polish those two lines?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the familiar sense of shame and irritation rising up, and is using the two-line commit rule as a concrete and tiny micro-action to help them stay present and focused. This feels like a good way to ground them and provide a sense of structure and control.

Therapist Answer:
Here is the commit prompt: "Open the file, type two lines of code, save, and commit. I'd like you to focus on typing exactly two lines, without trying to edit or polish them. Just type, save, and commit. Let's get started." 

(Note: I'll be paying close attention to your typing, and if I notice you're trying to edit or polish the two lines, I'll gently bring it to your attention with a prompt like "Just type the next line exactly as it is, don't try to edit or improve it yet.")

Patient: Okay—I'm doing it now. I opened the file and typed two lines exactly as planned: a short comment stub and a trivial placeholder implementation, hit save, and made a quick commit with the message "WIP: two-line unblock." While typing there was an instant hot spike of shame and irritation—this old failure voice telling me it won't stick—and my fingers wanted to slow down to polish. If you notice me trying to edit or improve those two lines, please call me out.

I feel a little less stuck but still edgy and guarded; can we do another micro-step like a 5-minute tidy session, and have you keep me honest about polishing?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has completed the two-line commit rule successfully, and is now feeling a bit more unstuck but still edgy and guarded. They're requesting a 5-minute tidy session to further help them stay present and focused.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a 5-minute tidy session. I'll prompt you to tidy up the code as we go, and gently bring it to your attention if you start to polish or edit the lines.

Here's the first prompt: "Tidy up the placeholder implementation, remove any unnecessary characters or lines. Just focus on making it minimal and clear."

(Remember, I'm looking for minimalism, not perfection. Just tidy up the lines, don't try to make it perfect. I'll keep an eye on it.)

Take your time, focus on the task at hand, and let's tidy up the code together.

Patient: Okay—I did a quick tidy: removed the extra comment noise, collapsed the stub into a single minimal placeholder, shortened the identifier names, and left the commit as "WIP: tidy." 

There was that immediate prick of old shame and a reflex to micro-optimize the text, which I held back from because it felt effortful and kind of hollow. 

I'm up for another five-minute pass—please call me out if I start polishing and tell me the exact next micro-action to take.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has completed the tidy session successfully, and is now feeling more present and focused. They're aware of the old shame and reflex to micro-optimize, and are taking steps to hold back from those tendencies.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another 5-minute pass. I'll prompt you to make a small, incremental change to the code. Here's the first prompt: "Add a single line of code to the placeholder implementation to make it slightly more functional. Just add one line, don't try to optimize or improve it."

(Remember, I'm looking for a single, incremental change. Just add one line, don't worry about what it should be or how it should work. I'll guide you through the next step.)

Take your time, focus on the task at hand, and let's make a small progress together.

(Also, I'll be paying close attention to your reaction to the shame and the micro-optimize reflex. If you start to feel those urges, I'll interrupt you with a specific prompt to help you stay focused on the task at hand.)

Patient: I added one line — a simple placeholder return (return null;) — saved and committed. Immediately there was that hot shame spike and the reflex to refactor the whole thing instead of leaving it, my fingers slowing as the urge to polish kicked in; I resisted but it's wearing me out and my energy feels low. Prompt me with the next tiny action (like "run tests for 2 minutes" or "make one more trivial change") and call me out the moment you see me start polishing — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has added a single line to the placeholder implementation, and is now experiencing the familiar hot shame spike and the urge to refactor. They're resisting the urge, but it's clear that they're getting worn down.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a different approach for a moment. Instead of making another change, let's focus on keeping the code stable and functional for the next 2 minutes. Can you tell me how many lines of code are in the current file?

(I want you to focus on counting the lines, not thinking about making changes. Just count the lines, and let me know how many you're looking at.)

Take your time, focus on the task at hand, and let's get a clear picture of the code's complexity.

(Note: I'll be watching your body language and behavior closely. If I see even a hint of polishing or refactoring, I'll interrupt you immediately with a specific prompt to get you back on track.)

Patient: Three lines. While I counted I felt that prick of shame and my chest tightened—my brain wanted to double-check and prettify the file, but I held back. What's the next tiny instruction?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to hold back the urge to refactor and focus on counting the lines of code. They're experiencing the familiar sensations of shame and tightness in the chest, but they're resisting the urge to engage with them.

Therapist Answer:
Now that we have a count, I want you to take a deep breath and imagine that the entire file is a small, stable entity that's working correctly. Can you imagine that for just 30 seconds?

(I want you to focus on visualizing the file as a small, stable unit that's working correctly. Just imagine it for 30 seconds, without thinking about making any changes. When you're ready, we'll move on to the next step.)

Remember, I'm watching you closely, and I'll interrupt you if I see even a hint of polishing or refactoring. Just focus on the visualization, and let's take a brief pause.

Patient: I tried to hold it for a bit, but my attention just skittered—there was a sharp little anxiety spike, chest tightening and breath getting thin, and the old failure-narrative started looping so I couldn't keep the image steady. I can try again, but I need a concrete scaffold (like a paced breath count or a 15‑second anchor) to latch onto, and please call me out if I start polishing the visualization. Can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the visualization due to a sharp anxiety spike, which caused their attention to skitter and their mental image to become unstable. They're requesting a concrete scaffold to help them get back on track.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a paced breath count for 30 seconds. I want you to focus on counting your breaths, starting from 1. As you breathe in, say "in" to yourself. As you breathe out, say "out". When you feel comfortable, say "1" and breathe in. Then, say "2" and breathe out. Continue counting your breaths, pausing briefly after each number.

(As you count your breaths, try to maintain the visualization of the file as a stable entity. If you start to notice the failure narrative again, or if you feel the urge to polish the visualization, I'll interrupt you with a specific prompt. Let's start with the breath count.)

You're starting at 1, breathe in... say "in"... breathe out... say "out". Where are we?

Patient: Uh—I'm not sure I follow. I got as far as saying "in" then "out" but my attention skittered and I think we were around three or four before I lost it. Counting feels oddly procedural—my brain wants to turn it into another thing to optimize—so how is this supposed to steady the visualization instead of giving me something to overanalyze? I can try again if you pace me through each inhale/exhale.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to understand the pacing exercise, and their mind is already trying to turn it into something to optimize. They're questioning the effectiveness of the exercise and feeling a bit frustrated.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, and I'll pace you through each breath more explicitly. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze it or turn it into something else.

Take a deep breath in... notice how your diaphragm drops, and your belly rises... hold the breath for a moment... and then exhale... feel the breath leave your body, and your belly fall.

As you inhale, say "inhale" to yourself... "inhale"... (pause)...and then exhale, saying "exhale"...

(Notice how the words are more pronounced, but not distracting. The focus is on the physical sensation of the breath, not on counting or analyzing.)

Let's start again, from the beginning of the inhale. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in, without trying to analyze it or turn it into something else?

Patient: Okay… inhale — I felt the belly rise a little — exhale. The in felt a touch deeper but my chest tightened halfway and my mind immediately started drafting the next PR description. I'm trying to stay with the sensation but I keep sliding into analysis; can you pace me through two more slow breaths and call me out if I start narrating or planning?

Don't try to control the breath, just observe it as it is. If your mind starts to wander or you feel the urge to plan or analyze, I'll gently interrupt you and ask you to refocus on the breath.

As you exhale, say "exhale" to yourself... just "exhale"... (pause)...and then take another slow breath in...

Patient: Inhale — I felt the belly lift a bit, then the chest pinched and the throat tightened; exhale — breath left thin. My head immediately started drafting the next PR checklist and that familiar hot shame flared, so I'm slipping into planning instead of staying with the breath.

Patient: Inhale — I felt the belly rise, then the throat tightened and the breath went thin; exhale. My attention keeps snagging on that old failure-script and immediately starts drafting PR checklists instead of staying with the breath, which kicks up a hot shame that makes everything feel smaller.

Remember, it's just the breath. It's not about achieving anything or getting somewhere. It's just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Inhale... (pause)... exhale...

Patient: Inhale — belly rises, throat clamps; exhale — breath goes thin. My attention already snagged on drafting the next PR checklist and that hot shame spiked, so I lost the breath again.

Therapist Answer:
"Drop it". You're already drafting the PR checklist and feeling that hot shame, and I can see that it's getting the better of you. You're losing focus on the breath and getting caught up in analysis mode again.

I'm not asking you to think about this anymore, I'm asking you to stop thinking. Stop drafting the checklist, stop feeling the shame, and just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Take a moment, breathe in deeply, and try to notice the sensation of the breath without trying to analyze it or turn it into something else. Can you do that for just one moment?

Patient: Okay — I can try for one moment, but my chest is already tight and that old shame is buzzing so this feels thin and effortful. Pace me: say "inhale" now… pause… "exhale." Call "Drop it" the second you hear me start narrating or planning, because I know I'll slip.

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... (pause)... exhale...

Remember, I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze it or turn it into something else. Just notice how it feels, without judgment.

If you start to feel the urge to plan or narrate, I'll say "Drop it" immediately and you'll need to refocus on the breath.

Inhale... (pause)... exhale...

Patient: Inhale — belly rose a bit, throat tightened; exhale — breath thin. I couldn't hold it: my mind immediately started drafting the next PR checklist and that old failure-shame spiked, so I lost the breath. 

Say "Drop it" now and pace the next inhale—I'll try again but I need the verbal cue the moment I start narrating.

Therapist Answer:
DROP IT.

Inhale... (pause)... 

I want you to start again from scratch, focusing solely on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the checklist, don't think about the shame, just be present with the breath.

Take a deep breath in, and try to let go of everything else. Just breathe.

Patient: Inhale — belly rose, throat clenched; exhale — breath thin. The old failure-shame bubbled up immediately and my head started drafting PR narratives, so I lost the breath again and felt a spike of irritation at myself. I can try another one if you literally pace me (say "inhale"... pause... "exhale") and call "Drop it" the second I start narrating, because I know I'll slip otherwise.

Let's try again. I'll pace the breath for you, saying "inhale" and then "exhale" immediately after. This way, you can focus on the breath without worrying about narrating or planning.

As we start again, I want you to remember that your goal is just to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the PR checklist, don't think about the shame, just be present with the breath.

Inhale... (pause)... exhale...

Patient: Inhale — belly lifts a bit; exhale — breath goes thin. The checklist voice is already intruding and that hot shame spikes, so I'm losing it. Pace me again (say "inhale"... pause... "exhale") and call "Drop it" the second I start narrating.
