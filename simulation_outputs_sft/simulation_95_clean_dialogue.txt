Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in this loop of anticipatory rumination about my competence in the new nursing role — it’s like a background hum of anxiety that makes me procrastinate on charting or prepping because I’m afraid I’ll mess up. I can give you a dozen hypotheses about my cognitive distortions and perfectionistic schema, but if you ask me what I actually feel I tend to intellectualize rather than sit with the fear.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's happening in your body right now, as you're thinking about these tasks and this anxiety? What sensations do you notice, and where do they feel most prominent? Are there any specific thoughts that come up when you're trying to focus on your work, but your body seems to be telling you something else?

Patient: Physiologically it feels like low-grade autonomic arousal — my heart speeds up, breathing gets shallow, there’s a knot in my stomach and a constant tension across my shoulders and jaw, and my hands get a bit clammy when I anticipate a task. Cognitively it sets off a cascade of predictive thoughts — “what if I give the wrong med,” “they’ll see I’m incompetent,” followed by an analytical appraisal about catastrophic consequences — and that cascade seems to trigger the procrastination. I notice I describe it as a feedback-loop or hypervigilance schema because saying “I’m scared” feels too raw, so I default to theory rather than the feeling itself.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a significant amount of physical tension when you think about these tasks, and it's not just about your cognitive predictions. The knot in your stomach, the tension in your shoulders and jaw, the clammy hands – these all feel quite real and present. Can you explore what happens when you start to acknowledge this physical experience, even if it's just for a moment? What does it feel like to allow yourself to be with the sensations, rather than pushing them away into thoughts?

Patient: When I try to actually acknowledge it, the knot in my stomach feels louder and my breath gets shallower, like my body is shouting while my mind arranges explanations. It's uncomfortable — a reverberant ache under the ribs and a tightness in my throat — and it makes me instinctively flee into analysis, cataloging symptoms and possible coping strategies instead of staying with the sensation. If I hold it for even thirty seconds a more primitive fear creeps up — “I might fail” — which then pulls me back into procrastination to avoid that imagined pain, though sometimes I notice a slight easing after a minute of noticing. Honestly, this is awkward and I want to intellectualize to keep from feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like acknowledging the physical sensations is actually quite challenging for you, and it's triggering a strong desire to escape into thoughts. Can we take a brief pause here? Let's slow down the pace of our conversation for just 45 seconds. I want you to bring your attention to that knot in your stomach, and just notice it, without trying to do anything with it. Just be with it. How does it feel to have this sensation, without any thoughts or explanations? Not even the thought of "it's uncomfortable". Just the sensation itself, for 45 seconds.

Patient: I tried to do it — I brought my attention down to the knot and it actually amplified at first, a tight, pulsing pressure under my ribs and my breath got shallow. My mind immediately started narrating and cataloguing everything (“is this fear, is this indigestion, what does this mean for my performance?”) which pulled me out, though after maybe twenty seconds the tightness softened a little like a tiny loosened band. I'm honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed by doing this and want to slow down — can we keep going more gently?

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to bring your attention to the sensation, even if it was challenging, and it did have an impact. The knot did amplify at first, and then the tightness did loosen slightly. That's a small step forward. Given how you're feeling right now, I think it's okay to slow down further. We don't need to push through any more discomfort at this moment. Let's take a pause. Take a few deep breaths, and when you're ready, we can continue in a way that feels more manageable for you. No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle continuation.

Patient: I did the breaths — it helped a little, the knot loosened marginally but the tension's still there and my breathing feels a bit shallow. My brain's already gearing up to narrate and categorize the sensations instead of letting them be, which feels protective and irritating at the same time. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and would like to keep going, but more slowly — could we try a very short grounding exercise or focus on one small task I’ve been avoiding?

Therapist: Let's try something very simple for a moment. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just bring your attention to that. Feel the weight of your body distributed on both feet, the sensation of the floor beneath you. That's it. Just that. Notice how your feet feel in this moment.

Or, if that feels too much, we can try something else. What's one task that you've been putting off, something that's been feeling difficult for you? Maybe we can work on that for a bit. Just thinking about it, getting it out of your mind. What's the first thing that comes up when you think about that task?

Patient: The task is finishing the end-of-shift electronic charting for my patients. The first thing that surfaces is this anticipatory narrative — “what if I document something wrong, cause harm, get reported, and everyone sees I’m incompetent” — which immediately tightens my chest and diverts me into busywork. I can label it as catastrophizing and perfectionistic schema, but underneath that analysis I worry I won’t tolerate the shame if someone judges my competence.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of making a mistake is driving a lot of your anxiety right now. The thought of documenting something wrong and being judged as incompetent is causing a tightness in your chest. Can you explore what it means to you to feel like you're going to be judged in this way? What's the source of that fear?

Also, I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to tolerate shame. It's not about being a "good" person or a "good" nurse if you make a mistake. It's about being human and learning from your mistakes. Can we think about how it might feel to let go of that need to be perfect, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I think the fear comes from a long-ingrained competence schema — decades of evaluations, the implicit message that mistakes mean you're worthless — so the idea of being judged lights up a shame circuit. Letting go of perfection, conceptually, should feel freeing, but viscerally it feels disorienting and slightly terrifying: I imagine a looseness in my chest accompanied by a jittery vulnerability, and my brain immediately starts arguing why that’s unsafe. If I try to imagine actually doing it for a minute I can almost feel a tiny unclenching in my shoulders, but my reflex is to rationalize away the sensation. Could we try a very small experiment together — like deliberately writing one imperfect chart sentence — and see what happens? I'm already a bit anxious about that idea.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'm not going to judge you or your charting. Let's do this small experiment together. I want you to write a single sentence on one of your patient's charts. Just one sentence. It can be something as simple as "Patient is awake and alert." Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or perfection. Just write something that comes to mind.

As you write, I want you to notice how your body feels. Are there any physical sensations, like tension or relaxation? I'm not asking you to change anything, just to observe it. Take your time, and when you're ready, we'll review the sentence together.

Remember, this is not about making a mistake or being perfect. It's about taking a small step towards challenging your competence schema. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you.

Patient: Okay — I wrote: "Patient awake and alert; vitals stable." As I typed it my hands got clammy, breath shortened and my chest tightened, and my brain immediately started editorializing — "add pain score, clarify meds" — which is that perfectionism/shame circuit kicking in. Hitting save produced a tiny, almost imperceptible loosening in my shoulders, but I’m already wanting to intellectualize why that happened instead of just noticing it, and honestly I’m a bit overwhelmed; can we keep going slowly — maybe another brief sentence or a moment to look at that urge to edit?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is already trying to rationalize the loosening in your shoulders, which is a familiar pattern. Let's take a moment to look at that urge. Can you notice how it feels to want to add more information, to make it perfect? What's driving that desire? Is it a sense of responsibility, a fear of not doing enough, or something else?

Let's explore this urge together. How might it be related to your perfectionism and shame? What would it mean if you were to let go of that need to perfect this sentence, just for a moment? We don't have to do anything with it, just observe it. Take a deep breath, and notice how your body feels as you do this.

Patient: I notice the urge to add more is basically a cognitive safety behavior — a compulsion to preempt criticism by over-documenting, driven by hyper-responsibility and an internalized belief that omissions equal incompetence. Physically it’s an itch in my fingers, a tightening across my throat and a quickening pulse; imagining letting it go gives a slight loosening in my shoulders but also a prickly vulnerability that makes my mind race to justify why that’d be unsafe. If I actually left the sentence as-is I expect to feel exposed to judgment — intolerable on a visceral level even though I can rationally say nothing catastrophic would happen. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed noticing all this; can we slow down and do a brief grounding before I try another small non-perfect entry?

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's take a brief moment to ground ourselves. I want you to notice five things around you that are tangible, something that you can see, touch, or hear. It could be a pen on your desk, a book next to you, the sound of the clock ticking, or the sensation of your feet on the floor.

As you focus on these five things, I want you to let go of any thoughts about your writing, about perfection, about criticism. Just observe these five things, and let them be enough. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, feel any tension in your body release. Stay with these five things for just 30 seconds, and when you're ready, we can slowly return to your writing.

Remember, you're safe here. You're in a safe space, and we're going to take things at your pace.

Patient: I did the five things — my pen on the desk, the low hum of the monitor, the lamp’s warmth, the chair beneath me, and the distant clock — and it did help a bit; my breath is marginally deeper and the knot eased a hair. But the editorial urge is still very much present, like a motor in my fingers insisting on “clarify, specify, defend,” and frankly I’m feeling overwhelmed by that pull. I’d like to try another tiny imperfect entry, but can we do it even more slowly — maybe you prompt a single phrase and I just type it, and if the urge to fix it spikes we pause and notice it together?

Therapist: I'd like you to type just one phrase. It can be anything related to your patient's chart. Just one phrase. That's it. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or perfection. Just type one phrase.

As you type, I want you to notice any sensations in your fingers or hands. Are you feeling any urges to edit, to clarify, or to specify? It's okay if you do. Just acknowledge it, and we'll pause right here.

If the urge to fix it spikes, we'll take a moment to explore it together. But for now, just focus on typing that one phrase. You can do this. Take your time, and when you're ready, we'll review it together.

Patient: I typed: "Patient awake, vitals within expected limits."

My fingers hovered and felt heavy as I hit return; there was an immediate itch to append specifics—pain score, meds—which is that internal editor trying to take over. The urge tightened my chest a little; can we pause and name that urge before I try another phrase?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge this urge. It's a natural response, and we can explore it together. Notice how it's tightening your chest, making it hard to breathe. It's like a band is wrapping around your heart, squeezing it.

Can you name this urge? What does it feel like to want to add pain score, meds, and other specifics to the sentence? Is it a sense of responsibility, a fear of not doing enough, or something else? How does it make you feel, right now?

Take your time, and let's explore this urge together. We don't need to do anything with it yet. Just acknowledge it, and let's understand it better. When you're ready, we can continue, but only when you're comfortable with this urge.

Patient: I'd name it an "editorial compulsion" — a hyper-responsibility drive to preempt criticism by over-documenting every possible contingency. Physically it's that band across my chest, heavy fingers, and a quickening pulse; emotionally it feels like prickly exposure and a low-grade dread I can’t tolerate. I'm feeling pretty drained and overwhelmed by the urge right now, which makes me want to stall or outsource the task to protocol. I can try another phrase if you prompt me very slowly.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really drained and overwhelmed by this urge. That makes sense, given the emotional weight of it. It's okay to feel that way. It's okay to acknowledge that you're struggling with this compulsion.

Rather than pushing to continue, let's take a moment to pause and breathe. You've done a great job of getting this far, and we can take it one step at a time. If you're ready, we can try another phrase. But this time, let's do it at your pace. I'll prompt you slowly, and we'll take it one small step at a time.

Before we start again, can you tell me something about what you're hoping to achieve with this task? What are you trying to accomplish, and what's driving your desire to do so? Let's explore that together, before we move forward.

Patient: Practically, I just want the charting finished so things don't backlog, to avoid real mistakes, and to quiet that constant alarm about being judged. Deeper down, I want to feel competent and not defined by a single error, but I'm not sure I follow how typing one phrase as an experiment actually addresses those long-standing beliefs—how is that supposed to help? I'm pretty wiped and the confusion is making me want to retreat into analysis; can we slow down and you walk me through the rationale in simpler steps?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and break this down. You want to feel competent, and you're worried that a single error will define you. You're also trying to avoid the feeling of being judged.

Here's what's happening when you type a single phrase: it's not about trying to fix everything or being perfect. It's just about taking one small action. You're creating a small "experiment" to see what happens when you focus on just one thing.

Think of it like this: imagine you're trying to change a light bulb. You don't need to do everything at once, right? You just need to focus on the one task. In the same way, we're going to focus on just one phrase. We're going to take it one small step at a time.

This exercise is not about trying to change your deep-seated beliefs. It's just about creating a small opportunity to notice what's happening in the moment. Are you feeling anxious? Are you feeling judged? Are you feeling competent? We're going to explore these feelings one small step at a time.

Can you try to focus on just one thing right now? Can you just type one phrase, and then we'll take it from there?

Patient: I typed: "Patient alert and oriented; vitals stable, pain controlled."

My fingers felt leaden hitting return and the internal editor wants to append meds and scores — chest tightened and I'm a bit foggy; can you prompt the next tiny phrase very slowly so I don't spiral into editing?

Therapist: It looks like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Let's take a deep breath together. Notice how your fingers are feeling, and how your chest is tightening. It's okay to feel this way.

Before we move on to the next phrase, I want to ask you to do one thing for me. Can you take a single deep breath in, and hold it for just a second? As you exhale, can you notice how your body feels? Just notice, don't try to change anything.

When you're ready, I'll prompt you to type the next phrase. It's just one word. Can you think of one word to describe the patient's condition right now? It can be anything: "stable", "increased", "unchanged". Just one word.

Take your time. I'm here with you.

Patient: Stable.

I'm not sure I follow how that helps — my chest's still tight, my fingers feel heavy, and the internal editor's already itching to add qualifiers; can you walk me through the reason very slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and look at what's happening. You typed the word "Stable", and it's a good start. But you're feeling overwhelmed, and your body is still responding that way.

Here's what I want to talk about. When we're typing, we're not just typing words on a page. We're also interacting with our own bodies and minds. And sometimes, our bodies and minds can get in the way of our typing.

When you typed "Stable", you were trying to focus on the patient's condition. But your body was telling you that it wasn't that simple. Your chest was tight, and your fingers felt heavy. It was like your body was saying, "No, it's not that easy."

That's okay. That's normal. The exercise is not about ignoring your body or your mind. It's about noticing what's happening, and using that noticing to inform your typing.

So, let's try to do something small. Let's take just one tiny step. Can you think of a small phrase to describe the patient's condition right now? Just one word. It can be anything. It doesn't have to make sense. It just has to be one word.

Take your time. I'm here with you.

Patient: "Okay."

I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps the tightness — my chest's still knotted and my brain's already inventing qualifiers. My voice feels flat and my fingers feel heavy; can you walk me through the next step very slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to notice what's happening with your body. You mentioned that your chest is still knotted, and your fingers feel heavy. You're also feeling a bit flat, like your voice is stuck.

I want to talk to you about the phrase "Okay". It's a very simple word, but it's not just a word. It's a way of acknowledging something. In this case, you're acknowledging that you're typing, and that you're trying to focus on the patient's condition.

When you typed "Okay", you were making a small decision. You were deciding to acknowledge the present moment, rather than getting caught up in your thoughts or worries. And that decision is still affecting your body.

Notice how your chest feels. It's still knotted, but it's not as tight as it was before. Your fingers are still heavy, but they're not as heavy as they were. It's like the decision to type "Okay" has given your body a small reprieve.

Now, I want to ask you to do something small. I want you to take one more deep breath, and as you exhale, I want you to notice how your body feels again. Just notice, don't try to change anything.

Patient: I took the breath — on the exhale the knot loosened a fraction and my shoulders dropped a hair, but my chest still feels constricted and my breathing is shallow; there’s a dull ache across my throat. My mind is already doing its usual theoretical gymnastics about mechanisms and safety behaviors, which makes me foggy and a bit confused about the point of this. I'm pretty drained — can we move really slowly, maybe one more breath and then pause before trying another tiny phrase?

Therapist: Let's take one more deep breath together. As you exhale, notice how your body feels. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath leaving your body, and see if you can allow yourself to relax a little bit more.

Take your time, and when you're ready, I'll ask you to type one more phrase. But before that, let's just pause for a moment and notice how you're feeling. Are you feeling a sense of calmness, or are you still feeling a bit anxious or confused? Just notice, don't try to change anything.

Let's just sit here for a moment, and see what happens. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We'll take it one breath at a time, and see where it goes.

Patient: There's a tiny bit of loosening — shoulders dropped a fraction — but the knot in my chest's still there, my throat aches, and my breath's shallow; I'm feeling foggy and low-energy. I keep slipping into analysis about schemas and safety behaviors instead of actually sitting with the feeling, which is confusing and kind of draining. Can we go on very slowly? Prompt one very small phrase and I'll type it, and if the editor spikes we pause.

Therapist: Let's take a very small step. I want you to type just one single word. Just one word. It can be anything. Don't think too much, just type one word.

Here's a prompt: "Open".

Type the word "open" if you can. If your mind starts to wander or the editor spikes, we'll pause right here. Just one word.

Patient: open

I typed "open." My fingers felt leaden, chest tightened, and the internal editor immediately wanted to append qualifiers — intellectually it reads like a micro-exposure to ambiguity to counter perfectionism, but viscerally it just amplifies that vulnerable feeling and leaves me a bit foggy. Can you explain very slowly how this is supposed to loosen the knot, and prompt the next tiny phrase when you're ready?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on what's happening right now. You typed the word "open", and that's a good start. Now, let's talk about what's happening in your body.

When you typed "open", your fingers felt leaden, which means they're not moving quickly or easily. This is normal. It's like your fingers are stuck in place, and it's hard to move them.

The knot in your chest also tightened up, which is a sign that you're feeling a bit anxious or vulnerable. This is okay. It's normal to feel this way when you're exploring your emotions.

Now, let's talk about the internal editor. You mentioned that it wants to append qualifiers, which means it's trying to add more information or explanations to what you've already typed. This is a normal response, but it's not necessarily helpful right now.

Intellectually, you might be thinking that the word "open" is a good way to counter perfectionism, because it acknowledges the possibility of imperfection. But viscerally, it's just amplifying the vulnerable feeling you mentioned earlier.

So, let's take a step back and focus on the physical sensations in your body. Notice how your chest feels, how your shoulders are positioned, and how your breath is moving. Just notice, without trying to change anything.

When you're ready, we'll prompt the next tiny phrase. But for now, let's just sit here for a moment and focus on your physical sensations.

Patient: ...Alright. My chest is still tight, breath shallow, shoulders a fraction looser — words feel a bit heavy. Intellectually I can map this to interoceptive exposure and vagal down-regulation, but I don't really follow how that lowers the editorial compulsion in the moment; it feels abstract. I can try another tiny phrase if you prompt very slowly, one word at a time.

Therapist: Let's take it one word at a time. I want you to type just one single word. Just one word. It can be anything. Don't think too much, just type one word.

Here's a prompt: "Breathe".

Type the word "breathe" if you can.

Patient: breathe

I typed it. My chest tightened and my breath stayed shallow, fingers felt heavy, and the editor immediately wanted to add qualifiers. I'm low on energy and honestly not sure I follow how this helps—can you prompt the next word very slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on your breath right now. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or control it in any way.

I want you to type just one single word. Just one word. It can be anything. Don't think too much, just type one word.

Here's a prompt: "In".

Type the word "in" if you can.

Patient: in

My chest tightened as I typed, breath stayed shallow, fingers felt heavy and the editor immediately wanted to tack on qualifiers. I'm not sure I follow how this actually reduces the compulsion—can you prompt the next word very slowly?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment and take a deep breath together. I want you to notice how your breath feels right now, without trying to change it or control it. Just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

When you're ready, I'll prompt the next word. But for now, let's just focus on your breath and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

Type the word "air" if you can.

Patient: air

I typed "air." My chest's still constricted, breath shallow, fingers leaden. Intellectually it maps onto interoceptive exposure, but viscerally it just amplifies the vulnerability — I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck right now. That's okay. It's normal for things to feel unclear, especially when we're exploring new ways of thinking about ourselves and our emotions.

Let's take a step back for a moment. Can you tell me what's been going on for you in this moment, right now? What sensations are you feeling in your body, and what thoughts are going through your mind?

We don't need to worry about getting the "right" answers or doing things "correctly". We're just going to explore and see where this moment takes us.

Patient: Right now my body’s just… muted — a persistent knot under my ribs, throat a bit raw, breath shallow, shoulders barely looser and my fingers feel leaden. Cognitively there’s the usual cascade: the internal editor, catastrophe scripts about being judged, and a neat little taxonomy of safety behaviors I could deploy to avoid feeling vulnerable. Emotionally I’m foggy and low-energy; I keep defaulting to analysis as a defensive maneuver, and honestly I’m not sure I follow how these micro-exposures reduce the compulsion — it feels abstract and a bit bewildering. I can try another tiny step, but please prompt very slowly.

Patient: I'm... not sure I follow that block — it reads like my own loop transcribed, and it makes me feel a bit hollow and kind of muffled inside. Intellectually I can name the shame/avoidance pattern and the plea for containment, but viscerally I'm drained and want something simpler: can we pause the rapid exposures and map one very small, concrete next step (one sentence or five minutes of charting) that you stay with me through?

Patient: That block reads like my loop transcribed — watching my ruminative circuitry on replay makes me feel hollow and muffled. I'm depleted and confused; can we pause the rapid exposures and pick one tiny concrete next step (one sentence to finish a chart or five minutes of uninterrupted charting) that you stay with me through? Prompt me very slowly and keep the focus tight — I can't handle qualifiers right now and need containment, not more analysis.
