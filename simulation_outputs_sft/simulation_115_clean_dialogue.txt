Patient: Hi, I'm a senior data scientist. Lately I've been feeling intense anxiety in social settings — I keep avoiding gatherings with friends since I lost someone close, and I guess that means my support's pretty limited right now. I don't know, it's just... hard to talk about.

Therapist: It sounds really tough to talk about your feelings, especially after losing someone close. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to have conversations about this loss, even with friends? What does that feel like for you?

Patient: I don't know. When someone brings it up I go quiet—my chest feels tight and I can't find the right words, so I usually steer the conversation away or make a joke. I guess after that I feel wiped out and often leave early or say I'm tired, which is why I've been avoiding get-togethers.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using humor and quick exits as ways to cope with the discomfort of discussing your loss. I want to gently suggest something else for a moment. Instead of trying to make a joke or leave early, could you try taking a deep breath, noticing where you feel the tightness in your chest, and then say something simple like, "That's a really tough topic. Can we talk about something else for now?" Just a small experiment to see how it feels to slow down and give yourself permission to take a pause.

Patient: I don't know. I guess I've tried breathing a few times, but when that tightness hits my mind just blanks and I end up laughing or changing the subject. I could try saying that line, but I'm worried it'll sound fake or weird and I don't know if I can actually do it.

Therapist: It's understandable that you're worried about how it might sound. Instead of focusing on saying the right words, could you try to observe what's happening right now? Notice the tightness in your chest, the thoughts racing around, and the urge to laugh or change the subject. Just acknowledge these sensations as they are – "Ah, my chest is feeling tight, and I'm having trouble focusing. I'm having a hard time just sitting with this feeling right now." Can you try to hold onto that simple observation for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My chest's tight, my shoulders feel heavy, and my thoughts keep jumping to what I'll say next instead of this. I'm holding a breath... but I don't know, it's really hard—I can already feel the urge to laugh or shift the topic.

Therapist: It's okay that the urge to laugh or change the subject is strong. Can you try to acknowledge that feeling, and then do something tiny to give yourself permission to slow down? Just notice the weight of your shoulders, and then slowly, slowly, let them relax down a bit more. Imagine you're allowing them to settle, one inch at a time. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, say the phrase "I'm just going to hold this pause for one more breath." It's not about doing it perfectly; it's just about taking one more small step.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My chest's tight and my shoulders feel heavy—I'm taking a slow breath now: "I'm just going to hold this pause for one more breath." I don't know, it's already feeling weird and I can feel the urge to laugh or change the subject.

Therapist: It's okay if it feels weird or awkward. Can you try to just be with that feeling for a moment? Notice how it's showing up in your body, and try to tolerate it without judgment. Don't try to push it away or distract yourself; just observe it, like you would an interesting rock in a stream. Can you hold the pause for just one more second, and then... whatever happens next, just happens?

Patient: Okay... I'm holding it. My chest's still tight and my mind's jumping—I'm trying not to laugh. I guess after that second I don't know, maybe I'll just say I need some air or I'll make a joke like I usually do. I don't want to, but it feels safer.

Therapist: It's understandable that the old patterns are tempting. Can you try to see what just happened? You took a small step, holding the pause for just one more breath. That might seem like a tiny thing, but it's actually a small victory. Recognize that you're capable of doing just a tiny bit more than you think you are. If you're feeling stuck, you could try saying something simple like, "You know what? I'm actually going to try to stay here for just a bit longer. I'll take one more breath and see what happens." It's not about changing everything at once; it's just about taking that next small step.

Patient: I did take one more breath. I don't know — it helped for a second, then my chest tightened again and I laughed like I always do. I guess I'm just worried people will think I'm being dramatic or weird, and that makes me want to bail. Can we… I don't know, talk about what to do when your mind starts listing everything you should've said?

Therapist: It's natural to have thoughts about what could have been said or done differently. Can you try to observe those thoughts as they arise, without judgment? Notice how they're making you feel – maybe a bit anxious or uncertain. Instead of getting caught up in "what ifs," try to ask yourself what's really driving that thought. Is it a genuine concern about the conversation, or is it a fear of being perceived in a certain way? Take a moment to explore that underlying motivation. Can you try to reframe the "should've said" thoughts in a more realistic way? Instead of "I should've said that," try saying to yourself, "I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this conversation right now. I'm worried about how it's going, but I'm also trying to stay present." Can you try to focus on the present moment, and what you're doing right now in the conversation?

Patient: I don't know. My brain almost immediately starts analyzing the conversation like data—running through all the possible things I should've said—and that checklist just makes my chest tighten so I bail. I guess telling myself it's grief helps in theory, but it doesn't stop the urge to leave. Can we talk about concrete, practical steps to interrupt that checklist when it starts? I'm not sure what would actually work.

Therapist: It's understandable that the checklist is triggering, and it's great that you're looking for practical ways to manage it. Can you try a simple technique called "labeling"? When you notice the checklist starting to run through its mental checklist, try to label it as a thought, rather than getting caught up in it. Just acknowledge it with a simple phrase, like, "Ah, I'm having the thought that I should've said X, Y, or Z." Try to keep the label brief and detached. Don't get caught up in analyzing or engaging with the thought; just label it and let it go. Take a deep breath and bring your attention back to the present moment. You can say to yourself, "I'm here now. I'm taking a breath. I'm going to stay with this moment." Try this for just one moment, and see how it feels.

Patient: I don't know. I tried labeling once—saying in my head "that's a thought"—but it just felt like adding another item to the checklist and didn't stop it; my chest tightened and I laughed. I guess I need something more concrete, like a short phrase to say out loud or a tiny physical move to interrupt it—can we try practicing one now? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something a bit more concrete. Can you try making a small, deliberate movement with your hands, like touching your thumb to your index finger? Just a simple, gentle touch. Try to do this movement whenever you notice the checklist starting to run through its mental items. Say to yourself, "Touch." Just say the word "touch" and make the movement. It doesn't matter if it feels silly or not; it's just a way to interrupt the automatic thinking and bring your attention back to the present moment. Try this for just one moment, and then we can explore further if you'd like.

Patient: I tried it — I touched my thumb to my finger and said "touch" out loud. It felt...odd, but it did break the checklist for a beat and my chest eased a little before the urge to laugh came back. I don't know, can we slow down and maybe try another tiny thing I could actually use in a noisy room?

Therapist: Let's try something even simpler. Can you try pinching the bridge of your nose between your thumb and index finger? It's a subtle, gentle movement that's easy to do discreetly in a noisy room. Try to do this whenever you notice the checklist starting to run through its mental items. Just pinch your nose and say to yourself, "pause." See if this helps you interrupt the automatic thinking and take a brief pause. We can try other techniques later if this one works for you.

Patient: I tried pinching my nose and saying "pause." I don't know — it helped for a beat, but I'm worried touching my face will look weird in a crowded room and make me more self-conscious. I guess something like pressing my thumb into my palm under the table or a subtle foot tap would feel safer — can we try one of those?

Therapist: Let's try pressing your thumb into your palm. It's a subtle, gentle action that's easy to do discreetly under the table. Try to do this whenever you notice the checklist starting to run through its mental items. Just press your thumb into your palm and say to yourself, "pause." See if this helps you interrupt the automatic thinking and take a brief pause. If you find this doesn't work, we can try the foot tap instead. A gentle tap of your foot on the floor might be a more subtle way to signal to yourself to pause.

Patient: I tried pressing my thumb into my palm — it did break the checklist for a second, then my chest tightened again. I don't know, touching my face felt like it might draw attention, so the foot tap seems safer, but I'm worried that might still be obvious. Can we slow down and… can we try practicing the foot tap now, just one time, to see how it feels? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on the foot tap for just one moment. Can you try lifting your foot slightly off the ground, just a few inches, and gently tapping the ball of your foot against the floor? It's a very subtle motion, and you don't have to tap too hard. Just a gentle, gentle tap. Try it once, just once, and see how it feels. Say to yourself, "just a little tap." See how it feels to do this tiny action and say the phrase "just a little tap." We can go from here.

Patient: Okay, I tried the tap. It was really subtle and it did break the checklist for a second — my chest loosened a bit, then the tightness sneaked back and I almost laughed like I always do. I don't know, I guess it might actually work in a noisy room since no one would notice, but it still feels kind of… silly. Can we slow down? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you're acknowledging those feelings. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly nod to yourself, like you're saying, "Okay, I've got this for now." Just acknowledge the sensations and the thoughts, and then... pause. Take a moment to collect yourself, and when you're ready, we can try to build on what you've learned so far. No pressure, no expectation. Just a gentle, gradual progression. We'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay... I did the nod and the breath. I don't know, I'm feeling really overwhelmed — my chest's tight again and I keep worrying I'll laugh or make a joke to get out of it. Can we slow down and maybe talk about what to do in the moment when I start joking or want to leave?

Therapist: Let's break it down to the smallest possible moment. Imagine yourself feeling the urge to joke or leave, and then, instead of acting on it, you take one single action: you pause. Just one breath, one second, one pause. That's it. You don't have to do anything else. You just pause. And then, take one small step: you acknowledge the pause, and then you ask yourself, "What do I want to do right now?" That's it. Just those two questions. We'll work on building up to more, but for now, let's focus on that one small, manageable step. Can we try that, just for one moment?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I took one breath and paused—my chest's still tight and I almost laughed, but I didn't leave. I asked myself "what do I want to do right now" and I couldn't really answer; I guess I just wanted to not feel like a mess. I don't know, can we slow down? Maybe give me an example of something I could actually say if I decide to stay?

Therapist: Let's give you a small tool to work with. When you find yourself feeling like you want to leave or joke, and you pause, you can try saying to yourself, "I'm here." Just say the word "I'm here." It's a simple, straightforward phrase that can help you ground yourself in the present moment. It's not about doing anything else; it's just about acknowledging your presence in the situation. You can say it softly to yourself, like a gentle reminder. We'll build on this, but for now, let's focus on giving you a small, concrete thing to use. Can you try saying "I'm here" to yourself, just for one moment?

Patient: I tried saying "I'm here" under my breath — it helped for a beat, like it anchored me, then the tightness snuck back and I almost laughed. I don't know, it still feels weird to say aloud in front of people. Can we slow down and come up with a couple of short, real things I could actually say to friends when the topic comes up? I guess I need something that doesn't sound rehearsed.

Therapist: Let's focus on creating some simple, genuine phrases that you can use in the moment. When you feel the urge to joke or leave, and you pause, you can try saying something like, "I'm not sure what to say right now," or "That's a tough topic," or "I need a minute." These phrases are designed to be short, authentic, and non-judgmental. They're not meant to be rehearsed or overly thought out; just genuine, simple statements that can help you take a moment to collect yourself. We'll work on building up to more, but for now, let's focus on these few small phrases. Can you try saying one of these phrases to yourself, just for one moment?

Patient: I tried whispering "I'm not sure what to say right now" — it helped for a second, then my chest tightened and I almost made a joke. I don't know, it still feels weird and scripted, like people will notice. Can we slow down? Maybe give me a couple more phrases that sound more natural.

Therapist: Let's try a few more phrases that are a bit more conversational. When you feel the urge to joke or leave, and you pause, you can try saying something like, "It's just really hard to talk about this right now," or "I'm not really sure how to say this without sounding stupid," or "I'm still trying to process everything." These phrases are still brief, but they're a bit more conversational and might feel more natural. We'll keep working on finding the right balance between brevity and authenticity. Can you try saying one of these phrases to yourself, just for one moment?

Patient: I tried saying "I'm still trying to process everything" under my breath — it helped for a beat, then my chest tightened and I almost laughed like usual. I don't know, it still feels awkward and like people will notice I'm doing something rehearsed. Can we slow down? Maybe we could try a quick role-play where you bring it up like a friend and I practice a couple of different, more natural responses.

Therapist: Let's take a break and try a quick role-play. I'll bring up a sensitive topic, and you can practice responding in a way that feels more natural to you. Remember, the goal is not to perfect a response, but to experiment and find a few options that feel more authentic. We'll keep it brief, just a few minutes. When you're ready, we can start. Here's the setup: I'll tell you that I lost a loved one recently, and I want to talk about it. Your task is to respond in a way that feels natural, using some of the phrases we've practiced. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: I guess I can try, but I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed. I don't know if I'll be any good at this—could we keep it simple? Maybe start with you saying, "I lost someone," and I'll try one of those lines.

Therapist: Let's keep it short and sweet. I'll start with a simple statement. Here we go: "I lost someone." Just respond with one of the phrases we've practiced, like "I'm still trying to process everything" or "It's just really hard to talk about this right now." No pressure, just a simple interaction. Go ahead.

Patient: I'm still trying to process everything. I don't know, it's just... hard to talk about.

Therapist: It's okay, it's okay. I can tell it's hard. Just take a deep breath. Let's just be here for a moment. *pauses* I'm sorry. I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm just really glad you're here to listen. *pauses again* Sorry, I'm just... sorry I said that. *trails off*

(Note: This is where the role-play would naturally break down, as the conversation becomes more complex and emotionally challenging. The goal is to have you respond naturally, and the therapist will then reflect on the interaction and its implications for the therapy.)

Patient: I don't know... when you said you were glad I was here my chest tightened — I felt like I should say something helpful and I couldn't. I guess the apology made me weirdly uncomfortable, like I don't want pity. Can we slow down and try the role-play again but this time I practice just staying with silence or saying something small like "I need a minute" or "I'm here"? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's start again, slower and simpler. I'll say something again: "I lost someone." Just respond with a simple phrase, like "I'm here," "I need a minute," or just a pause. We'll go at your pace, and we'll focus on small interactions. No pressure, just getting started again. You can stop at any time if you need a break. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Okay, I guess I can try again. If you say "I lost someone," I'll try to either stay silent or say "I need a minute." I don't know if I'll manage it well, but I'm willing to give it a shot.

Therapist: Let's start again. I'll say something simple: "I lost someone." Go ahead and respond. If you need to take a moment, it's okay to say "I need a minute" or simply stay silent. There's no pressure, just take your time. Here it is: "I lost someone."

Patient: I need a minute. I don't know — it's just hard for me to stay with this without wanting to make a joke or walk away.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. It's actually really brave of you to try to sit with these feelings. You don't have to do it alone, but you also don't have to do it right now. Take another minute, if you need to. Or when you're ready, we can try to gently move forward together. Just know that I'm here to support you, not to push you to do anything you're not comfortable with. Take your time.

Patient: I don't know. I appreciate you saying that, but my chest's still tight and my mind's racing — I keep worrying I'll laugh or blurt something and then bail. I guess can we slow down and focus on one concrete thing: how to stay a bit longer at a gathering or excuse myself without feeling embarrassed?

Therapist: Let's focus on one specific situation: what if you need to excuse yourself from a gathering for a minute? What's one thing you could say to buy some time, like "I'm going to grab a drink/refill my plate/explain something to someone"? What if you say that and then take a minute to collect yourself? You could say something like, "I'm just going to step outside for a minute to get some fresh air," or "I need to talk to someone for a second." What do you think? Would that work for you to try for a minute, even if it feels awkward?

Patient: I don't know — maybe something like, "I'm just going to step outside for a minute," or "I'm going to refill my drink," could buy me time, but I guess I'd still worry people think I'm being rude or weird. I could try picking one friend to use as an excuse, but I'm feeling really overwhelmed by even planning it. Can we slow down? I need to sit with this a bit longer.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Excusing yourself can be a bit tricky, and it's normal to feel anxious about it. Let's take a deep breath together and just focus on your breath for a moment. Imagine you're taking a slow, deep inhale... and exhaling... Just let go of any tension or worries for now. We can come back to the idea of excusing yourself later. For now, can you just sit with the feeling of needing to take a break from the conversation? What's one thing you can say to your friend right now, without feeling like you need to do anything more than that? Just one simple thing.

Patient: I don't know... maybe I'd say, "I'm going to step outside for a minute—I'll be right back." That feels simple and like it gives me space without making a thing of it. I'm still nervous about people noticing, though, and can we slow down a bit?
