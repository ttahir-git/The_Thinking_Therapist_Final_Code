Patient: I'm in my early fifties, work as a manager, and since the kids left I've been avoiding get-togethers with friends even though my partner keeps saying it's okay to go. The minute I think about a party my head turns into a fortune-telling machine—it insists I'll blurt something stupid, everyone will judge me, I'll embarrass myself, and they'll stop inviting me forever—so I just cancel. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake that it's definitely going to happen and that's what's been stuck in my mind.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens the minute you start thinking about going to a party? What's the first thought that comes up, and how does it make you feel? Is it the fear of saying something "stupid," or is there another specific worry that's driving this?

Patient: The very first thought is, "I'll say something stupid," and then my head immediately spins into the worst-case: they'll laugh, someone will tell the story about me for weeks, I'll be labeled the awkward one, people will stop inviting me, and I'll end up alone and humiliated. It makes my heart race, my face go hot, and I want to bolt or cancel right away. I know it sounds over the top, but once that story starts I can't see any other outcome—it's like my brain won't shut up about the disaster.

Therapist: It sounds like the story you're telling yourself is very vivid and intense. Can you try to observe that story without judgment for a moment? Just notice the thoughts, the emotions, the images... without trying to change anything or make them go away. Then, I'd like to ask: What do you think would happen if, instead of immediately thinking "I'll say something stupid," you could pause for just a second? What would happen if you took a deep breath and said to yourself, "Okay, I'm here, I'm thinking this, but I'm not going to act on it right now"?

Patient: I try, but the second I tell myself to pause and breathe the fortune-telling machine just gets louder: "You'll start breathing weird, someone will notice, they'll ask if you're okay, they'll whisper and laugh, and the whole night will be ruined." It makes me hot, dizzy, my thoughts race, and pausing feels pointless because the story immediately morphs into an even worse disaster—I'm overwhelmed trying to do the breathing because I know humiliation is what will definitely happen.

Therapist: It sounds like the pause and breathing exercise is actually making things worse, rather than better. Can you think about what might be happening when you're experiencing this intense thinking and physical response? What do you think is the purpose of this "fortune-telling machine" that's running through your mind? Is it trying to protect you in some way, or is it something else entirely?

Patient: I think it's trying to protect me — like some alarm that screams "danger: humiliation" so I don't get hurt. But it overplays everything and ends up sabotaging me, making me cancel and feel lonelier. I get that there could be other outcomes, but honestly that feels unrealistic to me — my head insists the worst will definitely happen. I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed talking about it; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you take a moment to just acknowledge that feeling right now? Notice how it's impacting your breath, your body, and your mind. Take a deep breath with me, and let's just pause for a second. I'm not going to ask any questions or try to do anything with you right now. Just be with the feeling of overwhelm, and see what happens. When you're ready, we can come back to this conversation.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to sit with it, but my chest is tight, my breathing's shallow, and the fortune-telling machine is screaming that I'll humiliate myself and be ostracized. Doing the breathing just feels like making me more noticeable and the story gets louder, so I can't really "just be" with it — I get pulled into the disaster loop. I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck; can we slow down and do something that doesn't feel like another thing to mess up?

Therapist: Let's take a very small step away from the conversation. I want you to bring your attention to your physical body, starting at your toes. Just notice how they feel right now, without trying to change anything. Gradually work your way up through your body, noticing the sensations in your feet, calves, knees, thighs, hips, back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, and head. As you focus on each area, try to simply acknowledge the sensations without judgment or attachment. Don't try to breathe or relax; just notice. You can do this for just 30 seconds, and we can come back to talking whenever you're ready.

Patient: Okay, I tried it. My toes felt a bit numb, calves tight, knees a little achy, hips heavy, and my lower back just held all the tension; my shoulders are up by my ears, arms heavy, hands tingly, neck stiff, and my head's buzzing with my heart racing. But the second I noticed my chest the fortune-telling machine screamed that I'll start hyperventilating, someone will notice, and it’ll turn into a full-on panic scene—so I kept getting yanked into that disaster story. I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck—can we slow down or try something simpler? I really don't want this to turn into another thing I mess up.

Therapist: I think we can stop right here. Let's just pause for a moment. I want you to look around the room, not at anything in particular, but just at the space around you. Take in the sights, the sounds, the feeling of the air on your skin. Just be with this moment, without trying to do anything or think about anything in particular. That's it. We can come back to this conversation later if you'd like.

Patient: Please don't stop — when you say "we can come back later" my brain immediately spins another story about being forgotten or labeled unstable, and I get more panicked. I can't just look around because the fortune-telling machine won't let go. Can we keep going but really slow? Ask me one simple thing: what's the absolute worst thing that would happen if I said something awkward at a party? I need to tell that story.

Therapist: You're right, the worst-case scenario might be what's driving this right now. Let's try to focus on that for just a moment. What's the absolute worst thing that would happen if you said something awkward at a party? Just one thing, no more. What's the most painful, worst-case outcome you can think of?

Patient: That the absolute worst is I'll be completely ostracized—people will laugh, stop inviting me, and I'll end up alone and humiliated. My head is already spinning with that story and I need to keep talking about it.

Therapist: Can you explore this "absolute worst" scenario a bit more? What would you need to happen for you to feel completely ostracized? Is it that people would laugh, or would it be that no one would even acknowledge you? Is it that you wouldn't be invited again, or that you'd be completely ignored? Sometimes, by breaking down the scenario into smaller, more specific parts, we can start to see if there's any room to breathe, or if there's a way to approach this thought that feels slightly less overwhelming.

Patient: It always starts with one person laughing—just a little chuckle—and then someone whispers, and the next thing I know that one awkward line becomes the story everyone tells about me. After that they'll stop inviting me, people will avoid sitting near me, my partner will look embarrassed, and I'll be left out and humiliated forever — that's the whole chain my brain insists on. I know you want me to consider other possibilities but that feels totally unrealistic right now; can we keep unpacking this one piece at a time?

Therapist: Let's keep focusing on this chain of events. What is it about that first chuckle that sets off the rest of the chain? Is it the sound of it, the reaction of the other people in the room, or something else entirely? Can you explore what might happen in that exact moment, just before the whispering starts? Maybe by breaking down the sequence like this, we can start to see if there's any pause, any hesitation, or any other detail that could help shift the narrative.

Patient: It's the sound plus that tiny shift in attention — like a spotlight flipping on me. In that split second my face heats, my mouth goes dry, someone definitely leans in, a whisper starts, laughter builds, and I can feel the whole story braiding together into the disaster I know is coming. I don't see a pause there — it feels inevitable — can we keep unpacking what would happen right after that first whisper?

Therapist: Let's focus on what happens right after the whisper. You mentioned that the laughter builds, and the story starts to braiding together. Can you imagine what it might be like if, for just a moment, the whispering stopped? If the laughter didn't pick up, and the story didn't start to unfold? What would you feel in that moment? What would your body do? Sometimes, by exploring what happens just after a key moment, we can start to see if there's any possibility of something different, even if it's just for a split second. Can you try to imagine that pause?

Patient: I try to imagine the pause, but my fortune-telling machine just fills it with something worse — a hollow silence that makes the whisper echo louder and then, later, everyone suddenly remembers and laughs about it. My chest tightens, my face heats, and the pause feels like the calm before the disaster so I can't hold it. I want to believe the pause could break the chain, but I don't see it; can we go slower? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. Can you just focus on your breath right now? Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your chest. Notice how it feels to breathe out. It's okay if your mind starts to wander or if you think about the pause and the chain again. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. No thinking about the story, no thinking about the outcome. Just the breath. Let's just be with this for a moment.

Patient: I tried to follow the breath, but the minute I focus on exhaling the fortune-telling machine yells that I'll breathe weird and everyone will notice and the panic will explode. My breaths stay shallow, my chest is tight, and I feel panicked and kind of embarrassed that I can't just do the simple thing. Can we slow way down—ask me one tiny, simple thing right now, like "what does your right hand feel like?"—I don't want another thing that'll just make me feel like I'm messing up.

Therapist: I'm so sorry. Let's just focus on something extremely small. Can you tell me what your right hand feels like right now? Just notice the sensation in your hand, the weight of it, the feeling of the air on it. No thinking about the story, no thinking about the outcome. Just your right hand. What's it like?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my hand supposed to help with this? My right hand feels warm, a little tingly, fingers slightly stiff and resting on my thigh; there's a faint pressure where my palm meets my leg. But of course the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I stare at my hand people will notice I'm nervous, they'll think I'm weird, and the whole humiliating chain starts again—I'm already getting flustered, can we keep this really slow and simple?

Therapist: It's okay if you don't see how noticing your hand is supposed to help. Can you just focus on the sensation of your right hand touching your thigh? Not the tingly feeling, not the stiffness, just the sensation of your hand resting on your leg. Imagine it's just sitting there, without any thought or intention. Just this one sensation. Try to focus on it for just one more breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is staring at my hand supposed to help? I'll try anyway: my right hand feels warm, my fingertips a bit numb, a light pressure where my palm rests on my thigh, and my thumb keeps twitching a little. Of course the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if anyone notices me looking at my hand they'll think I'm a wreck, they'll whisper and laugh, and the whole humiliating chain will start—I'm already getting flustered. Can we go even slower? Ask me one tiny, simple thing I can answer without feeling like I'm messing it up.

Therapist: Can you feel the pressure where your palm rests on your thigh right now? Just notice that one spot. No thinking, no focusing, no doing anything with it. Just be with the sensation of the pressure.

Patient: Yeah — I can feel it: a steady, soft pressure where my palm meets my thigh, a little warmth and the faint twitch of my thumb. But as soon as I notice it the fortune-telling machine yells, "If anyone sees you fidgeting they'll think you're a wreck and the whispering will start," and my chest tightens. I'm not sure how this is supposed to help—can we keep it super simple? Ask me one tiny thing I can answer without spiraling, like "what color is the chair you're sitting on?"

Therapist: Is the chair you're sitting on blue?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is the color supposed to help with this? The chair's a muted blue, kind of denim-looking. Of course the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I say it's blue everyone will notice I'm weird and start whispering, and I can feel myself getting flustered—can we keep this really slow and stick to one tiny thing at a time?

Therapist: Is the chair moving?

Patient: No — it's still, steady. But I just got hit with this rush of shame and frustration, like I'm failing at the tiniest thing, and the fortune-telling machine is yelling that if I say it's still people will notice, laugh, and I'll be humiliated. Can we slow down? I'm getting really flustered.

Therapist: It's okay. I'm here. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough right now. Take a deep breath with me. Just focus on your breath for a second. In, out, in, out... When you're ready, we'll try again.

Patient: I tried the breaths like you said — I inhaled and exhaled — but the fortune-telling machine just got louder, yelling that if I breathe weird people will stare and the whole humiliation chain will start. I'm confused about how this is supposed to help and I feel ashamed and frustrated that I can't even do the simplest thing without panicking. Can we keep it really, really small — ask me one tiny, simple thing I can answer without spiraling?

Therapist: Is your tongue in your mouth?

Patient: Yes—it's in my mouth. But I don't really get how that helps; I feel stupid and ashamed, like I'm failing at something obvious, and the fortune-telling machine is already screaming that if I show this embarrassment people will laugh and the whole humiliating chain will start. Can we slow down? I'm getting flustered.

Therapist: I think we need to stop for now. You're not ready to ask the next question, and that's okay. It's not about you being stupid or failing, it's about you being exactly where you need to be right now. We're going to pause. Can you just sit with that for a moment? No questions, no thinking, just being.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "sitting" supposed to help? I can't just pause; the idea of stopping immediately kicks up this old shame and I feel like I'm failing at the tiniest thing, which makes the fortune-telling machine scream that I'll be forgotten or dismissed. Please don't stop — that thought about being paused already has me spiraling. Can we keep going but painfully slow? Ask me one tiny, specific question I can answer without it turning into a disaster story.

Therapist: What is the color of the socks you are currently wearing on your left foot?

Patient: They're light gray — plain, a little worn at the heel. I'm not sure I follow why that helps; I already feel stupid for being asked something so small, and that shame makes the fortune-telling machine shout that if anyone notices my socks they'll whisper and laugh and the whole humiliating chain will start. Can we go even slower? Ask me one tiny thing I can answer without spiraling.

Therapist: Is the left sock's fabric slightly thicker than the right sock's fabric at the point where it meets the bottom of the foot?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? But yes, the left sock does feel a bit thicker at the bottom than the right. Saying that makes me feel embarrassed and a flash of shame hits me like I failed at something obvious, and my fortune-telling machine is already yelling that if anyone notices they'll whisper and laugh and everything will spiral into humiliation.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. It's okay to feel embarrassed. But I want you to know that feeling embarrassed right now doesn't mean you're failing. It doesn't mean you're not good enough. It just means that you're feeling a certain way right now. And that's okay. It's okay to take a deep breath and try to see if we can't find a way to be a little more gentle with ourselves. Can you try to do that for me? Can you just take a deep breath and try to be a little kinder to yourself?

Patient: I tried to breath like you said, but the moment I inhaled the fortune-telling machine just yelled louder — I felt hot, ashamed, like I'm failing at something obvious. I want to be kinder to myself, but it feels fake and that makes me more frustrated. Can we go painfully slow? Ask me one tiny, concrete thing I can answer without spiraling — like "what color is your mug?"

Therapist: Can you tell me what you're drinking right now?

Patient: It's chamomile tea — warm, slightly sweet, mug resting in both hands. Of course the fortune-telling machine immediately starts shrieking that if I look nervous sipping tea people will think I'm fragile, they'll whisper about me, and it'll turn into another humiliating story — so I already feel hot and ashamed. Can we keep this really slow? Ask me one tiny, simple thing I can answer without spiraling.

Therapist: Is the tea touching the rim of the mug?

Patient: Yes — it comes right up to the rim. Of course the fortune-telling machine is already yelling that if I take a sip and a drop spills on my sleeve everyone will notice, laugh, whisper, and I'll be humiliated and cut off forever. I'm getting flustered — can we slow waaaay down and do one tiny, simple question at a time?

Therapist: Is the tea moving in the mug?

Patient: Yes — there's a tiny ripple when I shifted the mug, mostly still otherwise. Of course my fortune-telling machine is already yelling that if it splashes a drop on my sleeve someone will gasp, people will laugh, and I'll be humiliated — my face's heating up just thinking about it. Can we keep this painfully slow and stick to one tiny question at a time?
