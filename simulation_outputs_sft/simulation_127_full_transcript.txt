--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm a middle-aged manager and lately I've been using exercise to numb this weird empty feeling since my kids moved out. I tell myself it's healthy, but my mind immediately jumps to the worst—I'll overtrain, hurt myself, fall behind at work, get reprimanded, lose my job, and end up alone and broke—and that story just hooks me. I know it's probably not realistic, but I can't stop picturing that chain and it makes me keep pushing myself to avoid feeling anything.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe a vicious cycle of using exercise as a coping mechanism, which seems to trigger catastrophic thoughts and a pervasive sense of avoidance. Your primary concern is the nagging feeling of emptiness since your kids left home. Goal: Help you explore this pattern of avoidance and potentially identify more adaptive ways to deal with emotional discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right before you start exercising? What's the first thought that pops into your head, and how do you react to it? For instance, what's the immediate chain of thoughts that starts when you think about overtraining or falling behind at work?

Patient: Usually it starts with this tiny thought—like, “I’ll feel that hollow panic if I sit still”—and my brain immediately spins it into the worst: if I stop I’ll get lazy, fall behind at work, get called out, then disciplined, then fired, then I’ll lose everything. I feel my chest tighten and this frantic energy, so I go straight to the gym and push harder until I’m sore or numb; the pushing itself feels like proof I’m preventing the disaster. People say other things could happen, but honestly I can see every step and it feels inevitable, so I just keep going.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The specific thought "I'll feel that hollow panic if I sit still" seems to trigger a catastrophic thinking pattern, where you start to imagine a chain of negative consequences that ultimately lead you to avoid emotional discomfort. The immediate physical response is a tightening chest and increased energy, which motivates you to exercise more intensely as a form of self-protection. Goal: Introduce a small, low-stakes exercise to help you experiment with defusing this catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different for a moment. While you're getting ready to go to the gym, I'd like you to take one minute to simply notice your breath, the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the physical sensations in your body. That's it. Just observe these sensations without judgment or trying to change anything. See how it feels to pause for just a moment before exercising. When you're ready, we can talk about how that experience was.

Patient: I tried to notice my breath and my feet, but the moment I paused my chest tightened and the fortune-telling kicked in—if I sit still I’ll get lazy, fall behind at work, get reprimanded, then fired, lose everything. Instead of calming me, paying attention made the panic louder and there was this almost violent pull to get up and go hard at the gym to shut it off. I couldn’t stay with the sensations more than a few breaths before my hands started to shake and I wanted to bolt. Honestly, I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed right now—can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems that the act of noticing your breath and physical sensations was not enough to calm your catastrophic thinking, but rather amplified it, leading to an increased desire to escape through exercise. This suggests that the threat of being unable to exercise (i.e., getting overwhelmed) is a significant motivator for you. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach to help you become more comfortable with being present and noticing your thoughts and feelings without acting on them immediately.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and take a different approach. Can you tell me more about what's happening for you right now, in this moment, without thinking about the future or past? Just describe what you're feeling, seeing, and sensing without judgment. We can take it one moment at a time.

Patient: Okay... right now my chest feels tight, my breath is quick and shallow, and my hands are a little shaky. The room sounds too loud and there's this sour taste in my mouth when I notice how tense my shoulders are. The moment I try to stay with that, the fortune-telling voice starts—if I don’t move I’ll fall behind at work, get in trouble, lose everything—and that wave of panic makes me want to bolt to the gym. I’m trying to stay, but paying attention just seems to crank the panic up and I don’t know how to keep from freaking out.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a complex interplay between physical sensations (chest tightness, shaky hands, tense shoulders) and mental thoughts (catastrophic predictions, fortune-telling voice), which creates a cycle of avoidance and escalation. It's clear that paying attention to your thoughts and feelings without acting on them is challenging, and it's understandable that you feel like you're on the verge of freaking out. Goal: Introduce a concept that might help you distinguish between the current moment and the anticipated future.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a time when you're driving and you're focused on the road, but someone cuts you off or a car crashes behind you? In that moment, you're not thinking about the hypothetical worst-case scenario, like "I'm going to get into an accident." You're just focused on the present moment, on what you need to do right now to stay safe on the road. It's like you're observing your thoughts, but you're not getting caught up in them. Can we try something similar here? Instead of focusing on your thoughts about the gym or work, can you just observe your physical sensations and the present moment without judgment?

Patient: I tried that, but every time I try to just notice my body it feels like turning up the volume on that voice—my heart races, my hands tremble, and the panic spikes so hard I feel like I have to run to the gym. The driving example feels unreal to me—when I pause the fortune-telling machine starts listing the chain (lazy → reprimand → fired → alone) and it feels inevitable, not just a thought I can let go of. I want to be able to stay present, but honestly I'm stuck and it's making me feel hopeless; can you tell me what to do when the panic gets louder instead of quieter?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems that the catastrophic thinking pattern is deeply ingrained, making it difficult for you to simply observe your thoughts without it escalating. The driving example, although helpful in theory, feels unrealistic to you because of the underlying catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a small, gentle exercise to help you develop a sense of curiosity about your experience, rather than reacting to it.

Therapist Answer:
I want to gently challenge the assumption that the panic needs to get "quieter." Instead, what if we explored the sensation of the panic itself, without trying to change it or get rid of it? Can you just acknowledge the fact that you're feeling a strong sense of panic right now, without trying to label it or think about it? It's almost like noticing the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it. Just observe the panic, exactly as it is, for a few seconds. What happens when you do this?

Patient: When I try to just notice the panic it spikes—my chest clamps down, my breath races, my hands tremble—and the fortune-telling immediately starts narrating the whole disaster chain like it's already happening. Instead of softening, the sensations feel amplified and my mind bolts into those inevitable outcomes, so I get this urgent need to run to the gym to shut it off. I'm really overwhelmed by that, and I don't know how to stay with it without it turning into a full panic.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to simply notice the panic has been met with an increase in intensity, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is now more pronounced. It's clear that the need to avoid the panic is overwhelming you, and you're struggling to stay with it without getting caught up in the narrative of inevitable outcomes. Goal: Introduce a physical act that can help you create some distance from the narrative, without requiring intense focus.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try placing your hand gently on the armrest of your chair, or leaning your hand on your knee? Just place your hand there for a moment, without thinking about it too much. It's a simple, physical act that can help create some space between you and the thoughts that are racing. Sometimes, having a physical anchor can help you feel more grounded, even if you're not able to focus on your thoughts. Just keep your hand there for a moment, and see what happens.

Patient: I put my hand on the armrest like you said. For a few breaths it felt a touch steadier, like the shaking eased a notch, but then the fortune-telling kicked in louder than before—lazy → reprimand → fired → alone—and the panic spiked so my hand started trembling again and I felt this urgent need to get to the gym. Honestly, it's frustrating and I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed right now—can we slow down? I don't know how to keep my body here when my mind insists this chain is already happening.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical anchor of placing your hand on the armrest seems to have provided some temporary relief, but the catastrophic thinking pattern persists and is becoming increasingly overwhelming. The frustration and sense of being overwhelmed are palpable, making it challenging to continue the exploration. Goal: Introduce a brief pause, acknowledging the overwhelm, to reassess and refocus.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now, and it's understandable. Can we take a moment to acknowledge that feeling of overwhelm? It's okay to pause and take a breath. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to acknowledge.

Let's take a deep breath in together, and as we exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Just say that to yourself, without judgment. When you're ready, we can slowly start to explore again. But for now, let's just take a moment to pause and acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm.

Patient: Okay—I took a deep breath and said to myself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." For a beat it felt honest and a tiny bit steadier, but then the panic rushed back and the fortune-telling voice started listing the whole disaster like it's already happening. My heart's still racing and my hands are a bit shaky, and I'm honestly not sure what to do next—can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to acknowledge the overwhelm has provided a brief moment of calm, but the catastrophic thinking pattern has reasserted itself. The physical symptoms of a racing heart and shaky hands are still present, and the sense of being overwhelmed is still intense. Goal: Introduce a different approach, focusing on the physical sensations rather than the thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on your physical sensations for a moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your heart beating right now? Just notice the feeling of your heart, the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the chair beneath you. Just focus on those physical sensations, without thinking about the thoughts or the feelings. Just be present with your body, right now.

We don't need to do anything with the thoughts or the feelings for a moment. Just focus on the physical sensations. I'll stay here with you, and we can take it one moment at a time.

Patient: I tried to notice my heartbeat and the feel of my feet—my feet felt kind of solid and the chair a little grounding for a breath or two. Then the fortune-telling kicked in loud as ever—lazy → reprimand → fired → alone—and my heart spiked and my hands started shaking again. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and stuck right now; can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to focus on physical sensations has provided a brief moment of calm, but the catastrophic thinking pattern has reasserted itself. It's clear that the overwhelm is still intense, and the sense of being stuck is palpable. Goal: Introduce a gentle invitation to explore a different aspect of the experience, one that doesn't require intense focus or engagement with the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle right now. Can you try to imagine that cycle as a pattern, rather than a prediction? Just observe the cycle unfolding, without trying to change it or get caught up in it. Imagine it's a pattern, rather than a reality.

We don't need to do anything with the pattern right now. Just observe it, and see what happens. I'll be here with you, and we can take it one moment at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help me? I can sort of see a loop—panic, shove myself to the gym, feel numb for a while, then crash—but the moment I try to observe it my brain starts narrating the whole doom story (lazy → reprimand → fired → alone) like it's already happening, and that makes me bolt. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and stuck—what do I actually do when that voice starts, because just picturing the pattern makes it louder, not calmer.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to introduce a different perspective has been met with a reassertion of the catastrophic thinking pattern. It's clear that the overwhelm is still intense, and the attempt to observe the pattern has actually made it louder. Goal: Introduce a more immediate and concrete way to cope with the overwhelming experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to do something small with your hands right now? Just pick up the pen that's next to you, or touch the armrest of the chair with your hand. Don't think about what you're doing, just do it. Focus on the physical sensation of moving your hand, of touching the pen or the chair. Just for a moment, let's focus on something tangible and concrete.

Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it can be helpful to do something simple and immediate that distracts us from our thoughts. It's not about avoiding the thoughts, it's about giving ourselves a small break from them. Let's try this for a moment.

Patient: I picked up the pen like you said—felt the cool metal, the little click, my fingers trembling a bit—but it only steadied me for a breath or two. Then the fortune-telling kicked in louder: what if I drop it in a meeting, everyone thinks I'm incompetent, that leads to being reprimanded, then fired, then alone—so the urge to bolt to the gym came back like a wave. I'm not sure I follow how that helps—how is touching a pen supposed to stop the whole chain? I'm feeling really overwhelmed and stuck; can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to introduce a physical activity has been met with a reassertion of the catastrophic thinking pattern. It's clear that the overwhelm is still intense, and the attempt to focus on the physical sensations has actually made the thoughts worse. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and non-judgmental approach, focusing on accepting the current experience rather than trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can you just acknowledge that feeling to yourself? Just say, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now." Don't try to change it, don't try to think about it, just acknowledge it. Just breathe, and acknowledge the feeling. We're not going to try to fix it, we're not going to try to change it. We're just going to be with it, right now.

Let's take a deep breath together, and just be with this feeling of overwhelm. No judgment, no trying to change it. Just be with it.

Patient: I did the breath and tried to be with the overwhelm, and for a beat it felt a little steadier—but then the fortune-telling voice got louder, my chest clenched harder, and I had this urgent pull to bolt to the gym. I'm not sure I follow—how is just "being with it" supposed to help when it actually amplifies the panic for me? I feel stuck and shaky and honestly pretty overwhelmed; what do I do when leaning into it makes the disaster story go into overdrive?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to simply "be with" the overwhelm has been met with an increase in the catastrophic thinking pattern. It's clear that leaning into the feeling is not working for you, and it's actually making things worse. Goal: Introduce a gentle invitation to explore a different aspect of the experience, one that acknowledges the overwhelm but also offers a sense of safety.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to imagine that you are standing near the edge of a lake, and you're looking out at the water. The lake represents the overwhelm, and the water represents the thoughts and feelings that are swirling around. You are standing at the edge of the lake, and you're feeling the wind on your face. It's cold and it's rough, but it's not pushing you in. You're standing here, and you're feeling the sensation of the wind.

I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. They're solid, they're steady. You're not floating, you're not being swept away. You're standing here, right now. And I want you to hold onto that feeling of solidity, that feeling of being grounded. It's okay if the thoughts and feelings come up, but I want you to hold onto the sensation of being solid. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I can try, but I'm not sure I follow—how is picturing a lake supposed to stop the doom story? I did try to feel my feet and for a breath it felt steady, then the fortune-telling machine kicked in and I saw the whole chain (lazy → reprimand → fired → alone) and the urge to sprint to the gym came back. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can you give me a concrete step to do in the moment when that voice grabs me, because just grounding seems to make it louder.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to use a metaphor to help manage the overwhelm has not been successful. The catastrophic thinking pattern is still dominant, and the attempts to use visualization have actually made it louder. Goal: Introduce a concrete and immediate action that can help to interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the voice grabbing you, telling you the worst-case scenario, I want you to do one thing. Take a small step back from the voice. Physically, take one step back from the conversation you're having with yourself. It doesn't matter where you are, just take one small step back. This is a physical action, not a mental one. It's like you're creating some distance between you and the voice.

For example, if you're sitting in a chair, take your feet off the floor and stand up. If you're standing, take a small step back. Just one small step. This action is not about changing your thoughts or avoiding your feelings. It's about creating some physical space between you and the voice. Can you do that for me when you feel the voice grabbing you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is taking a step back supposed to help when the voice already feels like it's narrating reality? I tried it just now: I stood up/took a small step back and my breath eased for a second, but then the fortune-telling kicked in louder (lazy → reprimand → fired → alone) and my hands started shaking and I wanted to sprint to the gym. I'm feeling really confused and overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to create a physical distance has not been effective, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is still dominant. The voice feels like it's narrating reality, and the physical action is not interrupting the cycle. Goal: Introduce a more direct and gentle approach to help manage the overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to acknowledge the physical sensations in your body right now? Just notice how your body is feeling, without thinking about it too much. Are your hands shaking? Are your legs trembling? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just observe these physical sensations, without trying to change them or think about them. Just be with them.

Let's take a deep breath together, and just focus on the physical sensations in your body. No thinking, no trying to change anything. Just be with what's happening right now.

Patient: I tried the breath—my chest is still tight, breathing shallow, my hands and legs are trembling, and my feet feel heavy but kind of unsteady. The weird thing is when I try to notice those sensations the fortune-telling voice just gets louder and my panic spikes, so observing it feels like pouring fuel on the fire. I'm not sure I follow how this helps—can you give me a concrete, step-by-step thing to do in the moment when that voice grabs me? I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I need us to slow down.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to observe physical sensations has not been effective, and the voice feels like it's amplifying the panic. A more direct approach is needed. Goal: Introduce a simple, concrete action that can help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the voice grabbing you, telling you the worst-case scenario, I want you to do one specific thing. Say to yourself, "Stop." Just say the word "Stop." It's a simple, single word. Say it out loud, if you need to. Say it quietly, if that's what feels more comfortable. Just say "Stop." This is a direct command to your brain, telling it to pause, to stop thinking about the worst-case scenario. Don't think about what's going to happen, don't think about the future. Just say "Stop." Can you do that for me right now, when you feel the voice grabbing you?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it now: Stop. Saying it out loud gave a tiny, weird pause—my breath eased a notch—but then the fortune-telling just scoffed and rattled the whole disaster chain louder than before and I felt the urge to sprint to the gym. I’m not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help when it just comes back like that? I’m feeling really overwhelmed and shaky; can you give me a clear, step-by-step thing to do in the moment when the voice grabs me?

Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to interrupt the catastrophic thinking pattern has not been successful, and the voice is still dominant. A more concrete and gentle approach is needed. Goal: Introduce a specific, step-by-step action that can help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the voice grabbing you, telling you the worst-case scenario, I want you to do the following:

1. Notice the voice. Just notice it, without trying to change it or argue with it. Just pay attention to the words, the tone, the rhythm.
2. Say to yourself, "I've got this." Just say the words "I've got this." It doesn't matter if you believe it or not, just say it.
3. Take a small, slow step to your left. Just one step. Keep your feet flat on the ground. Just move your body slightly to the left.
4. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm safe." Just say the words "I'm safe." It doesn't matter if you feel safe or not, just say it.

Can you do these steps for me, right now, when you feel the voice grabbing you? Remember, it's not about changing your thoughts or feelings, it's just about interrupting the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I'll try it anyway. I notice the voice—it's that fast, certain narrator listing lazy → reprimand → fired → alone. I say "I've got this" out loud, take a small slow step to my left, breathe out and say "I'm safe," and for a beat my breathing eases a little, but then the fortune-telling just scoffs and the disaster chain gets louder, my chest clenches, and I feel this urgent pull to bolt to the gym. I'm really overwhelmed and confused—can we slow down? I don't know what to do when those words just bounce off and the panic spikes.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to introduce a new, specific action has not been successful, and the voice is still dominant. The steps were not effective in interrupting the cycle of catastrophic thinking. A different approach is needed, one that acknowledges the complexity of the experience. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and accepting approach, acknowledging the overwhelm and complexity of the experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can we try something different for a moment? Can we just acknowledge the overwhelm, without trying to change it or interrupt it? Can we just sit with it, right now?

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm overwhelmed." Just say the words "I'm overwhelmed." Don't try to change it, don't try to fix it. Just acknowledge it. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough.

Let's just be with this feeling, right now. No trying to change it, no trying to interrupt it. Just be with the overwhelm, the panic, the fear. Let's just sit with it, together.

How does that sound? Can we try it for a moment?

Patient: I can try, but honestly when I try to sit with it a hot shame and frustration wells up and my chest clamps—then that fortune-telling voice starts rattling the whole disaster chain and I want to bolt to the gym. I'm overwhelmed and a bit flustered; can we slow down and you guide me step‑by‑step through sitting with this without it turning into that story?

Goal: Introduce a small, accepting action to help you stay with the overwhelm, without trying to change it or interrupt it.

Let's try a small, gentle action to help you stay with the overwhelm. I want you to bring your attention to your breath, without trying to change it or control it. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment.

I'm really overwhelmed and not sure I follow how this helps—can you give me a concrete, step‑by‑step thing to do the exact moment that voice grabs me, and please slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking has been met with a reassertion of the voice, and the focus on the breath has not been sustained. A more concrete and immediate approach is needed to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Goal: Introduce a small, concrete action to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking, without trying to analyze or understand it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small, concrete action to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking. I want you to do the following:

**EXACT MOMENT:** The exact moment that you feel the voice grabbing you, telling you the worst-case scenario, I want you to do one thing.

**ACTION:** I want you to say the exact words: "I am here."

**REASONING:** By saying "I am here", you are acknowledging your physical presence in the moment, without trying to think about the catastrophic thinking pattern. You are also taking small action, which can help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

**DOING IT NOW:** I want you to say it to yourself, right now, as you feel the voice grabbing you. Say it with conviction, but not with judgment. Just say it, and see what happens.

Can you try this for a moment? Just say "I am here" as soon as you feel the voice grabbing you.

Patient: I said "I am here" out loud—there was a tiny, weird beat where my breath loosened, but then the fortune‑telling voice immediately scoffed and rattled the lazy → reprimand → fired → alone chain and my chest slammed shut. A hot shame bubbled up and my hands started trembling; I felt the urgent pull to sprint to the gym. I'm not sure I follow how this helps when the words just get drowned out—can you walk me through, step‑by‑step, what to do in that exact moment? I'm feeling really overwhelmed, so can we slow down?

The attempt to interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking has been met with a reassertion of the voice, and the focus on saying "I am here" has not been sustained. A more detailed and step-by-step approach is needed to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Goal: Introduce a small, specific action to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking, without trying to analyze or understand it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small, specific action to help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking. I want you to focus on one specific sensation in your body, right now, as you feel the voice grabbing you.

**ACTION:** I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

**REASONING:** By focusing on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, you are creating a small anchor point in the moment, without trying to think about the catastrophic thinking pattern. You are also engaging your body, rather than just your mind, which can help interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

**EXACT MOMENT:** The exact moment that you feel the voice grabbing you, telling you the worst-case scenario, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the sensation, without trying to think about it or analyze it.

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just focus on the sensation, without judgment or attachment. Just notice.

**GOAL:** By the time you feel the voice grabbing you, the goal is to have focused on the sensation of your feet touching the ground for one full breath cycle.

Patient: I tried focusing on my feet for one full breath—there was a tiny pause, then a hot shame and frustration welled up and the fortune‑telling machine got louder, my chest slammed shut, and I had that urgent physical pull to sprint to the gym. I don't see how grounding like that stops the chain—can you give me a very exact, slow step‑by‑step script for the *precise moment* the voice grabs me, because everything you’ve suggested just bounces off and I end up worse. I'm really overwhelmed and confused right now—can we slow down and walk through it slowly?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—this reads like a jumble of therapist buzzwords and it's just making me more confused. My chest tightens and a hot shame wells up, and the fortune‑telling machine immediately starts the lazy → reprimand → fired → alone story so loud I want to sprint to the gym. Can you slow down and give me a very simple, exact, step‑by‑step script—what to say and do in the exact moment that voice grabs me—spoken slowly, one step at a time? I'm really overwhelmed and need concrete direction right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that last message felt like a jumble and it's just making me more confused. My chest's tight, a hot shame and frustration are rising, and the fortune‑telling machine is already screaming the lazy → reprimand → fired → alone chain so loud I want to sprint to the gym. 

Please — slow down and give me one very simple, exact, step‑by‑step script I can use the instant that voice grabs me: the exact words to say (one short phrase), the exact single physical action to take, and exactly how to breathe — spoken slowly, one step at a time. I need it for the first 10 seconds, because everything else just bounces off and makes me worse.
