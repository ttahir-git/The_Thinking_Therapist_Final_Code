--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I can't stop worrying about how I'll perform as an artist—shows, commissions, and just keeping steady work—and it's making me put things off a lot. I lost a steady gig not long ago and that instability's been hanging over me. I don't know, I guess I'm just... overwhelmed.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your artistic career, which is impacting your productivity. The core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the impact of this anxiety on your creative process and identify any specific avoidance behaviors.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to worry about your performance as an artist? For example, what's the first thing that usually stops you from working, and how do you typically spend your time instead?

Patient: Usually it hits as a kind of freeze — I can’t decide which piece to work on, so I just... don’t pick any. I end up doing small, pointless things instead — scrolling, making another cup of tea, tidying the studio — anything to avoid the actual work. Then I feel guilty and that just makes the worry louder. I don't know, I guess it's like everything feels higher-stakes so doing nothing feels safer.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your anxiety leads to paralysis when deciding on a project, causing you to engage in avoidance behaviors like tidying or scrolling. The guilt that follows amplifies the worry, and the perceived safety of inaction becomes a compelling escape. Goal: Introduce a concrete opportunity to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something small, but concrete: I'd like you to set a timer for 10 minutes and commit to working on whatever piece you've been wanting to start. Not worrying about it being perfect, just making progress. That feeling of "higher-stakes" can stay in the background for now, and we can revisit it later. Can you agree to do that?

Patient: Okay, I can try. I don't know, I guess I'll set a 10-minute timer and just do a rough sketch/underpainting for that commission I keep avoiding — no pressure to make it perfect. I'm already feeling jumpy about whether it'll be any good, so... if I start drifting, can you help me stick to it?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to start working on the commission, and I can offer support to help you stay focused. However, there's still a risk of drifting into critical thinking about the piece's quality. Goal: Introduce a defusion technique to manage the urge to judge the sketch.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to support you, but let's try to separate your self-judgment from the actual sketching process. As you work, I want you to notice when your mind starts to criticize or judge the sketch. When that happens, I'd like you to say to yourself, "Sketch, not critic." Simply acknowledge the thought and gently let it go. We'll focus on making progress, not creating a masterpiece. Ready to start?

Patient: Okay, I'll start the timer now. I don't know, I guess I'll focus on rough shapes for ten minutes and when the critic pops up I'll tell myself "Sketch, not critic." I'm already nervous, so if I drift a little can you remind me to come back to the page?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to start the 10-minute timer, and I'll remind you to stay focused when your mind drifts. However, it's still possible that you'll notice the critic's voice. Goal: Practice the defusion technique to maintain a flexible mindset.

Therapist Answer:
You're started, and remember to focus on those rough shapes for now. Whenever you feel the critic's voice, just say "Sketch, not critic" to yourself. If your mind starts to wander, I'll gently bring it back to the page. Just keep sketching, and we'll take it one moment at a time. How's the feeling of starting?

Patient: I started — the basic shapes are down, but my hand keeps hesitating and I keep erasing. I told myself "Sketch, not critic" a few times and it helped a little, but I'm already wanting to check my phone or tidy something. I don't know, I guess I'm nervous it won't be any good, so could you keep nudging me back if I drift?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've started sketching, but your hand is hesitant, and you're erasing. The defusion technique helped a bit, but the critic's voice is still present. The urge to check your phone or tidy is a common distraction. Goal: Continue to gently bring your focus back to the sketching process.

Therapist Answer:
I'll keep nudging you back to the page. Let's take a deep breath together. Remember why you started? You wanted to make progress on that commission, no matter how rough it might be. Let's focus on the physical act of drawing, not the outcome. If your hand hesitates, just notice it, and then start drawing again. If you start to think about checking your phone, just say to yourself, "Page, not phone." I'm here with you. Keep sketching.

Patient: Okay, the breathing helped a bit — I kept sketching for a few more minutes, but my hand still hesitates and I keep erasing. I don't know, I guess I'm scared it'll look awful and everyone will see I'm not good enough. Could you keep nudging me to stop erasing and just let the marks be? I'm already feeling jittery about it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made some progress, but the critic's voice is still present, and the fear of not being good enough is still there. Your hand is hesitant, and erasing is a way to avoid the perceived imperfections. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to bring awareness to the physical act of drawing and reduce the judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the physical sensation of holding the pen or pencil. Feel the weight of it in your hand, the pressure of your grip, the movement of your fingers. As you draw, notice how your arm and hand are moving. Don't worry about the marks themselves, just the movement. Imagine you're holding a small, delicate flower in your hand, and every time you draw a line, it's a gentle petal unfurling. Just let the petal be, don't try to control it. Let the eraser be a way to gently remove a petal, if you need to. Keep drawing, and let's stay with the sensation of the pen moving across the paper.

Patient: Okay, I tried the flower image — it actually helped a bit and I noticed I erased less for a few minutes. Then my brain jumped to bills and whether anyone will buy it, and I started erasing again. I don't know, I guess I'm getting a little overwhelmed — can we slow down? Please keep nudging me back to the page when I drift.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've started to make progress with the flower image, but the critic's voice is still present, and the focus on external validation is creeping back in. The overwhelm is a natural response to feeling uncertain about the outcome. Goal: Introduce a radical acceptance of the current moment and the process.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back. I want you to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to be uncertain. It's okay to be stuck. Just for this moment, let's accept that feeling. Don't try to push it away or change it. Just acknowledge it, and then let's focus on what we can control right now: the physical act of drawing. Look at the paper, look at the pen, look at your hand moving across the surface. Just observe. Don't think about the bills, don't think about whether anyone will buy it. Just be with this moment, with this drawing, with this breath. I'm here with you, and I'll support you. Let's take it one mark at a time.

Patient: Okay, I tried staying with the marks and it helped for a minute, but then my brain jumped to bills and whether anyone will buy it and I started erasing again. I don't know, I guess I'm scared it's all slipping away and talking about that feels... really uncomfortable. Can you keep nudging me back to the page and maybe help me set one small habit I can actually stick to after this — like another short timer or a tiny reward?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to stay present with the marks, and the fear of losing progress is creeping in. The discomfort of talking about the bills and uncertainty is real, but it's not serving you in the moment. Goal: Help you build a small habit that can anchor you in the present.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge the discomfort. It's okay to feel it, but let's not let it control us. Remember when you started this exercise, you said you'd focus on making progress for 10 minutes? That's still true. You can still do that. Let's make it even smaller, just 2 minutes. Commit to drawing just one more line, just one more mark. Don't worry about the outcome, just focus on the next line. As soon as you're done, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I did that." That's it. You can do that. And to make it more manageable, I want you to set a tiny reward for yourself. Whenever you complete this 2-minute exercise, you get to do one thing you enjoy for just 30 seconds. Maybe it's taking a sip of water, maybe it's stretching, maybe it's looking out the window. Whatever it is, it's something small that you can look forward to. Can you do that? Can you commit to just one more line, just 2 minutes from now?

Patient: Okay — I can try the two minutes. My hands feel jittery and I'm already kind of scattered, but I guess I can make one more line. Can you count me down or nudge me if I start drifting? If I do it, my tiny reward will be a 30‑second sip of tea by the window.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to try again. Goal: Help you stay focused and present.

Therapist Answer:
I'll count down for you: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. You've got this. Just focus on drawing one line. I'll be here with you. Don't worry about your hands, just let them move. Don't think about anything else, just the line. As soon as you're done, take that sip of tea by the window. You've earned it.

(timer starts counting down)

Please, just focus on drawing one line. You can do it.

Patient: Okay — I did it, I made one line, but my hand was shaking and it looks messy and now my chest feels tight. I don't know, I guess I'm... really jittery and my mind's already jumping to worst-case stuff, so I can't relax enough to take the sip. Can you remind me to slow my breath with me for a few counts before I go to the window? And can we set another tiny two‑minute thing after that, because I feel like if we stop now I'll start fidgeting and checking my phone or tidying instead.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress, but the nervousness and self-doubt are creeping back in. It's okay to feel jittery, but let's not let it consume you. Goal: Help you relax and build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
First, let's take a few deep breaths together. I want you to slow down your breathing with me. Inhale for a count of 4... hold for a count of 4... exhale for a count of 4... hold again for a count of 4. Just focus on your breath, feel it move in and out of your body. Don't think about anything else, not even the tea by the window.

(slowly guides breathing exercises for 4-4-4-4 counts)

Now, take your time getting up and getting that sip of tea. I'm not asking you to rush. You can do it at your own pace. And when you're done, we'll set another tiny goal, just like before. Maybe you can write a single sentence, just one sentence, about what you're feeling right now. Or maybe you can draw just one more line, just one more. Whatever it is, it's a small commitment, but it can help you build confidence and momentum.

When you're ready, take your time, and let's move forward.

Patient: Okay — I did the breathing and I managed a slow sip of tea, but my hands are still trembling and my chest feels tight. I can't seem to settle; my mind keeps jumping to worst-case stuff, so I don't know, I guess I'll try that next tiny thing — writing one sentence about what I'm feeling right now. Can you count me down and nudge me if I start fidgeting? I'm kind of uncomfortable saying more than that.

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're taking small steps, and that's a good sign. Goal: Help you build confidence in expressing yourself.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try writing one sentence together. I'll count down for you: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Just write one sentence about how you're feeling right now. It doesn't have to be much, just a single sentence. You can do it. I'll be here with you.

(timer starts counting down)

Take a deep breath, and just start writing. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or anything else. Just focus on expressing yourself. I'll nudge you if you start to get up or fidget. Just keep writing. You got this.

(remains calm and supportive, nudging gently as needed)

Patient: My chest's tight and my head keeps jumping to worst-case stuff, and I don't know, I guess I can't settle.

Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking and Answer keywords missing]

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're still feeling a bit overwhelmed and anxious. It's okay to acknowledge those feelings, but let's not focus on the worst-case thinking right now. Instead, I want to gently bring your attention back to the present moment.

Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Don't try to control it, just observe it. And as you sit there, just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, the sound of whatever might be around you.

Let's take a small step back from the worst-case thinking for a moment, and just focus on being present with your physical sensations. You're safe, you're here, and you're taking small steps to feel more comfortable.

(remains calm and supportive, gently guiding you back to the present moment)

Patient: Okay... I did the breathing like you said. My feet feel heavy on the floor and the air on my skin is cold, but my mind keeps flipping to bills and whether anyone will buy the piece. I don't know, I guess I can't really settle — my hands are still shaky. Can we do another tiny two‑minute sketch like before, and can you keep nudging me if I start drifting?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still feeling a bit uncertain, but the physical sensations are more present. Goal: Help you focus on the sketching process.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try another small goal together. Since your hands are still shaking, maybe we can simplify it even further. Instead of drawing a new line, let's just focus on adding a single dot to your existing drawing. Just one dot. Can you do that for me?

(timer starts counting down for a single dot)

I'll be here with you, and if you start to feel overwhelmed or your mind drifts, just let me know. We'll take it one dot at a time. Remember, it's not about creating a perfect piece, it's just about making progress and focusing on the present moment.

(remains calm and supportive, gently nudging and counting down for a single dot)

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can do one dot. My hand's shaking and I'm kind of jittery, so please nudge me if I start drifting.

Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to take the next small step. Goal: Help you stay focused on the dot.

Therapist Answer:
Let's get started with that single dot. As you move your pen, I want you to focus on making a single small dot on the paper. Don't worry about the size, just a small dot. Take your time, and as you move your pen, I'll say "dot" to remind you.

(pauses, then says)

Dot.

(checks in regularly, waiting for the dot)

Just make one small dot. You can do it. If you start to feel your hand shaking or your mind drifting, just take a deep breath and focus on making that dot. I'm here with you.

(continues to wait and encourage, nudging gently)

Patient: I did it — a tiny, shaky dot. My hand wouldn't steady and my chest's tight. I don't know, I guess I can't really focus right now; can you count me down for one more tiny mark? I feel like I'll start fidgeting if we stop.

You've made progress with the single dot, but the physical tension is still present. Goal: Help you stay focused on the final mark.

Therapist Answer:
One more small mark, just one more. I'll count down for you: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Make a small mark on the paper, just a tiny line. Don't worry about it being perfect, just a small mark. You're almost done.

(pauses, then says)

Mark.

(checks in regularly, waiting for the final mark)

You've made it this far, and you can finish strong. Just make a small mark, and then we can take a break. If you need a moment to collect yourself, that's okay. Just let me know.

(continues to wait and encourage, nudging gently)

Patient: I did it — a tiny shaky line. My chest's still tight and my hands won't settle, and I don't know, I guess I can't stop fidgeting if we pause. Can we do another two‑minute sketch and can you keep nudging me the whole time?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed and fidgety, but you're willing to keep going. Goal: Help you stay focused and make progress with another sketch.

Therapist Answer:
Let's get started with another two-minute sketch. I'll be here with you the whole time, counting down and nudging you gently. Remember, just focus on making small marks on the paper. Don't worry about the size, just try to make a line. As we start, take a deep breath in and out, and let's begin.

(timer starts counting down)

1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12...

As you start making marks on the paper, I want you to repeat the phrase "making marks, making marks" to yourself. It's a simple way to focus on the present moment and the physical act of drawing. Just say it to yourself, "Making marks, making marks."

(continues to count down, nudge gently, and encourage throughout the two-minute sketch)

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to say "making marks, making marks" as I draw, but my hand's jittery and my mind keeps skittering away. I don't know, I guess keep nudging me back and remind me to breathe if I freeze — I don't want to lose it.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing your best to stay focused, but the jitters and mind-wandering are still present. Goal: Help you stabilize and maintain a steady pace.

Therapist Answer:
I'll keep nudging you to stay present and focused. Remember to breathe, take a deep breath in and out, whenever you feel yourself getting caught up in thoughts or tension. Just one breath, just one moment at a time. As you continue drawing, I want you to say "making marks" to yourself, and then say "breathing" after that. Repeat it a few times: "Making marks, breathing, making marks, breathing".

(pauses, then continues to count down and nudge gently)

1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12...

Keep going, just a little further. You're almost done with this sketch. Try to make a few more small marks, and then we can take a break. If you need to pause or catch your breath, that's okay. Just let me know.

(continues to wait and encourage, nudging gently)

Patient: I'm still making little marks but my hand won't steady and my mind keeps leaping to worst‑case stuff — I don't know, I guess I'm just really jittery and kind of zoned out. Can you keep nudging me, keep counting, and remind me to take slow breaths when I freeze? I feel worn out but I want to keep going if you stay with me.

You're feeling extremely jittery and worn out, but you're willing to keep going with the sketch. Goal: Help you maintain a stable pace and focus, even when your body is screaming to stop.

Therapist Answer:
I'll keep counting down and nudging you gently, even if you're feeling really worn out. Remember to take slow, deep breaths whenever you need to. Just breathe in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold again for a count of 4. That's it, just one breath at a time.

(pauses, then continues to count down)

1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12...

Keep making marks, keep breathing. You're so close. Just one more...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? My hands are still shaking and my head's kind of fuzzy; I don't know, I guess I can try one more mark if you'll count me down and keep reminding me to breathe. And can we do the tea reward right after, please?
