Patient: I've been thinking a lot about how angry and frustrated I get around the whole job loss and instability thing. I guess it's embarrassing to admit, and I don't know why it keeps coming out as shortness or snapping at people.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to share. It sounds like the instability is really tough to deal with, and it's understandable that you're feeling short-tempered. When you snap at others, is it usually because you feel like they're not understanding what you're going through, or because something specific they say or do sets you off?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it's both — mostly when people don't seem to get how hard it is, or when someone says stuff like "why haven't you found work yet?" or jokes about being "past it," and I just get defensive and snap. I don't know, it feels dumb to get so worked up over it.

Therapist: Those kinds of comments can be really triggering, especially when it feels like people are dismissing your experience. Instead of getting defensive and snapping, can you try to pause for a moment when someone makes a comment like that? Notice how it makes you feel, and take a deep breath before responding. What would it be like to say something like, "I understand you're trying to be helpful, but it's not that easy. It's really tough to find work right now"?

Patient: I can try that, I guess. I don't know if I'd actually say it — I usually either freeze up or blurt something out before I think. Pausing and breathing sounds okay in theory, but it feels hard and kind of fake when I'm that worked up. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed talking about this.

Therapist: Let's take a break from discussing the specific situations that trigger your defensiveness and snapping. How about we start with a different question? What's one thing you're looking forward to in your life right now, something that feels good or brings you comfort?

Patient: I guess I'm looking forward to my morning walks in the park — it's the one time I feel a little calmer and like I can breathe. I don't know, it sounds small, but those routines help me feel a bit steady.

Therapist: It's great that you have a daily routine that brings you calm. When you're out on your walks, can you try paying attention to your feet touching the ground, the sensation of your breath moving in and out, or the sounds around you? Take a moment to notice these small things without judgment. Just observe, and see if that helps you feel a bit more centered when you return here.

Patient: I can try that, I guess — when I walk I do notice my steps sometimes, so it doesn't sound completely impossible. I don't know, though, when I'm triggered my chest just tightens and I can't think, so I'm worried I won't remember to do it then; can we slow down? I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy talking about how I snap.

Therapist: Let's take a step back, literally and figuratively. Can we start by acknowledging that it's okay to feel overwhelmed right now? It's understandable that talking about how you snap can be uncomfortable. Let's focus on taking care of you in this moment. Why don't we just sit here in silence for a minute, and when you're ready, we can continue our conversation at a pace that feels more comfortable for you?

Patient: I don't know if I can just sit in silence — it makes me feel like I'm left alone with all the stuff I try not to think about. I guess I can try for a minute, but could we keep it short or could you let me know when it's over? I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy talking about how I snap.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and you can always come back to me whenever you're ready. Let's try a short silence for 30 seconds, and when you're ready, we'll continue. If you need a break or feel overwhelmed at any point, just take a deep breath and say "enough," and we'll pause. I'll signal when the 30 seconds are up, and we can go from there.

Patient: Okay, I can try. I don't know if I can do 30 seconds — could we try a shorter pause, like 15? I'm already feeling tight and want to say something.

Therapist: 15 seconds it is. When you're ready, just let me know, and we'll take the next step. I'll start counting down: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... pause.

Patient: I couldn't really stay silent — my chest tightened and my mind went straight to bills and wondering if after all these years as an accountant anyone will take me seriously again. I don't know, I guess sitting with that just makes me want to either snap or shut down. Can we talk about small, practical things I can actually do in the moment when I feel that tightness, because I'm worried I won't remember to breathe?

Therapist: Let's focus on the breath. When you feel that tightness in your chest, try bringing your attention to your breath, just for a second. Notice how your chest is feeling, and then slowly, slowly bring your attention to your breath. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on the sensation of each breath without thinking about anything else. For example, you could say to yourself, "I'm noticing my breath right now," or "I'm feeling my chest relax as I breathe in." Can you try that when you feel the tightness?

Patient: I can try that, I guess, but when my chest tightens my head goes straight to bills and I can't hold anything in mind — I don't know how I'll remember to do it. Could you give me one very simple thing to say or do in the moment, like a one-line script or a tiny action I can actually manage? I'm starting to feel more anxious just talking about it.

Therapist: Just try saying the word "inhale" to yourself when you feel that tightness in your chest. Just one word: "inhale." Repeat it to yourself, even if you can't think about anything else. That's it. No pressure, just say "inhale" and focus on the sound of the word. It's simple, and it might be enough to give you a tiny moment of clarity.

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow. How's just saying "inhale" supposed to help when my head immediately races to bills and all that? I guess I can try whispering it or saying it in my head, but I'm worried I'll forget in the moment. Do you mean say it out loud or just think it? I'm feeling a bit jumpy.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. When you feel that tightness in your chest, try this: just think to yourself, "Take one breath." That's it. Just one word, "Take one breath". Say it to yourself silently, without thinking about anything else. Just focus on the word and the sensation of taking one breath. Don't worry about forgetting, just try it for a second. Can you try that?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm not sure how that helps when my mind's racing — how am I supposed to focus on a word when bills and everything else are flashing through my head? Do you mean say "Take one breath" out loud or just think it? I'm feeling jumpy and worried I won't remember to do anything, but I can try saying it silently now: "Take one breath."

Therapist: It doesn't matter if you say it out loud or think it, just try to focus on the sensation of the word on your tongue. When you say "Take one breath" silently, feel the movement of your tongue, the sensation of the sound in your mouth, and the slight pause before the rest of the sentence. Focus on that physical sensation for a brief moment. It's not about controlling your thoughts, but about creating a small, tangible anchor in the moment. Just try it for a second.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow how focusing on the tongue or the word is supposed to stop my head from racing. I just tried saying "take one breath" silently and I felt a tiny pause, but then my mind shot straight to bills and whether anyone will take me seriously after all these years as an accountant. I guess I can keep trying, but can we slow down? I'm getting jumpy and it's hard to hold onto this.

Therapist: It's okay, let's take a brief pause. You've been trying to focus on the word "Take one breath" for a while now, and it's clear it's not working as well as we'd like. Can we just stop trying to focus on that word for a moment? Just look at me, and take a deep breath. Notice how your body is feeling, and notice the silence between us. Take a moment to just be present in this space. We'll start again whenever you're ready.

Patient: I tried to take a breath, but I can't stay with it — my chest tightens and my mind goes straight to bills and whether anyone will take me seriously. I don't know how to just sit and be present; I guess I need something more concrete. Can you count breaths with me or tell me when to inhale and exhale? I'm getting jumpy, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's start small. I'll count the breaths with you. When you're ready, just nod to yourself, and I'll start counting. When I say "one," you'll inhale, and when I say "two," you'll exhale. Just focus on the sound of my voice and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. We'll take it one breath at a time. Ready when you are.

Patient: I guess I'm ready... I don't know if I'll keep up — my chest's already tight and my head's racing about bills and whether anyone will hire me. Can you start slowly? I'm feeling jumpy and distracted.

Therapist: One... (pause) You're breathing right now. Take one breath in through your nose, and hold it for a second. One. Your chest is rising, and your breath is moving in. Now, exhale slowly through your mouth. Two. Your chest is falling, and your breath is moving out. Just focus on the sensation of that one breath, and the next one, and the next. We're taking it very slowly. Ready?

Patient: Okay... I did that. It helped a tiny bit — I felt a little less tight for a second, but then my head went straight to bills and whether anyone will hire me again. I don't know if I can keep focusing, but I guess I can try one more breath if you'll guide me.

Therapist: It's okay, you're doing okay. Just take another breath, and I'll be here with you. Remember, one breath at a time. Focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without thinking about anything else. It's just this one breath, right now. When you're ready, we can try to gently bring our attention back to the present moment, without focusing on the thoughts about bills. Just one more breath. Ready?

Patient: Okay... I did that. It helped a tiny bit — a small break in the tightness — then my head darted straight to bills and whether anyone will hire me. I don't know if I can keep focusing, but I guess I can try one more if you keep guiding me... Can we go slower? I'm feeling pretty wiped.

Therapist: Let's take a pause. You're doing your best, and that's all I can ask for right now. Just sit with your breath for a moment, and notice how your body is feeling. Don't worry about the thoughts or the breaths, just rest for a second. When you're ready, we can come back to this. You can take a break, and we can try to come back to it when you're feeling a bit more centered. Take your time.

Patient: I don't know... I keep getting this wave of shame and it's making my chest tighten all over again. I feel small and stupid, like whatever I do won't be enough, and I guess that makes me angry and useless at the same time. I'm wiped — can we just slow down and not push into more right now? I don't really know what I need besides... maybe just staying here with you a bit.

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to not be okay right now. That wave of shame is a tough one to deal with, and it's understandable that it's making you feel small and useless. Can you just be here with me for a second, without trying to do anything or push through? I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not going to try to fix anything right now. Just being present with me, in this moment, might be enough. You can take all the time you need, and we can just sit here together. No pressure, no expectations. Just being.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to stay here with you for a bit. My chest's still tight and my head keeps darting to bills and whether I'll ever get another job, so I'm jumpy and not sure how long I can sit, but... can we just stay like this for a few minutes?

Therapist: Just take your time, and don't worry about sitting for too long. We can do whatever feels comfortable for you. Let's just focus on the present moment, right now. You're sitting here with me, and that's all that matters. If your head starts to dart to thoughts about bills or job security, just gently acknowledge them without judgment. You can say to yourself, "Okay, I'm noticing that thought right now," or "I'll just acknowledge that for a second." Don't try to push it away or engage with it too much. Just observe, and then gently bring your attention back to the present moment. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice the thoughts, but they yank me straight to bills and that shame and then I go blank. Can you give me one tiny, concrete thing to do in the moment—like a one-word anchor or a short line—because I'm feeling wiped and jumpy and I won't manage anything complicated right now.

Therapist: Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Say to yourself, "Ground." Just that one word. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the feeling of the ground beneath you. That's all you need to focus on right now. Just one word: "Ground".

Patient: I guess I can try. Ground. My feet are on the floor, but my head's already snagging on bills and that stupid shame — I don't know if this will help, but I'll keep saying "Ground" for a little while.

Therapist: It's okay that your mind is already pulling back to those thoughts. Just acknowledge that, and gently bring your attention back to the word "Ground". Don't try to push away the thoughts right now, just observe them. Say to yourself, "Okay, I've got a thought. I'm noticing that I'm thinking about bills and shame. I'll just acknowledge that for a second, and then come back to the word 'Ground'." Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, say "Ground" again.

Patient: Ground. I can feel my feet a bit, but my chest's still tight and my head keeps snagging on bills and that stupid shame. I don't know if it's helping much, but it's a tiny pause — I guess I can keep doing it if you guide me slowly.

Therapist: Let's take a slow and gentle approach. As you continue to say "Ground" to yourself, try to explore the sensations in your body a bit more. Notice where the tightness in your chest is specifically located, and see if you can identify any other subtle physical sensations, like tension or relaxation. You can say to yourself, "I'm noticing that the tightness in my chest is in this spot," or "I'm feeling a bit of tension in my shoulders." Keep your focus on the physical sensations, and see if you can build on that awareness. When you're ready, say "Ground" again, and take it from there.

Patient: Ground. I can feel my feet, a bit — like they're planted but my chest is this tight band across the upper part, right under my ribs, and my shoulders are hunched up. There's a knot in my stomach too, and my jaw's clenched. I don't know, it helps a tiny bit to name it, but my head keeps flashing to bills and that stupid shame and I get jumpy. Can we go slower? Maybe tell me the next small thing to do—one step at a time—because I can't hold much right now.

Therapist: Let's take it one small step at a time. As you continue to focus on the sensations in your body, try to notice the thoughts that come up without judgment. Just observe them, and then gently bring your attention back to the present moment. When the thoughts about bills and shame come up, notice them specifically. You can say to yourself, "Okay, I've got a thought about bills." Then, instead of trying to push it away or engage with it, simply acknowledge it and let it go. For now, let's focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the sensation of your feet, and see if you can stay with it for a second.

Patient: Ground. I can feel my heels and a bit of pressure under the balls of my feet, but that tight band under my ribs is still there and my jaw's clenched. I don't know — I guess I can keep doing this, but my head keeps snapping to bills and that stupid shame. Can you tell me one tiny next thing to do, like a simple movement or phrase, because I can't hold much right now?

Therapist: Try to release the tightness in your jaw a little bit. Just notice the sensation of your jaw clenching, and then make a tiny effort to relax it. You can say to yourself, "Let go a little." Just release the tension in your jaw for a second, and then bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the pressure under the balls of your feet, and the sensation of your heels. Just stay with those sensations for a second.

Patient: I don't know... I tried to let my jaw loosen a bit — I let my teeth part and it helped a tiny, tiny amount, I guess. My chest's still tight and my head's already snagging on bills and that shame, and I'm feeling kind of drained. Can you give me one more very small thing to do, slowly, and stay with me while I try it?

Therapist: Just take one slow, deep breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Feel the sensation of your chest rising and falling, and the sensation of your belly expanding and contracting. Just focus on the sensation of that one breath, and let it be. Don't try to control it or change it, just be with it. Just breathe. I'll stay with you for as long as you need.

Patient: Okay... I did one slow deep breath. It helped a little — a tiny space — but then my chest tightened again and my head went straight to bills and that stupid shame. I feel wiped and jumpy. I don't know, can you keep guiding me with something really simple? Like just say "inhale" and "exhale" slowly or count with me again? I guess I need you to stay with it.

Therapist: Let's start with something very simple. I'll count slowly, one to one, and then you can breathe with me. When I say "inhale," you'll take a slow breath in. When I say "exhale," you'll take a slow breath out. Just focus on the counting, and let's take it one slow breath at a time. Ready? One... Inhale. Two... Exhale.

Patient: Okay... I followed that with you. It helped a bit — my chest eased for a second when you said "inhale" and "exhale," but then my head snapped to bills and that stupid feeling that I'm a failure. I'm jumpy and kind of wiped. Can you keep saying "inhale" and "exhale" slowly a few more times and stay with me? I don't know how long I'll manage, but I want to try.
