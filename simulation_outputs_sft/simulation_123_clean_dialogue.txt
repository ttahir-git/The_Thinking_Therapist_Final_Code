Patient: I've been feeling really anxious in social settings lately — even with friends or my partner there I get overwhelmed and end up avoiding gatherings. I work as a data scientist, and my OCD plus ongoing financial stress just seems to make it worse. I don't know, it's awkward to say out loud.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel anxious in social situations? What's the first thing that goes through your mind, and what's the first physical sensation you notice in your body? Try to describe it as precisely as possible, without worrying about judgment.

Patient: I don't know, I guess the first thought is something like, "They're noticing how weird I am" or "Did I just say something stupid?" Right after that my chest gets tight and my stomach kind of drops. My hands get sweaty, my voice goes quieter, and my head goes fuzzy like I can't find words, so I usually look at my phone or grab a drink to get out of it.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is responding quite strongly to the initial thought. Can you notice what happens to you when you start to reach for your phone or grab a drink? Is there a sense of relief or escape when you do, or is there a sense of guilt or embarrassment afterwards? For example, what's going through your mind when you're scrolling through your phone or taking a drink, and how does that affect your overall experience in the social setting?

Patient: I guess grabbing my phone or a drink gives a quick, stupid relief—like I can hide or pretend I'm occupied. But then I start feeling guilty and embarrassed, thinking I missed chances to connect or that people think I'm rude, and that makes the anxiety hang around even longer. I don't know, it's like a short escape that just makes everything feel worse afterward.

Therapist: Those feelings of guilt and embarrassment are a big part of the experience. Can you think about what would happen if, instead of reaching for your phone or drink, you simply allowed yourself to sit with that feeling for a moment? What would it be like to notice the physical sensations and the thoughts without trying to change them or escape them? Would it be possible to start to develop a sense of curiosity or interest in exploring what's going on, rather than just trying to get out of it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I didn't reach for my phone the anxiety would just get louder and my chest would feel like it's closing. It feels really scary to sit with it; part of me thinks if I could stay curious for even a minute I might notice the pattern instead of spiraling, but I get so uncomfortable I usually bail. I don't know, it's hard to imagine actually doing that.

Therapist: It's not about trying to reduce the anxiety right away; it's about developing a sense of curiosity about what's happening in your body and mind. Can you imagine taking one deep breath, right now, and noticing just the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Just that one sensation, without trying to change it or think about it too much? No need to try to do anything else, just be with that one sensation.

Patient: Okay... I tried to take a breath — it felt pretty shallow and my chest stayed tight, and my first thought was, "Are they going to notice I'm breathing weird?" I guess there was a tiny flicker of calm but then the urge to check my phone hit and I almost did it. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that feeling overwhelmed, and it's good that you're willing to slow down. Let's look at what happens when you reach for your phone. It's like a familiar pattern that you're trying to break. Can you try something small? Instead of reaching for your phone, can you just pause for a second and say to yourself, "Phone." Just say the word "phone." That's it. No need to do anything else, just say the word. Notice how that feels.

Patient: "Phone."

Okay—I said it. It made this tiny gap, like the urge loosened for half a second, but my hands still wanted to grab it and my chest stayed tight. I don't know, I feel kind of awkward doing this—can we go a bit slower?

Therapist: It's completely okay to feel a bit awkward, and I'm here to support you. Let's take a moment to breathe with the pause. Can you just stay with the sensation of saying "phone" for a second longer? Just 2... 3... seconds. No need to think about anything else, just be with that one word. Notice how the gap is starting to feel a little bigger. Can you just stay with that for another second?

Patient: I did— I tried to stay with the word for a few seconds, and there's this tiny looseness, but my chest is still tight and my hands are twitching toward my phone. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable and I'm getting restless; can we go slower or try something else? I feel like I'm about to bail.

Therapist: It's okay to feel restless, and it's understandable that you want to move forward. Let's try to focus on the sensation of your breath for just a second, without thinking about the phone or anything else. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just for a second? No need to try to change it or control it, just be with the sensation. Imagine you're just sitting with your breath, allowing it to be what it is. Let's see if we can sustain this small moment of being present for just one more second.

Patient: I tried to stay with my breath for another second — I could feel the air a little, but my chest's still tight and my hands are twitching. I guess there was the tiniest bit of calm, but I'm getting really restless and I feel like I'm about to bail. Can we slow down or do something else? I don't know, this is getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that you're feeling really restless and uncomfortable. Can you just notice that for a second, without trying to change it? Just feel the sensation of restlessness, the tension in your chest, the twitching in your hands. No need to try to overcome it, just be with it. And then, can we go back to the pause? Just sit with your breath, just for a second, and let's see what happens.

Patient: I do notice it — my chest's tight, my hands keep twitching, and I'm really restless. I tried to breathe but my mind keeps jumping to other stuff and I feel kind of panicky. I don't know, can we slow down or try a different grounding thing, like naming a few things I can see?

Therapist: Let's try to focus on what you can see. Can you notice three things in this room right now? Just three things. Look around you, notice the shapes, the colors, the textures. Try to focus on those things, just for a second. What can you see?

Patient: I guess I can see my laptop with a sticker on it, a chipped coffee mug, and a little potted plant on the windowsill. My hands are still twitching and my chest feels tight — I don't know, can we slow down or try something simpler?

Therapist: Let's try to bring your attention to your feet. Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the ground? Feel the weight of your body distributed on them. Notice the sensation of the chair, the floor, the air on your skin. Just focus on that sensation for a second.

Patient: I can kind of feel my feet on the floor — like a faint weight — but my chest's still tight and my hands keep twitching. My mind keeps darting off to other stuff and I can't hold it there; I'm feeling really jittery and distracted. I don't know, can we go even slower or try something simpler, like counting breaths or squeezing something in my hand?

Therapist: Let's try something very simple. Can you just squeeze your hand for a second? Not too hard, just a gentle squeeze. Notice how your hand feels, how your fingers feel the squeeze. Just hold that sensation for a second. No need to think about anything else, just the squeeze.

Patient: Okay... I squeezed my hand. It helped a little — like the twitch shifted there — but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting to other stuff. I don't know, can we try counting breaths or maybe hold the squeeze for a bit longer? I'm really finding it hard to stay with this.

Therapist: Let's extend the squeeze a bit longer. Can you just keep squeezing your hand for another second or two? Just hold that sensation, notice how it feels. And then, when you're ready, can you start counting your breaths? Just breathe in, "one", breathe out, "two". No need to think about anything else, just the breaths. Let's start with that.

Patient: Okay—I held the squeeze for another second and tried to count breaths, but I keep losing track and the numbers get jumbled. My chest feels tighter, my hands are twitching more, and I'm really jittery and distracted — I don't know, I guess something's making me more anxious right now. Can we slow down or try a different, simpler grounding thing? I feel like I'm about to bail.

Therapist: Let's start again from the beginning. Can you just focus on your breath for a second? Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try to let go of the counting for now. Instead, just notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed on them. Notice the sensation of the chair, the floor, the air on your skin. Just focus on that sensation for a second.

Patient: I don't know — I can't really focus; my chest's tight and my mind keeps darting to other stuff and I'm getting kind of panicky. I guess can we do something simpler, like naming five things I can see or holding the hand squeeze longer? I'm feeling really scattered and like I'm about to bail.

Therapist: Let's try holding the hand squeeze for a longer period of time, just for 30 seconds. Can you do that for me? Just squeeze your hand, notice the sensation in your fingers, the feeling of the squeeze. Try to let go of any thoughts or worries, just focus on the physical sensation. We'll do that for 30 seconds, and then we can reassess how you're feeling.

Patient: Okay—I'll try to hold it for 30 seconds. My hands are already shaking and my chest is really tight and I'm pretty distracted, so can you count it out or tell me when we're halfway? I don't know, I'm worried I'll bail.

Therapist: I'll count it out for you. We'll start now: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... 21... 22... 23... 24... 25... 26... 27... 28... 29... 30. You made it. Now, take a deep breath in and out, and notice how your body feels for just a moment.

Patient: I don't know — I took the breath, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking and my head feels fuzzy. I guess the counting made me more jittery instead of calmer. Can we slow down? Maybe try something simpler or just sit with this for a minute.

Therapist: Let's take a break from counting. Can we just sit here for a minute? Just notice how you're feeling right now, without trying to do anything else. Take a deep breath, and just be with your body and your thoughts. Let's just sit here for a minute, and then we can try something else if you'd like.

Patient: I tried to sit with it for a minute but I can't — my chest's closing, my hands are shaking, my head's fuzzy and my mind keeps darting. I don't know, it's getting worse and I'm really jittery; can we do something simpler, like a guided 4-4-4 breath or just talk about something easy for a minute? I feel like I'm about to bail.

Therapist: Let's try a guided breathing exercise. I want you to focus on four things right now: your four breaths. Just breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, breathe out for a count of four, and hold again for a count of four. Try to focus on just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about anything else. Let's start again from the beginning: breathe in for four, hold for four, breathe out for four, hold for four.

Patient: Okay... I tried one round of the 4-4-4 but it felt shallow — my chest's still tight, my hands are shaking, and my mind keeps jumping. I don't know, can we slow down or do something simpler? I'm kind of worn out and it's hard to keep going.

Therapist: It's okay to feel worn out. It's okay to take a break. You've been trying a lot of different things, and it's not working out. Can we just stop for a minute? Take a deep breath, and notice how you're feeling right now. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, it's okay to feel like you're not making progress. Let's just be with that feeling for a second, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: I tried to breathe with you, but my chest's still tight and my hands won't stop shaking. Everything feels kind of blurry and heavy — I don't know, can we slow down or just talk about something simpler? I'm really on edge and about to bail.

Therapist: Hey, can we just talk for a minute? I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be on edge. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Can you just focus on your breath for me right now, and try to let go of some of that tension? I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Just talk about whatever you need to talk about. We'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: I don't know... I'm kind of wiped out and everything feels fuzzy and tight in my chest. There's this friend's birthday next week—my partner keeps saying I should go, but I keep imagining freezing up and then feeling guilty for skipping, so I keep making excuses. I guess can we just… talk about how to not bail or maybe slow down and break it into something smaller?

Therapist: Let's start with just one small thing. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when your partner says you should go to the friend's birthday party? What's the first thing that comes up for you? Is it the fear of freezing up, or something else? Let's just focus on that one thought for a second. What's happening when you think about it?

Patient: I guess the first thought is, "What if I freeze or say something stupid and everyone notices," and that image just makes my chest clamp up. Then it spirals — I picture leaving early, feeling guilty, and obsessing afterward about how rude I was, plus there's this extra pressure from money stuff like I can't afford any social fallout. I don't know… maybe we could make it smaller, like planning to go for 15 minutes or agree on a quick exit, but I'm kind of fuzzy and worn out.

Therapist: Let's focus on just one small step. Can you imagine if we agreed to just go for 15 minutes? Would that feel less overwhelming? You could leave early if you need to, but at least you'd have a small commitment to yourself. Just 15 minutes. Can you think of anything else that might make it feel more manageable? Maybe it's not about being "on" for the whole time, but about just showing up and being present for a little while. Let's try to break it down even further. What if we said we'd just go for 5 minutes, and then reassess? Just 5 minutes. Can you think of what that would feel like?

Patient: I don't know... five minutes sounds more doable, like less pressure. But even thinking about it makes my chest clamp and I can already imagine making excuses to leave, so I'm not sure I'd actually stay. I'm kind of worn out — can we slow down and figure out one tiny concrete step I could use so I don't bail?

Therapist: Let's focus on just one tiny thing. Can you commit to looking at the friend's birthday party invitation for just 30 seconds? That's it, just 30 seconds. Can you do that for me right now? Just look at it, see the name and date, and that's it. Don't think about anything else, just focus on looking at it. After 30 seconds, we can reassess and see how you're feeling.

Patient: I guess I can try to look at it for 30 seconds, but my chest's already tight and I'm really jittery. Can you count it for me? I don't know if I'll make the whole time, but I'll try.

Therapist: I'll count down with you. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Okay, you're looking at the invitation. Just take a deep breath and notice it for a second. You can do this. Let's see how you're feeling right now.

Patient: I looked at it—my chest's super tight, my hands are shaking, and I keep picturing myself bailing, so I don't know if I can actually stay. I guess a tiny plan might help, like agreeing to go for five minutes and texting my partner when I get there. Can we try to make that plan really concrete and simple?

Therapist: Let's make that plan really concrete. Can you commit to sending a text to your partner saying "Hey, I'm on my way to the party now" exactly five minutes before you arrive? And can you also agree to send another text saying "Hey, I'm leaving now" exactly five minutes after you arrive? That way, you'll have a clear plan and your partner will know exactly when to expect you. And we can even use a timer to help you stay on track. How does that sound?

Patient: I guess I can try. I don't know if I'll actually remember to text five minutes before — I tend to chicken out — so I'll commit to texting "on my way" when I'm in the car and setting an alarm to send "leaving" five minutes after I arrive so I don't have to rely on willpower. Can we make my in-person goal just five minutes at first and have my partner ready to leave with me if I panic? I'm kind of wiped, so can we keep this simple.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Committing to texting "on my way" when you're in the car and using an alarm to send "leaving" five minutes after you arrive is a good way to ensure you don't rely on willpower. And having your partner ready to leave with you if you panic is a great safety net. Let's keep your in-person goal simple for now and focus on getting you to the party for just five minutes. Can you commit to that? Just five minutes, and you can reassess how you're feeling and adjust as needed.

Patient: I think I can try that — I guess I'll text "on my way" when I'm in the car and set an alarm to send "leaving" five minutes after I get there. I'm already kinda wiped and my chest's tight just thinking about it, so can we also make a backup like my partner waiting outside to walk me out if I panic? I don't know, I feel foggy and worried I'll chicken out, but I'll try to stick to five minutes.
