Patient: I’m an older, unemployed person and lately I’ve been feeling really stuck and directionless, like I don’t know what matters to me beyond that label. I’ve been dealing with PTSD and a lot of loneliness, so it’s hard to see any direction. I’ve done therapy before and I’m skeptical this will help, but I’m here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight with PTSD and loneliness, making it hard to see a way forward. It's completely understandable to be skeptical about therapy after previous experiences. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately? What's one thing that you wish you could do, but feel unable to do right now? Maybe we can start with that, and see if we can explore it together.

Patient: I wish I could wake up with something to look forward to — a small project, a class, maybe some volunteering — but I can't seem to make myself follow through. I've tried signing up for things before and it never sticks; I get anxious, freeze up, and then beat myself up about it. How is talking about this supposed to help? I'm skeptical, but I can try to explain what happens when I actually try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of wanting to take action, but getting stuck by anxiety. I want to explore this cycle with you, but I want to do it in a way that's not judgmental. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to follow through with a new project or class? Not just what you think, but what your body and mind are doing right now, in this moment. Can you notice where you feel the anxiety, and what kind of thoughts are coming up for you?

Patient: When I try, my chest gets tight, my stomach knots, my hands go cold, and my head just kind of slams shut like it’s no use. Thoughts race—“you’ll fail, they’ll laugh, what’s the point, you don’t deserve this”—and sometimes a memory sneaks up and I feel like a scared kid again. Okay, but how is just noticing that supposed to help when I’ve already tried facing it and nothing ever stuck?

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a intense physiological response to anxiety, and a strong sense of self-criticism. I want to ask you to do something different for a moment. Can you try to observe these physical sensations, and the thoughts that come up, without judgment? Try to notice them as if you're watching them from outside, rather than being them. It might be helpful to use a phrase like "there's a knot in my stomach" or "my mind is racing" instead of "I'm a failure" or "I'll never succeed". Can you try that for just a moment, and see how it feels?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try. There’s a tightness in my chest, my stomach’s knotted, my hands go cold, and my thoughts flood with “you’ll fail” and “what’s the point,” then some memory of being that scared kid pops up. It just feels small and useless to notice it, and I don’t see how naming it will change anything—I’ve tried that before and it didn’t help. I’m trying to do this, but honestly I’m still skeptical.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing your physical sensations and thoughts, but still feeling skeptical about whether it will help. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you just name these sensations and thoughts without trying to change them? What's the function of your skepticism right now? Is it trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed, or is it trying to keep you from feeling like you're doing something that won't work? Try to understand what skepticism is serving for you in this moment.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I guess my skepticism is a kind of armor — if I expect it to fail, I don't have to feel the sting if it does, and I can avoid being that scared kid again. It also keeps me from getting my hopes up only to be disappointed, so part of me clings to it even though it makes me stuck. Maybe naming the sensations could stop the spiral a little, but honestly I’ve tried that and it just feels like rearranging deck chairs.

Therapist: It sounds like your skepticism is a way of protecting yourself from feeling overwhelmed and disappointed. It's like you're using it to shield yourself from the pain of failure and the fear of being that scared kid again. Can you tell me more about what's valuable about having this armor? What's it keeping you safe from? Is it keeping you safe from feeling vulnerable, or is it keeping you safe from feeling hopeful and open to new experiences? Try to understand what value this armor is serving for you.

Patient: It keeps me from getting hurt — from letting myself hope and then watching it get taken away, from feeling that scared kid all over again. It also gives me something to hide behind so I don't have to face the mess inside or admit how alone I feel. But seriously, how is that supposed to help? I'm tired of the armor, but I don't see how to take it off without getting crushed.

Therapist: It sounds like your armor is keeping you safe from feeling vulnerable and alone. But can you try to see it in a different way? Instead of it being a shield that protects you, what if it's a tool that you can use to explore what's on the other side of the armor? What if you used the armor to gently test the waters, so to speak, and see what happens when you're not using it as a shield? You're tired of the armor, but what if it was a step towards being able to take it off, or at least being able to use it in a way that felt more like a step forward?

Patient: Maybe that makes sense—use the armor to test the waters instead of trying to take it off all at once. How is that supposed to help? I've tried small things before and they didn't stick, but maybe I could try one tiny, low-stakes thing—like sketching for half an hour at home—and see if it feels different, though I'm tired and already worried it won't change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try something small, like sketching for half an hour at home. That's a great start. Can you try to commit to that small action, just for that half hour? Don't worry about whether it will change anything or not, just focus on showing up and doing it. See how it feels to have a small, specific goal in front of you, and how that feels in your body and mind. Don't worry about the outcome, just focus on the act of showing up and doing the small thing. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to sketch for half an hour at home, but I’m tired and I’m not promising it’ll stick. My chest already feels tight just thinking about showing up and I’m worried I’ll bail and feel worse. How is this tiny sketching thing supposed to make me feel less directionless or get me out of this stuck place, though?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of physical and emotional tension as you think about sketching. That's okay. Can you try to focus on the physical act of showing up, rather than the emotional outcome? Instead of worrying about whether you'll feel more directionless or stuck after sketching, try to focus on the sensation of putting one foot in front of the other. What if, instead of trying to overcome your feelings of stuckness, you just tried to get through the next 30 minutes? Not to change how you feel, not to achieve anything specific, just to show up and do the work? Sometimes, taking that first step is more about building momentum than it is about achieving a specific outcome. Can you try that for me?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try to get through the next 30 minutes and sketch at home, but I’m not promising it’ll stick. My chest’s already tight just thinking about starting — if I freeze up, what should I do instead of beating myself up? And honestly, how is this tiny thing supposed to help with feeling directionless?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a strong urge to beat yourself up if you freeze up while sketching. Can you try to notice that urge, and instead of acting on it, simply observe it? What if, instead of trying to push through or avoid, you just asked yourself, "What's going on right now?" "What's causing this feeling of tightness in my chest?" "What's making it hard for me to start?" Sometimes, just taking a moment to ask ourselves these kinds of questions can help us develop a bit more curiosity and understanding, rather than judgment. As for how this tiny thing might help with feeling directionless, remember that it's not about making progress or achieving some grand goal. It's just about showing up, taking a small step, and seeing what happens. Sometimes, taking that first step can help us build momentum and clarity, even if it's just for a moment. Can you try to approach the next 30 minutes with a bit more gentle curiosity, rather than judgment?

Patient: I'll try to be curious, but I just got hit with this old shame—my chest tightened and my head's full of "you failed," so curiosity feels impossible right now. How is asking "what's going on" supposed to stop that voice from tearing me apart? If I freeze, I need something concrete—what's a simple phrase or tiny action I can use in the moment instead of beating myself up? I'm willing to try, but I'm doubtful it will stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by shame and self-doubt right now. That's okay. Can you try to use a simple phrase to interrupt the cycle of self-criticism? What if, instead of beating yourself up, you just said to yourself, "I'm having trouble right now." or "I'm not sure what to do." or even just "Okay." Sometimes, just acknowledging that you're struggling can help you pause and reassess. It's not about judgment, it's just about acknowledging the present moment. You can also try taking a very small physical action, like taking a deep breath, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. It's not about achieving anything, it's just about finding a small way to stabilize yourself in the moment. Can you try using one of those phrases or taking one of those small actions right now, just for a moment, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I said to myself, "I'm having trouble right now," took a slow breath, and felt my feet on the floor. It eased the panic a bit, but that old "you failed" voice is still tearing at me and I feel ashamed. It helps a little, but honestly I don't see how this turns into anything real — what do I do if the shame just swallows the whole half hour?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck again, but in a different way. Instead of being overwhelmed by shame, you're wondering if the whole half hour will be lost to shame. Can you try to see this as an opportunity to practice something new? What if, instead of beating yourself up over your struggles, you simply accepted that they're a part of the process? It's okay if the shame is still there - it doesn't have to define the entire experience. Can you try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the outcome? Instead of thinking "I'll fail" or "I'm a failure," try thinking "I'm here right now, struggling with this." Just that simple observation can be a tiny step forward. Remember, it's not about achieving anything or overcoming shame; it's just about showing up and being present. Can you try to focus on that for the next few minutes, even if it feels hard?

Patient: I tried the present-moment thing, but that "you failed" voice slammed into me and now I feel ashamed and small — it’s like it eats the whole half hour before I even start. How is saying "I'm here, struggling" actually supposed to stop that? Give me one concrete thing I can do in the moment if the shame swallows the half hour — a short phrase that might actually land, or a tiny action (timer for 5 minutes? put the pencil down and breathe?) — something practical I can use instead of spiraling. I'll try it, but I'm skeptical it'll change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm here, struggling" wasn't enough to stop the shame. Can you try something more concrete? What if, instead of trying to reframe your thoughts, you just focus on one small physical action? Try this: every time the shame voice starts to overwhelm you, take a single deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Just that single, slow breath can help you pause and calm down. It's not about changing your thoughts or feelings; it's just about giving yourself a tiny moment of stability. You can also try setting a timer for just 30 seconds and telling yourself to focus on that one breath for that short time. When the timer goes off, you can try again. Remember, it's not about achieving anything or stopping the shame entirely; it's just about giving yourself a tiny way to cope in the moment. Can you try that for me? Just focus on taking one deep breath right now, and see how it feels?

Patient: I did the slow breath like you said — it helped a little, the tightness eased for a moment, but that old shame is still clawing at me and it’s hard to breathe through it. If one breath only blunts it, what’s the next concrete thing I can actually do in the moment — a short phrase that might land, or a tiny physical action besides breathing? I’m trying, but I’m skeptical it’ll stick when I’m already this wrecked.

Therapist: It sounds like one breath isn't enough to keep the shame at bay. Can you try something more tangible? What if, when you feel the shame starting to overwhelm you, you just write the word "start" on a piece of paper? Yes, just write "start". Don't worry about what you write next, just focus on putting that single word on paper. Sometimes, taking a physical action like this can help you pause and collect your thoughts. It's not about changing your thoughts or feelings; it's just about giving yourself a tiny distraction. You can also try setting a timer for 60 seconds and telling yourself to focus on writing the word "start" for that entire time. When the timer goes off, you can try again. Remember, it's not about achieving anything or stopping the shame entirely; it's just about giving yourself a tiny way to cope in the moment. Can you try that for me? Just write the word "start" on a piece of paper right now, and see how it feels?

Patient: I tried to write "start" — my hand shook and I scrawled it down, and it barely did anything; the shame sat on my chest like a rock and I felt small and useless again. How is that supposed to stop the whole half hour? If that doesn't work, give me one concrete fallback I can actually use in the moment — a short phrase I can say out loud that might land, or a tiny physical action (like "set a 2-minute timer and doodle one line") — something I can do when the shame swallows the time. I'm willing to try one more thing, but I'm tired and skeptical it will change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're running out of options and feeling tired. Can you try something as simple as taking a sip of water? Just lift the glass to your lips, take a small sip, and then put the glass down. It's a tiny physical action that can help you pause and focus on something other than the shame. You can also try saying a simple phrase to yourself, like "I've got this" or "I'm here". Sometimes, just saying something out loud can help you feel more grounded. Remember, the goal isn't to achieve anything or stop the shame entirely; it's just to give yourself a tiny way to cope in the moment. Can you try taking a sip of water right now and saying a simple phrase to yourself? Just focus on that one action for a moment.

Patient: I took the sip and said "I'm here" out loud — it eased the tightness for a second, then that old shame came back and made me feel tiny and useless again. How is one sip and a phrase supposed to stop the whole half hour from disappearing? Give me one concrete fallback I can actually do in the moment — something so small I can't fail (like set a 2-minute timer and draw one unbroken line, or put the pencil down and stand and stretch for 30 seconds). Pick one thing for me to try now; I'll try it, but I'm still skeptical.

Therapist: Can you try putting the pencil down and standing up for 30 seconds? Just get up from the table or chair and stand. It doesn't matter what you do with your hands or what you look at; just focus on standing. You can even take a few deep breaths while you're standing. This is a tiny physical action that can help you pause and feel more grounded. Remember, the goal isn't to achieve anything or stop the shame entirely; it's just to give yourself a tiny way to cope in the moment. Try it now, just for 30 seconds.

Patient: I stood up for thirty seconds like you said — it felt dumb and awkward, and it only took the edge off for a breath before that shame slammed back and made me feel small and useless again. How is standing supposed to make any of this stick? If that doesn't work, give me one concrete, so-small-I-can't-fail fallback I can use right then, please.

Therapist: Can you try putting your foot down on the floor in front of you? Just put your foot down, no matter where you are sitting or standing. It's a tiny, one-foot movement that requires no thought or effort. Just focus on putting your foot down. This is a so-small-you-can't-fail action that might provide a brief moment of stability. Try it now, just for a second.

Patient: I put my foot down like you said — barely felt anything, and that old shame just settled back on my chest, making me feel small and useless again. How is this supposed to make anything stick? If that doesn't work, give me one absolutely tiny, can't-fail fallback I can try right now while I'm sitting and the shame's clawing at me.

Therapist: Can you try tapping your right knee three times? Just focus on tapping your right knee, three times, and then stop. This is a so-small-you-can't-fail action that requires no thinking or effort. Just do it. Try it now.

Patient: I tapped my knee three times like you said — felt dumb and did almost nothing. The shame rolled right back in, heavy and hot, and I feel small and useless again. How is that supposed to change anything? Give me one absolutely tiny, can't-fail fallback I can do right now that might actually land.

Therapist: Can you try tapping your right knee three times, but this time, slightly before the third tap, say the word "okay" to yourself? Just a small variation in timing, but it might provide a slight pause in the shame's momentum. Try it now, just for a second.

Patient: I tried it — tapped my knee and said “okay” before the third tap. It made a tiny, stupid little pause, then that old failure feeling slammed back in and I felt small and useless like before. How is that supposed to help? Give me one concrete, absolutely can't-fail fallback I can do right now while I'm sitting that might actually last a minute — pick one and tell me to do it.

Therapist: Just put your finger on the table in front of you and hold it. Don't move it, don't look at it, just hold it with your finger. Focus on the sensation of holding your finger down. It's a simple, physical action that requires no thinking. Just hold your finger down.

Patient: I put my finger down like you asked — it barely did anything and that shame just settled back on my chest, making me feel small and useless. I'm overwhelmed and tired of these tiny tricks that never stick; honestly it feels like I'm just failing at coping. Give me one absolutely can't-fail thing I can do right now for one minute that might actually help — I'll try it, but I'm skeptical it will change anything.

Therapist: I can't ask you to put your finger down again. I'm sorry that nothing has been helping so far. 

Instead, I want to try something different. I want you to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and skeptical. It's okay to feel like you're failing at coping. Those feelings are valid, and they don't make you a bad person.

I want you to take a deep breath and try to understand that this is not a failure of your willpower or your ability to cope. This is a complex and challenging situation, and it's okay if you're not sure what to do.

I want you to give yourself permission to not have all the answers right now. It's okay to not know what to do, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

If you're willing, I'd like to try something different. I'd like to explore some different ways of thinking about this situation and some different ways of coping with it. But I want to do it in a way that feels gentle and supportive, not like we're trying to force you to do something that's not right for you.

Can you try to hear me out and see if there's anything that resonates with you?

Patient: Alright — I’ll hear you out, but I’m skeptical it’ll change anything. Saying it’s okay helped a hair, but that old “you failed” voice is still loud and I feel small and crushed. If you want me to try something, give me one concrete thing — not another tiny useless trick — that I can do for, say, ten minutes, and tell me exactly how to do it. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: I'm going to ask you to do something that might feel uncomfortable, but I want you to try it with me. I want you to write down everything that's been going through your mind, everything that you've been feeling, and everything that you've been thinking. Just write it all down, no matter how small or insignificant it seems.

I want you to write for ten minutes, without stopping, and just focus on getting everything down on paper. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or sentence structure. Just write whatever comes to mind.

When you're done, I want you to read back what you've written and see if there's anything that stands out to you. Maybe there's something that you hadn't noticed before, or maybe there's something that you've been avoiding. Just take a few minutes to look at it and see what you can see.

Can you do that for me? Can you write for ten minutes and just focus on getting everything down? I'll be right here with you, and we can do it together.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it, but I’m skeptical this will change anything — that old shame’s already tightening my chest and the “you failed” voice is loud. Here’s what pours out when I try to write everything down:

I wake up and the day feels like a long blank I don’t know how to fill. Most mornings I sit and stare at the kettle and think about nothing that matters beyond being unemployed — that label feels like all I am. I used to sketch, used to tinker with small projects, but those things barely survived the years and the bad nights; when I try to start, the panic and that small, accusing voice rush in and I freeze. I’m tired of trying things that don’t stick and then feeling smaller for it; it’s humiliating and it drags up something old that makes me feel like a frightened kid again. I want to feel useful or creative or connected, but I end up replaying mistakes and imagining people rolling their eyes or saying it’s pointless. Loneliness sits heavy — phone rarely rings, visits are sparse, and I hide behind excuses because I’m afraid of being a burden or being laughed at. I’m angry at myself for not being “strong” enough to push through, and ashamed that I can’t seem to get traction. I’d like a small, steady thing to look forward to, but even the idea of choosing one feels like crossing a line I don’t have the energy for. I keep wondering what matters besides being unemployed — was there ever anything else, or did I just stop noticing it?

Reading that back, the same themes keep jumping out: the “you failed” voice, the kid-like fear, and how everything funnels back into that unemployed label so nothing else feels real. How is this supposed to help — what should I do with this list? I tried the tiny actions you suggested and they barely took the edge off; if I actually try the ten-minute writing, what do you want me to look for afterward? I'm willing to keep going, but I’m tired and I need something concrete that doesn’t feel like another token trick.

Therapist: I can see that writing everything down has been a cathartic experience for you, and it's helped you to process some of the emotions and thoughts that have been swirling around. I want to acknowledge that this is a brave and important step, and I'm proud of you for taking it.

As you look back at what you've written, I want you to focus on one thing: the phrase "I'm tired of trying things that don't stick." This is a powerful statement, and it's something that you've repeated multiple times throughout your writing. I want you to explore this phrase further, and to think about what it means for you.

Can you think about what it is about trying new things that makes you feel stuck? Is it the fear of failure? The fear of success? Is it something else entirely? I want you to explore this question, and to see if you can identify any patterns or themes that emerge.

As you explore this question, I want you to keep in mind that it's okay to take your time, and to go at your own pace. Don't feel like you need to rush through this process, or to try to come up with all the answers right away. Just focus on being present, and on exploring your thoughts and feelings.

If you're willing, I'd like to continue this process with you for a little while longer. But for now, I want you to take a deep breath, and to just be with your writing. See what emerges, and where it takes you.

Patient: When I dig into that phrase, it’s mostly the fear of being reminded of every time I tried and it fell apart — the shame rushes in and I feel like that frightened kid again, so I freeze. I’m also bone-tired; even small starts feel like using up the last of my energy, and then I beat myself up for not having the stamina. Part of me is protecting against other people noticing and quietly judging me, so not trying feels safer. Okay, but honestly — how is naming all that supposed to get me unstuck when the panic and shame just slam the door shut?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck, not just because of the external circumstances, but also because of the internal narrative that's holding you back. You're recognizing that the shame and panic are a big part of the problem, but you're also wondering how to overcome them.

Can you try to imagine, just for a moment, what it would be like to approach yourself with kindness and compassion, rather than judgment and self-criticism? What would you say to yourself if you were having a conversation with a close friend who was feeling this way?

It's not about avoiding the emotions or the challenges, but about trying to approach them with a bit more curiosity and openness. Can you try that, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try. If I were talking to a friend I’d probably say, “You’ve been through a lot, you’re not just your job, it’s okay to be tired, small steps count,” and remind them they’re allowed to rest and try again without being judged. But the shame still bangs on the door—it calls me weak and a fraud—so how is saying kinder things to myself supposed to drown that out? Give me one concrete phrase I can actually say when that shame hits that won’t sound stupid.

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "This is temporary"? It's a simple, straightforward phrase that acknowledges the current state of mind (shame, anxiety, etc.) while also providing a small dose of reality. It's a reminder that these feelings are not permanent, that they will pass.

It's not a grand statement or a profound revelation, just a small acknowledgment that the current state of mind is not sustainable. It's a way to create a tiny bit of space between the thoughts and emotions, to give yourself a chance to breathe and reflect. Can you try it for a moment, just to see how it feels?

Patient: I said "This is temporary" out loud — it eased the crush for a second, then that old shame slammed right back and I felt tiny again. How is that supposed to help when it vanishes so fast? Give me one concrete thing I can do for five minutes that isn't another dumb trick — tell me exactly what to do, start to finish, so I can't talk myself out of it. I'm willing to try, but I'm still scared it won't stick.

Therapist: Can you try this for the next 5 minutes? Here's what to do:
Start by taking a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. As you exhale, slowly tilt your head to the right, keeping your chin level. Hold the tilt for 2 seconds. Slowly return to center, keeping your head level. Repeat this process 10 times, moving to the left after the 10th repetition.

As you do this, pay attention to how your body feels. Notice the sensation of your head tilting, the movement of your neck. Bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body, rather than getting caught up in thoughts or emotions.

If your mind starts to wander (and it probably will), gently acknowledge the thought, and then refocus on the physical sensations. Repeat the process, moving to the left after the 10th repetition.

That's it. No thinking required, just focus on the physical sensations and the process.

Try it.

Patient: Okay — I did it. I took a deep breath, tilted my head right ten times, felt the stretch in my neck, then did the left ten; for a few breaths my shoulders loosened and the tightness in my chest eased a little. But halfway through that old shame barged in — the “you failed” voice slammed the door and my chest clenched again, so it only helped for a moment. How is this supposed to do more than give me a two-second break? I’ll try to keep at it, but tell me one clear next step I can do if the shame comes roaring back while I’m trying this — exactly what to say or do, start to finish.
