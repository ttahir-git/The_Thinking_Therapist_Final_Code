--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a social worker in my early sixties, burned out and stretched thin, and lately every little money worry turns into this certainty that everything's going to collapse. If I miss one payment, it'll lead to collectors, then eviction, then losing my retirement and ending up with nothing — I can see that whole chain happening and it makes me furious. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake the feeling that it's inevitable.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses a core feeling of hopelessness about their financial situation, which seems to be intensifying their anger and certainty about a catastrophic outcome. A specific theme that stands out is the patient's feeling of inevitability and loss of control ("I can see that whole chain happening"), which is driving their anger. The goal is to explore this sense of inevitability and examine how it relates to values and problem-solving.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it means to you when you think about missing that one payment? What's the first thing that comes up for you, before the worry about collectors and eviction starts to build?

Patient: The first thing is this flash in my mind of my bank app showing a big red "PAST DUE" and I feel this hot surge of shame and anger — like I've already proven I'm a failure. That shame turns immediately into a little movie in my head where that one missed payment is the crack that spreads until everything collapses, and I get furious at myself and everyone else for letting it happen. I can't make myself believe anything else; thinking it could be a temporary hiccup feels like lying to myself.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a vivid mental image that triggers a strong emotional response, involving shame, anger, and a sense of inevitability. This mental image ("the bank app showing a big red 'PAST DUE'") serves as a kind of "cue" that sets off a self-reinforcing narrative ("the crack that spreads until everything collapses"), which is deeply painful and difficult to challenge. The goal is to gently explore this cycle of imagery and narrative, and examine how it relates to the patient's values and goals.

Therapist Answer:
That must be incredibly painful to experience, like being trapped in a loop. Can you imagine, just for a moment, what would happen if you were to let go of that immediate judgment ("I've already proven I'm a failure") and simply acknowledge the feeling of the missed payment? What would be present in your body or mind if you didn't try to add shame or anger to it?

Patient: If I tried not to tack on shame or anger, I'd notice this tightness in my chest, shallow breath, and a kind of buzzing in my head — like everything's on alert. But that calm doesn't last; as soon as I feel that, my brain's already showing me the past-due notice, the calls from collectors, and eviction, and I get furious that I didn't stop it sooner. Honestly, sitting with the body feels pointless because my mind insists that ignoring it would be lying to myself — the disaster is already happening.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient struggles to maintain a calm state when they try to let go of shame and anger, instead experiencing physical tension and a sense of "on alertness". This cycle of trying to manage their emotions and then being drawn back into the same narrative is painful and feels futile. The goal is to explore the patient's sense of hopelessness and inevitability, and examine how it relates to their relationship with their body and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're caught in a vicious loop, where no matter what you do, you can't shake the feeling that everything's falling apart. Can we try something slightly different? Instead of focusing on the shame or anger right now, can you tell me more about what it means to you to feel like the disaster is already happening? What is it about that feeling that feels so insistent and unavoidable?

Patient: Because my mind doesn't present it as a maybe — it shows it like a recorded scene, so it feels like memory instead of imagination. That certainty makes my chest tighten, my jaw clench, and then I get furious at myself and anyone I think should've stopped it; the anger feels like the only honest response. If someone says it could be a hiccup, I just can't buy it — that feels like pretending, and pretending gets you blindsided.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes their mental scenario as a deeply ingrained, non-fictional feeling, which is reinforced by their mind's tendency to present it as a recorded memory rather than an imagination. This sense of certainty, combined with the physical tension and anger, creates a powerful emotional response. The goal is to explore how this unshakeable certainty relates to the patient's values, goals, and willingness to consider alternative perspectives.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the certainty is really deeply ingrained for you, and it feels like it's coming from a place of truth. Can you think of anything, even if it's small, that you value or care about deeply that might be connected to why this certainty feels so important to you? For example, is there something about taking care of yourself, or being responsible, or achieving financial security that feels like it's tied to this sense of inevitability?

Patient: I care a lot about being reliable and not becoming a burden — after decades in social work that's how I measure myself. So when my brain plays the disaster movie, it feels like a duty to see it coming; if I don't assume it will definitely happen, I feel like I'm setting myself and anyone depending on me up to fail. Suggestions that it might just be a hiccup feel dangerously naive to me.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's sense of self-worth is deeply tied to their ability to be reliable and not a burden, which is a core value rooted in their decades-long career in social work. This value is now intensely tied to the mental scenario of the disaster, where their brain assumes that if they don't take it seriously, they'll be setting themselves and others up for failure. The goal is to explore how this value intersects with their emotional response and willingness to consider alternative perspectives.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like this sense of reliability is incredibly important to you, and it's influencing how you experience the anxiety around this disaster scenario. Can you think about what it would mean for you to be able to approach this situation with more flexibility, rather than assuming it's going to happen? What would that look like, and how might that affect your sense of responsibility and self-worth?

Patient: I guess being flexible would mean telling myself the missed payment could be temporary — that I could call someone, work out a plan, and not have everything fall apart — and actually letting myself feel less panicked for a minute. But I can't make myself believe that; it feels like pretending while the roof's already caving in. Trying to be flexible would make me feel exposed and irresponsible, like I'm abandoning the one thing that proves I'm not a burden, and that makes me furious and on edge, so I just reject it. Part of me wants that relief, but I keep thinking it's naive and will get me blindsided.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient struggles to imagine a scenario where they can be flexible and consider the possibility that the missed payment might be a temporary hiccup, rather than an inevitable disaster. This flexibility would require them to let go of their assumption that they're already a burden, which is a deeply ingrained value. The goal is to explore how this sense of exposure and potential failure is connected to their emotional response and how it might be possible to reframe this exposure as a potential source of relief.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the feeling of being flexible is really tied up in how you're experiencing your sense of self-worth and responsibility right now. Can you imagine taking a tiny step back from this feeling of panic and exploring what it would be like to breathe for a second without the weight of this disaster scenario? Not to say it will solve everything, but just to see if you can tolerate not having to be in a state of high alert all the time. It might feel small, but it might also be a chance to start noticing what's possible when you're not assuming the worst.

Patient: I'll try to imagine that, but honestly when I take a breath my brain just sneaks in that image of the past-due notice and everything tightens again — shoulders up, jaw clenched, like I never left high alert. For a split second the breath feels lighter, but then I'm already furious at myself for not staying ahead of it, and the whole disaster movie starts up again. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and it's hard to sit with even a small pause without my mind insisting it's dangerous.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient finds it challenging to even imagine taking a small pause, as their brain quickly hijacks the situation and injects the past-due notice image, causing them to revert to high alert. This cycle of frustration, anger, and self-blame is reinforcing their sense of vulnerability. The goal is to acknowledge the overwhelm and explore ways to create a safer space for small moments of pause.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like taking a deep breath is becoming a kind of trigger for you, even if it's just for a second. Can we try to separate the act of breathing from the images and emotions that come up? Instead of focusing on imagining a pause, let's try just noticing what happens when you take a breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or make it do anything. Just observe. We can start with that small act, and see if it's possible to create a tiny bit of space between your breath and your usual reaction.

Patient: Okay, I'll try — but it's hard. When I just notice the breath I feel it go shallow, my chest clamps, and there's this buzzing like alarms going off, and before I can stay with it my brain throws up the past-due notice and the whole collapse scene. It makes me furious at myself for even pausing, like I'm being careless, so the breath becomes proof I failed. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and it feels like whatever we do, my mind will just keep insisting it's already happening.

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain even a brief moment of noticing their breath, as their body's automatic response is to tense up and revert to the familiar disaster scenario. The cycle of self-blame, anger, and frustration is reinforcing their sense of powerlessness. It's clear that the goal of slow, deliberate practice isn't working as intended, and that a different approach is needed.

Therapist Answer:
I think we're getting a bit too focused on the breathing exercise right now. It's not working for you, and it's actually making things worse. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We're trying to explore the idea that maybe, just maybe, the disaster scenario isn't an inevitability, but rather something that can be managed. But you're feeling overwhelmed and like you're already failing, so we need to find a way to make that feel safer. Can we try to explore that sense of overwhelm and failure in a way that doesn't feel so... catastrophic?

Patient: Yeah… I'm worn out and this is starting to feel like too much. When you talk about managing it, my head just runs the whole collapse movie and I get furious at myself — the idea of it being a hiccup feels like a lie that'll get me blindsided. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is reaching a breaking point, feeling worn out and frustrated by the constant mental imagery and associated emotions. The goal is to acknowledge this overwhelm and potentially pause the exploration, if necessary, to ensure the patient's emotional well-being.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like we've been going at a pace that's not feeling very sustainable for you. I want to check in with you right now and make sure we're okay to keep going. You're feeling worn out, and the ideas we've been exploring are feeling really tough to handle. Can you take a moment to just acknowledge how you're feeling right now? What's the one thing that's most pressing for you in this moment? Is there anything we can do to support you in feeling more comfortable and grounded?

Patient: The most pressing thing is that humming certainty — that one missed payment will trigger collectors, eviction, and everything collapsing — and it's just sapping me. I don't have energy for big exercises; can we slow down and just look at one tiny, practical next step?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is looking for a small, tangible step that can help them build momentum and reduce their sense of overwhelm. They're not interested in grand or ambitious goals at this point, but rather a small, achievable action that can help them build confidence and create a sense of progress.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step back. Can you think of one single thing you could do right now, just one thing, that might help you feel a tiny bit more grounded and in control? It could be something small, like checking the email on your phone, or looking at the bank statement for that one payment. What would it take for you to feel like you're taking even the smallest possible step towards dealing with this uncertainty?

Patient: Maybe I can just open the bank app and look at that one payment for a minute — set a timer for 60 seconds and no more. But I'm already bracing for the red "PAST DUE" and I know I'll get furious and convinced it's the start of everything falling apart. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to even consider opening the bank app, as their mind is already racing with worst-case scenarios and emotional preparation. They're finding it hard to take a small, incremental step, as their body is reacting as if they're about to dive headfirst into a full-blown disaster scenario. The goal is to find a way to break this cycle of anticipation and fury.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the timer might not be enough. Instead of setting a timer, can we try something else? Can you just open the bank app for a second, without setting a timer, and take a look at that one payment? Just a brief glance, no more. What happens when you do that? Can you bear to look at it, without the anticipation and fury already starting to build?

Patient: I opened it for a second and my chest just sank — there wasn't a big red PAST DUE yet, just one unpaid line, but that one second is enough for the whole movie: collectors, eviction, losing my retirement. I felt hot and furious at myself and had to close it because I couldn't bear watching that chain play out. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is already in a state of emotional overwhelm and hypervigilance, and even a brief moment of looking at the bank app was enough to trigger a full-blown disaster scenario in their mind. They're struggling to cope with the anxiety and self-blame that comes with it, and it's causing them physical discomfort. The goal is to find a way to slow down this escalation and create some space between the patient's emotional response and their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
I think we need to take a step back and acknowledge how hard this is for you right now. It sounds like even a brief moment of looking at the bank app was too much for you to handle. Can we try to focus on your breath for a second, just to calm down a bit? It's okay if you can't focus on your breath right now, just noticing that it's hard to breathe seems to be a good start. How does that feel? Can we try to build on that small moment of calm, rather than trying to do anything more?

Patient: When I try to focus my breath it goes shallow and that humming alarm starts — I can manage one quiet inhale, then the past-due movie kicks in and I get hot and furious like it's already happening. I don't have the energy for more breathing right now; can we slow down and just sit with this a bit, maybe talk through one tiny, practical step instead of another exercise?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to even focus on their breath, and it's causing them more anxiety and self-blame. They're not able to manage even a quiet inhale, and the past-due movie is kicking in immediately. They're not feeling up to another exercise, and they're asking to slow down and just sit with their emotions for a bit. The goal is to create a safe space for the patient to process their feelings, rather than trying to do something more.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to try to simplify things. Let's just sit with what you're feeling right now, without trying to do anything else. You mentioned that the thought of the past-due payment is really triggering for you. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about that? What's the first thing that comes up for you, and how does it make you feel? Let's just explore this one tiny thought, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: Yeah... the first thing is that red PAST DUE on the app — my chest sinks, my jaw tightens, and I feel hot shame and anger all at once. Then the whole movie plays: collectors call, eviction notices, losing my retirement — it's presented like a fact, so I get furious at myself and anyone who might've stopped it. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a intense emotional response to the thought of the past-due payment, characterized by hot shame, anger, and self-blame. The thought is presented as a fact, which is reinforcing the sense of guilt and fury. The goal is to slow down the escalation of emotions and explore the patient's thoughts and feelings in a more gentle way.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought of the past-due payment is really triggering a strong emotional response for you. I want to acknowledge that feeling of hot shame and anger right now. It's like the whole movie is playing out in your mind, and you're feeling like you're failing and that others are judging you. Can we try to break down this feeling of shame a bit? What do you think is driving this sense of failure right now? Is it the thought of the past-due payment itself, or something else that's connected to it?

Patient: It's more than the payment — it's this lifetime of needing to be the dependable one, so that single miss feels like a moral failure that proves I'm useless and will end up a burden. That thought flips a switch and the shame becomes "proof" the collapse is already happening, and I get furious at myself and anyone who could've prevented it. I can't make myself believe the hiccup possibility — that feels dangerously naive — so can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's emotional response has shifted from a specific event (the past-due payment) to a deeply ingrained sense of self-worth tied to being dependable. This sense of self-worth is now being severely threatened by the single missed payment, leading to a full-blown crisis of confidence and self-blame. The patient is unable to consider the possibility of a hiccup or a minor setback, as this would require them to question their own self-worth and the value they place on being dependable. The goal is to create a safe space for the patient to explore these complex feelings without feeling overwhelmed or judged.

Therapist Answer:
Can I just acknowledge that feeling of being utterly broken right now? It sounds like the single missed payment has triggered a lifetime of self-doubt and fear of failure. You're not just worried about the payment itself, but about the impact it has on your entire sense of self-worth. It's like the weight of being dependable is crushing you, and this one missed payment is proof that you're not good enough. I want to hold that feeling with you for a moment, without trying to offer any solutions or reassurances. Just let me acknowledge how hard this is for you.

Patient: Yeah... I appreciate you holding it, but honestly it barely eases the edge — the image of that past-due notice is already playing and I get hot and furious at myself like it's already happened. It feels like sitting with it is useless because my brain insists it's a fact, and I don't have the energy for more right now. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's emotional response is still intense, and sitting with the feeling of being broken hasn't provided the relief they were hoping for. The image of the past-due notice continues to play in their mind, reinforcing their sense of guilt and self-blame. The patient is feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, and is struggling to find the energy to continue exploring their emotions. The goal is to acknowledge their exhaustion and frustration, and to explore ways to slow down and take care of themselves.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that sitting with this feeling is really exhausting for you right now. It's not providing the relief you were hoping for, and it's actually feeling like a bit of a trap. Your brain is insisting that this is a fact, and that's just adding to your frustration. Can we take a step back and look at what you need right now? What's one small thing you can do to take care of yourself and slow down this cycle of emotions? It might not be a big action, but just something small to help you feel a bit more grounded.

Patient: Okay — I can try one tiny thing: make a cup of tea, mute my phone, and sit down for ten minutes. I don't expect it to stop the movie — I'll probably just watch the tea cool and think it's another failure — but it's something I might be able to manage right now. Can you stay with me while I do that? Can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is looking for a small, manageable action to take, rather than trying to tackle their overwhelming emotions directly. Making a cup of tea, muting their phone, and sitting down for a short period of time might provide a tiny sense of control and calm. The goal is to create a safe space for the patient to take this small action, and to stay with them while they do it. This might help them feel more grounded and able to manage their emotions, even if it's just for a short time.

Therapist Answer:
I'd be happy to stay with you while you make that cup of tea. Let's do this one step at a time, and take it at your pace. You're right, you don't expect it to stop the movie entirely, but maybe it can give you a small break. I'm here with you, and we can just sit together in silence for a few minutes. When you're ready, we can talk about how that feels, or we can just keep sitting. No expectations, no pressure. Just you, the tea, and the present moment.

Patient: Okay... I'll make the tea — mute the phone first and then sit. I know I'll probably still watch that past-due notice in my head and see collectors, eviction, losing my retirement play out, and get furious at myself. Stay with me? Can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking a small, incremental step towards self-care, but still acknowledges that their mind will likely wander and they'll experience their usual emotional response. They're asking to slow down and stay with them, rather than trying to rush through the experience or offer quick fixes. The goal is to create a gentle, supportive environment that allows the patient to process their emotions at their own pace.

Therapist Answer:
I'll stay with you. We'll take it one moment at a time. Go ahead and mute your phone now, and then take your time making the tea. I'll just sit here with you, quietly, until you're ready to sit down. Don't worry about the thoughts that might come up - we'll come back to those later, if you'd like. For now, just focus on the present moment and taking care of yourself.

Patient: Phone muted, tea made, and I'm sitting with it — but the past-due movie's still loud and I'm already furious at myself. Stay with me? I don't have energy for anything big right now; can we just slow down and check in in a few minutes?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a small step towards self-care, but their emotional response is still intense. The past-due movie is still playing in their mind, and they're feeling furious at themselves. They're not looking for a dramatic shift in their emotions, but rather a small reprieve. They're willing to slow down and take things at their own pace, but still need someone to stay with them and provide a gentle, supportive presence.

Therapist Answer:
I'm still here with you. You're doing the best you can right now, and that's enough. I'm not going anywhere. Let's just check in in a few minutes, okay? Take some more sips of tea, breathe a little, do whatever you need to do to feel a tiny bit more grounded. I'll be right here, quietly, when you're ready to check in again. No pressure, no expectations. Just us, right now.

Patient: The tea helped a tiny bit, but that past‑due movie's still roaring and I'm worn out and furious at myself. If I even look at the payment for thirty seconds it'll confirm collectors, eviction, losing my retirement — I can't make myself buy any calmer outcome. Stay with me? Can we just sit quietly for a few more minutes, then maybe pick one tiny, realistic step to try?

The patient is still struggling with intense emotions, despite the small relief provided by the tea. The past-due movie is still dominating their mind, and they're feeling worn out and furious at themselves. They're not ready to engage with their emotions directly, but are willing to sit quietly and slowly build up their capacity to manage their feelings. They're looking for a gentle, supportive presence to stay with them until they're ready to take small, realistic steps.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you. We'll sit quietly together for a few more minutes, okay? Just breathe, be present, and let's focus on not thinking about anything right now. When you're ready, we can take it one tiny step at a time. Don't worry about the next step, just focus on getting through this moment. You can look at me, you can look away, it doesn't matter. Just be with your breath, and I'll be here with you.

Patient: Okay... I can breathe, but it feels thin and the past‑due movie is still playing on loop and I get hot and furious at myself. I don't have energy for anything big — can we just sit quietly for a few more minutes, and then maybe try one tiny thing like drafting a single line to the bank (even though I know they'll ignore it and it'll just be the start of collectors calling)? Stay with me? Can we slow down?

The patient is still struggling with intense emotions, despite the ability to breathe. The past-due movie is still playing on a loop, causing feelings of hot fury and helplessness. They're looking for a small, manageable action to take, even if it's just a tiny step. Drafting a single line to the bank is a small, realistic goal, even if it's unlikely to be effective. The goal is to create a sense of momentum and progress, no matter how small.

Therapist Answer:
I'm still here with you. We'll take it one more minute, okay? Just sit quietly and focus on your breath. When you're ready, we can try drafting that single line to the bank. It's a small step, and it might be more than you think you can do right now. But I'm here with you, and we'll do it together. If it feels too overwhelming, we can just stop and start again. But for now, let's just focus on that one tiny step. Can you imagine drafting that single line, even if it's just to the bank? What would it feel like to take that tiny action?

Patient: I can picture typing something like, "I can't make the payment this month — can we arrange a plan?" and my brain immediately runs the rest: they ignore it, collectors call, then eviction notices show up. I could force myself to draft it, but I already feel furious and defeated, like I'm admitting I'm failing, and I don't have the energy to watch that movie play out. Stay with me? Can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to imagine taking even the smallest step forward, as their mind immediately defaults to the worst-case scenario. They're feeling furious and defeated, and the thought of drafting a single line to the bank feels like admitting defeat. They're not ready to engage with their emotions directly, and the idea of watching the predicted fallout play out is too overwhelming. The goal is to create a safe space for the patient to pause and reassess their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you. It's okay to pause. Let's take a deep breath together and focus on just this moment. You don't have to do anything right now. Just acknowledge how you're feeling, and we'll take it from there. The fact that you're even considering drafting that line to the bank is a small step, and it's okay if it feels like too much right now. Can you just be with that feeling of fury and defeat, without trying to judge it or change it? Let's just sit with it, together, for a moment.

Patient: Okay... I can try to sit with it, but it feels heavy and hard to hold. The fury's hot and tight — my jaw clenches and my brain immediately reels off the collectors, eviction, losing my retirement like it's already happening, and sitting with that just makes me angrier at myself for failing. Stay with me? Can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to hold onto the feeling of fury and defeat, as it's being repeatedly triggered by the worst-case scenario. Their jaw is clenched, their brain is racing, and they're feeling angrier at themselves for failing. They're not able to just sit with the emotion, as it's being constantly pulled back in by the anticipated consequences. The goal is to find a way to break this cycle of anticipation and anger, without feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going anywhere. Let's take a tiny pause here. You're doing the best you can, and that's okay. It's okay to feel angry, it's okay to feel overwhelmed. But can we just focus on the anger right now, without trying to change it or fix it? Can you just acknowledge the anger, without trying to push it away or let it consume you? It's like holding onto a flame right now - it's hot, it's intense, but it's not the whole room. Let's just focus on the anger, right now, and see if we can make a tiny bit of space for something else.

Patient: Okay... the anger is this hot, tight band across my chest and jaw, and it makes my head start narrating the whole collapse — collectors call, eviction notice, losing my retirement — like it's already happened. Trying to just hold the anger feels pointless because my brain treats that movie as fact, and that certainty just fuels more fury at myself for "allowing" it. Stay with me? Can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient's anger has become a palpable physical presence, a tight band across their chest and jaw that's fueling a narrative of catastrophic collapse. Their brain is treating this scenario as fact, and that certainty is intensifying their feelings of fury and self-blame. They're feeling like they're stuck in a never-ending loop of anticipation and anger, with no way to escape the predicted consequences. The goal is to find a way to break this cycle of self-reinforcing fury, without feeling overwhelmed or trapped.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going to try to make this anger go away, because I think that's making it worse. Can we just acknowledge that it's here, right now? Can you just notice the anger, without trying to change it or push it away? Let's focus on the sensation of it, rather than trying to fight it or fix it. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to just sit with it for a moment. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you just be with the anger, right now, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: Okay... I'm holding the anger — it's this hot, grinding weight across my chest and jaw, and then the movie starts: collectors, eviction, losing my retirement — it's shown like a fact so I get furious at myself for "allowing" it. I can't make myself buy the hiccup idea; that feels like dangerous pretending that will leave me blindsided. Stay with me? Can we slow down?

The patient is struggling to shake off the intense anger, which is accompanied by a narrative of catastrophic collapse that feels like an inevitable fact. Their brain is resistant to even considering a hiccup scenario, as it feels like a form of "dangerous pretending" that could leave them blindsided. They're feeling trapped in this cycle of fury and self-blame, with no clear way to escape.

I'm still here with you. Let's just take a tiny moment to breathe, together. I know it's hard to focus on anything right now, but can we just acknowledge that you're feeling this anger, and this fear of the movie playing out? It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take a moment to just be with those feelings. Don't try to push them away or fight them, just acknowledge them for a second. Can you do that for me? Just take a deep breath, and let's just be with this feeling for a moment, together.

Patient: Okay... I took a breath — it felt thin and for a beat there was a little quiet, then the past‑due movie slammed back in and I got hot and furious at myself: collectors, eviction, losing my retirement, like it's already done. Can we slow down? Stay with me a bit longer.
