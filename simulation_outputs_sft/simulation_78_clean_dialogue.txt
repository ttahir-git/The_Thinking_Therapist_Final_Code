Patient: I've been feeling really anxious in social situations lately, so I've been avoiding gatherings with friends and mostly keeping to myself. It's been worse since my children moved out — I guess I feel kind of lost and don't have much support. I don't know, it's awkward to say, but it's starting to get in the way of my art and my days.

Therapist: You're sharing about the feeling of being lost and unsupported after your children left the house. Core emotion is a sense of loss and possibly loneliness. Goal: Explore the sense of being lost and its impact on daily life and relationships more deeply.


Can you tell me more about what happens when you think about going to a social gathering or meeting up with friends? What specifically makes you feel anxious or uncomfortable in those situations? Is it the interaction with others, the pressure to perform or talk about things, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know…when I think about going, my chest gets tight and my mind just goes blank — I start rehearsing things to say and then feel like I'm failing at it. I guess it's mostly the pressure to perform, worrying people will notice I'm awkward or lonely, and that the small talk will feel impossible. I try not to be around too long because it drains me, so I just avoid it.
