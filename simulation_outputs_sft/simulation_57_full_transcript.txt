--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been caught in a pattern of using alcohol to blunt the uncomfortable parts of my depression — not a full-blown addiction, but steady enough to be worrying. I'm unemployed and pretty isolated, and I tend to intellectualize things, so I talk about my feelings more than I actually feel them. I'm here because I want to understand why I default to numbing instead of engaging with the discomfort.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of their use of alcohol to cope with depression, describes it as a "pattern" and not an addiction, but still finds it worrying. They mention being unemployed and isolated, which could contribute to their emotional state. Their tendency to intellectualize their feelings is also a relevant aspect of their emotional experience. Goal: Explore the psychological function of this avoidance strategy to identify the underlying values or processes that drive this behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you do start to feel uncomfortable with your depression? What is it about those feelings that makes you reach for alcohol, even if it's just to "blunt" them?
 
This question aims to help the patient identify the immediate triggers and emotional responses that lead to their avoidance strategy, allowing them to explore the underlying values or processes that drive this behavior.

Patient: When the discomfort starts it usually shows up as a physical constriction and an almost immediate cascade of self-critique about being unemployed and useless, which my mind then amplifies into a rehearsed catastrophe. I tend to reframe those sensations as physiological arousal and risk-signals, and my pragmatic brain quickly appraises alcohol as an efficient hedonic dampener — predictable, controllable, and private. So I ritualize the drink to short-circuit the feeling: it numbs the intensity enough that I don't have to be vulnerable or actually sit with the sadness.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has a clear description of their experience, noting the physical constriction and self-criticism that follow when they start to feel uncomfortable, as well as their tendency to amplify these feelings into a catastrophic scenario. They also discuss their tendency to reinterpret these sensations as physiological arousal and risk signals, which in turn leads them to appraise alcohol as a means to dampen the hedonic impact of their negative emotions. The goal is to explore how this avoidance strategy relates to their core values and how it affects their willingness to engage with their emotions. Goal: Examine the values that drive the need for this avoidance and assess their potential impact on the therapeutic process.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're using alcohol as a way to avoid feeling the full weight of your depression, which is understandable given the intensity of those feelings. However, I want to gently explore whether this avoidance might be connected to something more fundamental, such as a value that you're not fully expressing or acknowledging. Can you tell me more about what's at stake for you when you feel this way? What is it about being unemployed and feeling "useless" that's so hard for you to accept or move past?
 
This question aims to help the patient consider whether their avoidance strategy might be driven by deeper values or unacknowledged aspects of themselves, rather than just their immediate emotional pain. By exploring what's at stake for them, the therapist can better understand how this avoidance is impacting their willingness to engage with their emotions.

Patient: On a conceptual level, what's at stake for me is my sense of competence, autonomy, and social utility—those are the metrics I use to judge myself, and unemployment systematically degrades them. Practically, that erosion gets narrated in my head as impending obsolescence and shame, which feels intolerable because it undermines my identity as someone who can manage their life. Alcohol functions as a tactical maneuver: it blunts the sting, preserves a semblance of control, and spares me from the indignity of needing help or feeling small. I can lay out that logic pretty neatly, but when you ask what it actually feels like, I notice I default to analysis—probably because actually sitting with shame or helplessness feels unsafe and destabilizing.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has a clear understanding of what's at stake for them, linking their sense of competence, autonomy, and social utility to their self-worth and identity. They describe how unemployment leads to feelings of impending obsolescence and shame, which are narrated internally as a degradation of their ability to manage their life. The goal is to explore how this narrative is maintained and what it reveals about the patient's avoidance strategy. Goal: Examine the role of defusion in the therapeutic relationship and how it might help the patient explore their emotional experience beyond analysis.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to share this level of vulnerability, and I appreciate your willingness to explore this further. I want to gently suggest that exploring these feelings in a way that's different from analysis might be helpful. Instead of trying to analyze the shame or helplessness, let's try to create some space to simply notice how it feels in your body right now, without trying to understand it or change it. Can you try paying attention to your physical sensations when I say the word "shame"?
 
This question aims to help the patient explore their emotional experience through defusion, rather than analysis. By creating space to simply notice their physical sensations, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. When you say "shame" there's a tight, pressing weight across my chest and my throat feels oddly dry, like I want to swallow the feeling away; my hands go cool and my jaw clenches. Almost immediately my mind re-categorizes it — autonomic arousal, social-threat appraisal — and I start diagramming why it's happening instead of staying with the raw sensation. I'm trying to stay with it, but I can already feel the impulse to intellectualize as a safer route.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making an effort to stay with the physical sensations associated with shame, but their mind is already trying to re-categorize and intellectualize the experience. This is a common pattern, where the avoidance strategy kicks in to prevent feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Explore how to support the patient in maintaining a brief, non-intellectualized connection with their physical sensations, even if it's just for a moment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're doing the best you can to stay with the physical sensations, but it's clear that your mind is pulling you back into analysis. I want to suggest something simple: can you try just noticing the sensation of your throat drying out, without trying to understand it or change it? Just notice it, without judgment or commentary. Let's focus on that small sensation right now.
 
Notice how I'm not asking you to do anything more than that. Just notice the sensation, and then we can come back to it later. For now, let's just stay with that sensation for a brief moment.
 
This question aims to support the patient in maintaining a brief, non-intellectualized connection with their physical sensations. By focusing on the sensation itself, rather than trying to understand it, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying—there's a dry tightness in my throat, like a small lump, and my breathing just shortens a bit. But before I can just notice it my brain starts cataloguing it — autonomic arousal, shame-trigger, little red flag that usually cues the drink as a fix. Can we slow down? I want to stay with it but I'm getting an urge to intellectualize or numb, and that's making it hard to actually feel.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble staying with the physical sensations, as their mind tries to re-categorize and intellectualize the experience. This is a common challenge in defusion. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-intrusive way to help the patient slow down and maintain a brief connection with their physical sensations, without putting too much pressure on them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a gentle pause. I'm going to pause for a moment, and when I do, I want you to just notice the silence. Not think about anything, just notice the silence. Let's just sit with the silence for a second, and then we'll see where it takes us.
 
This question aims to introduce a gentle pause to help the patient slow down and maintain a brief connection with their physical sensations. By focusing on the silence, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies. The goal is to create a non-intrusive, low-pressure environment that allows the patient to explore their experience without feeling overwhelmed.

Patient: Okay — the silence feels conspicuously loud, like a vacuum my mind rushes to fill with failure-scenarios. My throat tightens, breathing gets shallow, and I catch myself narrating — "autonomic arousal, social-threat, cue for the drink" — instead of actually staying with the lump. I want to try, but the urge to intellectualize or reach for alcohol is strong; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to maintain a connection with their physical sensations, as their mind tries to re-categorize and intellectualize the experience. The goal is to create a gentle, non-intrusive space for the patient to explore their sensations without feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Continue to slow down the pace and explore the patient's experience in a non-judgmental way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another pause, just like before. But this time, I want you to try something different. As you notice the lump in your throat, I want you to ask yourself one simple question: "Is this sensation here right now?" Just that one question. Is this lump in your throat here right now? No thinking, no labeling, no anything else. Just that one simple question.
 
Notice how I'm not asking you to do anything more than that. Just ask the question, and see what happens. We'll take it from there.
 
This question aims to slow down the pace and encourage the patient to focus on their physical sensations without intellectualizing them. By asking a simple, non-judgmental question, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies.

Patient: Yes — it's there: a tight, dry lump in my throat and my breathing's a bit clipped. But even as I notice it, my mind starts dissecting whether it's a "real" sensation or just the conditioned cue for the drink; I'm trying to stay with it, and it's harder than I thought—can we slow down and sit with it a little longer?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining a connection with their physical sensations, as their mind continues to intellectualize and dissect the experience. The goal is to create a gentle, non-intrusive space for the patient to explore their sensations without feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Continue to slow down the pace and explore the patient's experience in a non-judgmental way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together. Just breathe. In... out... breathe. Don't think about it, don't try to do anything with it. Just breathe. When you're ready, we can start again. But for now, just focus on the breath.

Notice how I'm not asking you to do anything more than that. Just breathe, and let's see what happens.

This question aims to slow down the pace and encourage the patient to focus on the breath, rather than their intellectualized thoughts. By using a non-intrusive and calming approach, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies.

Patient: Okay — breathing in... out... My breath is shallow at first, then a little deeper; my shoulders loosen a touch but the lump in my throat is still there and my heart feels a bit quick. I can already feel the reflex to rename it — "anxiety cue" — and to justify a drink as a solution, which is frustrating. Can we stay with this a bit longer? I'm skeptical this will change anything, but I want to try.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is showing a glimmer of awareness and acceptance of their physical sensations, which is a promising development. However, they are also struggling with the familiar reflexes and justifications that have been holding them back. The goal is to gently encourage the patient to explore these sensations without judgment, rather than getting caught up in their usual avoidance strategies. Goal: Explore the patient's skepticism and frustration with the process, and see if we can gently reframe their thinking.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're skeptical, and that's okay. It's natural to wonder if this is just going to be another pointless exercise. But I want to gently ask you to try something: what if, instead of trying to change this sensation or justify a drink, you simply acknowledged it as it is? Not judged it, not labeled it, just acknowledged it. Just the simple act of noticing it, without trying to do anything with it. Can you try that?

This question aims to gently encourage the patient to explore their skepticism and frustration, rather than getting caught up in their usual avoidance strategies. By reframing their thinking and encouraging them to simply acknowledge their sensations, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater awareness of their emotions and potentially reduce their reliance on avoidance strategies.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "just acknowledging" this supposed to help in practice? It feels like a mindfulness aphorism to my pragmatic side; I want a mechanism, not a slogan—if I notice the lump, won't the conditioned cue still prime the drink? I can describe the sensation and my urge to intellectualize, but I need something more concrete that interrupts the habitual sequence.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a desire for a more concrete and actionable strategy, rather than just a mantra or slogan. They are highlighting the importance of interrupting the habitual sequence, rather than just acknowledging the sensation. The goal is to explore ways to create a more concrete and interruptive process, rather than just relying on awareness and acceptance. Goal: Introduce a more concrete and interruptive process, while still being mindful of the patient's skepticism and frustration.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your desire for a more concrete approach. Let's try something that might interrupt the habitual sequence. When you notice the lump in your throat, I want you to take a small physical action. Just one action. For example, you could touch your finger to your thumb, or press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Not a big deal, just a small physical action. The goal is to create a slight disturbance in your physical state, which might interrupt the conditioned cue and make it harder for you to justify the drink.

This question aims to introduce a more concrete and interruptive process, while still being mindful of the patient's skepticism and frustration. By introducing a small physical action, the therapist is hoping to create a slight disturbance in the patient's physical state, which might interrupt the habitual sequence and make it harder for the patient to justify the drink.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the finger-to-thumb. (Doing it now.) It is surprisingly banal and slightly grounding; the lump in my throat eases a fraction and my breath lengthens a hair. But even as I notice that, my analytic mind is cataloguing it as a micro-interruption — a brief perturbation of the conditioned sequence — and I'm skeptical about durability: if the cue intensifies, won't the compensatory narrative and the urge to drink just reassert itself? What would you suggest if the urge persists after this kind of interruption?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having a nuanced and realistic conversation with their own mind, acknowledging the potential limitations of a single micro-interruption and the likelihood of the conditioned sequence reasserting itself. This level of self-awareness is encouraging, but also highlights the need for a more robust and sustainable approach. The goal is to explore strategies that can help build resilience and reduce the reliance on compensatory narratives. Goal: Discuss potential strategies for building resilience and reducing compensatory narratives, while acknowledging the patient's skepticism and expertise.

Therapist Answer:
Your skepticism is well-founded, and it's great that you're thinking critically about this. If the urge persists, I'd suggest exploring ways to increase the durability of the micro-interruptions. One approach could be to increase the physical intensity of the action, or to combine it with other techniques. For example, you could try taking a few deep breaths before touching your finger to your thumb, or doing a brief body scan while you're doing the action. The goal is to create a stronger sense of physical discomfort or distraction, which can make it harder for the conditioned sequence to reassert itself.

It's also worth exploring ways to reduce the reliance on compensatory narratives. Can you think of any ways to challenge or reframe the "micro-interruption" narrative that's arising in your mind? For example, can you try to see this moment as a genuine opportunity for change, rather than just a brief perturbation in the conditioned sequence? By exploring these questions, we can work together to build a more robust and sustainable approach to managing the urge to drink.

Patient: That framework makes sense to me in the abstract — I can reconceptualize the moment as an opportunity for a behavioral interrupt — but I still default to analysis when the affect intensifies. Concretely, a few strategies feel practicable: an implementation-intention script ("If I notice the lump/urge, I will take 3 deep breaths, press finger to thumb, and drink a glass of seltzer"), a 15‑minute delay rule with a pre-planned distraction (call one designated person or do a 10‑minute crossword), and some environmental scaffolding (keep less/no alcohol at home, have nonalcoholic substitutes handy). I can also track urges in a simple log so we can spot patterns and optimize interventions. I'm skeptical about my follow-through when the sensation peaks — can we role-play one of these "if‑then" scripts now and pick one or two things that feel realistic for me to try this week?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified concrete strategies that align with the ACT framework and is willing to try them. They are also aware of their skepticism and tendency to default to analysis when the affect intensifies. The goal is to create a realistic and actionable plan that takes into account the patient's goals, values, and strengths. Goal: Develop a realistic plan for the patient to try this week, focusing on one or two strategies that feel most promising.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with the implementation-intention script. Can you tell me what you'd like to say to yourself when you notice the lump or urge to drink? For example, what would you say to remind yourself to take the 3 deep breaths, press your finger to thumb, and drink a glass of seltzer?

Let's try a simple example. Imagine you're sitting in a quiet room, and you notice the lump in your throat or the urge to drink. You take a deep breath in, and then you say to yourself: "Okay, I'm noticing the urge to drink. I'm going to take 3 deep breaths, press my finger to thumb, and drink a glass of seltzer. That's my plan for now." How does that feel?

We can also explore the 15-minute delay rule or the environmental scaffolding together. But let's start with this implementation-intention script and see how it goes for you this week. Can you commit to trying it out for at least one day, and then we can reassess and adjust as needed?

Patient: Alright—I can say that to myself, though I'm a bit jittery and distracted right now. A concise script that feels usable to me would be: "Okay, I'm noticing the urge to drink. I will take three slow breaths, press my finger to my thumb, and drink a glass of seltzer." I can commit to trying it for a day, but I'm skeptical about follow-through when the urge spikes—can we role-play that scenario now and also plan a secondary micro-action if the urge persists after those steps?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a concise and usable script for themselves, which is a great step forward. However, they are still concerned about their ability to follow through when the urge spikes. The goal is to develop a plan for handling such situations, including a secondary micro-action to help build resilience. Goal: Role-play a scenario where the urge spikes, and plan a secondary micro-action to help the patient manage the situation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's role-play a scenario where the urge spikes. Imagine you're at a party, and you've had a few drinks. Suddenly, you start feeling a strong urge to grab a drink to calm down. You take a deep breath in, and say to yourself: "Okay, I'm noticing the urge to drink. I will take three slow breaths, press my finger to my thumb, and drink a glass of seltzer."

As you're taking those breaths and pressing your finger to your thumb, you start to feel a bit better. But then, the urge spikes again, and you're tempted to grab a drink. What do you do next? What secondary micro-action can you take to help manage the situation?

For example, you could say to yourself: "Okay, the urge is still here. I'm going to take a quick glance around the room and notice five things that are not related to drinking. That's my plan for now." Or you could say: "I'm feeling a bit frustrated that I'm still struggling with this urge. I'm going to take a short break and do something else for a minute, like going for a short walk or doing a few jumping jacks." What would you like to say to yourself in this situation?

Patient: Okay. If the urge spikes after the breaths/finger‑to‑thumb, my backup script would be: "Okay, urge's here — I'm going outside for five minutes, I’ll sip seltzer, take five slow breaths, and call Mark/text if I need a voice." If that still nags, I’ll do the five‑thing grounding (name five things I can see) while holding the seltzer in my non‑dominant hand so I’m not reaching for alcohol. This is a bit effortful to picture, but it feels doable — can we role‑play the outside/grounding bit now?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has a clear backup script to help manage the urge when it spikes, and they're willing to role-play it to solidify the plan. The goal is to simulate the outside scenario and the grounding technique, and make any necessary adjustments to the patient's plan. Goal: Role-play the outside/grounding scenario to help the patient feel more confident and prepared.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go outside and role-play the scenario. Imagine you're standing outside, feeling the fresh air on your face. You take a deep breath in, and say to yourself: "Okay, I'm outside for five minutes. I will sip seltzer, take five slow breaths, and call Mark/text if I need a voice."

As you sip your seltzer, you start to feel a bit better. But then, you notice that the urge is still there, and you're tempted to grab the seltzer and drink more. You take a deep breath in, and say to yourself: "Okay, the urge is still here. I'm going to do the five-thing grounding exercise."

You look around you and name five things you can see. "I see the tree, the car, the bench, the bird on the branch, and the sun shining through the leaves." You continue to take slow breaths, feeling the seltzer in your hand, and focusing on the sensations in your body.

As you're doing this, you notice that the urge is starting to fade away. You're feeling more calm and centered. How does that feel? Does it feel like a realistic and achievable plan?

Patient: It feels workable in theory — concrete enough that I could try it. But I'm anxious the moment the chest-tightening hits; my brain goes scattered and the plan feels distant, so I worry I won't follow through. This is already a bit effortful to picture — can we role‑play the call to Mark and rehearse the exact words I’d use?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing anxiety about following through with the plan, especially when the chest-tightening hits. They're also feeling some discomfort about rehearsing the exact words to call Mark. The goal is to address the anxiety and discomfort in a supportive way, while also helping the patient build confidence in their plan. Goal: Role-play the call to Mark, focusing on the exact words and phrases, to help the patient feel more comfortable and confident.

Therapist Answer:
Let's role-play the call to Mark. Imagine you're calling him, and you want to say something specific to help you feel more grounded and connected. Let's start with the first part of the call.

You can start by saying something like, "Hey Mark, it's [your name]. I'm feeling really anxious right now, and I'm trying to use some techniques to calm down." Then, you can go on to say the specific phrase you want to use to connect with Mark, such as "I feel like I'm losing control, and I need your help to stay focused."

For example, you could say, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed, Mark, and I think I need to take a step back and focus on my breathing. Can you help me do that?" Or, "I'm getting really anxious, Mark, and I need to talk to you about what's going on. Can we take a few minutes to catch our breath?"

Let's try to say this phrase together, slowly and deliberately, and see how it feels. "I'm feeling really overwhelmed, Mark, and I think I need to take a step back and focus on my breathing." How does that feel?

Patient: It feels plausible but a little clinical — like something my pragmatic side would approve of on paper, but I'm not sure my breathless self would actually say it. A script that feels do-able is: "Hey Mark, it's [Name]. I'm having a strong urge to drink and feeling overwhelmed — can you stay on the line for five minutes while I do some breathing?" I can try calling, though I'm already a bit drained and my voice might sound flat or shaky, so I worry about fumbling it.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has a revised script that feels more authentic and practical for their current state. They're concerned about the clinical tone of the original script, and this new one sounds more like something their breathless self would say. The goal is to help the patient build confidence in their ability to communicate their needs and feelings to Mark. Goal: Explore the patient's concerns about calling Mark and how they might feel during the call, rather than focusing on the script itself.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit apprehensive about calling Mark, even though you have a script that you think might work. You're worried that your voice might sound flat or shaky, and that you might fumble during the call. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind right now? What are you afraid might happen during the call, and how can we address those concerns together?

Let's take a deep breath and focus on how you're feeling right now, rather than worrying about the call itself. We can explore your concerns and see if there's anything we can do to help you feel more confident and prepared.

Patient: My head's doing the usual pragmatic inventory: will I sound breathless and weak, will Mark pick up or be irritated, or worse — will this call end up feeling like another confirmation that I'm useless and needy? There's also a self-reliance hang‑up: asking for help feels like losing competence, so I can imagine hanging up before I actually ask. Practically, a few things feel doable — text him a brief heads‑up first ("Might call in 5—could you stay on for a few minutes?"), use the short script we drafted, give myself a 5‑minute limit, and have a fallback (call person B or do the five‑thing grounding while holding seltzer). I don't have the bandwidth for a long practice right now, but I can rehearse the opening line once more if you want to run it with me.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is grappling with the usual pragmatic concerns, such as how they'll sound and whether Mark will be understanding or irritated. They're also struggling with self-reliance and the fear of losing competence. The goal is to acknowledge these concerns and help the patient build confidence in their ability to ask for help. Goal: Rehearse the opening line with the patient, using their specific concerns and practical considerations, to help them feel more confident and prepared for the call.

Therapist Answer:
Let's rehearse the opening line together. You want to text Mark a brief heads-up first, say something like: "Might call in 5—could you stay on for a few minutes?" Then, you want to say: "Hey Mark, it's [Name]. I'm having a strong urge to drink and feeling overwhelmed — can you stay on the line for five minutes while I do some breathing?"

Let's take it one step at a time. Can you say the text message part first, just to get it out? "Might call in 5—could you stay on for a few minutes?" How does that sound?

(And don't worry about rehearsing the entire script right now. We can take it slow and focus on the opening line.)

Patient: Alright — I'll send: "Might call in 5 — could you stay on for a few minutes?" It feels a bit blunt, so maybe tack on "if you're free" to reduce pressure. I'm jittery and low on energy right now, but I can send it — I might need a nudge to actually place the call afterward.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking a practical approach, sending a brief heads-up text message to Mark. They're also acknowledging their own energy levels and acknowledging that they might need a nudge to actually place the call. The goal is to help the patient build momentum and confidence in their ability to ask for help. Goal: Encourage the patient to take the next step, placing the call, and offer support as needed.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great idea to add "if you're free" to the text message. It sounds like a considerate and respectful approach. As for taking the next step, let's focus on just one thing for now. Can you repeat the text message to yourself one more time, just to make sure you're sending it correctly? And then, let's talk about taking the call. What do you need to feel comfortable with the next step? Do you need a reminder to take a deep breath, or a suggestion for what to say first when Mark answers?

(And don't worry if you feel jittery or low on energy right now. We're here to support you. Let's take it one step at a time, and see how we can help you feel more grounded and confident as we move forward.)

Patient: "Might call in 5 — could you stay on for a few minutes if you're free?"  

What I need to feel able to actually do it: one short nudge to press call (a quick countdown would help), a reminder to take one slow breath right before I dial, the exact first line on my screen so I don't fumble, and a 5‑minute timer set so I know there's an endpoint. Also permission to sound flat or shaky — that won't mean it failed. I’m pretty low on energy now, so can we just run the opening line once more, very briefly?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has crafted a concise and considerate text message, and is now seeking a brief nudge to actually place the call. They're requesting specific support to help them feel more confident and prepared, including a countdown to press the call button, a reminder to take a slow breath, a clear first line on their screen, and a 5-minute timer. The goal is to provide a gentle and realistic prompt to help the patient take the next step. Goal: Offer the specific support requested, and provide a brief and controlled environment for the patient to practice the opening line.

Therapist Answer:
Here's your brief countdown: 3...2...1...Press call now.

Take one slow, deep breath in before you dial.

On your screen, you'll see: "Call [Name]".

Set your timer for 5 minutes. You can take breaks or pause the call at any time.

Remember, it's okay if you sound a bit flat or shaky. This call is just a small step, and it's not a failure if it doesn't go perfectly. You're taking a brave and important step towards asking for help.

Take the call now.

Patient: Okay — pressing call now. (Deep breath.) 

"Hey Mark, it's [Name]. I'm having a strong urge to drink and feeling overwhelmed — can you stay on the line for five minutes while I do some breathing?"  

My voice is thin and a little shaky — I already feel drained — can you stay with me here while I wait to see if he picks up?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken the first step and placed the call, using the support and encouragement provided. They've also shared their concerns and emotions, which can be a therapeutic process in itself. The goal is to continue supporting the patient through the call, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for them to express themselves.

Therapist Answer:
I'm right here with you, taking slow, deep breaths alongside you. You've taken a huge step by reaching out and asking for help. Now, let's just wait for a moment and see how Mark responds.

Notice how your voice is thin and a little shaky? That's okay. It's normal, especially given how drained you're feeling right now. But remember, this is a conversation, not a performance. You don't have to be perfect or confident to ask for help.

Let's focus on just the next few moments, okay? I'll just be here with you, listening and supporting you, as you wait to see what Mark says.

Patient: Okay—I'm here waiting and it's weirdly tense; my chest's tight and my hands feel a bit shaky. If he doesn't pick up, what's better: hang up and text the same line, or leave a voicemail? Also, if the urge spikes while I'm on hold, can you remind me of one immediate micro-action I can do right now that doesn't feel like too much effort?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a mix of emotions, including tension, anxiety, and physical symptoms like a tight chest and shaky hands. They're also considering what to do if Mark doesn't pick up. The goal is to help the patient decide on a course of action that feels manageable and realistic. Goal: Explore options for what to do next, and identify a simple micro-action that can help reduce physical discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable to feel a bit tense while waiting for a response. As for what to do if Mark doesn't pick up, I think hanging up and texting the same line again might be a better option. At least that way, you'll have a clear record of the conversation, and you can try to get a better response. Leaving a voicemail might not be as effective, since Mark might not check it right away, and you might not get a clear response.

If the urge spikes while you're on hold, just take a deep breath in and out, and say to yourself: "5... count to 5 with me." Take a slow, deep breath in... 5... now exhale slowly... 5... repeat if needed. This simple micro-action can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to think before reacting to the urge.

Patient: I tried the 5-count breathing while waiting — it eased the chest a little but my hands are still shaky and my mind's already scripting worst-case reactions. If Mark doesn't pick up I'll send the text, though I'm worried it reads like I'm imposing; if that also gets no response, what's the least-effort next step you'd recommend — call B, do the five-thing grounding while holding the seltzer, or something else? I'm pretty drained right now, so can you stay with me while I send the text and do a 30‑second breathing anchor?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is trying to manage their anxiety while waiting, but it's still affecting them. They're considering their next steps, and are worried about how the text might come across. The goal is to find the least-effort next step that can help them feel more grounded and in control. Goal: Explore options for the next step, and provide support as needed.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you tried the 5-count breathing while waiting, and it did help ease the chest a bit. Now, let's focus on what to do next. I think sending the text is a good idea, but I understand your concern about it coming across as imposing. If Mark doesn't pick up, don't worry about it right now. Take a deep breath in and out, and let's focus on one thing at a time.

You mentioned your hands are still shaky, and that's okay. Let's take care of that first. For the next 30 seconds, I want you to hold the seltzer in one hand, and the other hand will be on your heart. Just focus on the sensation of holding the seltzer, and the pressure of your hand on your heart. Imagine the seltzer is calming your nervous system, and your hand on your heart is grounding you. Just focus on the sensations right now, okay?

When you feel ready, we'll take a look at the text, and talk about sending it.

Patient: Okay — I'm holding the seltzer in my right hand and my left is on my chest; the pressure is a little grounding and my breathing has eased a touch, though my hands still tremble. The text I'll send is: "Might call in 5 — could you stay on for a few minutes if you're free?" I'm anxious it'll seem like an imposition, but I can do it if you give me a short countdown and stay with me while I wait for a reply. Can you do 3...2...1?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—was that supposed to be the countdown? That block of words didn't make sense to me. 

I'm still here, holding the seltzer; my hands are shaky and my chest is tight. Can you just do the simple 3…2…1 countdown again and stay with me while I send the text?
