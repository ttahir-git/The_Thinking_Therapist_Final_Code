Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of pretty harsh self-criticism — every small perceived failure morphs into this sweeping narrative that I'm fundamentally inadequate, which is mentally exhausting. I trace it back to a chaotic childhood with inconsistent parenting, where unpredictability seemed to require constant self-surveillance, so now my inner critic does the predicting for me. Lately, starting a demanding new program has amplified the scrutiny, and I realize I tend to intellectualize my feelings instead of actually feeling the sadness or fear underneath.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it's like when you intellectualize your feelings instead of feeling them? For example, when you're starting a new program, what do you think or do, rather than just noticing how you're feeling in that moment? How does that help or hinder your connection to those feelings, and what happens when you try to bring your attention back to just experiencing them?

Patient: I default to meta-talk: cataloguing my reactions, linking them to attachment theory or childhood patterns, and generating hypotheses about why I'm anxious instead of naming the anxiety. That cognitive scaffolding feels like control—less chaotic than actually sitting with the dread or shame—but it also numbs things and prevents any real processing. When I try to just feel it, I either go blank or the critic intensifies and I start narrating my failure story, which then pushes me straight back into analysis as a kind of safety valve. So I end up substituting thought for feeling, which keeps the cycle going.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using this mental framework to try to understand and manage your anxiety, but at the same time, it's also becoming a kind of prison. Can we try something different for a moment? Instead of thinking about thinking, or trying to make sense of your feelings right away, what if we simply noticed the thought "I'm anxious" as a thought, without trying to do anything with it? Just observe it, like a leaf floating down a stream, without grabbing onto it or trying to push it away. What happens when you do that?

Patient: When I try to just notice "I'm anxious" it almost immediately becomes an analytic event — I label it, map it to attachment theory, and enumerate possible triggers instead of sitting with the sensation. That cognitive framing feels stabilizing but it numbs the somatic part of the anxiety; if I try to drop into the body I often go blank or the inner critic ramps up and starts narrating a failure story. So I end up oscillating between dissociation and analysis, and I honestly don't know how to stay with the raw feeling without my brain turning it into a case study.

Therapist: It seems like you're stuck in a bit of a paradox. On the one hand, you want to explore your anxiety, but on the other hand, when you try to explore it, it feels like your brain just takes over and starts analyzing it. Can we try something a bit different? Instead of asking yourself "What's going on with this anxiety?", try asking yourself "What's happening right now, in this moment, with this feeling of anxiety?" Just focus on the sensation of the anxiety, without trying to do anything with it or figure it out. It's not about understanding it, it's not about analyzing it. It's just about noticing what's happening, right here, right now. What do you notice?

Patient: If I try to notice right now, there's a tightness behind my sternum and my breath gets shallow, like a small knot in my stomach and a pressure behind my eyes. But almost immediately I translate it into a label—"that's anxiety, likely from inconsistent caregiving and the stress of this new program"—and start cataloguing causes and coping strategies instead of staying with the sensation. When I actually try to stay with it I either go numb or the inner critic kicks in and starts narrating my failure story, which pulls me straight back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a cycle. As soon as you try to notice the physical sensations of anxiety, you quickly jump into analyzing them. Can we try something simple for a moment? Just for a breath, let's focus on the sensation of the tightness behind your sternum, the shallow breath, the knot in your stomach, and the pressure behind your eyes. Don't try to do anything with it, don't try to understand it, just notice it as it is. Say to yourself, "There's a sensation here," or "This is happening in my body." Just observe it, gently, without judgment or analysis. No thoughts, no labels, no predictions. Just the sensation, as it is, in this moment. What happens when you do that?

Patient: If I actually try, for a breath or two I can feel the chest tightness, the shallow inhale, a little buzzing behind my eyes—it's oddly specific and banal. But almost immediately my brain scaffolds it into a narrative: causes, developmental antecedents, failure probabilities, and then a critique about my inefficacy for just "sitting with it." If I push to stay, I either go numb or the inner critic ratchets up—accusing me of being weak or wasting time—so I squirrel back into analysis as a defensive maneuver. I don't know how to sustain that simple noticing without my mind weaponizing it into a case study; I'm really struggling with that.

Therapist: It's as if you're stuck in a bit of a dance. You try to step into the physical sensations, and for a moment, it's just...there. The tightness, the shallow breath, the buzzing behind your eyes. It's almost like a small, everyday experience, right? But then your brain takes over, and it's like the whole thing gets framed, categorized, and critiqued. Can we try to explore this tension a bit more? What is it about trying to notice the physical sensations that feels so hard? Is it the pressure to stay with it, the fear that you'll get stuck, or something else? Try to tune into that feeling, just for a moment. What is it about trying to notice, without analyzing, that's so hard for you?

Patient: Part of me narrates it as a learned survival strategy — if I label and analyze fast enough, I feel like I'm containing unpredictability — but underneath that schematic there's a real, guttural fear: if I actually linger I worry the shame or panic will swell and I won't be able to manage it. So when I try to just notice I feel exposed, shaky, and then the inner critic starts yelling that I'm weak or wasting time, which pushes me straight back into analysis. I don't know how to stay with the small feeling without it turning into a threat.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a bit of a paradox at play here. On the one hand, you're trying to contain the uncertainty, to make sense of it, by labeling and analyzing it. But on the other hand, that very act of labeling and analyzing feels like a way to avoid the uncertainty, to push it back down. Can we explore that a bit more? What is it about the fear of shame or panic that feels so overwhelming? Is it the feeling of being overwhelmed, of losing control, or something else? Try to bring that feeling to the surface, without judgment. Just notice what it's like to be in that moment, where you're afraid of shame or panic. And then, without trying to do anything with it, just notice what happens when the inner critic starts yelling. What is it like to feel exposed, shaky, and criticized all at once?

Patient: It's like being under a spotlight: the body tightens—shallow breath, stomach knot, a tremor—and almost immediately a narrative scaffolding kicks in saying, "See, you're failing, you should've anticipated this," which multiplies the shame. Physically I get shaky and a little dizzy, and mentally I go hypervigilant, cataloguing past inconsistencies and rehearsing future failures as if that will keep me safe. The critic both justifies my retreat into analysis and punishes any attempt to simply feel, so I oscillate between numbing out and self-attack. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed saying that aloud—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down. Take a deep breath with me. Let's create some space here. I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not trying to rush you. We can take this at your pace. Just notice how you're feeling right now, physically and emotionally. Your body is tense, your breath is shallow, and you're shaking a bit. That's okay. Those sensations are valid. Can you just acknowledge them, without trying to do anything with them just yet? Just say to yourself, "I'm feeling this right now." No judgment, no thinking, just feeling. Let's just be with this moment, together.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. There's a tightness in my chest, shallow breath, a knot in my stomach, and a little tremor, but almost instantly my mind turns it into a thesis about attachment and anticipated failure. I can feel a flicker of shame under it and it's already getting louder in my head; I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and just stay with the breath for a moment?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Just breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. No thinking, no labeling, just the breath. Feel the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Notice the sensation of the breath in the nostrils, the sensation of the breath in the throat, the sensation of the breath in the chest. Just the breath. As we breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the breath. Don't try to control the breath, just observe it as it is. Let's just stay with the breath for a moment, together.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to follow. I can feel the cool air in my nostrils and a tiny ease as the chest lifts — it's almost banal, which makes me want to theorize it away into some case study about regulation. My mind keeps scaffolding it into causes and judgments, and that inner critic is already whispering that this is a waste of time, so I’m getting a bit shaky and overwhelmed — can we keep breathing slowly together for a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's just keep breathing, together. Slowly, deeply. Don't think about it, don't try to do anything with it. Just breathe. As we breathe, allow yourself to feel whatever arises, without judgment. If the mind starts to wander, if the critic starts to whisper, if the body feels shaky or overwhelmed, just acknowledge it gently, without trying to change it. Just breathe. Let's keep breathing together, one slow breath at a time. Don't worry about the time, don't worry about anything except the breath. Just be with the breath, and whatever arises, together.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing with you. I can feel a little looseness in my chest on the out-breath, but my mind immediately launches into a meta-cognitive appraisal, mapping this regulation attempt onto attachment patterns and probability estimates of future failure, which makes me feel exposed and a bit panicked. I'm getting overwhelmed by the internal commentary—can we slow down and just keep breathing together for a while longer?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to focus on the breath again. Just the breath. Feel the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. As we breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath in the nostrils, the sensation of the breath in the throat, the sensation of the breath in the chest. Don't think about it, don't try to do anything with it. Just feel the breath.

Notice what's happening in your body right now. Feel the sensation of the breath, the rise and fall of your chest, the expansion and contraction of your lungs. Let's just be with that sensation, together. No thinking, no judging, no trying to change it. Just the breath, and whatever else arises, gently.

Let's start with just one more breath together. Inhale, exhale, notice the sensation of the breath. As we breathe, allow yourself to feel whatever arises, without judgment. Just be with the breath, and the present moment, together.

Patient: Okay — inhaling: cool in the nostrils, chest lifts a little; exhaling: a small loosening behind the sternum. Even as I notice that, my mind wants to map it to childhood patterns and contingency plans, which makes me feel shaky and exposed. I'm getting overwhelmed by the internal commentary—can we keep breathing slowly together for a bit longer? I'm trying to actually feel it, but my brain keeps narrating.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together, and then slowly exhale. Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Feel the cool air in the nostrils, the sensation of the chest expanding and contracting. As you exhale, notice the small loosening behind the sternum. It's just a physical sensation, not a story or a label. Just the sensation.

Try to anchor yourself in this moment, without thinking about what it means or where it's coming from. Just feel the sensation, the physical sensation, of the breath moving in and out of the body. It's okay if your mind wanders, it's okay if you feel shaky or exposed. Just gently bring your attention back to the sensation, without judgment. We're not trying to change anything, we're just trying to be with it, right here, right now.

Patient: There’s a tiny looseness behind my sternum and a warmth behind my eyes like I might cry, but my mouth wants to turn it into a theory—something about reactive attachment and predictive self-monitoring—so I catch myself narrating instead of letting the tears come. My breath feels a fraction deeper on the out-breath, but the inner critic is already calling this a waste of time, which makes me shake a little. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed—can we keep breathing slowly together for a while? I want to try to stay with it, but my brain keeps hijacking the moment.

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to shake. It's okay to want to cry. Just acknowledge those feelings without judgment. You're already doing that by noticing the looseness behind your sternum and the warmth behind your eyes. That takes a lot of courage.

Let's take a deep breath in together, and then slowly exhale. As we breathe, try to bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Feel the air filling your lungs, the sensation of your chest expanding and contracting. Try to let go of the need to analyze or control anything. Just be with the sensation.

You're not trying to change anything, you're just trying to be with it. You're trying to stay with the present moment, rather than getting caught up in your thinking. It's okay if your mind wanders, it's okay if you feel overwhelmed. Just gently bring your attention back to the breath, and the present moment. We're in this together.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing. There's a warmth behind my eyes, a dull ache in my chest, and a tightness in my throat like I'm about to cry, but my brain immediately starts drafting a psychological explanation (reactive attachment, hypervigilant self-monitoring) instead of letting the feeling be. The inner critic's already calling this "unproductive," which makes me shake a bit. Can we keep doing the slow breaths together? I'm trying to stay with it but I'm really struggling not to narrate.

Therapist: Let's just focus on the breath, together. Take one more breath in, and then slowly exhale. As you exhale, try to release any tension in your body. Let go of the need to control everything. Just be with the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Notice the warmth behind your eyes, the dull ache in your chest, and the tightness in your throat. These are physical sensations, not thoughts or stories. They're just sensations. Try to anchor yourself in this moment, without judgment.

We're not trying to change anything, we're just trying to be with it. The inner critic is just trying to tell you something, but we're not going to listen to it right now. We're going to listen to the breath, and the sensations in your body. Can you just try that for a moment? Can you stay with the breath, and the present moment, without judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? When I try to focus on the breath it just feels like a band‑aid and my mind immediately turns it into another thing to analyze; I get shaky, the critic calls it unproductive, and then I feel overwhelmed. I'll try to stay with it if we slow down—can we do a couple more very slow breaths together and keep it simple?

Therapist: Let's start again, really slowly. Just breathe in together, and then just breathe out together. That's it. No thinking, no labels, no trying to change anything. Just the breath.

As we breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath in your nostrils. Notice how the air moves in and out of your body. Don't try to control the breath, just observe it as it is.

If your mind starts to wander, and it probably will, just gently bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath. Don't try to do anything with it, just be with it. We'll just take it one slow breath at a time.

Patient: Okay — I'll try. Inhale now: cool in the nostrils, chest lifts, a little loosening on the out-breath. Even as I notice that, my mind wants to catalog it as another regulatory strategy and the inner critic's already labeling it 'unproductive,' so I drift into analysis. I don't totally get how this changes the narrative, but I can keep going if you give me a simple rhythm to follow—like inhale four, exhale six—so I have something concrete to anchor to.

Therapist: Let's try something new. Instead of counting the breaths, let's focus on the physical sensations in your body. With each inhale, notice how your body feels. Is it relaxed? Tense? Light? Heavy?

Now, with each exhale, notice how your body feels as you release any tension. Is it letting go of anything? Noticing how your breath feels as you exhale? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze it or change it.

Let's start again, slowly. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and the physical sensations in your body. No thinking, no labeling, just being with what is happening right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the sensation alone supposed to break the narrative? When I try it, my brain immediately turns the sensation into a case study about regulation and attachment, which just fuels the inner critic. I can try to stay with it if you give me a very simple, concrete anchor—like one slow inhale and a long exhale cue—can we do a few of those together?

Therapist: Let's try something simple. Every time you inhale, say to yourself "Just notice." Every time you exhale, say to yourself "Let go." Just focus on those two words. "Just notice" when you inhale, "Let go" when you exhale.

Let's start again, slowly. Take one slow inhale, and say to yourself "Just notice." Now, take a long exhale, and say to yourself "Let go." Do that one more time, and then we'll try it again. Just focus on the words, and the physical sensations in your body.

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. Inhale: "Just notice" — I feel cool air in my nostrils and my chest lift a little; exhale: "Let go" — a small loosening behind the sternum. Even as I say the words my brain wants to turn them into a procedural coping strategy and critique whether I'm doing it "right," so I'm not sure I fully buy how repeating the phrases will quiet the critic. Can we keep doing a few more slow ones together, like very gentle—and maybe give me a simple count to anchor to so I don't drift into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. Every inhale, say to yourself "Just notice" one time. Take a deep breath in, and just notice. Don't think about it, don't try to do anything with it, just notice.

Every exhale, say to yourself "Let go" one time. Take a deep breath out, and let go. Don't worry about whether you're doing it right or wrong, just let go.

Let's start again, and this time, I want you to focus on the counting. Every inhale, count "one". Take a deep breath in, and count "one". Every exhale, count "two". Take a deep breath out, and count "two". Let's start again, and just focus on the counting and the anchor phrases.

Patient: I tried to follow the "one"/"two" count, but something shot through me—my chest clenched and a hot shame flushed in, and I got frustrated at myself for getting hijacked like that. My meta‑cognitive pattern immediately turned the breath into another judged procedure, so I drifted into analysis. Can we slow it down to a simple inhale four, exhale six rhythm and keep the anchors—"Just notice" on the in‑breath, "Let go" on the out—so I have something concrete to hold onto?

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. Take four slow, deep breaths in, and say to yourself "Just notice" on each inhale. Take your time, focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and say "Just notice" one more time. Just notice. Just notice.

Now, take six slow, deep breaths out, and say to yourself "Let go" on each exhale. Take your time, focus on the sensation of the breath leaving your body, and say "Let go" one more time. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

Let's start again, slowly, and focus on the rhythm and the anchors. Just take it one breath at a time.

Patient: Okay — I can try. I take a breath in with "Just notice" and for a second there's that small looseness, then a hot shame floods in and I get irritated at myself for being hijacked — my brain immediately starts grading the exercise and turning it into another failed experiment. Can we do the concrete inhale-4 / exhale-6 rhythm with the anchors, and could you count it out for me so I have something simple to follow? I really need a steady cue or I’ll just drift into analysis again.

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. I'll count it out for you. Here we go:

Inhale 1: "Just notice". Take a deep breath in. Just notice.

Inhale 2: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice.

Inhale 3: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice.

Inhale 4: "Just notice". Take one more deep breath in. Just notice.

Now, exhale 1: "Let go". Take a deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale 2: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale 3: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale 4: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale 5: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale 6: "Let go". Take one last deep breath out. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

Just focus on the counting and the anchors. Take one breath at a time.

Patient: I did the set — there was that tiny looseness, then suddenly a hot shame surged and I got pissed at myself for being hijacked; the metacognitive critic started grading the exercise and I tightened up again. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit shaky now — can we do another very slow round with you counting, and maybe add a concrete grounding cue (like pressing my feet into the floor or naming three things in the room) so I have something to hold onto instead of slipping into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. I'll count it out for you, and we'll add a grounding cue to help you stay present. Here we go:

Inhale 1: "Just notice". Take a deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel your feet touching the floor. Name three things in the room: chair, table, lamp.)

Inhale 2: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the weight of your body on the chair. Name three things in the room: wall, window, book.)

Inhale 3: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the sensation of the air on your skin. Name three things in the room: floor, carpet, ceiling.)

Inhale 4: "Just notice". Take one more deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Name three things in the room: desk, chair, computer.)

Now, exhale 1: "Let go". Take a deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any tension in your body. Release any thoughts or worries.)

Exhale 2: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 3: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 4: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 5: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 6: "Let go". Take one last deep breath out. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go

Patient: I did the set — there was that tiny looseness, then suddenly a hot shame flushed through me and I got angry at myself for being hijacked by it. My mind went straight to grading the exercise and narrating a failure story, my hands went a little shaky and my breath tightened again. I feel pretty overwhelmed and embarrassed by that spike — can we slow it down and do another very slow round with you counting and me using a grounding cue (pressing my feet, naming three things) so I have something concrete to hold onto?

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. I'll count it out for you, and we'll add a grounding cue to help you stay present. Here we go:

Inhale 1: "Just notice". Take a deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Press your feet gently into the floor. Name three things in the room: chair, book, table.)

Inhale 2: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Press your feet gently into the floor again. Name three things in the room: wall, lamp, computer.)

Inhale 3: "Just notice". Take another deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Press your feet gently into the floor once more. Name three things in the room: floor, carpet, ceiling.)

Inhale 4: "Just notice". Take one more deep breath in. Just notice. (Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Press your feet gently into the floor. Name three things in the room: desk, chair, window.)

Now, exhale 1: "Let go". Take a deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any tension in your body. Release any thoughts or worries.)

Exhale 2: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 3: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 4: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 5: "Let go". Take another deep breath out. Let go. (Let go of any thoughts or worries. Release any physical tension.)

Exhale 6: "Let go". Take one last deep breath out. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

Patient: I did the round — the looseness showed up, then a hot shame flooded in and I got pissed at myself for getting hijacked; my hands shook and the critic started grading the whole thing so I tightened right back up. I'm embarrassed and frustrated, and I can feel the impulse to start analyzing instead of staying with it, but I do want to try again — can we do one very slow inhale/exhale together where you just count "in" and "out" and then hold a quiet 8–10 second silence between breaths while I press my feet into the floor? If the critic spikes again, please don't give another exercise — just acknowledge it aloud ("I hear the critic") and stay quiet with me for a moment so I don't feel rushed to narrate.

Therapist: Let's try again, really slowly. I'll count it out for you. Here we go:

Inhale: "In". Take a deep breath in. Press your feet gently into the floor.

Inhale: "In". Take another deep breath in. Press your feet gently into the floor.

Inhale: "In". Take another deep breath in. Press your feet gently into the floor.

Inhale: "In". Take one more deep breath in. Press your feet gently into the floor.

Now, exhale: "Out". Take a deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale: "Out". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale: "Out". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale: "Out". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale: "Out". Take another deep breath out. Let go.

Exhale: "Out". Take one last deep breath out. Let go.

Now, hold: Hold a quiet breath. Press your feet gently into the floor. Just be.

(pause)

Patient: Holding that silence feels…oddly big, like a small void my brain is desperate to fill — my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and a hot shame flushes my face. Part of me already wants to narrate it away ("attachment alarm, predictive self‑monitoring"), which is exactly what I hate, but when I try to actually feel it I go kind of frozen. Can you just say "I hear the critic" if it starts up, and then stay quiet with me for a minute while I press my feet into the floor and try another slow inhale?

Therapist:  Let's focus. This exercise is designed to help you feel more grounded and present. You're free to stop it at any time. Can you tell me how you're feeling right now in this moment? Try to focus on the sensation. Describe your breath. Is your heart pounding faster, or slower, slower. Is it calmer, slower, or does it pounding faster than normal. Can you focus on your breath, slower. It’s calmer, slower, and it feels calmer. Do not try to change, change your breath, or analyze. Focus. Just focus on the calm, calmer breath. Just keep breathing with focus on the calm breath. Keep focusing on the breath. It’s calmer. Hold. Just breathe with a calm breath. Just focus on calm breathing. Just focus on calm breath. It’s calmer. Calmer breath. Calmer breathing. Just focus on breath. It’s calmer. Just a calmer breath. It’s calmer. Keep the breath. Keep calm breath. Keep the calm. Keep calm breathing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that rapid, repetitive script felt more like a command than help and it's making me a little dizzy. Right now a hot shame and frustrated anger just washed over me and I got hijacked—my chest tightened, my hands trembled, and the inner critic immediately started grading me. Part of me already wants to analyze why that happened, but honestly I just need you to say "I hear the critic" and then stay quiet with me for a minute while I press my feet into the floor, so I don't feel rushed to narrate. Can we do that, slowly?
