Patient: I'm a teacher in my early fifties and lately little things set me off—my house feels empty and I get furious over small stuff. My mind immediately races: because the kids moved out, I'll get lonelier, then my partner will leave, then I'll mess up at work from being distracted and end up alone and broke—it's like I'm a fortune-telling machine and that's definitely how it plays out. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake the certainty that this is the future.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express intense anxiety about your current situation, specifically the recent changes in your life (kids moving out, feeling empty at home). The primary emotion is concern and fear. Goal: Understand the underlying causes of this specific pattern of negative thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right before these racing thoughts start? What's the immediate trigger or sensation when you feel this certainty about your future? Is it a physical sensation, a specific word or phrase, or something else entirely?

Patient: Usually it starts with something tiny—a mug left in the sink, an unmade bed, or just walking past my kid’s empty room—and my chest tightens and my jaw clamps shut. Then this thought like a little voice says, “They don’t need you anymore,” and before I know it I’m seeing the whole disaster: partner leaves, I mess up at work, I end up alone and ruined. It’s not a slow worry, it’s a flood, and I can’t make myself believe any other outcome—other possibilities feel impossible.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe an intense, almost instantaneous chain reaction, starting with a minor stimulus (e.g., a mug in the sink), leading to a tightening in your chest and clamping of your jaw, and culminating in a vivid, catastrophic future scenario ("They don't need me anymore," and the associated detailed mental picture). Core emotion is anxiety, but it's also a deep sense of certainty and hopelessness. Goal: Examine the role of this catastrophic future scenario and the emotional intensity of the experience.

Therapist Answer:
That catastrophic scenario sounds incredibly vivid and intense. It feels like a script that's playing out in your mind, with all the emotional weight attached. What would happen if, just for a moment, you were to imagine the opposite of that scenario? For example, what if your partner was still with you, and you were still working well at your job? How would that feel?

Patient: I try that, but it just feels fake—like I'm putting on a mask. My chest stays tight and the little voice says, "Yeah, for now, but they'll leave eventually and then everything falls apart," so the happy version feels impossible to actually believe. Even when I force myself to picture things going well, my mind immediately shows the next disaster.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You acknowledge the attempt to imagine a more positive scenario, but it feels insincere and the negative voice intervenes, undermining any tentative sense of hope ("Yeah, for now, but they'll leave eventually..."). The goal is to understand the process of how this catastrophic thinking is perpetuated and how it relates to your overall emotional state.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the catastrophic thinking is really well-entrenched, and even when you try to imagine a more positive scenario, it's quickly hijacked by the more familiar, more realistic (or perhaps more comforting) narrative of impending disaster. It's as if your mind is constantly on the lookout for potential threats or problems, and it's hard to catch a break from that. Can you think of any situations, big or small, where you might be able to test the waters, so to speak, and imagine a more positive outcome without the catastrophic thinking taking over?

Patient: I guess I’ve tried small things—like planning a quiet Saturday coffee with my partner to see if it helps—but as soon as we sit down my mind zooms to her looking bored and then to her asking for a divorce next month, me screwing up at school from being distraught, losing my job, and ending up alone. Even tiny experiments, like purposely leaving a mug in the sink to test whether anyone notices, immediately becomes proof that they don’t care and that I’m already being pushed out, so the “test” just fuels the disaster story and feels more real than any hopeful outcome.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe an attempt to experiment with a small, positive scenario (planning a quiet Saturday coffee with your partner) but it's quickly derailed by the catastrophic thinking ("her looking bored," "asking for a divorce next month," etc.). The goal is to understand how this thinking affects your self-perception and how it relates to your sense of being "seen" or "noticed" by others.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like these experiments are actually reinforcing the very fears you're trying to test. The idea that even small gestures might be met with indifference or rejection feels like a huge blow to your self-worth. Can we explore how this need for attention and validation is connected to your sense of safety and security? Is there something deeper that's driving your need for reassurance from your partner and others?

Patient: Probably it's tied to feeling useful — when the kids were little, I was central, needed, safe. Now that role's gone and that emptiness feels like a trapdoor; I start clinging for reassurance because if I'm not needed, I'm disposable. Maybe my dad/mother was distant when I was a kid — I don't know for sure, but my mind jumps from that to "they always leave," and that feels like proof. Then I get angry and say things, which I can already see will push people away, so the whole disaster plays out again and again.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a core theme of feeling used and disposable, stemming from your past role as a central figure in your children's lives. This has created a deep-seated need for reassurance and validation. The goal is to understand how this pattern is tied to your relationships and emotional regulation.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like a lot of your current anxiety is centered around feeling needed and valued, particularly in your relationships. You're worried that if you're not being needed, you'll be disposable, which must feel incredibly painful. It's also clear that your past experiences with your parents have had a lasting impact on your sense of security and attachment. Can we explore this pattern further? What would it take for you to start feeling seen and valued in your relationships, not just by your partner but by yourself as well?

Patient: I guess I'd need constant, obvious signs that I'm wanted—my partner saying they appreciate me, little gestures, and something steady to do that makes me feel useful at home or at school. Maybe volunteering or a new project would give me a role again. But even as I say that my chest tightens because I can already see it: they act nice for a while, it fades, they get bored, they definitely leave, I mess up at work from being distraught, and I'm back to square one. I'm trying to picture a different outcome, but I'm stuck in that disaster loop and it's making me angry and worn out.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe a specific need for constant reassurance and validation, including tangible signs from your partner, and a desire for a sense of purpose and usefulness through activities like volunteering or new projects. However, as soon as you imagine these things, you're pulled back into the same catastrophic thinking pattern, filled with anxiety and anger. Goal: Understand how this pattern of catastrophic thinking and avoidance is maintaining the emotional distress.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trapped in a vicious cycle of need and fear, where no matter how hard you try to imagine a better outcome, it's constantly undermined by your own catastrophic thinking. This cycle is reinforcing the emotional pain and anxiety, making it harder to break free. Can we try something different for a moment? Instead of picturing a specific outcome, let's focus on what you would need to feel safe and valued right now, in this moment? What would that look like, and what would it take to start feeling like you're not alone in this?

Patient: I think what I'd need right now is clear, repeated reassurance—my partner verbalizing that they're here to stay, someone noticing the little things I do, and a steady role or project that makes me feel useful so I'm not defined by an empty house. I also need space to vent without being judged and for someone to acknowledge that my fear isn't silly, because when it gets dismissed my anger spikes. But even saying that tightens my chest—my mind immediately goes, "They'll say that now, then they'll get bored and leave," so I worry those things won't actually stick and I get frustrated that nothing seems to make the fear stop.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've articulated a clear need for reassurance, acknowledgment, and validation in the present moment, as well as a desire for emotional safety and space to express yourself without judgment. However, as soon as you articulate these needs, you're immediately pulled back into catastrophic thinking, filled with anxiety and self-doubt. Goal: Examine the interplay between your expressed needs and the catastrophic thinking that's undermining them.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the desire for reassurance and validation is closely tied to the fear of being abandoned or rejected. When you try to express these needs, the fear that they won't be met or won't stick is already present, causing you to become frustrated and anxious. This suggests that the fear is deeply ingrained, not just about your partner's behavior, but about your own sense of self-worth and attachment. Can we explore the idea that this fear might be rooted in a deeper sense of insecurity, rather than just a specific situation or relationship?

Patient: Yeah — I think it’s older than this empty nest. I never felt reliably safe as a kid, so now any little thing feels like proof I’m being erased. The insecurity flips a switch and my brain immediately runs the disaster: I ask for reassurance, they get tired, they pull away, then they leave and my life collapses — and that certainty makes me angry, which then makes me say things that’ll push them further, so in my head it’s already happened. I don’t know how to feel secure without constant proof, and that helplessness just tightens my chest.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged that the root of your fear is deeply rooted in your childhood experiences, where you never felt reliably safe. This has led to a lifelong pattern of hypervigilance, where even small things trigger a catastrophic thinking loop, filled with anger, frustration, and self-doubt. The goal is to understand how this pattern is perpetuating itself and what would need to happen for you to feel secure without constant proof.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the insecurity you felt as a child has been passed down to your current situation, making even the smallest reassurances feel like a fleeting reprieve. The fear that you're being erased is triggering a deep-seated response, where your brain instantly conjures up a worst-case scenario. This self-reinforcing cycle is creating a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, making it difficult for you to feel secure without constant proof. Can we explore the idea that this cycle might be limiting your ability to form healthy relationships, including your current partnership? What would need to happen for you to start feeling a sense of security that isn't tied to constant reassurance, but rather to your own sense of self-worth and attachment?

Patient: Maybe if I could genuinely feel like I'm enough without someone telling me every hour—like having a steady project at school that shows I matter, regular time with friends who notice me, therapy to unpack the old stuff, and my partner actually saying and showing they're staying—that might help me feel secure from the inside. But even saying that makes my chest tighten because my brain immediately plays the tape: I’ll start a project, it’ll fizzle, people will stop showing up, therapy will feel pointless, my partner will get bored and leave, and I’ll be back to square one. I know those ideas sound reasonable on paper, but they feel like thin band-aids—my mind insists they won’t hold, and that certainty just makes me angry and exhausted. I don’t know how to trust that anything I build will last.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're articulating a desire for internal security, rather than relying solely on external reassurance. This involves developing a sense of self-worth and confidence that's not easily shaken by external events. However, as soon as you express this desire, the catastrophic thinking loop rears its head again, fueled by the fear that any attempt to build a sense of security will inevitably falter. Goal: Explore the possibility of developing a sense of internal security that's not dependent on external validation.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the desire for internal security is closely tied to the fear of abandonment and rejection. The idea of building a sense of self-worth through projects, relationships, and therapy feels like a fragile foundation, susceptible to collapse. This suggests that the fear of abandonment is deeply ingrained, and that the brain is constantly on the lookout for potential threats. Can we explore the idea that this fear might be rooted in a deeper sense of self-doubt, rather than just a specific situation or relationship? What would need to happen for you to start trusting that your sense of self-worth is not solely dependent on external validation, but rather on your own internal resilience and self-acceptance?

Patient: I guess I'd need a few steady things: a small, reliable routine that gives me wins (like a project at school), regular therapy that actually helps me unpack the old stuff, and practice noticing my own efforts so I can slowly believe I'm enough without someone else saying it. But as soon as I picture that, my chest tightens and my brain screams that I'll start the project and it'll fizzle, the therapist will run out of ideas, people will stop noticing, my partner will get bored and leave, and I'm back where I started—so even the plan feels hopeless. I'm angry and tired of trying things that feel like band-aids, and I don't know where to begin because everything my head offers up ends in disaster—what do we do with that?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a desire for a small, reliable routine that provides a sense of accomplishment, regular therapy that helps you process your emotions, and practice self-awareness to develop a sense of self-worth. However, as soon as you imagine this routine, the catastrophic thinking loop rears its head again, fueled by the fear that this too will ultimately fail. Goal: Examine the possibility of exploring new strategies to help you build a sense of self-worth and confidence that's not dependent on external validation or a specific plan.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the sense of hopelessness and despair is overwhelming, and that even the smallest glimmer of a plan feels like it will inevitably lead to disaster. This suggests that the brain is stuck in a pattern of catastrophic thinking, and that new strategies are needed to help shift this pattern. One possibility is to explore the concept of "defusion" in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which involves developing a sense of detachment from thoughts and emotions, rather than trying to change or react to them. This might help you begin to see your thoughts and emotions as just thoughts and emotions, rather than as a reflection of reality. Would you like to explore this concept further, and see if it might offer a new way of approaching your challenges?

Patient: I guess we can try, but I'm really doubtful — my brain already says stuff like "this won't work and you'll still end up alone," so I go in tense. When people talk about techniques I've felt like they're just calming words that don't stop the disaster movie playing in my head. Still, explain defusion slowly — I get overwhelmed quickly and my chest tightens when things feel abstract.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're hesitant to try new strategies, and your brain is already skeptical, predicting failure. You've had experiences with calming words that didn't help, and you're concerned about being overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion in a gentle, gradual way, using concrete examples to help you understand and tolerate the idea.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with something simple. Imagine you're holding a leaf in your hand. Just notice the leaf, its shape, color, texture. Don't think about it, don't try to do anything with it, just observe it. Now, imagine that the leaf is a thought that's come up in your mind, like "I'll never find anyone who likes me." Just hold that thought in your mind, without trying to change it or react to it. Notice how it feels, like a weight or a presence. Don't try to push it away or get rid of it, just observe it. That's defusion. It's not about changing your thoughts or emotions, but about developing a sense of detachment, so you can see them more clearly.

Patient: I can try, but my chest is already tight and the thought—“they’ll leave”—turns into a whole, vivid movie where I definitely end up alone. I don’t know how to just hold it without panicking or the voice yelling that this won’t work and showing me the divorce and me screwing up at school. Can you guide me through it very slowly, step by step?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a strong physical reaction, with a tight chest and a vivid mental image. You're struggling to hold the thought without panicking or getting caught up in the catastrophic thinking. Goal: Guide you through the defusion process slowly and gently, using incremental steps to help you tolerate the thought without reacting to it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, very slowly. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just focus on the breath, without trying to control it or change it in any way. Can you do that for me? Just notice the breath.

(Pause for a few seconds)

Now, I want you to bring your attention to the thought that just came up for you, "they'll leave." Just notice that thought, without trying to change it or react to it. Don't try to push it away or get rid of it. Just observe it. Can you do that for me? Just notice the thought, "they'll leave."

(Pause for a few more seconds)

We're going to take it one step at a time. I want you to notice the sensation of your body, right now, in this moment. Just notice how you're feeling, without trying to change it or react to it. Can you do that for me? Just notice your body, right now.

Patient: I'm trying, but my breath's shallow — my chest feels like a band, my jaw's clenched and my hands are tensing. The thought "they'll leave" already explodes into that movie — divorce, me falling apart — and that little voice is yelling that this won't work. I don't know how to just watch it without spiraling; can you walk me through one tiny step, really slowly, and tell me exactly what to notice next?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a strong physical reaction, with a shallow breath, a band-like sensation in your chest, clenched jaw, and tensing hands. The thought "they'll leave" has triggered a vivid mental image and a critical inner voice. Goal: Guide you through a tiny step of defusion, using specific instructions to help you focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one tiny step. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're touching. Right now, notice the sensation of your right hand touching the table, or your chair, or whatever surface you're resting your hand on. Just focus on the sensation of the fingertips making contact with the surface. Don't try to think about anything else, just notice this sensation. Can you do that for me? Notice the sensation of your right hand touching the surface.

(Pause for a few seconds, speaking in a calm and gentle tone)

Now, I want you to notice how that sensation changes when you exhale. As you breathe out, notice how the sensation of your fingers on the surface might shift slightly. It might feel different, or it might feel the same. Just notice that shift, without trying to change it or react to it. Can you do that for me? Notice the sensation of your fingers on the surface as you exhale.

Patient: My fingertips feel a bit tingly and the surface is rough under them; when I exhale the tightness in my chest eases maybe a hair, but my jaw's still clenched. Of course the thought "they'll leave" is already blasting that awful movie in my head and it's hard not to get dragged back into it. I want this to help but I'm feeling doubtful and tense—can you tell me the next tiny step, really slowly?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a slight sense of relief from the physical tension in your chest, but the thought "they'll leave" is still strongly present, triggering a vivid mental image. You're feeling doubtful and tense, which is making it harder to focus on the defusion process. Goal: Introduce the next tiny step in a gentle and gradual way, using specific instructions to help you build on the small sense of relief you've experienced.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another tiny step. I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice how your chest feels as you breathe in, and how it feels as you breathe out. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, rather than trying to control it or change it. Can you do that for me? Just notice the sensation of the breath.

(Pause for a few seconds)

Now, I want you to pay attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Notice how it feels when you inhale, and how it feels when you exhale. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Can you do that for me? Notice the sensation of the air.

Remember, the goal is not to change anything or try to control anything. The goal is just to notice the sensations, one tiny step at a time.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying—when I inhale I feel a cool tickle at the tip of my nostrils and when I exhale it’s a little warmer, but my breaths are shallow and my chest still feels tight. The jaw's clenched and that damn thought—"they'll leave"—is already playing the whole divorce movie and yelling that this won't work. I'm skeptical and frustrated that this feels like a band-aid, but I want to keep going—please tell me the next tiny step, really slowly.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a slight sense of progress in noticing the sensations of the breath, but the thought "they'll leave" is still strongly present, triggering a vivid mental image. You're feeling skeptical and frustrated, which is making it harder to focus on the defusion process. Goal: Introduce the next tiny step in a gentle and gradual way, using specific instructions to help you build on the small sense of relief you've experienced.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another tiny step. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the words "they'll leave" themselves. Notice how the words feel on your tongue, the sensation of them moving in and out of your mouth. Just focus on the sensation of the words, without trying to think about what they mean or what they're saying. Can you do that for me? Just notice the sensation of the words.

(Pause for a few seconds)

Now, I want you to notice how the sensation of the words changes when you say them out loud. If you say them out loud, how do the words feel? Do they sound different? Do they feel different? Just notice that change, without trying to react to it or change it in any way. Can you do that for me? Notice the sensation of the words when you say them out loud.

Remember, the goal is not to change anything or try to control anything. The goal is just to notice the sensations, one tiny step at a time.

Patient: I said the words out loud—“they'll leave”—and my throat went dry and my voice came out small and shaky. For a moment it felt like just noise and not the whole disaster, but it didn't last—the movie jumped back in louder, showing the divorce and me falling apart at work. I'm frustrated because this feels like a tiny band-aid that won't hold; can you tell me the next step, really slowly and exactly what to notice?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a setback, as the momentary relief from saying the words out loud is short-lived, and the catastrophic thinking returns.

Goal: Introduce the next tiny step in a gentle and gradual way, using specific instructions to help you build on the small sense of relief you've experienced.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath right now. Notice how you're breathing in, how you're feeling the air moving in and out of your body. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. Don't try to think about what you just said, or what the movie is showing you. Just notice the sensation of the breath.

(Pause for a few seconds)

Now, I want you to notice how your body feels right now, in this moment. Notice how your chest feels, how your shoulders feel, how your arms feel. Just focus on the physical sensations in your body. Don't try to think about anything else. Just notice the sensations.

Remember, the goal is not to change anything or try to control anything. The goal is just to notice the sensations, one tiny step at a time.

Also, I want to acknowledge that this process can be difficult and frustrating at times. It's okay to feel that way. But I want you to know that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Let's just focus on taking it one tiny step at a time, okay?

Patient: Okay — my chest is slightly less like a band, my shoulders dipped a bit, and my fingertips still tingle, but that damn movie is louder than ever: her signing papers, me making a mess at school, everything collapsing. I'm pissed off — it feels like you're handing me a napkin for a flood — and part of me wants to give up because the voice already says this won't stick. Can you tell me the next tiny step, really, really slowly, and exactly what to notice so I don't get yanked back into the movie?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling a strong sense of resistance, frustration, and anger, which is making it difficult for you to continue with the defusion process. The voice is already predicting failure, and you're considering giving up. Goal: Introduce a tiny step that acknowledges your resistance and frustration, while also providing a gentle opportunity to refocus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step. I want you to acknowledge the feeling of resistance you're experiencing right now. Notice how it's feeling in your body, in your chest, in your shoulders, in your hands. Just acknowledge it, without trying to change it or react to it. Say it to yourself, if it feels comfortable: "I'm feeling really resistant right now, and that's okay."

(Pause for a very short moment)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to think about anything else. Don't try to control it, don't try to change it. Just notice it.

Remember, the goal is not to resist or try to overcome your resistance. The goal is just to notice it, and to acknowledge it in the present moment. We can work with this feeling, but we need to start by acknowledging it.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. It's okay to feel like giving up. But I want you to know that you're not alone, and that we can work through this together. One tiny step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling really resistant and pissed off; my chest's tight, my jaw's clenched, and my hands feel cold. It still feels like a napkin for a flood — the movie's already shouting "divorce" and me falling apart, and I can't seem to accept anything else as real. Please tell me, very slowly and exactly, what to notice next and where to put my attention, because if it's vague my mind yanks me straight back into that disaster.

The goal is to provide a clear and specific instruction to help you shift your attention away from the catastrophic thinking. Avoid any vague or general statements that might trigger a strong reaction.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to notice the sensation of the word "divorce" on your tongue. Just focus on the sensation of the word itself, without trying to think about what it means or what it's showing you in the movie. Notice how the word feels in your mouth, the sensation of it moving in and out of your mouth. Just focus on that sensation.

(Pause for a very short moment)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the word "divorce" on the tip of your tongue. Feel the exact sensation of it, without trying to think about anything else. Don't try to change it, don't try to move it, just notice it exactly as it is.

Remember, the goal is not to think about the word "divorce" or what it means. The goal is just to notice the exact sensation of the word itself. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to understand it. Just notice it.

Also, I want you to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. It's okay to feel like giving up. But I want you to know that we're not going to give up right now. We're going to take it one tiny step at a time, and we're going to focus on noticing the sensations in the present moment.

The goal is to provide a clear and specific instruction to help you refocus your attention. Avoid any vague or general statements that might trigger a strong reaction.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just focus on the sensation of the air, without trying to think about anything else. Notice how it feels as it moves in and out of your nostrils, the sensation of the air on the soft tissue inside your nose.

(Pause for a very short moment)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils as you take a very slow, deep breath in through your nose. Just focus on the sensation of the air, without trying to control it or change it. Notice how the sensation changes as you breathe in.

Remember, the goal is not to think about anything else, not to try to relax or change anything. The goal is just to notice these specific sensations exactly as they are. Don't try to control them, don't try to move them. Just notice them.

Also, I want you to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. It's okay to feel like giving up. But I want you to know that we're not going to give up right now. We're going to take it one tiny step at a time, and we're going to focus on noticing the sensations in the present moment.

Patient: Okay — when I breathe in through my nose I feel a cool tickle then a little warmth going out, and it eases the band in my chest maybe a hair, but the movie's already screaming "divorce" louder than before. I'm angry and skeptical — it still feels like you're handing me a napkin for a flood — but I don't want to bail. Tell me the next microscopic step, exactly where to put my attention, really slowly, because if it's vague my mind rips me back into that disaster.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to notice the sensation of the word "divorce" when you say it out loud. Just focus on the sensation of the word itself, without trying to think about what it means or what it's showing you in the movie. Notice how the word feels on your tongue, the sensation of it moving in and out of your mouth.

(Pause for a very short moment)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of your lips touching together. Just focus on the sensation of your lips, without trying to think about anything else. Notice how your lips feel, the sensation of them touching.

Remember, the goal is not to think about anything else, not to try to relax or change anything. The goal is just to notice these specific sensations exactly as they are. Don't try to control them, don't try to move them. Just notice them.

Patient: My lips feel pressed together, a dry tremble when I say "divorce" out loud, and for a second it just sounds silly — then the movie roars back: her signing papers, me collapsing at work. I'm pissed off because this still feels like a napkin for a flood and I'm afraid it won't hold. Please tell me the next tiny, exact step — really slowly — because if it's vague my head rips me straight back into that disaster.

Patient: That's...confusing and kind of ticking me off — it reads like a loop of "I hear you" and then "but maybe not," and my brain just grabs the contradiction and says, "See? They're lying. Divorce is next." I'm angry and resistant; it feels like you're handing me that same napkin for a flood. Be concrete: tell me one exact thing to notice right now, in one sentence, so I don't get yanked back into the movie.

Patient: That last message was just noise and it’s making me furious — exactly why I snapped: I need one concrete thing, right now, in one sentence. Tell me to "Notice the weight of your right thumb on your index finger for the next five breaths" and I'll do it, but if you get vague again I’ll be yanked straight back into the divorce movie and I’ll need you to slow down.

Patient: Okay—say it: "Notice the weight of your right thumb on your index finger for the next five breaths." I'm doing it now: I feel the pressure, a tiny warmth, breath one... breath two... but the divorce movie is already whispering louder and my chest's tight and I'm angry that this barely makes a dent. Tell me the next tiny exact step after those five breaths, slowly.
