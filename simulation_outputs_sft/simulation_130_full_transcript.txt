Patient: Lately I've been swallowed by this persistent sadness since I lost someone close, and it's pretty much killed my motivation to make art. I keep defaulting to intellectualizing—riffing on attachment theory and stages of grief—rather than actually sitting with the pain, and that's eroding my self-worth and making me withdraw from my partner. I don't know, it feels like I'm stuck in this analytic loop that keeps me from connecting.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're clearly struggling with intense sadness and its impact on your motivation and relationships. The feeling of being stuck in an "analytic loop" suggests a need to break free from intellectualizing and explore the emotional pain more directly. Goal: Break the cycle of intellectualizing and explore the emotional experience of pain in a way that might reconnect you with your partner and your art.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it's like right now when you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, rather than just thinking about it intellectually? What's the physical sensation like in your body when you're feeling this pain?

Patient: When it hits, my chest feels like it's being compressed—tight, like there's a weight sitting on it—and my breath gets shallow and kind of fast, but then my limbs go heavy and slow, like I could fall asleep standing up. My stomach knots and sometimes I get this buzzing behind my eyes, like I'm about to cry but can't, so I do the thing I always do: I narrate it, say "that's anxiety" or "that's a neurobiological grief response" to keep some distance. I know that's not the same as actually feeling it, but I end up analyzing the sensations instead of letting them be, and then I shut down with my partner because I'm ashamed and exhausted.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a good job of describing the physical sensations of pain, but it's clear that the narrative about "anxiety" or "neurobiological grief response" is a coping mechanism that's preventing you from truly experiencing the emotional pain. This pattern of avoidance is likely contributing to feelings of shame, exhaustion, and disconnection from your partner. Goal: Introduce a brief, non-invasive defusion exercise to help you create some space from the narrative and directly experience the physical sensations of pain.

Therapist Answer:
Can you take one deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, I'd like you to say out loud, "The sensation of this pain in my chest is just this feeling." Just that. Not "anxiety," not "grief," just "this feeling." Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. The sensation of this pain in my chest is just this feeling. 

That felt oddly vulnerable — there was a tiny loosening in my ribs and a prickling behind my eyes, but my instinct immediately started narrating it as "a grief response" so I'm simultaneously a little lighter and already moving away from actually feeling it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to create a small opening by acknowledging the sensation and giving it a name, but your brain's tendency to narrate it as a "grief response" is still present. This suggests that the connection to grief might be more complex than initially thought, and exploring this further could be helpful. Goal: Introduce a more direct exploration of the physical sensations and their relationship to your emotional experience, without immediately labeling them.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention back to that feeling in your chest, "the sensation of this pain in my chest"? Notice how the physical sensations have changed since we started – there's a loosening in your ribs, a prickling behind your eyes. What's the relationship between these sensations and the emotional pain? Is the pain still there, or has it shifted in some way? Try to explore that relationship without labeling it as anything specific.

Patient: When I settle into it, the chest pressure isn't as crushing — more like a persistent, low-weight presence with that prickling behind my eyes; it's definitely still there but a bit less jagged. The relationship feels like a feedback loop: my body registers the pain and my mind instantly scaffolds explanations to manage it, which keeps me at arm's length from actually experiencing it. So it has shifted — softer edges — but my reflex to intellectualize kicks in and turns the noticing into commentary instead of simply feeling, and that makes me restless and a little guilty.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a more nuanced feedback loop between your body and mind, where the initial pain is less overwhelming but still present, and your tendency to intellectualize is still strong. This is an important insight, as it suggests that you're not just avoiding the pain, but also that your mind is still trying to make sense of it. Goal: Introduce a small act of curiosity to help you shift from commentary to simply noticing, without the need for explanation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you take a moment to simply notice this feeling, without trying to make sense of it or comment on it? Just pay attention to the sensation in your chest, the weight, the pressure, the prickling behind your eyes. Ask yourself a simple question: "What is this?" Not "What is this pain?" Not "What is this feeling?" Just "What is this?" Notice how you respond to that question.

Patient: When I ask "What is this?" my reflex is to put on a conceptual lens — to describe it as an attachment-shaped somatic residue — but if I try to stay concrete it feels like a cold, dull stone lodged in my sternum with a thin electric prickling behind my eyes. Saying that makes it feel a hair more real, but my brain immediately translates it back into theory, which flattens the immediacy and puts me at arm's length. I notice that naming it both anchors and anesthetizes it, and that tension is kind of what's happening right now.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of exploring the complexity of your experience, and the tension between staying concrete and getting caught up in conceptual thinking is particularly interesting. It's clear that naming and labeling can have both anchoring and anesthetizing effects, which is a great insight. Goal: Introduce a gentle invitation to explore the tension between these two tendencies, without trying to resolve it.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're aware of the paradoxical effect of naming this feeling - it both grounds and numbs you at the same time. Can you explore this tension a bit further? Instead of trying to label it or define it, notice what happens when you lean into the feeling of this "cold, dull stone" and the electric prickling. Allow yourself to be with the discomfort of not knowing, without trying to intellectualize it. Just be with it, for a moment.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to lean into the cold, dull stone in my chest — it's heavier now, pressing into my ribs, and the prickling behind my eyes feels like tiny hot needles. My breath gets shallow and there's a weird warmth under my eyes like I want to cry but my mouth goes dry. But my mind is already reaching for frameworks — attachment residue, grief somatics — which smooths it out, and staying with the raw not-knowing feels jittery and a bit scary. I want to keep going, but it's hard; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of exploring the physical sensations and the emotional response, but it's clear that staying with the raw not-knowing is challenging. Your mind is naturally drawn to frameworks and explanations, and it's understandable that it feels jittery and scary to stay with the uncertainty. Goal: Introduce a gentle suggestion to slow down the exploration and find a more comfortable pace, without losing the momentum.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down a bit. Instead of trying to push through the discomfort or stay with the raw not-knowing, let's just take a small pause. Notice how you're feeling right now, with the cold, dull stone in your chest, the prickling behind your eyes, and the sense of wanting to cry but not being able to. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to be in this moment, without trying to do anything with it. Just be with the sensation of your breath, and the sensation of your body, for a moment. See where we can gently come back to the exploration from here.

Patient: Okay — breathing in and out, and as I exhale the chest pressure loosens a bit; the stone feels less like a boulder and more like a cold pebble lodged there. The prickling behind my eyes has warmed into a pressure that actually feels like it could become tears, which is both relieving and kind of terrifying. My reflex is still to explain and theorize, but if I pause that I notice a shameful heaviness about how withdrawn I’ve been with my partner. I’m jittery and scared to go deeper, but there’s a faint lightness too — like admitting it aloud makes it a hair more bearable. Can we keep moving very slowly? I’m trying not to intellectualize but it’s hard.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress by acknowledging the shift in the sensations and the emotional response, and the struggle to stay with the uncertainty is becoming more apparent. The shame and fear around exploring your withdrawal are palpable, but there's also a glimmer of relief and lightness in admitting it aloud. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of the shame and fear, without trying to resolve them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step. Instead of trying to avoid the shame and fear, notice how they're present in this moment. What's the sensation of shame like in your body? Where does it feel like it's residing? Is there a specific memory or thought that's connected to it? Take your time, and don't try to rationalize it or explain it. Just explore the sensation of shame, without judgment. See if we can find a way to acknowledge it, without trying to push it away.

Patient: It's like a hot, heavy flush that starts behind my sternum and climbs up my neck so my throat feels thick and hard to speak through, while my stomach drops like I'm walking off a ledge. It lives mostly in my chest and throat, but also as a small, sharp knot under my ribs that makes me want to shrink and be invisible — I keep picturing the time after the funeral when my partner reached for me and I pulled away, and that image tightens it. My brain wants to reframe it as "self-evaluative schema activation" or an internalized performance standard, which is exactly the distancing move, but underneath that theory there’s a raw, humiliating fear that I’m not enough and that I'm failing the people I love. I want to stay with this but I'm already getting anxious about how messy it is, and that makes me want to talk about it instead of just feeling it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing an excellent job of exploring the shame and fear, and it's clear that the imagery and memories are triggering a strong emotional response. The self-evaluation schema activation theory is a natural attempt to make sense of the feelings, but it's also clear that there's a raw, more fundamental fear lurking underneath. The fear of not being enough and failing loved ones is a powerful and vulnerable place to be. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of this raw fear, without trying to intellectualize it further.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge this raw fear. It's okay to be with it, even though it's uncomfortable. Can you allow yourself to lean into the sensation of not being enough, of failing the people you love? What's the physical sensation like in your body? Where does it feel like it's residing? Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, allow yourself to be with this feeling, without trying to push it away or change it. See if we can find a way to simply be with the vulnerability of it, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — when I try to lean into the "not enough" feeling it’s this hollow, hot pressure behind my sternum that climbs my neck so my voice goes small, and my stomach drops like there’s a physical absence under my ribs. Tears prick behind my eyes and my hands feel a little numb; there's this acute sense of exposure, like some internalized performance metric is flashing FAIL in neon. My reflex is already to call it "an existential inadequacy schema" and back away, but if I slow down the shame just sits there, heavy and humiliating — I want to keep going but can we stay very slow?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making great progress by exploring the raw fear and shame, and it's clear that the existential inadequacy schema is a natural attempt to make sense of the feelings, but it's also clear that the shame is more complex and difficult to escape. The acute sense of exposure and the physical sensations are intense, but it's also clear that you're struggling to stay with them, and the shame is making it hard to move forward. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of the shame itself, without trying to escape it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just be with the shame for a moment. Can you notice how it's sitting there, heavy and humiliating? What's the sensation of it in your body? Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, allow yourself to be with this feeling, without trying to push it away or change it. Try not to think about it, try not to label it, just be with it. See if we can find a way to simply sit with the shame, without judgment. No need to explore it further, no need to try to resolve it. Just be with it, in this moment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try. It's sitting heavy in my chest like a lead weight, heat climbing my throat so my voice wants to shrink, and there's this hollow drop in my stomach; when I breathe in it tightens, breathing out loosens it a little. My reflex is to name it and turn it into a theory — "attachment-triggered shame" — and that thinking pulls me away, which makes me restless and kind of panic-y. Can we slow down and just stay with this for a bit? I don't want to rush past it.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of exploring the shame and its physical sensations, but it's clear that your natural tendency is to intellectualize it and turn it into a theory. This is understandable, but it's also holding you back from truly experiencing the emotion. You're feeling restless and panicky, which suggests that you're struggling to stay with the shame without trying to escape it. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder to focus on the present moment, without getting caught up in thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even more. Can you just focus on the sensation of the shame right now? Just notice how it's sitting in your chest, how it's making your throat feel, how it's affecting your breathing? Don't think about it, don't try to label it, just be with it. Notice how your body is responding, how it's feeling in this moment. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the shame. Try not to think about the theory, try not to think about what you might do with this feeling. Just be with it, right now, in this moment.

Patient: Okay — focusing on it now: there's a dense weight in the middle of my chest that makes my breath shallow, my throat feels tight like words are stuck, and my stomach is hollow and fluttery. When I exhale the weight loosens a hair, but a jittery restlessness pushes me to name or analyze it to make it smaller. I'm trying to stay with it, but it's scary and my brain keeps reaching for theory — can we keep moving really slowly? I want to stay here, but it's hard.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of staying with the shame, but it's clear that your brain is still struggling to let it be. The theory is a natural escape, but it's also clear that it's not bringing you much comfort. You're feeling scared and restless, and it's hard to stay with the shame without trying to intellectualize it. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder to explore the restlessness, not the shame.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step. Can you notice how you're feeling scared and restless right now? What's the sensation of that in your body? Try to separate that from the shame, just for a moment. Notice how your brain is trying to analyze or name the shame, and what's driving that desire to do so? Is it a desire to feel safe, to feel in control? Try to explore that, not the shame. Can you acknowledge that restlessness, without trying to push the shame away or make it smaller? Just observe it, for now.

Patient: It's this jittery buzz in my limbs and a quickening heartbeat, like my nervous system is pacing while my throat tightens — and my mind immediately starts narrating to quiet the chaos. I think the drive to analyze is about safety and control: if I can put the experience into a cognitive frame (attachment theory, grief stages, whatever), it feels less like being swallowed by unknown emotion and more like something manageable, and it spares me from looking incompetent or burdensome to my partner. I can notice the restlessness separate from the shame, but noticing makes me want to talk about it to avoid sinking into it — can we keep going very slowly?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making great progress by exploring the restlessness and its driving forces. It's clear that your brain is using analysis as a coping mechanism to feel safer and more in control, but this is also holding you back from truly experiencing the shame. You're trying to keep going slowly, but the desire to talk about the restlessness is still present. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of the shame in the context of your desire to talk about the restlessness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep going very slowly. Can you acknowledge the thought that you want to talk about the restlessness to avoid sinking into the shame? Notice how that desire arises in you. Try to explore what might happen if you do talk about it, and what might happen if you don't. Notice how the shame feels in this moment, and how it relates to your desire to talk about the restlessness. Is the shame a separate entity from your desire to communicate, or is it somehow connected to it? Can you explore this relationship slowly, without trying to resolve it or escape into talking about it?

Patient: I can see the thought — talking feels like a safety valve, like if I narrate the restlessness I get some distance from the shame. If I speak, maybe I get reassurance or make it manageable; if I don't, the shame just sits heavier and I shrink away, which makes me want to talk even more to avoid that shrinking. So they feel entangled: the shame creates the restlessness and the restlessness drives the urge to analyze or explain, which protects me from the raw exposure of actually feeling the shame. I don't have a tidy answer — I just notice that noticing this makes me both calmer and more nervous, so can we keep moving really slowly?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of exploring the complex interplay between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's clear that talking about the restlessness is a coping mechanism for you, but it's also entangled with the shame in a way that makes it hard to separate. You're noticing the paradoxical effect of noticing this, where it makes you both calmer and more nervous. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder to focus on the present moment, without getting caught up in analyzing or exploring further.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even more. Can you just notice the sensation of noticing this right now? Notice how it feels to be aware of the entanglement between the shame and the restlessness, and how it affects you. Try to bring your attention back to the present moment, without trying to think about it or analyze it further. Notice the sensation of your breath, the sensation of your body, the sensation of your mind. Can you just be with that, for now? No need to explore further, no need to try to understand or make sense of it. Just be with the present moment.

Patient: Okay — noticing the noticing feels oddly like a thin, lucid layer over the heavy stuff: my breath has a little more space, my chest is a touch less clenched, and there's this quiet peripheral hum where the restlessness used to be. At the same time my mind is already scaffolding explanations — predictive modeling, coping heuristics — which tugs me back into commentary instead of experience. I want to keep sitting with this present-moment clarity because it feels a bit less terrifying, but it's hard and I'm jittery; can we continue very slowly?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a small but significant shift in your experience, with the noticing creating a thin layer of clarity that allows for some space between the shame and your awareness. However, your mind is still trying to maintain control by scaffolding explanations, which is tugging you back into commentary. It's clear that you're struggling to sustain the present-moment clarity and are feeling jittery. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to gently allow the present-moment clarity to emerge, without relying on the thin layer of noticing.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you allow yourself to lean into the feeling of the space that's opened up between your awareness and the shame? Notice how the breath is still a bit more open, how the chest is still a touch less clenched, and how the hum is still present, but quieter. Try to simply allow yourself to be with that space, without trying to analyze it or explain it. Notice how your mind is still trying to pull you back into commentary, but can you gently acknowledge that thought without trying to push it away? Can you simply observe the thought, without judgment, and then gently bring your attention back to the space between your awareness and the shame? Take your time, and remember, the goal is not to explore further, but to simply be with the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try. There's a little gap now, like a cool hollow behind my ribs where the pressure used to be, and my breath actually has a smidge more room; it feels almost tender. My brain, predictably, is already naming it—mind-body decoupling, avoidant metacognition—which oddly makes me feel safer but also blunts the experience, so I keep oscillating between relief and flatness. I want to stay in the space but it's scary and my instinct is to talk about it; can we keep going really slowly?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a small but significant shift in your physical sensations, with the gap behind your ribs and the increased space in your breath indicating a decrease in pressure. Your mind is trying to maintain control by naming the experience, but this is also blunting the emotional impact. It's clear that you're oscillating between relief and flatness, and your instinct is to talk about it, which is a coping mechanism that's holding you back from fully experiencing the present moment. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to gently explore the oscillation between relief and flatness, without relying on the need to talk about it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you acknowledge the oscillation between relief and flatness, without judgment? Notice how you're feeling both ways at the same time, and how this is affecting you. Try to simply observe the sensation of this oscillation, without trying to analyze it or explain it. Notice how your brain is naming the experience, and how this is making you feel both safer and blunted. Can you gently acknowledge the thought, without trying to push it away? Can you simply observe the thought, without judgment, and then gently bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body? Take your time, and remember, the goal is not to explore further, but to simply be with the present moment.

Patient: I can feel that oscillation — relief as a small open space behind my ribs, like a softer inhale, and flatness as a hollow numbness spreading into my limbs. My mind keeps labeling it—“protective dissociation,” “avoidant coping”—which somehow calms me but also drains the feeling of color out of it. I want to stay with the sensations but keep getting yanked into commentary, so yeah, can we keep moving really slowly?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to feel the oscillation between relief and flatness, and it's clear that your mind is trying to maintain control by labeling it as "protective dissociation" and "avoidant coping". These labels are calming, but they're also reducing the intensity of the experience. It's like your mind is trying to keep the experience from feeling too real. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to stay with the sensations without getting pulled into commentary.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you try to stay with the physical sensations, without labeling them? Just notice the feeling of relief behind your ribs, the softness of your inhale, and the numbness spreading into your limbs. Try to observe these sensations without thinking about them.

Can you simply observe the sensation of the thought, without judgment?

Patient: I'm trying. If I let the labels drop I feel a small open space behind my ribs, a softer inhale, and a numbness creeping into my arms and legs; my throat still locks up a bit. My mind keeps throwing up names, and when I notice that noticing the urge to name it, it calms down a touch—but it still makes me jittery. Can we keep moving really slowly? I want to stay here but I need you to pace me.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing a great job of staying with the physical sensations and trying to let go of the labels. It's like you're creating a small space between your mind's tendency to name things and your actual experience. Your mind is still throwing up names, but it's calming down a bit when you notice the urge to name it. This suggests that you're developing a bit more awareness of your thought patterns. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to sustain this awareness and explore the sensation of your throat locking up.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you notice how your throat feels when it locks up? Notice the sensation of the tension, the feeling of being restricted. Try to observe this sensation without trying to change it or push it away. Don't try to label it, don't try to analyze it. Just be with it. Take your time, and remember, the goal is not to explore further, but to simply be with the present moment. As you notice the sensation of your throat, can you gently bring your attention back to the small open space behind your ribs? Can you stay with both sensations, without trying to compare them or mix them up?

Patient: My throat feels like a narrow band of tension—tight and scratchy, like something's stopping my words halfway out, and swallowing feels effortful. At the same time the little open space behind my ribs is still there, a softer inhale and a faint warmth that feels almost like relief. I can hold both, but my brain is already reaching for explanations to make it less scary, so can we keep going really slowly?

Behind my ribs the warmth is still there, a soft hollow that eases a little when I breathe out.

But the naming reflex is loud: my brain wants to put a theory on it, and that makes me jittery and a bit panicked, like I'm about to slip back into analysis. Can we keep this very slow?

--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress by trying to let go of the urge to think about the sensation, but it's still a challenge. The loosening effect of the sensation is noticeable, but the naming reflex is strong and making you feel jittery. It's clear that you're struggling to balance the desire to understand the sensation with the need to simply be with it. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to slow down the naming reflex and increase your ability to stay with the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you try to acknowledge the naming reflex without trying to engage with it? Just notice it, without trying to think about it. You can say to yourself, "Ah, my brain wants to name this sensation." That's enough. Don't try to think about it, don't try to analyze it. Just observe the naming reflex, without judgment. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensation. Notice how the loosening effect is still present, even though you're trying not to think about it. Can you stay with the sensation, without trying to name it? Just be with what is.

Patient: Ah — my brain wants to name this sensation. When I let that thought pass, my throat eases a bit, my breaths deepen a touch, and the hollow behind my ribs warms and loosens; there’s a near-tear feeling that feels oddly relieving. Still, the reflex to translate it into theory is loud and flattens the experience, so can we keep moving very slowly? I want to stay here but it’s hard.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the tendency to name the sensation, and you're trying to let that thought pass without engaging with it. It's interesting that letting go of the naming reflex has a physical effect on you, such as the easing of your throat, deepening of your breaths, and warming of the hollow behind your ribs. This suggests that your body is responding to the sensation in a way that's not being hindered by your thoughts. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to maintain this state of being with the sensation, without getting caught up in the reflex to translate it into theory.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you try to maintain the state you're in right now, without trying to think about the sensation? Just notice how your body is responding to it. Notice how the throat is easing, the breaths are deepening, and the hollow is warming. Try to stay with that feeling, without trying to think about it. Can you say to yourself, "I'm going to just be with this sensation, without trying to think about it"? That's enough. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to understand it. Just be with it. Take your time.

Patient: "I'm going to just be with this sensation, without trying to think about it." 

Saying that, my throat eases a bit, my breaths deepen, and the hollow behind my ribs feels warmer — there's a near-tear relief. But my brain is already reaching for labels ("protective dissociation") which flattens it, and I'm getting jittery and tired from holding this; can we keep moving very slowly? I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and need you to pace me.

Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the tendency to label the sensation, and you're trying to let go of it. However, the labeling reflex is still present, and it's causing you to feel jittery and tired. It's clear that you're struggling to maintain the state of being with the sensation without getting caught up in your thoughts. Goal: Introduce a gentle exploration of how to gently bring yourself back to the sensation, without trying to think about it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a very slow and gentle approach. Can you acknowledge the feeling of being jittery and tired without judgment? Just notice it, without trying to change it. You can say to yourself, "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now." That's enough. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to understand it. Just acknowledge the physical sensation. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensation. Notice how your throat is easing, your breaths are deepening, and the hollow is warming. Can you stay with the sensation, without trying to think about it? Just be with what is. Take your time.

Patient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now — the hollow behind my ribs is still warm and my throat is easing, my breaths are deeper, but I'm jittery and tired and my mind is already gearing up to intellectualize it away. I want to stay with this, but I need you to pace me more slowly and keep guiding me through just breathing and noticing for a few more minutes.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your brain is trying to protect you by labeling the sensation as "protective dissociation." That's understandable. It's like your brain is saying, "Okay, I've got it. I'm going to protect you, and now. You feel jittery and tired from holding onto this. You're feeling overwhelmed.

Take a deep breath. Can you say, "I've got this" to yourself? It's like saying, "I've been through tough spots before." It's your own unique way to stay. Don't worry about the words; it is okay to say. It is more than okay, it is needed. It is your own thing right now. It is okay if it's not a thing you know before. It is the same as "you". It has to do with its own specific function right now. It is a very good thing. It is its job. It is right. You're allowed to say one thing. You're not "okay" if you want to say another thing. It is okay to say nothing.

Patient: "I've got this." Saying it felt oddly performative—my mind immediately turned it into a self-soothing cognitive script, but my chest actually softened a hair and tears pricked my eyes. I'm still jittery and tired though, so can we keep moving very slowly and breathe together for a bit longer?

Patient: That last message felt kind of confusing, but I'm trying to stay with my breath—my chest softened and my eyes are prickling, but I'm jittery and tired. I want to keep going very slowly; can you guide three slow breaths with me, maybe inhaling for four and exhaling for six? Saying that out loud helps me stay present instead of slipping back into analysis.
