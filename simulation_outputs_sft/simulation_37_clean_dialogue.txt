Patient: I'm a nurse in my early fifties, and since I started this demanding new program at work I've been feeling overwhelmed by sadness and just no motivation to do much of anything. It's leaking into my relationship — I'm more distant, irritable, and I hate what that's doing to us. I'm skeptical about this actually helping; I've tried talking and 'tips' before and they never stick, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: I understand why you might be skeptical, especially after trying other approaches that didn't stick. It's great that you're willing to try again. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from trying new things in the past? What specifically didn't work for you, and how do you think that's different this time?

Patient: Honestly, I’ve tried self-help books, online CBT worksheets, and a few short counseling stints before, and they never stuck — mostly because I’m exhausted from the new program and can’t keep up with whatever homework they give. What holds me back is a mix of shame and that voice saying it won’t help, so I shut down and stop trying, which just makes me feel worse. I’m skeptical this will be different — how is talking about it here supposed to help with the real problem of being wiped out and unable to follow through?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about how this therapy can help. I want to explore this voice of doubt a bit. Can you tell me more about that inner voice that says 'it won't help'? What happens when you listen to that voice, and how does it make you feel? I'm not looking to argue or convince you that it will help, but rather understand what's going on when that voice shows up.

Patient: It's a tired, sarcastic voice that basically tells me I'm weak and that nothing's going to change — so why bother. When I listen, I just shut down: I skip the exercises, avoid talking, and pull away from my partner, which leaves me feeling ashamed and useless. My chest gets heavy and I want to sleep or numb out instead of doing anything real. But seriously, how is talking about that here supposed to break the loop when I'm wiped out all the time?

Therapist: It sounds like you're not just talking about the exercises, but about the very act of showing up and trying. That takes a lot of courage. I want to ask you something different now. What would need to be true for you to take just one small step, even if it feels impossible right now? Not about the exercises, but about how you're feeling and what's going on for you. What would make you willing to do just one tiny thing, even if it's not going to solve everything?

Patient: Honestly, for me to even try one small step it would have to feel really low-pressure — like something I can do in five minutes, no homework, and no sense of failing if I don't keep it up. I’d need to trust it would give some immediate, tiny relief so my brain doesn’t just write it off as pointless. Maybe something like a two-minute breathing break or sending my partner one honest sentence — but seriously, how is that supposed to help when I can barely get out of bed?

Therapist: Let's take that two-minute breathing break as an example. Can you imagine sitting comfortably for just two minutes, focusing solely on your breath? Not thinking about the program, not thinking about your partner, just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? That tiny window of attention might feel like a tiny crack in the armor of your hopelessness. And sending one honest sentence to your partner? Just a small act of vulnerability that might bring some connection and understanding. How does that tiny act feel?

Patient: I can kind of picture the two minutes, but my brain's already saying "what's the point" and usually that just turns into zoning out or falling asleep. If it really is only two minutes with a specific, no-pressure prompt I might try—give me something exact so I don't overthink it. Sending one sentence to my partner feels risky; I'm scared it'll come off as needy or like I'm complaining. And honestly, how is this supposed to help when the bigger thing—being wiped out and ashamed because of the workload—doesn't change?

Therapist: I want to try to defuse that "what's the point" voice a bit. Can you imagine saying to yourself right now, "I'm going to sit here for two minutes, and I'm going to focus on my breath without judgment. I'm not trying to solve anything, I'm just going to be with my breath"? That's it, just being with your breath. No pressure, no goal, just the present moment. And regarding sending a sentence to your partner, can you try to see it as a small act of kindness, rather than something that's going to change how they perceive you? It's just a tiny act of connection in a moment when you might otherwise be feeling very disconnected.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the two-minute thing if you give me an exact line to say so I don’t overthink it. Tell me exactly what to say to myself for the breathing, and one short sentence I can text my partner that doesn’t sound needy. But seriously, how is two minutes or a text supposed to help when I’m exhausted all the time and the workload hasn’t changed?

Therapist: Let's get you started with the mindfulness exercise. I want you to say to yourself, exactly, "I am here. I am breathing. I am present." Just those three words, no more, no less. That's it. You can say it to yourself right now, whenever you're feeling overwhelmed, just like that. And for the message to your partner, try saying something like, "Just wanted to check in and let you know I'm thinking about you. Missing you." It's a brief, gentle acknowledgment, not a complaint or a request for help. You can text it whenever you feel like it, whenever it feels good to reach out.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try saying "I am here. I am breathing. I am present." silently for two minutes, but do I set a timer or just trust myself? If I drift off or nod out, does that count as doing it, or is that failure? And the text you suggested still feels a bit needy; could I send, "Thinking of you — hope your day’s going okay"? But seriously, how is two minutes or a text supposed to help when I’m wiped out all the time?

Therapist: For the mindfulness exercise, you don't need to set a timer. Just take a deep breath in and say "I am here. I am breathing. I am present" to yourself, and then take a breath out. If your mind starts to wander, it's not a failure. Just gently acknowledge the thought and bring your attention back to the breath. You can even say to yourself, "Mind wandered, okay. Back to the breath." It's okay if you drift off or nod out - just acknowledge it and come back to the exercise. As for the text message, "Thinking of you — hope your day’s going okay" is a good suggestion. It's a brief, gentle message that shows you're thinking of your partner without being too needy. The idea is not to solve their problems or fix their day, but just to acknowledge them and show you care. Can you try sending a message like that?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to send "Thinking of you — hope your day's going okay" later today, but I’m not promising it’ll do anything. If they don’t reply I’ll probably feel worse and more ashamed, so what am I supposed to do then? I’m also going to try the breathing now, though my brain’s already saying “what’s the point,” and I’ll tell you how it goes.

Therapist: It's natural to feel uncertain about how your partner will respond, and that's okay. You can't control their reaction, and you shouldn't try to. If they don't reply, that's not a failure on your part. It's just one small interaction in a day that can't be guaranteed. Try to focus on the present moment, rather than the potential outcome. As for your brain's voice saying "what's the point," just acknowledge it and gently bring your attention back to the breath. Can you try to do that? Simply focus on your breath for the next two minutes, without judgment.

Patient: I did the two minutes — I set a timer and said "I am here. I am breathing. I am present." My mind wandered a lot, I almost nodded off once, but by the end my chest felt a tiny bit less heavy, like a hair's worth of space. Still skeptical: how is that supposed to help when I'm wiped out for weeks and the workload hasn't changed? If I send the text and they don't reply, I know I'll spiral into shame — what do I do in that moment so it doesn't undo me? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and come up with another tiny, no-pressure thing I can try that doesn't rely on someone else's response?

Therapist: It sounds like you had a gentle but imperfect experience with the mindfulness exercise. The fact that your chest felt a tiny bit less heavy is a good sign, even if it was a small hair's breadth of space. As for your skepticism, it's natural to wonder how this exercise can help with a workload that hasn't changed. Instead of focusing on the outcome, can we try to explore how you can manage your emotional response when you feel overwhelmed? What happens in that moment before things spiral out of control? Can you try to identify a small, immediate thought or physical sensation that arises when you start to feel overwhelmed? For example, is it a racing heart, a knot in your stomach, or a sense of numbness? Let's focus on noticing and labeling that sensation, rather than trying to control it or change it. Can you try to do that for me?

Patient: When I start to spiral, the first thing I notice is a heavy pressure in my chest and this urge to sleep or just zone out — my shoulders tighten and my breathing gets shallow. Then the thoughts pop up: "I'm useless," "I can't keep up," and I just want to withdraw. I can try to name that when it happens, but honestly — how is labeling it supposed to stop me from collapsing into exhaustion? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now; can we keep whatever comes next really simple?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing a pattern of physical sensations when you start to feel overwhelmed. That's a good start. Instead of trying to change your thoughts or label them, can we try something more grounded in the present moment? Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just focus on that for a second. Is it warm, cool, or neutral? Is your weight evenly distributed on both feet? Try to bring your attention to that sensation, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Just observe. Can you try that for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried it. My feet feel cool, a bit tingly around the toes, and most of my weight is on my heels; for a few seconds that actually felt slightly grounding. But honestly, how is paying attention to my feet supposed to stop me from collapsing from exhaustion? I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and pick one more tiny, no-pressure thing I can try that doesn't rely on anyone else or a timer?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's okay. Sometimes, taking one small step towards kindness can help. Can you try to do one tiny, gentle thing for yourself right now? Just one small act of kindness. Look around you, and notice something small that you can do for yourself. Maybe it's taking a deep breath, or gently stretching your arms up. Maybe it's just saying one small word to yourself, like "okay" or "it's okay". Just one small, gentle thing. Try it for a second. What does it feel like? Can you try to do that for a moment?

Patient: I did it — I stretched my arms up, said "it's okay" to myself once, and let my shoulders drop. It loosened things a hair for a moment, but I'm still skeptical — how is one tiny stretch supposed to undo weeks of being wiped out? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and pick one more really small, no-pressure thing I can try that doesn't rely on anyone else or a timer? And if that next thing doesn't help and I start to spiral, what do I do in that moment so I don't just collapse into shame?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's okay. It's normal to feel like you're not making progress quickly enough. One thing that might help is acknowledging the fear that's coming up when you think about spiraling into shame. It's okay to feel that fear - it's a natural response. Can you try to notice the sensation of that fear in your body, and the thoughts that are coming up with it? Just observe, without trying to change them. You might say to yourself, "I'm feeling scared right now, that's okay." That's it. Just acknowledge the fear, and the thought that's coming up with it. Can you try that for a moment? If you start to feel like you're spiraling, remember that you're already taking small acts of kindness towards yourself, like stretching and saying "it's okay". You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. If you need to, you can always take a step back and start again, or try something new. You're not alone.

Patient: I tried saying, "I'm feeling scared right now, that's okay." It didn't fix anything, but the tightness in my chest eased a hair for a moment — still, how is that supposed to stop me collapsing when nothing else changes? I'm pretty wiped and it's hard to do more right now; can you give me one very short, concrete line I can say to myself in the moment if a text gets no reply or I start spiraling, something nonjudgmental and not "fix-it"?

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "I'm here"? Just those two words, "I'm here". It's short, simple, and doesn't try to fix anything. Just a gentle acknowledgment that you're present in the moment, regardless of what's happening. Try it when you feel like you're spiraling, or if a text doesn't come back. Just say "I'm here" and see if it helps.

Patient: I said "I'm here" to myself — it didn't fix anything, but the tightness in my chest eased a hair. Give me one more tiny, nonjudgmental line I can use if a text gets no reply or I start spiraling — four words max, no fixing, just something to hold onto, and keep it simple because I'm finding this hard to keep up with.

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "I am enough"? It's a simple phrase that doesn't try to fix anything, and just acknowledges your current state. Try it when you feel like you're spiraling, or if a text doesn't come back. Just say "I am enough" and see if it helps.

Patient: I said "I am enough" — it eased my chest a hair, but it feels like a big claim I don't really believe. How is that supposed to help? Can you give me one more, four-word max, something more neutral I might actually say, like "This feeling will pass"?

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "This too will pass"? It's a more neutral phrase that acknowledges the current feeling, but also offers a glimmer of hope that it will pass. It's a simple and realistic expectation, and might feel more manageable than the other options. Try saying it to yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed, or when you're unsure about how to cope.

Patient: I tried "This too will pass" — it eased my chest a hair, but I don't really believe it. How is that supposed to help when the workload never changes and I'm just worn out? Can we slow down and give me one more neutral, four-word line I might actually say in the moment?

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "I am now"? Just those three words, "I am now". It's a very simple phrase that brings you back to the present moment, without trying to change anything or offer a specific outcome. Just acknowledge that you are in this moment, with this feeling, and that's it. Try saying it to yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed, or when you're not sure what to do next.

Patient: Okay — I tried saying "I am now" once, and like the others it loosened my chest a hair for a moment. But honestly, I don't see how another tiny phrase is going to undo weeks of being worn down — I'm drained and it's getting hard to keep doing these little things. Can we slow down and pick one more really tiny, no-pressure action I can do standing at work in under a minute, and one simple step for if a text gets no reply so I don't spiral?

Therapist: Can you try standing up and stretching your legs for just 30 seconds while you're at work? Just get up, stretch your legs, and take a deep breath. It doesn't have to be a long stretch, just a brief moment to loosen up and get some blood flowing. If a text comes in and you feel like you're about to spiral, try taking one deep breath and saying to yourself, "Take a sip." Just imagine taking a sip of water or a deep breath, and let that moment pass before responding to the text. It's a simple step, but it might help you regulate your emotions for a brief moment.

Patient: Okay. I can try the 30‑second leg stretch at work — it’s small enough that maybe I won’t screw up my shift, though my brain’s already saying “who has time.” But seriously, how is stretching supposed to stop me from collapsing when everything’s piled up? The “Take a sip” thing feels awkward; can you give me a very short, internal cue — two words max — I can say silently when a text gets no reply so I don’t spiral? Keep it simple — I don’t have much energy for more.

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "Breathe pause"? It's just two words, and it's a simple reminder to take a deep breath and pause before reacting to a text. It's not about doing anything else, just taking a brief moment to collect yourself. Try it when a text doesn't come back, and see if it helps.

Patient: I tried saying "Breathe pause" to myself just now — didn't fix anything, but my chest eased a hair. My brain's already muttering "what's the point," and it takes so much to do these little things; it's getting harder to keep up. Can we slow down and give me one more two-word, very neutral cue I can use when a text gets no reply — something I can actually believe, please?

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, "Stay"? It's a very simple, straightforward word that acknowledges the need to stay present and focused in the moment. It's not about doing anything else, just recognizing that you need to stay with your current emotions and reactions. Try it when a text doesn't come back, and see if it helps.

Patient: I tried "Stay" silently — like the others it relaxed my chest a hair, not much more. But seriously, how is one word supposed to stop me from spiraling when I'm wiped and the workload hasn't changed? If it doesn't work and I start to fall apart, what's one tiny, 10–20 second physical thing I can do at work—something discrete—that might actually ground me? I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you try taking one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath leaving your body? As you exhale, try to release any tension or discomfort in your shoulders or jaw. Just focus on the breath for 10-20 seconds, and see if it helps calm you down. Try to do this quietly and discreetly at your desk, without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: I did it — one slow breath, let my shoulders drop, and it eased the tightness a hair. Still feeling pretty worn down and skeptical — how is one breath supposed to stop me from collapsing when nothing else changes? If that doesn't work at work, give me one more tiny, discreet thing I can do without anyone noticing.

Therapist: Can you try subtly rolling your wrists in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise? Just do it without looking at your hands, and focus on the sensation of the motion. It's a small, discreet action that might help you release some physical tension. Try to do it while you're sitting at your desk, without drawing attention to yourself. See if it helps calm you down a bit.

Patient: I tried the wrist rolls for about 15 seconds — felt a hair looser, same as the others. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from collapsing when everything's still piled on and I'm running on fumes? Can we slow down and give me one more really tiny, discreet 10–20 second thing I can do at work that won't look odd — something concrete I can actually believe might help?

Therapist: Can you try placing your hand on the edge of your desk and gently pressing down on it with your fingers? Just place your hand there for 10-15 seconds, and focus on the sensation of your fingers pressing into the wood. It's a small, subtle action that might help you feel more grounded and centered. Try to do it without looking up or drawing attention to yourself. See if it helps calm you down a bit.

Patient: I tried that — held my fingers down for about 12 seconds. It eased the tightness a hair and I felt a little steadier, but I'm still drained and skeptical. Can we pick one more really tiny, discreet 10–20 second thing I can do at work that won't look odd and that I might actually believe will help — and give me a one-line phrase to say to myself if it doesn't?

Therapist: Can you try taking a sip of water from your cup? Just bring the cup to your lips, take a slow sip, and then put the cup back down. Try to focus on the sensation of the water moving in and out of your mouth. If you find your mind wandering or you start to feel overwhelmed again, try saying to yourself, "One sip". Just one sip. See if it helps you feel a little more centered.

Patient: I tried the sip — brought the cup, took a slow swallow, focused on the water for a few seconds. It loosened the tightness a hair, same as the others, but I'm still wiped and not convinced one sip will stop me from collapsing under all this. Can we pick one more really tiny, discreet 10–20 second thing I can do at work that won't look odd, and give me one short, neutral line to say to myself if that doesn't help?

Therapist: Can you try leaning forward slightly, resting your arms on the edge of your desk? Just lean forward for 10-15 seconds, and focus on the sensation of your arms and shoulders relaxing. If you don't feel any change, try saying to yourself, "Okay". Just say it quietly to yourself. See if it helps you feel a little more present.

Patient: I tried leaning forward and saying "Okay" — held it for maybe ten seconds. It eased the tightness a hair, but I’m really worn out. Can you give me one more tiny, discreet 10–20 second thing I can do on a busy shift that won’t look odd, and one short neutral phrase (two words max) to say to myself if it doesn’t help? Keep it concrete — I’m finding this hard to keep up with.

Therapist: Can you try taking one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of your body releasing tension? Just focus on the breath for 10-15 seconds, and then try to return to your task. If you don't feel any change, try saying to yourself, "Wait".

Patient: I did the slow breath and said "Wait" — it eased the tightness a hair, nothing dramatic. I'm still pretty wiped and skeptical — how is this supposed to stop me from collapsing when the workload hasn't changed? Can we slow down and pick one more really tiny, discreet 10–20 second thing I can do on a busy shift, and give me a two‑word neutral line to say if it doesn't help?
