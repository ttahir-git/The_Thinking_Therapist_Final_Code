Patient: Lately I’ve been feeling stuck — like everything that matters to me is just the job and I don’t know who I am without being a construction worker. If I try to change or figure out what else matters, I’ll mess it up, lose the steady pay, fall behind on bills, maybe get evicted and end up alone and ashamed — that’s the only future I can see. I know it sounds extreme, but I can’t shake that certainty; other outcomes just feel unrealistic.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "everything that matters to you is just the job"? What specifically does that mean in your life right now?

Patient: It means the job is the only thing that gives me any purpose — I wake up, go to the site, come home, and that’s where I feel useful; everything else fell away after the breakup and I don’t have hobbies or a circle outside work. If I try to look for something else or slow down to figure it out, I’ll bomb interviews or lose hours, the pay drops, I’ll fall behind on bills, get evicted, and end up completely alone and ashamed — that’s the chain I see and it feels inevitable. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but honestly that just sounds unrealistic to me; my mind keeps running the worst-case and I get stuck on it.

Therapist: It sounds like your purpose and identity are really tied to your work right now. What are some things that you value about being a construction worker, even if it's not the only thing in your life? For example, is it the sense of camaraderie with your coworkers, the physical activity, or something else? And what specifically would need to happen for you to feel like you could slow down and explore other options without falling behind or feeling ashamed?

Patient: I guess what I value is the routine and knowing exactly what’s expected — the crew, the physical work, the steady paycheck — it’s the one place I feel competent and not useless. For me to slow down, I’d need a real safety net: enough savings to cover months of bills, a schedule that won’t get cut, and someone or something to prove I won’t lose everything if I take a breath. But even if I did all that, my mind immediately runs the tape — savings eaten by a surprise expense, job lost anyway, eviction notices — so those “safety” plans just feel like paper against a storm. I don’t know, it’s like I’m stuck watching the worst outcome play on loop and I can’t make it stop.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trapped in a cycle of worst-case thinking. Can I ask you something a little different for a moment? Instead of focusing on the worst outcome, can you try to notice when your mind starts to go down that path? Can you catch yourself thinking "savings will get eaten by a surprise expense, job will get lost, eviction notices" and say to yourself, "Wait, I'm having that thought again"? Just notice the thought, without judgment or reaction. That might help break the cycle a bit. Is that something you'd be willing to try for just a minute or two?

Patient: I can try for a minute, but I gotta be honest — I’ve done that in my head before and it just… doesn’t stick. I notice the thought, say “I’m having that thought,” and then my mind just keeps piling on the next disaster like it’s on repeat, so it feels kind of pointless. Still, I’ll do it if you want me to, but I’m skeptical it’ll change anything.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. It's not surprising that trying to defuse the thought on your own didn't work for you before, since you're used to running through worst-case scenarios. Can I suggest something else for a moment? Instead of trying to defuse the thought right now, why don't we take a tiny step back from it? Let's focus on taking just one small action, no matter how tiny it seems. Would you be willing to just say one word to me right now? For example, could you say "yes", or "I can try", or even just "I'll take one step"? That's it. Just one small action.

Patient: Okay

Therapist: That's a great start. Can you say "yes" again right now, and mean it this time? Not just say it, but actually feel like you're agreeing to take a small step. And can I ask you what one small step you might take after this conversation, if you don't mind? What might be one tiny action that you could commit to taking, even if it's just to explore one option, to see where it leads?

Patient: Yes — I mean it. I'll move $20 into a separate "buffer" jar tonight after dinner. Even while I say that, my head's already on repeat — I picture the truck needing a tire next week and that money gone, but alright, I'll do it anyway.

Therapist: It's good that you're willing to move forward with that plan, despite your head's reaction. Can we explore what it means for you to move $20 into the "buffer" jar? What does that represent to you, and what are you hoping to achieve with it? Is it just a small safety net, or is there something else going on here?

Patient: It’s mostly symbolic — something I can point to and say I did one small thing for myself, a tiny buffer so I’m not literally one flat tire away from disaster. But my brain’s already screaming that the truck will need a tire next week or the heater will go and that $20 will be gone, so it feels like a bandage on a sinking ship. I guess I’m hoping it proves I can take tiny steps without everything collapsing, but I’m honestly skeptical that it’ll change how hooked I am to the worst-case story.

Therapist: It sounds like you're being realistic about the buffer's limitations. Can I ask you something else? Instead of focusing on whether this tiny step will change everything, why don't we explore what it means for you to take this step right now? What is it about taking this action that feels important to you, even if it's just a small step? Is it the sense of control, the hope that it might make a difference, or something else? Let's focus on the present moment, and what you're feeling right now.

Patient: Right now it feels like a tiny anchor — a small, practical thing I can point to and say I didn’t just sit and watch. I get a bit of relief in my chest, but it’s shallow: my hands are still tense and my mind’s already running the tire-or-heater scenario that’ll wipe it out. Maybe it’s about control and not wanting to be totally helpless, but I’m still convinced it won’t stop the next disaster — it just feels like postponing the inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're still feeling a bit stuck in this pattern of thinking. Can I try to help you explore this sense of control vs. inevitability a bit more? What do you think it means to you to feel like you're not helpless, but still convinced that the next disaster is inevitable? Is it like you're trapped in a cycle of "I can do something small, but it's not going to change anything in the end"? How would you like to break out of that cycle, or what would help you feel like you're making progress in a more meaningful way?

Patient: It feels like doing little things gives me a bit of control, but my brain treats them like temporary patches — I fix one thing and the next disaster’s already lined up to wipe it out. To really break out I’d want something concrete: like three months’ savings, guaranteed hours, and someone to keep me accountable while I try small steps, but even saying that I can already see the hours getting cut and the savings gone, so it just feels pointless. I don’t know where to go from here — it honestly feels like we’re just running in circles and that frustrates the hell out of me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and frustrated by the lack of progress. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel that way. Instead of focusing on the specific steps you need, can we take a step back and look at what's driving your desire for control in the first place? What is it about feeling in control that matters to you? Is it the sense of agency, the feeling of being able to make a difference, or something else? Let's explore that together.

Patient: Control matters because it’s the one thing that keeps me from feeling useless and ashamed — if I don’t keep a grip, I see the bills piling up, the job gone, eviction notices, and everyone thinking I’m a failure. I want the agency to provide and feel competent; it’s pride and not wanting that humiliation, but my brain insists any small slip will set off the whole collapse. I’m pissed and tired of the tape playing on loop and I don’t know how to make it stop — other outcomes just don’t feel real to me.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the fear of feeling useless and ashamed. Can I ask you to imagine a moment when you're not in this state of fear and self-doubt? What does that moment look like, feel like, and sound like? Is it a memory, a fantasy, or something that you've experienced recently? Let's explore that moment together, even if it's just for a few seconds. As we do, I want you to notice how your body feels, what your thoughts are like, and what your emotions are like in this moment. See if we can bring that feeling back into your awareness, even if it's just for a brief moment.

Patient: Okay—if I try to picture a moment without that knot in my chest, it’s like the few mornings off I had last summer: sitting on the back steps with a bad cup of coffee, sun on my knees, birds going, and the crew were off so it was quiet. My shoulders unclench a bit, my breathing’s slower, my hands don’t shake, and for a second my head’s not narrating disasters — I just feel... normal, a little warm, kinda content. But even as I say that I can already see it: take a day off, lose a job bid, miss out on hours, bills stack up — so the calm never sticks and I get angry at myself for letting it show up at all.

Therapist: It sounds like you're saying that even in the midst of this rare calm, your brain is already trying to predict and prepare for the worst-case scenario. That's a very human response, but it's also what's keeping you stuck in this cycle of fear and anxiety. Can I ask you something? What do you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to control the narrative in that moment? What if you just allowed yourself to be present with the calmness, without judgment or expectation? Would it be okay to just be there, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I wish I could — those few seconds on the back steps felt real and good. But the minute I try, my head screams that if I let up I'll miss the call about hours getting cut, lose the bid, fall behind on rent, and everything collapses, so it doesn’t feel safe to stay calm. I can try to hang with the feeling for a few breaths, but I'm already tense and pissed that I can't trust it — can we slow down? I don't know how to make that calm stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit suffocated by the need to control everything, even in the moment of calm. I'm not going to try to speed up the process or push you to do anything you're not ready for. Instead, let's take a step back and focus on one small thing: just observing the physical sensations in your body right now. Can you bring your attention to your breath, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or judge it. See if we can stay with that for just a few more breaths, without trying to add anything else to the mix.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try. Breathing in and out now... I notice it’s shallow, my chest’s tight, shoulders up and my stomach’s knotted. But of course my brain’s already on the tape: if I slow down I’ll miss the call about hours being cut, then the savings get eaten, and I’m evicted — so I tighten up and get pissed at myself for even trying. Can we slow down? This isn’t sticking and I don’t know what else to do.

Therapist: I'm not going to try to stop the thinking right now, because that's not how this works. I want you to notice the feeling of tension in your body, the way your breath is shallow, and the way your mind is racing. Can you just acknowledge those sensations, without trying to change them or judge them? Just observe them, like you're looking at a tree branch in a river. See if we can just sit with those sensations for a moment, without adding anything else to the mix. Don't worry about the thinking right now. Just focus on the physical sensations. Take one more deep breath, and when you're ready, we can try to explore the thinking again.

Patient: Okay — I took the breath. It felt a little easier for a second, my shoulders dropped a hair, but my head’s already screaming that if I relax I’ll miss the call about hours being cut, the savings will vanish, and I’ll end up on the street. I’m pissed and tired that the calm never sticks — can we slow down? What do you want me to do when that tape starts playing like that?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated right now. I'm not going to try to fix this or offer a solution. Instead, I want to ask you something. What would happen if, right now, you just allowed yourself to feel the way you're feeling? Not try to change it, not judge it, but just acknowledge it. If you felt comfortable doing that, would you say that's something you could try for just a tiny moment? Not to change anything, just to be with it. Can you do that for me? Just for a second.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to sit with it for a second. Right now my chest’s tight, my hands feel cold, and the tape in my head’s already yelling about missed calls, cut hours, savings gone, eviction — it’s loud and I’m trying to just name it: “I’m scared, ashamed, angry.” I’m doing it, but honestly I’m already pissed that it doesn’t calm the worst-case stuff — can we slow down? What do you want me to do next?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to say "I'm scared, ashamed, angry" right now. I want to acknowledge that those feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel them. It's also understandable that you're feeling a bit frustrated that naming your emotions isn't immediately calming the worst-case thoughts.

Can we try something for just a moment? I want you to look at that feeling of being angry, not at the thoughts that are driving it, but at the anger itself. Just observe it, notice what it feels like, where it's located in your body. Can you do that for me? Just for a second, and then we can try to explore it further.

Patient: It’s a hot tightness in my chest, my jaw’s clenched, my fists curl up, and my face feels flushed like I’m ready to snap. And of course the minute I show that anger I’ll lose my temper, my boss’ll write me up, hours get cut, the bills pile up, and I’m back to being evicted and ashamed — that’s the chain my head jumps to, so I can’t just sit with the anger without it turning into disaster. I can try to stay with it, but I’m pissed and frustrated and honestly need us to slow down — what do you want me to do next?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in this cycle of anger and fear. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel angry right now, and it's not about trying to calm it down or suppress it. It's about noticing what it feels like, where it's located in your body.

Can I ask you to do something for just a tiny moment? I want you to notice the sensation of your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Not the thoughts, not the emotions, just the physical sensation of the breath. Can you focus on that for just a second, and then we can try to explore it further? I want to help you find a way to sit with the anger that doesn't turn into disaster, but we need to take this one step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I’m breathing in and out, it’s a touch deeper than before but still tight in my chest and pretty shallow. Even as I notice it my head’s already on the tape: miss the call about hours being cut, truck needs a tire, savings gone, eviction — so I tense up again. I can try to stay with the breath longer, but I’m pissed this keeps happening; can we slow down and make the next step concrete so it doesn’t feel like useless breathing exercises?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really frustrated and stuck right now. I want to assure you that this isn't just about "useless breathing exercises." We're going to take a small step that might feel concrete and tangible, and it's going to help us build momentum.

Here's what I want you to do next. I want you to look at your hands. Just notice them for a moment. Feel the weight of your arms, the sensation of your fingers on the armrests or your lap. Can you just notice that sensation for a second? Not the thoughts, not the emotions, just the physical sensation of your hands in this moment.

And then, I want you to make a tiny decision. I want you to decide to do one small thing with your hands. It can be anything - take a deep breath, stretch your fingers, touch the armrest. Just make a small decision and take one tiny action with your hands. Can you do that for me?

Patient: My hands are rough and heavy, calluses on the pads, knuckles tight. I stretch my fingers out and let them splay for a second — and of course my brain's already yelling that if I relax it looks like I'm slacking, the boss writes me up, hours get cut, bills pile up, and I'm back to being evicted. I'm trying to stay with the stretch, but can we slow down?

Therapist: I can see that you're still caught up in the thinking, even as you're stretching your fingers. It's like your brain is always one step ahead, waiting to pounce on any sign of relaxation or vulnerability.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the thinking, I want you to bring your attention back to the physical sensation of stretching your fingers. Can you just notice how it feels to have your fingers splayed out like that? Notice the sensation of the skin stretching, the movement of the joints, the feeling of the air on your skin.

And then, I want you to add a sense of curiosity to that observation. What do you notice when you look at your hands right now? What do you see? What do you feel? Let's just explore that sensation for a moment, without judgment or thinking.

Patient: They’re rough — calluses, little scars, grease under a few nails, veins popping when I squeeze. If I look curious about them, I notice they’re what pays the bills; they’re proof I can do something useful. But of course my head goes straight to: if I slow down to notice, someone’ll think I’m slacking, the boss writes me up, hours cut, bills stack up, eviction — so I can’t even be proud without that disaster tape kicking in. Can we slow down? What do you want me to do with that?

Therapist: I can see that you're struggling to find pride in your work, despite the fact that it's what pays the bills. It's like your brain is constantly pulling you back down, telling you that if you slow down to appreciate your hard work, you'll be seen as slacking, and that will lead to disaster.

I want to try something different. Instead of focusing on the thinking, I want you to focus on the physical sensation of your calluses and scars. Can you just notice how they feel? The roughness, the texture, the sensation of the skin? Don't think about what they mean or what they represent, just notice the physical sensation.

And then, I want you to ask yourself a question. What would it take for you to be able to look at your calluses and scars without thinking about the catastrophic outcome? What would it take for you to be able to feel a sense of pride or self-worth in your work, without being controlled by that disaster tape? Let's explore that question together.

Patient: Honestly, it’d take something concrete — like three months’ pay in the bank, a guaranteed schedule from the boss, and someone I trust to check in with me while I try to feel okay about my hands — before I could even look at my calluses without that tape kicking in. But I can already see it: a surprise bill eats the savings, the foreman backs out of the guarantee, hours get cut, and I’m right back to being ashamed — so even the “concrete” plan feels pointless. I’m pissed and tired of this loop; can we slow down and make the next step something actually real and practical, not just more breathing exercises?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really stuck and frustrated right now. I want to assure you that we're not just going to continue with more abstract thinking or breathing exercises. We're going to take a step back and look at what's actually possible for you right now.

Let's start with something small. What is one tiny thing you can control in your life right now that you can focus on for just one minute? It doesn't have to be a big deal, just something small. Can you think of something like that?

And then, I want you to make a commitment to yourself. Let's say that for just the next 10 minutes, you're going to focus solely on that one thing you've identified. You're not going to think about your calluses, or your job, or anything else. You're just going to focus on that one thing. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can do that. I’ll move the $20 into the buffer jar right now and set the jar on the shelf so I don’t forget. Even as I say it my head’s already screaming the truck’ll need a tire next week and that money’s gone, but I’ll do it anyway. Can we slow down — what do you want me to notice while I do this?

Therapist: I want you to focus on the physical sensation of putting the $20 into the jar right now. Can you feel the weight of the money in your hand? Can you feel the movement of your fingers as you slide the bills into the jar? Can you feel the sound of the money clinking as it falls into the jar?

And then, I want you to pay attention to the jar itself. Can you feel the shape of it in your hand? Can you see it sitting on the shelf in front of you? Can you notice how it's positioned, and how it looks? I want you to focus on the physical reality of this jar, and this action, right now.

Let's take one moment to focus on this. Just notice the sensation of putting the money into the jar, and the jar itself. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I slide the bills in — I feel the crinkle, the weight in my fingers, and the clink when they hit the glass. The jar’s on the shelf by the calendar, a little smudged, looks small but solid, like something I actually did for myself. Of course my head’s already yelling the truck’ll need a tire next week and that $20’s gone, so it still feels like nothing more than a joke — can we slow down? What do you want me to notice next?

Therapist: I'm glad you're noticing the physical sensations of putting the money into the jar. Now, I want you to notice how you're feeling in your body. Can you feel the weight of the jar on the shelf, or the sensation of the air on your skin? Are there any areas of tension or relaxation in your body?

And then, I want you to notice your thoughts. I know your head is already yelling about the truck needing a tire next week and the money being gone, but I want you to gently acknowledge those thoughts. Can you see them, like clouds in the sky? Can you observe them without judgment or reaction?

Let's take one moment to focus on the present moment. Just notice your body, your thoughts, and the sensations in your hands. Can you do that for me?

Also, I want to ask you something. How does it feel to have actually done something tangible to take care of yourself? To have moved the money into the buffer jar? How does that make you feel about yourself and your abilities?

Patient: It feels a little good — like I did one tiny thing for myself, proof I’m not totally useless — but my head’s already yelling that the truck’ll need a tire next week and that $20’s gone, so the relief’s short and I’m pissed and skeptical. So yeah, proud for a second, then ashamed for thinking it mattered. I don’t know what the next real step is that won’t just get wiped out — can we slow down and figure out a concrete, practical next move that I could actually do without my brain predicting disaster every five seconds?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a mix of emotions right now. It's great that you're acknowledging the relief of having taken that tiny step, but it's also understandable that your brain is jumping back in with its usual negative predictions.

Let's take a step back and look at what you've done so far. You've moved the $20 into the buffer jar, which is a tangible representation of your efforts to take control of your finances. That's something to build on.

For the next step, I want to ask you something simple: what's one small thing you can do tomorrow to move forward with your finances, without putting too much pressure on yourself? It could be as simple as checking the jar to see if the money is still there, or making a quick phone call to confirm a payment.

I want to focus on small, achievable steps that you can do without feeling overwhelmed by your brain's predictions of disaster. Can you think of something like that for tomorrow?

Patient: Alright — tomorrow morning I’ll check the jar, count what’s in there, and take a quick photo so there’s a record. Of course my head’s already freaking out — phone’ll die, the photo won’t save, or I’ll forget and spend it anyway — so I don’t trust this will matter. Can we slow down and make that next step more concrete so it actually stands a chance of sticking (like where to put the jar or how to set a foolproof reminder)?

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a bit stuck again, with your head already predicting worst-case scenarios for checking the jar tomorrow.

Let's make a plan to make this next step more concrete and increase the chances of it sticking. Here's what I want to suggest: we'll create a simple system to help you remember to check the jar tomorrow. I want you to place the jar on the same spot in your kitchen counter every day, so it becomes a habit. We'll also set up a reminder on your phone, so it goes off at a specific time each morning. How does that sound?

Additionally, I want to encourage you to keep the photo of the jar's contents as a record, but also keep a simple log or journal of your progress. This will help you see how far you've come and give you a sense of accomplishment.

Can you commit to trying this system for just one week, starting tomorrow morning?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it for a week. Here’s what I’ll do: put the jar on the kitchen counter by the kettle, set my phone alarm for 8:00am labeled “check jar,” take a photo and save it in my phone, and write a one-line note in the little notebook I keep by the sink. 

But I’m already pissed my brain’s on repeat — phone dies, alarm doesn’t go off, I forget, I spend it, the photo never saves — so I don’t trust this will stick. Can we slow down? Help me pick the one backup I should actually trust if the alarm fails — what should I do next, right now, to make this feel less like it’s going to collapse?

Therapist: I can see that you're already feeling a bit anxious about the whole system failing, and that's understandable. Let's take a step back and focus on just one small thing that you can control, right now, to make this feel less like it's going to collapse.

Can you tell me exactly what your one-line note is going to say in the notebook by the sink? What is one single, concrete action you're going to take next time you check the jar?

Think about it carefully and write down exactly one thing. We're going to focus on just this one small action, and we're going to make sure it sticks.

Patient: One-line note (exact): "Check jar — count cash & write amount + date (do not spend)." 

One concrete action next time: count the money and write the exact dollar amount and today’s date in the notebook by the sink. I know my brain’s already screaming this won’t stick — phone dies, I forget, I spend it — so can we slow down and make a backup for that one action?
