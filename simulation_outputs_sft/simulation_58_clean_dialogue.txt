Patient: Lately I've been getting these spikes of anger and frustration whenever work or money uncertainty comes up — it just drags up the grief all over again. I'm a senior artist, so losing gigs or not knowing if the next commission will come feels like a constant bruise. I've tried talking and doing the usual coping stuff before, it doesn't work much, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's happening in your body right now? Where are you feeling this anger and frustration, physically? Is it in your chest, your stomach, your head? Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, our body can be a good guide. What's the first thing that you notice about how you're holding your body right now?

Patient: There's this tightness across my chest and a constant knot in my stomach, like I can't take a full breath. My shoulders hunch up and my hands clench before I even realize it. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help? I've tried breathing stuff and it doesn't stop the worry about not having work.

Therapist: I understand it's hard to see how noticing your physical sensations is going to stop the worry about not having work. But what if, instead of trying to control your breath or your thoughts, you could just observe them as they are? Can you try to notice the sensation in your chest, the knot in your stomach, and the way your hands are clenching right now, without trying to do anything with them? Just watch them, for a moment, without judgment. What does that feel like?

Patient: Alright, I'm trying to notice it — there's a sharper pressure across my chest, the knot in my stomach feels hotter, and my hands are tighter than before. Watching it doesn't calm it; if anything it feels like I'm feeding it, the anger gets louder when I pay attention. But I'm doing it because you asked — honestly, how is that supposed to help when the bills and not having work are still real?

Therapist: I can see that watching your sensations isn't calming them down, and it's actually making them feel worse. I appreciate that you're trying, though. It takes a lot of courage to keep showing up, even when it's hard. Can I ask you something about that? What would happen right now, in this moment, if I were to ask you how your day is going, or how you're feeling about not having work? Would that be helpful, or is that just something we've already explored?

Patient: My day's been...okay enough to keep me distracted—did some sketching but kept getting yanked back into worry, couldn't catch a full breath. When you ask about not having work it usually just makes the anger flare up—tight chest, hot knot, I get short and snappy. I'm skeptical it'll help to rehash it—I've talked about this before and it didn't fix the bills—but I'm willing to try if you think there's something different here; honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you're doing your best to keep yourself occupied, but the worry is still there. I want to try something a bit different. Instead of asking you directly about your not having work, I'd like to ask you how our conversation is feeling right now. Is it feeling helpful, or is it just feeling like another conversation about the same things? Sometimes, just noticing the tone and the pace of our conversation can be a good way to shift things. How are you feeling about this moment, just now?

Patient: I don't know — right now it feels tense and a little pointless, like we're circling the same drain. My chest's tight, jaw's clenched, and part of me is bracing for the next blow instead of listening. How is that supposed to help when the bills and the waiting for work are still real?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed right now. Your body is tense, and it feels like you're bracing for something to happen. I'm here with you, and I'm listening. It's okay to feel that way. Can we just take a pause for a moment, without trying to do anything or say anything? Just be with the feeling of tension and bracing, for a second. Sometimes, just being with it can be enough.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to pause — the tightness in my chest is still there, my breath's shallow and my hands stay clenched, and there's this low hum of worry about money underneath it all. I'm willing to sit with it for a bit, but honestly, how is just sitting with this supposed to help pay the bills or get me work?

Therapist: I can see that you're still feeling a lot of tension and worry, but you're willing to sit with it for a bit. I want to ask you something about time, because I think it's been on your mind lately. How do you think the way we're using time right now affects how you're feeling? Is it making things feel more manageable, or is it just adding to the sense of overwhelm?

Patient: It just feels like time is a countdown that I can't stop — the more we slow down or dwell on it, the louder the worry about unpaid bills gets and the tighter my chest becomes. Right now this kind of talking about timing mostly adds to the overwhelm instead of making things feel manageable. But okay—how is noticing that supposed to help me actually get work or pay rent?

Therapist: I understand that time feels like it's speeding up, and that's making things feel more overwhelming. I'm not asking you to change the pace of our conversation, but I want to ask you something about what's most important to you right now. What is it about having work and paying rent that feels so crucial to you? Is it about having a sense of security, or is it about something else? Sometimes, when we focus on what's driving our anxiety, we can start to see if there's a different way to approach things.

Patient: It's not just the money — it's about security and feeling like I still matter. Work gives me routine and dignity, and without it I feel adrift and ashamed, like I'm losing the last parts of who I am. I've tried reframing this before and it didn't change the bills or the waiting, so how is talking about my values supposed to help pay rent?

Therapist: I can see that this isn't just about the money, but about feeling like yourself. You're saying that work gives you a sense of routine and dignity, and without it, you feel lost and ashamed. I want to ask you something about shame. What happens when you think about not having work? What stories do you tell yourself about yourself? Can we explore those stories together for a moment?

Patient: I tell myself I'm useless and out of date — like everyone's moved on and there's no place for an old artist anymore. Then there's the blame story: I should've planned better, I shouldn't have trusted the market, I'm the one who messed up. It makes me feel small and ashamed, and also furious—at myself and at how unfair it all feels. But honestly, how is talking through those stories supposed to get me clients or pay the rent?

Therapist: Those stories can be really painful, and it's understandable that you'd want to avoid them. But I want to ask you something: what if, for just a moment, you could look at those stories without judgment? Just observe them, like you're watching a script or a scene from a movie? What if you could see the words, "I'm useless" or "I messed up," without taking them personally? Sometimes, when we can do this, we start to feel a little less charged, a little more curious. Would that be a small step for you to take?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that — when I look at the words "I'm useless" and "I messed up" they do feel a bit like lines on a page instead of me, but they still stab the same. My chest eases a hair and my jaw's still clenched; it sort of takes the edge off but doesn't change the bills or make clients appear. Honestly, how is seeing those words as words supposed to translate into actual work or rent money?

Therapist: I can see that looking at the words as words does bring a small sense of relief, but it's not a solution to the bills or clients. That's a fair point. Can I ask you something? What if, instead of trying to change the words or the thoughts, you could try to see what's driving them? What is it about feeling useless or like you've messed up that feels so painful right now? Is it the uncertainty about your work, or is it something else? Sometimes, understanding what's driving our thoughts can help us see if there's a different way to approach things.

Patient: I think it's both — the uncertainty about work and a deeper loss of identity. Losing gigs feels like losing the part of me that mattered, so the shame, blame, and anger all hit as proof that I'm slipping away. I get why you want me to understand what's driving it, but honestly, how is that supposed to actually get me clients or pay rent? I'm willing to dig into it, but I'm skeptical it will fix the practical stuff.

Therapist: I understand that you're skeptical about how understanding what's driving your thoughts will directly impact your work or finances. But I want to ask you something: what if, in exploring what's driving these thoughts, you were to find that there's a small shift in how you're thinking about yourself or your situation? Not a solution to the bills, maybe, but a small shift? A tiny crack in the armor of self-blame and shame? Sometimes, that crack can be enough to let a little more light in, to make it easier to move forward. Can we try to explore that possibility for just a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing a "tiny crack" in my thinking supposed to get me clients or pay the rent? I can kind of see, in theory, that if I'm less stuck in shame I might actually reach out or take a different step, but I don't feel that shift right now; my chest's still tight and it all feels abstract. I'm wary, but I'll poke at the idea for a minute if you think there's a real difference this time.

Therapist: Let's take a pause here for a moment. I want you to bring your attention back to your physical body, right now. Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about anything, just observe. Can you do that for me for just 30 seconds?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to do it right now for thirty seconds? Fine, I'll try. 

Okay: my feet feel flat against the floor, a little numbness at the balls of my feet and a dull ache in my left heel; the air on my forearms is cool but my neck feels warm; my breath is shallow, chest still tight but when I focus there's a tiny space on the out-breath where the pressure eases. It helps a hair, but I'm not convinced how feeling my feet is supposed to get me any clients or pay the rent. Is this just grounding, or is there something else I'm supposed to notice?

Therapist: You're noticing a few things that might be helpful. The feeling of your feet on the ground, the numbness and ache, the sensation of the air on your skin - all of these are just physical sensations. They don't necessarily have a direct impact on your work or finances. But the thing that's interesting is that moment where your breath eases on the out-breath. Can you try to focus on that sensation just for a second? Notice how it feels to breathe out and how the pressure in your chest changes? Sometimes, when we pay attention to that subtle shift, it can be a good sign that we're starting to create a bit of space.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — focusing on the out-breath... okay, I can do that. When I breathe out there's a tiny loosening under my sternum, like the pressure drops a millimeter and my hands unclench a bit, but the knot in my stomach is still there and my jaw's tight. I can notice that small space, but honestly, how is feeling a millimeter of relief supposed to get me clients or pay the rent?

Therapist: It's not about the magnitude of the relief, but about the fact that you're noticing it at all. You're paying attention to your body, to your breath, to the sensations that are arising. That in itself is a small step forward. Can you try to accept that this is progress, no matter how small it seems? It's not about the outcome, but about the process of paying attention, of creating a bit of space. What do you think about that? Is there anything else that comes up for you when you consider that small step?

Patient: I can sort of accept that it's progress, but when that tiny loosening happens it drags up that old failure and the shame spikes — my jaw tightens and I feel ready to snap. I get the point about creating space, but I'm stuck on the practical: how does noticing that millimeter of relief help me actually reach out for clients or not explode when a gig falls through? If you're suggesting this can lead somewhere, give me one concrete step I can try next that ties this noticing to doing something that might bring work — otherwise it just feels like rehearsing feelings with no payoff.

Therapist: I understand that it's easy to get stuck on the theoretical aspect, but I want to offer you a concrete step that might help bridge the gap. Instead of just noticing the relief, what if you tried to take a small action that feels connected to that relief? For example, right now, you could try sending a brief email to a potential client or a contact in your network. Not a sales pitch, just a simple "Hi, I'm reaching out to see how they're doing. Maybe we could discuss a potential project?" That's it. Just a small email. Can you try that for me? It's a tiny step, but it's a tangible action that might help you build momentum. What do you think?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to send an email right now? Just the idea tightens my chest and drags that old failure up so my jaw clenches and I feel ready to snap. I don't even have a clear list of contacts and I'm terrified of sounding needy or getting ignored; if you're serious, give me one simple, non-salesy sentence I could actually press send on without freezing, otherwise this just feels like one more thing I'll mess up.

Therapist: Let's take a step back. Instead of sending an email, can you just write one single sentence right now? Just a single sentence that you could send to anyone, without any expectation of a response or outcome. Something like: "I'm having a bit of a tough day today"? Just that one sentence. Can you try that for me?

Patient: Hi — I'm having a bit of a tough day and thought I'd reach out; no pressure to respond, just wanted to check in.

Therapist: It sounds like you're being genuine and non-pressuring. Before we wrap up, can you tell me how you're feeling right now? Has anything shifted for you in the past few minutes since we started this conversation? Is there anything else you'd like to explore or any specific questions you have?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm shaky and distracted right now: chest tight, jaw clenched, stomach knotted, and that tiny easing I felt when I wrote the sentence immediately pulls up that old shame so I almost freeze. Writing it helped a hair, but I'm anxious and skeptical it will get any work or even a reply — how is that supposed to bring clients or money? If we're actually doing something useful, give me one concrete next thing I can do in the next ten minutes that might move the needle (a subject line? a follow-up line? something to calm the panic so I can send more than one sentence), because I don't want this to just be rehearsing feelings with no payoff.

Therapist: I think what might be helping you right now is that you're feeling a tiny bit more connected to your own thoughts and emotions. That's a good sign. For the next 10 minutes, I want you to focus on crafting a simple email that builds on what you've just started. Can you try to write a single subject line that you feel comfortable using? Just one word or a short phrase that you think might grab someone's attention. That's it. Just the subject line. Take a few deep breaths and focus on that. See if you can calm down just a bit and get back to writing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want just one subject line? Okay: "Quick hello."

My chest's tight and I'm shaky right now; this feels too small and I keep thinking, how is that supposed to actually get work or a reply? If that's the subject, give me one tiny opening line I can paste into the body and one quick tip to calm me so I can actually hit send.

Therapist: "Quick hello" is a good start. For the opening line, how about: "I'm thinking about reconnecting with some old contacts and wanted to touch base with you"? It's a brief and casual introduction that can help set a relaxed tone. As for calming down, I want you to focus on your breath for just one second. Take a deep inhale through your nose, hold it for a brief moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. As you exhale, repeat the phrase "I can do this" to yourself. One time. Just one time.

Patient: Okay — I did the breath and said "I can do this" once on the out-breath; there was a hair of loosening but then that old shame spiked and my chest tightened and my hands clenched again. Give me one short closing line I can paste into the email body and one very simple, practical trick I can do right before I hit send to stop freezing (something I can do in 10 seconds). And be straight with me — how is this supposed to actually get me clients or money and not just be another rehearsal of feelings?

Therapist: I'm going to give you a simple closing line that can help: "Looking forward to hearing from you if you're free to chat." It's a brief and non-committal statement that can help you wrap up the email without feeling too much pressure.

For the practical trick, I want you to do something that's going to help you build momentum. Right before you hit send, take your phone and text me a single word: "Send". That's it. Just one word. It's a small action that can help you build confidence. It's also a reminder that you're not alone and that I'm here to support you.

As for getting clients or money, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This is just the beginning. You're taking a small step, and it's okay if it doesn't lead to immediate results. What's important is that you're taking action, which is already a huge step forward. The goal is to build momentum, not to get clients or money right now. Can you try that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I can't actually text you from here, and just the idea of doing anything right now makes my chest tighten and my hands clench. 

Okay, I'll do the substitute: I'll type the word now like I'm about to press send — Send.

Now be straight with me: how is that actually supposed to bring clients or money? And give me one very quick, physical 10-second trick I can do right before I hit send so I don't freeze (something I can actually do in the moment).

Therapist: I can see that you've typed the word "Send". Now, let's be honest about what this is actually doing. It's not magically conjuring up clients or money. However, it is taking action. It's sending an email, which is a tangible step towards reconnecting with people and potentially opening up new opportunities.

For the quick physical trick, I want you to do something simple: pick up your pen and place it on the desk in front of you. Just that simple action. Do it now, right before you hit send. It's a small gesture that can help you feel more grounded and connected to the physical act of taking action.

Patient: Okay — I picked up the pen and set it down like you said. There was a tiny click of focus and my shoulders eased a hair, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaky; I'm not sure I follow how that actually gets me work. Give me one more very short, 10-second trick I can do right before I hit send so I don't freeze, and then give me one exact single-paragraph email I can paste that includes subject, opening line, body (one sentence), and closing — something non-salvy I can actually press send on in the next five minutes. How is that supposed to help bring clients or money, concretely, if I don't get a reply?

Therapist: For the final trick, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4, hold it for a count of 4, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 4. This simple breathwork can help calm your nervous system and reduce physical tension. As you exhale, say the phrase "I'm ready" to yourself. Do this now, right before you hit send.

Here is a concrete email you can paste:

Subject: Quick hello

I'm thinking about reconnecting with some old contacts and wanted to touch base with you. I've been thinking about some new ideas and would love to discuss them with you. Looking forward to hearing from you if you're free to chat.

This email is a simple and non-committal introduction that can help you reconnect with someone and potentially open up new opportunities. Even if you don't get a reply, it's a tangible action that can help you build momentum and move closer to your goals.

Patient: Okay — I did the 4-4-4 breath and felt a tiny loosening, but then that shame spiked and my chest tightened again. I can paste and send that email, but I'm already bracing for being ignored or freezing up — how is that supposed to get clients or money if most people don't answer? Give me one short follow-up sentence I can send after a week if I get nothing, and one quick phrase I can say to myself the moment the shame or anger spikes so I don't snap at someone. Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and focus on concrete next steps if this doesn't work?

Therapist: For the follow-up sentence, how about: "No rush, just wanted to check in and see if anything has come up"? It's a simple and non-committal statement that can help you reconnect with someone without putting too much pressure on them.

For the quick phrase, I want you to say to yourself: "It's okay to pause". This can help you calm down and reduce the physical tension that arises when shame or anger spikes.

As for slowing down and focusing on concrete next steps, I think that's a great idea. Let's take a step back and focus on what you can realistically do next. Since you've sent the email, let's talk about what you can do to follow up and take care of yourself during this process. Can you tell me what you're feeling most overwhelmed by right now?

Patient: I'm most overwhelmed by the not-knowing — the bills, the waiting, and this constant fear that nobody will reply. My shame and an old failure flood in the second I try to act, my chest goes tight, jaw clenches, and I either freeze or get snappy, so the small steps fizzle out. I need one clear plan for if nobody answers and a real, simple thing to do in the moment so I don't freeze — and honestly, how is any of this supposed to turn into actual work? Can we slow down and make the next steps concrete?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on one concrete next step.

**If nobody answers:** Instead of getting overwhelmed, let's focus on the fact that you took a risk and reached out. What if you didn't get a reply, but that's okay? You can try a different approach or tactic in the future. For now, let's focus on what you can control.

**Simple thing to do in the moment:** When you feel that shame or anxiety spike, take a few deep breaths and say to yourself: "I'm here now." This simple phrase can help you ground yourself in the present moment and reduce physical tension.

**Concreting next steps:** Let's focus on one small, tangible step you can take in the next 10 minutes. Can you do something small to care for yourself, like making a cup of tea, taking a short walk, or doing some stretching exercises? Sometimes, taking care of our physical bodies can help calm our minds and reduce anxiety.

Regarding turning this into actual work, let's start with small, achievable goals. You've taken a risk by reaching out, which is a great first step. Now, let's focus on building momentum and taking small, tangible steps towards your goals. We can work together to break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps.

How does that sound? Can you commit to taking one small step to care for yourself in the next 10 minutes?

Patient: Okay — I can make a cup of tea in the next ten minutes, though I don't expect miracles. Before I do, give me one very quick 10-second trick I can actually do if the shame spikes so I don't freeze, and spell out a straight plan for what to do if I get no reply (one step after one week, and one step after two weeks).
