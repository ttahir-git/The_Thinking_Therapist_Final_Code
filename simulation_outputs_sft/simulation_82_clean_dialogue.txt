Patient: Hi — I've been really anxious in social situations lately, to the point that I avoid gatherings with friends even when I want to go. My colleagues at school are supportive, but outside of work I just feel overwhelmed and... I don't know. I guess I'm worried this avoidance is starting to take over my life.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in a social situation, even if it's with friends or people you know? What's the first thing that makes you feel anxious or overwhelmed?

Patient: I don't know... usually the first thing is my chest gets tight and my heart starts racing, and then I start sweating. I guess it's the thought that people are watching me or waiting for me to say something stupid. I'm not great at talking about it—it's embarrassing and I kind of want to change the subject.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of making a mistake or being judged is really intense for you. When you feel like you're in this situation, what's the first thing you do to try to escape or make it less uncomfortable? Do you find yourself leaving early, changing the subject, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... usually I try to make myself small or find an excuse to leave, like saying I have an early morning or I need the bathroom. I guess I keep my phone out or steer the conversation to something safe, and sometimes I just walk out if it feels too much.

Therapist: It seems like you're finding ways to cope with your anxiety in social situations, but they might not be serving you well in the long run. Can you think about what it would be like to try something different for a change? For example, what if, instead of trying to escape or make the conversation safe, you tried to focus on just one thing: listening to one person? Or what if you allowed yourself to feel anxious for a short time, just to see how it would pass?

Patient: I don't know... I guess focusing on one person sounds easier in theory, but I'm worried if I try that I'll just spiral or feel like everyone can see I'm nervous. Letting myself feel anxious feels risky too — I'm afraid it'll turn into a panic — so I'm kind of overwhelmed thinking about trying it; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of trying something new, and that's okay. Instead of focusing on trying to change everything right now, let's take a small step back. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling in this moment? Just sit with those feelings for a moment, and I'll listen.

Patient: I don't know... my chest feels tight and my breathing gets shallow, like I need to move. I guess there's this background hum of thoughts—everyone's watching, I'll say something stupid—and it makes my hands feel clammy. It's really uncomfortable to sit with; I'm trying, but I keep wanting to shift to something else.

Therapist: Let's just sit with this feeling of discomfort for a moment. You're already aware of it, and you're trying to sit with it, but it's hard, I can tell. What's one small thing that you could do, right here, to help you feel just a tiny bit more grounded or centered in this moment? Maybe it's taking one deep breath, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or something else entirely. Just one small thing.

Patient: I don't know... maybe I could take one slow, deep breath and try to notice my feet on the floor. Okay — I'll try that: a slow breath in, and out; my chest's still tight but my feet feel a bit more grounded. I'm trying, but it's still uncomfortable — can we go a little slower?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. Instead of focusing on the discomfort, let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and then leaving? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or focus on the discomfort. You're doing one slow breath right now.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel the air a little in my nose and my lungs, but it's still kind of shallow and tight. My mind keeps jumping to the thought that everyone's watching, so it's hard to stay with the breath — I'm trying, but can we go slower?

Therapist: Let's take a step back even further. Imagine that you're watching your breath right now, but also imagine that you're watching the thought that just came up - the one about everyone watching. Just watch that thought as it arises, without trying to change it or engage with it. You're not trying to stop the thought, you're just watching it. Keep that in mind as you breathe. One slow breath.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of see the thought about everyone watching, but then another one jumps in saying I'll say something stupid, and it keeps piling up. My breath is a bit slower but my chest's still tight — I guess I'm afraid if I stay with it it'll turn into a panic. Can we slow down a lot? I'm trying to stay with it but it's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's slow down dramatically. I want you to focus on just one thing: the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Imagine that you're standing on a calm lake, and a single ripple is forming on the water. Watch that ripple as it forms, and then watch as it slowly starts to spread out. Don't try to think about anything else, just watch that ripple. As you breathe in, imagine that you're introducing a tiny ripple into the water, and as you breathe out, imagine that you're watching that ripple slowly spreading out. Just the sensation of the breath, and the ripple. No thoughts, no distractions.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of picture the ripple, but my chest's still tight and the thoughts keep piling in — I keep waiting for the panic to start. I guess... can we slow down a lot more? Maybe just count breaths or go back to feeling my feet, because I'm trying but it's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's start with something very simple. I want you to focus on your feet. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them. Just notice the feeling of your feet. Don't think about anything else. One step: notice the sensation of one foot. Just that one foot. Not both, just one. As you focus on this, I want you to let go of any tension in your body. Release any tightness in your chest or shoulders. Just breathe, and focus on your foot.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel my left foot, the weight on the heel and a little tingle in the toes, but my chest's still tight. I'm trying to let my shoulders drop and breathe into it, but it's really hard — can we go even slower? I guess I'm worried if I focus too much it'll turn into a panic.

Therapist: Let's go back to the sensation of just one breath. Imagine that you're taking one very slow, deep breath in. As you inhale, imagine that you're filling a small space just in front of your nose. Just that small space. Don't think about your lungs or your chest; just that small space. As you fill that space, imagine that the air is slowly moving into your body. Just watch that space as it fills, and then slowly empty. Don't worry about the sensation in your chest right now. Just focus on the breath. When you're ready, we can come back to the foot.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of feel that tiny space at my nose filling and emptying, but my chest is still tight and my mind keeps flicking to thoughts like "they're watching." I'm trying to stay with it but it's hard — can we go back to the foot for a bit? It's really uncomfortable and I need to slow down.

Therapist: Let's focus on your foot again. I want you to notice the sensation of your left foot more closely. Imagine that you're looking at it from the side, and you're noticing the shape of your foot, the space between your toes, and the feeling of your heel on the ground. Just notice these details, without thinking about anything else. Don't worry about the thoughts or the chest tightness right now. Just focus on your foot. You can take one slow breath in, and then just sit with the sensation of your foot. When you're ready, we can come back to the breath again. For now, just focus on your foot.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my foot supposed to help with the panic? I can kind of feel my left heel and the space between my toes, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps jumping to "they're watching." I don't know, I guess I can try to stay with it, but can we go a lot slower? I'm trying and it's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back. Imagine that you're holding a small, tiny thread that's connected to your left foot. This thread is very thin, and it's almost invisible. Just focus on this thread for a moment. Notice its presence, its texture, its color. Don't think about anything else, just this thread. It's a tiny, tiny thing, but it's there. And it's connected to your foot. Just sit with the thread for a moment, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is picturing a tiny thread tied to my foot supposed to help with the panic? I can kind of feel my heel and the space between my toes, but the thread image feels odd and makes me want to shift away. I don't know, I guess I can try, but can we go a lot slower and just stay with the foot for a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's just focus on your foot again. Imagine that you're simply noticing your foot. No thoughts, no images. Just the sensation of your foot touching the floor. Feel the weight of your body on your foot, the sensation of the ground beneath you. Just notice these sensations, one by one. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly bring your attention to your foot again. Just focus on the sensation of your foot. One breath. Stay with your foot.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing my foot supposed to help with the panic? I can feel my left heel and the space between my toes, but my chest is still tight and the "they're watching" thought keeps popping in. I guess I can try to keep my attention there, but can we go a lot slower and can you give me one very simple thing to do right now so I don't start panicking?

Therapist: Can you simply notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils right now? Just feel the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. Don't think about anything else, just this sensation. Notice how the air feels as it moves in and out. Stay with this sensation for just one second. Can you do that?

Patient: I don't know... I can try, I guess. The air feels a little cool going in and warmer coming out, but my chest is still tight and that "they're watching" thought keeps jumping in. I'm trying to stay with it, but can we go a lot slower? It feels like I'm on the edge of panicking.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back. You can feel the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Now, I want you to notice just one thing about that air. Can you focus on the sensation of just one nostril? Just one nostril. Don't think about the air going in or out, just the nostril itself. Just notice it. It's there, right in front of you.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of feel my left nostril — cool as the air goes in, warmer as it comes out — but my chest is still tight and that "they're watching" thought keeps popping up. I guess I can try to stay with it, but can we go a lot slower? I'm really worried it'll tip into a panic.

Therapist: Let's focus on the nostril itself for a moment. Just notice the sensation of your left nostril right now. Can you feel its texture? Its shape? Its temperature? Just this one nostril. Don't think about the other nostril or the air going in and out. Just this one nostril. Just focus on it. For one second. Just one second.

Patient: I don't know... I can kind of feel my left nostril — a coolness going in, a bit warmer coming out — but my chest's still tight and the "they're watching" thought keeps barging in. I'm not sure I follow how focusing on that is supposed to help; can we go way slower? Maybe just count breaths with me or go back to the foot for a bit, because I'm trying and it's getting hard.

Therapist: Let's count breaths together. I'll start: 1... 2... 3... You breathe in and I'll count: 1... Your breath out, and I'll count: 2... We'll keep going together. Just focus on your breath, and I'll keep counting. When you're ready, we can try something else. For now, just breathe with me. 1...

Patient: I don't know... I'm trying to breathe with you—1—but my chest is still tight like it's stuck. I guess counting helps a tiny bit, but it feels awkward and I'm worried it'll tip into a panic, so can we go a lot slower or maybe go back to the foot for a bit? I'm not great at this and I'm kind of flustered.

Therapist: Let's go back to the foot for a moment. We were focusing on just noticing your left foot. Can you just sit with that sensation again? Notice the feeling of your foot touching the floor, the sensation of the ground beneath you. Just notice these sensations, one by one. Don't worry about the counting or the breaths right now. Just focus on your foot. We can come back to that later if you need to. For now, just rest with your foot.

Patient: I don't know... I can feel my left heel on the floor and a slight tingle between my toes, but my chest is still tight and that "they're watching" thought won't go away. I'm not sure how focusing on my foot is supposed to help—can we just stay with it a bit longer and go really slow? Maybe tell me one tiny thing to notice next so I don't start panicking.

Therapist: Let's take it very slowly. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your toes right now. Yes, your toes. Notice how the air feels as it moves in and out of the tiny spaces between your toes. Just that sensation, one toe at a time. Can you focus on that for just a second?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—air moving in and out of my toes? I don't know... that feels weird and kind of gross. I can feel my heel and a little tingle between my toes, but imagining air there makes me want to pull away. Can we just stick with the weight on my foot and give me one very small thing to notice next? I'm trying, but please go a lot slower.

Therapist: Let's stick with what you're comfortable with. Can you notice the sensation of your foot touching the floor right now? Just the feeling of your foot making contact with the ground. Notice the weight of your body distributed on your foot, the sensation of the floor beneath you. Just that sensation. One second.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my foot supposed to help with the panic? I can feel my heel on the floor and the weight there, but my chest's still tight and the "they're watching" thought keeps coming in; I'm trying to stay with it, but can we go a lot slower and can you give me one tiny, simple thing to notice next?

Therapist: Let's try something very simple. Can you notice the sensation of your breath moving in right now, as it enters your nostrils? Just notice the sensation of the breath as it enters your body. Don't try to think about it or control it, just notice it. It's right there, just for a second.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my breath supposed to help? I can kind of feel the cool air at my nostrils, but my chest's still tight and that "they're watching" thought keeps popping up. I don't know, I guess I can try to notice it for a second, but can we go really slow?

Therapist: Let's take an extremely slow breath together. Just one. In. (pause for a very brief moment) In. (pause again) Now, just breathe out. (pause once more) Out. Can you just notice the sensation of that one breath moving in and out of your body? Just this one breath. No thinking, no trying. Just the sensation of the breath.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow — how is just one breath supposed to help? I can try to notice it, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps jumping to "they're watching." Can we go a lot slower and count them together? I'm trying, but it's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's start with just one count. I'll count one together with you. Just listen to my voice counting, and focus on that. One... (pause) One. Just that one sound, one number. Can you hear it? Just focus on that sound for a moment. One...

Patient: I can hear you — one. I'm not sure I follow how that helps; my chest is still tight and my mind keeps jumping to "they're watching." I don't know, can you say it more slowly and keep counting with me a few more times? I'm trying, but it's uncomfortable.

Therapist: I'll keep counting very slowly, but I want you to focus on a tiny part of your experience. I want you to notice the sensation of the single sound "one" right now. Just that sound, just that number. Can you feel the vibration of the word "one" in your mouth? Just that feeling. One... (pause) One. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say it again with me: One... (pause) One.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow—saying "one" over and over feels odd and it's not really helping; my chest's still tight and that "they're watching" thought keeps barging in. Can we go a lot slower? Maybe just tell me one tiny, concrete thing to notice right now—something I can actually do without feeling weird.

Therapist: Can you notice the sensation of your toes on the floor right now? Just focus on the sensation of the weight of your feet distributed on the ground. Notice the feeling of your toes touching the floor, the pressure of your feet on the ground. Just this sensation. Take a moment to notice it.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my toes supposed to help with this? I can feel the pressure under my toes and the weight on my heel, but my chest's still tight and that "they're watching" thought keeps barging in. I guess I can try to focus on one toe if that helps, but can we go a lot slower and can you give me one tiny, concrete thing to do next? I'm trying, but it's getting hard.
