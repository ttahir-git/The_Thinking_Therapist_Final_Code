Patient: I've been avoiding get-togethers with my close friends because I get really anxious in social settings — my heart races and I overthink every little thing. I'm usually pretty outgoing at work as a software developer, but with all the family conflict lately it's getting worse and I keep canceling. I don't know, I guess I just feel uncomfortable talking about it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses avoiding social get-togethers due to increased anxiety in social settings, particularly after family conflict. Core emotion appears to be discomfort or unease. Goal: Explore how these feelings are manifesting in avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've been really struggling to balance your social life with these anxiety feelings. Can you tell me more about what happens right before you cancel plans or when you're in a social situation? What's the first thing that makes you feel anxious or uncomfortable, and how do you typically respond to it?

Patient: Usually it starts the night before — I just start replaying every possible conversation and worry I'll say something dumb or make things awkward. My chest tightens, I get sweaty and can't sleep, and then the morning of I find any excuse to cancel or say I'm not feeling well. I don't know, I guess it's this fear of being judged or not fitting in, and talking about it makes me... uncomfortable.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a pattern of anxiety starting the night before, manifesting as a fear of saying something wrong or being judged, leading to avoidance of social situations the next day. Core emotion appears to be discomfort, specifically around vulnerability. Goal: Introduce defusion to reduce the patient's emotional intensity and increase willingness to explore the avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of mental chatter about the potential for awkward conversations or being judged. Can you bring one of those worries up for me right now, without judgment? Just say it out loud, like you're telling a friend. "I'm worried I'll say something dumb..." Just hear yourself say it, without trying to problem-solve or change it. How does that feel?

Patient: "I'm worried I'll say something dumb or make things awkward and everyone will judge me." Saying that out loud makes my chest tighten and my hands feel clammy — I want to disappear. I don't know, I guess it's just really uncomfortable to stay with that feeling.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient acknowledges and intensifies their worry, showing discomfort with their physical sensations and desire to escape. Goal: Create a gentle space for defusion to help manage the patient's emotional pain.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal for that worry to intensify right now, and it's okay to feel like you want to disappear. Instead of pushing that feeling away, can we try to observe it for a moment? Just notice your hands feeling clammy and your chest tightening. Can you describe it in a way that feels a bit more neutral? Like, "My hands are feeling a bit sweaty right now." Just observe the sensation of your hand sweating, without trying to change it or push it away. How does that feel, noticing it just a bit more?

Patient: My hands are a bit sweaty and my chest feels tight, like a heavy pressure and my breath gets shallow. I don't know, I guess it feels weird to just notice it without trying to fix it, and I want to fidget or change the subject.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has increased their awareness of their physical sensations and feels uneasy with the lack of action. Goal: Introduce mindfulness of the breath to create a subtle shift in focus and reduce the patient's urge to engage with their discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that you're noticing the physical sensations without trying to change them. Let's try bringing your attention to something else, just for a moment. Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to control it or change it. Notice how it feels in the nostrils, the sensation of the air moving in and out. Just observe the breath, gently, without trying to do anything with it. How does that feel?

Patient: Okay, I tried that — my breath feels kind of shallow but I can notice it moving in and out. I don't know, I guess it helps a tiny bit, but my mind keeps leaping to what I might say or how people will judge me. It's getting uncomfortable and I feel like fidgeting or checking my phone.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to focus on their breath, but their mind is easily distracted by worries about social interactions. Goal: Introduce a small, low-stakes behavioral experiment to help the patient become more aware of their thoughts and physical sensations without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that your mind is still jumping to worries about social interactions. I'd like to try something else for a moment. Let's make a tiny, tiny experiment together. When you notice that your mind is jumping to those worries, I'd like you to gently say to yourself, "Thinking." Just that one word: "Thinking." When you say it, don't try to do anything with the thought. Just say the word, "Thinking," and gently let the thought pass. Can you try that with me now? Just one word: "Thinking."

Patient: Thinking. Okay, I said it, but my thoughts are still jumping — images of saying something stupid pop up and my chest tightens. I don't know, I guess it felt a tiny bit helping for a second, but mostly I just want to fidget or check my phone.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to identify the word "Thinking" as they think it, but their core worries and physical sensations persist. Goal: Gradually increase the patient's willingness to explore their thoughts and physical sensations without judgment or distraction.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you said "Thinking" just now, even though the thoughts kept coming back. Can we try something a bit more subtle for a moment? Instead of focusing on the thoughts themselves, let's try noticing the physical sensations again, but this time without saying "Thinking." Just gently bring your attention to the sensations in your chest, the feeling of your breath moving in and out, and the sensations in your hands. Try to notice these sensations without trying to change them or push them away. Just observe them, gently. What's showing up in your body right now?

Patient: My chest's still tight and my breathing's shallow, my shoulders feel hunched and there's this knot in my stomach. My hands are clammy and I keep wanting to fidget or check my phone. I don't know, I guess it feels weird to just sit with it instead of doing something about it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to acknowledge and describe their physical sensations without judgment, but they still feel uncomfortable with the sensation of sitting with it. Goal: Introduce a new perspective to help the patient see that their current experience is a valuable opportunity for exploration.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now, and it's hard to sit with all these physical sensations. But I want to gently ask you to consider something. Right now, in this exact moment, you're experiencing a very real, very present, and very physical way of being. That's something that's happening right here, right now. It's not just your thoughts, it's not just your worries, it's not just your fears. It's your entire body, with all its sensations, its tension, its relaxation. And that's something worth exploring, even if it's uncomfortable. What if, for just a moment, you let go of the need to change it, to fix it, to move it? What if you just allowed yourself to be with it, exactly as it is? Can you try that, just for a moment?

Patient: I tried to stay with it for a moment, but my chest's still tight and I kept wanting to fidget and check my phone. I don't know, I guess sitting with it just makes me want to fix it or run. Can we slow down? Or maybe shift to something more concrete—like practical steps I can use before plans so I don't bail?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to stay with their physical sensations and is looking for a way to slow down or shift their focus to more concrete, practical steps. Goal: Introduce a more grounded and actionable approach to help the patient build confidence in their ability to manage their anxiety before social interactions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like sitting with the physical sensations is still feeling a bit overwhelming for you. Let's take a step back and look at some concrete strategies that might help you feel more prepared and confident before social interactions. Can we explore some small, manageable steps you can take right now, before plans, to help you feel more grounded and able to handle your anxiety? For example, might you try taking a few deep breaths before leaving the house, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground? Or maybe you could try visualizing yourself handling a social interaction with ease? What kind of concrete steps feel most helpful to you right now?

Patient: I don't know, I guess practical stuff feels less scary than sitting with the feeling. A few things that feel doable to me are:

- Do a 3–5 minute breathing/box-breathing routine right before I leave.  
- Grounding: a quick 5‑sense check (name 5 things I can see, 4 I can touch, etc.) when I start to spiral.  
- Set a time limit — tell friends I'll stay 45–60 minutes so it's not open-ended.  
- Have a simple exit plan or a phrase ready if I need to leave, and a small role (bring snacks, help host) so I have something to focus on.  
- Prep 3 go-to topics or questions so I don't freeze trying to think of things to say.

I don't know, I guess those feel manageable. Can we practice the breathing now? I feel weird asking but I think doing it with you might help.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is looking for a concrete, practical approach to manage their anxiety, and they've identified several strategies that feel manageable. Goal: Introduce the breathing exercise as a tangible, shared experience to help the patient build confidence and relaxation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do the breathing exercise together, right now. I'll guide you through it, and you can focus on your breath. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, try to let go of any tension in your body. Feel the breath move in and out of your nostrils. Inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold again for a count of 4. Repeat this cycle a few times, slowly. As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest, the expansion and contraction of your lungs. Try to let go of any thoughts or worries, just focus on the breath. We'll do this together, for as long as you need. How does that feel, right now, as we breathe together?

Patient: Okay, that actually helped a little — my chest feels a bit less tight and my breath's a bit deeper. But my mind keeps jumping to worries and I still feel like fidgeting or checking my phone. I feel weird asking, but can we do another round? I don't know, I guess a short script I can say to myself before I leave would help so I don't overthink and bail.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to acknowledge a slight improvement in their physical sensations but still struggles with intrusive thoughts and urges to fidget or check their phone. Goal: Introduce a short script to help the patient build confidence in their ability to manage their anxiety and provide a sense of control before social interactions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another round of breathing together, and then I'll help you craft a short script that you can use to calm your nerves before leaving. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, try to let go of any tension in your body. Repeat the 4-4-4-4 breathing cycle. As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

When you're ready, let's move to the script. What would you like to say to yourself before you leave the house? Something to remind you to stay calm, focus on the present moment, and manage your anxiety? We can start with a simple phrase, like "I've got this," or "I'm ready," and build from there. What sounds helpful to you?

Patient: I don't know, I guess something like: "I can stay for 45 minutes. It's okay to feel nervous — breathe, be curious, not perfect, and I can leave if I need to." That still feels a bit long and weird to say out loud. Can we try shortening it and practice me saying it once or twice?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a script, but it feels a bit lengthy and awkward to say out loud. Goal: Refine the script to make it concise and more natural-sounding, and practice it together to build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
That script sounds like a good start, but let's try to simplify it a bit. How about this: "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave." Repeat that a few times, slowly, and see how it feels. Can you say it with me one more time: "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave." Just one more time. Good? Now, let's try it again: "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave." Just say it once, just for a moment, and then take a deep breath. How did that feel?

Patient: It helped a little — saying "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave" made my breath steadier and felt a bit grounding, but saying it out loud still feels awkward and exposed. I don't know, I guess I could try repeating it more, or maybe help me make it even shorter so it's less weird to use in front of people.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has found a slight improvement in their physical sensations from using the revised script, but still struggles with the awkwardness of saying it out loud. Goal: Encourage the patient to focus on the function of the script, rather than its form, and explore ways to make it more comfortable to use in social situations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on what's most important for you, which is having a way to calm your nerves and manage your anxiety before leaving. Instead of worrying about saying it out loud, let's try to focus on the benefits it brings you. How does it make you feel to have a way to say "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave"? Does it make you feel more in control, more confident? Can we try to emphasize those feelings, rather than the way it sounds when you say it? For example, we could try saying it together like a mantra: "Breathe, be present, it's okay to leave... breathe, be present, it's okay to leave..." Just focus on the words, the feeling they bring you, and the way they help you manage your anxiety. How does that feel?

Patient: It helped a little — repeating it in my head steadied my breathing, but saying it out loud still feels awkward and exposed. I don't know, I guess a one-word cue like "Pause" or "Breathe" would be easier to use in front of people; can we try that once or twice? Also, can we go over a couple simple exit lines I can use if I need to leave?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has found some relief in using the mantra-like repetition of the script, but still struggles with saying it out loud. Goal: Introduce a one-word cue to help the patient transition more comfortably, and explore simple exit lines that feel natural and safe.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try using a one-word cue to help you transition when you need to leave. What about "Breathe"? Just saying "Breathe" can be a simple way to remind yourself to pause, take a deep breath, and assess the situation. We can practice it a few times together: "Breathe" just once, then wait a moment, then say it again. "Breathe" again. How does that feel?

Now, let's think about some simple exit lines you can use if you need to leave. What would feel natural and safe to say? For example, something like "Excuse me, I need some fresh air" or "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can I take a break"? What's one or two simple lines that feel like they could work for you?

Patient: Breathe. Breathe.

Okay—some simple lines that feel doable to me: "I need some air," "I need a quick break, I'll be right back," or "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, I need to step out." I don't know, I guess the shorter ones feel less weird to say out loud. Can we try me saying "I need some air" once so I can see how it feels?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has successfully practiced the one-word cue "Breathe" and has identified a few simple exit lines that feel comfortable to say out loud. Goal: Provide a supportive environment to help the patient build confidence in using these new tools.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try saying "I need some air" together once, just to see how it feels. Go ahead and say it out loud: "I need some air." Take a deep breath and relax, just for a moment. How does that feel? Notice how your body responds to the words, and how it feels to be using this new phrase.

Remember, the goal is not to sound perfect, but to feel more comfortable and confident in using these phrases. You're doing great so far. If you need to, we can practice saying "I need some air" again. Or we can try one of the other exit lines you mentioned. Just let me know what feels most natural for you right now.

Patient: "I need some air."

Saying that out loud felt weird — my chest loosened a bit but I also felt exposed. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess it feels a bit like a bandaid and I'm getting uncomfortable, can we slow down or try the one-word cue again?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing mixed emotions after using the exit line "I need some air," feeling both slightly more relaxed and uncomfortably exposed. Goal: Reassess the pace and introduce a clear next step to help the patient rebuild confidence.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions, especially when trying something new. The goal is not to fix everything right away, but to build small steps towards feeling more comfortable.

Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. We can definitely try the one-word cue again, just to see how it feels. This time, let's focus on the physical sensation of saying the word, rather than the emotions that come up. Just say it with me once, slowly: "Breathe." Just the word, just the sound. Notice how it feels in your mouth, in your chest, in your entire body. Take a moment to simply focus on the sensation of the word.

We can also try something else if you'd like. What if we take a few more deep breaths together, just to calm down and relax? Or we can try saying the exit line again, but this time, let's focus on using it in a more natural way, without worrying too much about how it feels. Just let me know what you'd prefer.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the sensation of the word supposed to help? I don't know, I guess let's try "Breathe" once more. Breathe. Okay, that helped a tiny bit — my shoulders eased and my mind jumped less; can we practice the short exit line "I need some air" one more time, maybe in a few different tones so it feels more natural?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to build confidence with the one-word cue "Breathe," and is willing to try the short exit line again. Goal: Provide a supportive environment to help the patient practice the exit line in a more natural way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try saying "I need some air" in a few different tones to see how it feels. We can start with a gentle, relaxed tone: "I need some air." Notice how your body responds to the words, and how it feels to say them. Now, let's try saying it a bit more assertively: "I need some air." Notice the difference in tone and how it feels to say it in a more direct way. Finally, let's try saying it with a bit more brevity: "Air." Just the one word, with a slight emphasis on the end. Notice how it feels to say it in a more concise way.

Remember, the goal is not to perfect the tone or the way you say it, but to find a way that feels natural and comfortable for you. You're doing great so far. If you need to, we can practice saying "I need some air" again, in different tones, or try one of the other exit lines you mentioned. Just let me know what feels most natural for you right now.

Patient: Okay—trying the tones now: the gentle "I need some air" relaxed my chest a little, the assertive one felt weirdly performative, and "Air" was short and kind of sharp but might actually work if I'm panicking. I'm suddenly feeling more anxious and distracted though, my mind keeps snapping around and I keep wanting to check my phone. I don't know, I guess can we slow down and do the one-word "Breathe" a couple more times, or practice the short exit line once more so it feels more natural?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a shift back towards anxiety and distraction, making it harder to maintain focus on the training. Goal: Introduce a brief pause to help the patient regroup and refocus, before continuing with the training.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and pause for a moment. Notice how your body is feeling right now, and take a moment to simply acknowledge those sensations. You've been doing great so far, and it's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed or distracted. Just take a moment to breathe, and then we'll slowly start again.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice how your body feels. Just relax for a moment, and then when you're ready, we'll start again with the one-word "Breathe". You can say it with me, just one time: "Breathe." When you're ready, we'll try the short exit line again, but for now, let's just focus on taking it one moment at a time.

Patient: Okay — I took a deep breath and said "Breathe." It helped a bit — my shoulders loosened — but I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops me from bailing later; it still feels kind of like a band-aid. I don't know, I guess can we do "Breathe" a few more times and then practice the short exit line again? I'm feeling jittery and keep wanting to check my phone.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is seeking a more sustainable solution to manage their anxiety and is struggling to understand the value of the "Breathe" exercise. Goal: Introduce a new perspective on the "Breathe" exercise and explore ways to make it more meaningful and applicable to the patient's life.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that you're feeling a bit skeptical about the "Breathe" exercise, and it's normal to wonder if it's just a temporary fix. Let's try to explore it in a different way. When you said "Breathe" earlier, what was going through your mind? Was it just the physical sensation, or was there something else that came up?

Notice how your body responds to the words "Breathe". Is there a physical sensation, like your heart rate or breathing, that changes when you say those words? Let's try to tap into that sensation. Just say "Breathe" with me again, and notice how your body responds. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. How does that feel?

Now, let's try to connect that sensation to a specific goal or intention. What do you want to achieve when you say "Breathe"? Is it to calm down, focus, or take a specific action? Let's explore that together. How can we make "Breathe" a more meaningful and applicable exercise for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I said "Breathe" I noticed my shoulders loosen and my breathing steadied a bit, but my mind immediately jumped to “what if I bail” and my hands wanted my phone. I guess the real goal is to calm down enough to actually leave the house and stay for the time I set. Maybe "Breathe" would feel more useful if it links to a small action — like say "Breathe," take three slow breaths, tuck my phone away, and step out the door. I don't know, can we try practicing that sequence? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a clear goal of managing anxiety to leave the house and stay for the set time, and is seeking a more practical and actionable way to use the "Breathe" exercise. Goal: Adapt the "Breathe" exercise to incorporate a small, tangible action that links to the patient's goal, while also introducing a pause to help manage overwhelming feelings.

Therapist Answer:
It makes sense that you want to connect the "Breathe" exercise to a specific action that helps you manage your anxiety and stay focused on your goal. Let's try adapting the exercise to include a small, tangible action that you can do when you say "Breathe".

Let's break it down into smaller steps. We'll start with just one step, and then add more as we go. Can you say "Breathe" with me, and then take one slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth? Just focus on the breath for a moment.

As you exhale, notice how your body feels. Now, I want you to tuck your phone away for just a second, so we can practice this exercise without distractions. Take a moment to put your phone in a safe place, just for this exercise. How does that feel?

Now, let's add another step. As you say "Breathe" and take that deep breath in, I want you to think about why you want to leave the house right now. What's the purpose of leaving, and what do you hope to achieve? Take a moment to reflect on that, just for a second.

We'll add more steps as we go, but for now, let's focus on just this small exercise. Can you try saying "Breathe" with me, taking a slow breath in, tucking your phone away, and thinking about your purpose for leaving? Just one more time.

Patient: I don't know, I tried it — I said "Breathe," took a slow breath, and shoved my phone in my bag, but my hands kept wanting it. I'm not sure I follow how thinking about my purpose helps in the moment — I guess I thought "to connect with one friend" but my mind still races and I feel jittery. Can we slow down and do that sequence once more, step-by-step?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to integrate the new steps into their anxiety management, and is finding it difficult to see the value in thinking about their purpose. Goal: Introduce a pause and a clear question to help the patient reflect on their anxiety and identify what's driving their physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel like you're making progress, but then your mind starts racing again. Let's take a step back and try to understand what's going on.

When you said "Breathe" and tucked your phone away, what did you notice physically? How did your body feel, and what sensations were present?

Let's take a moment to pause and reflect on that. Notice how your body is feeling right now, and what sensations are present. Are there any physical sensations that are particularly notable?

Now, I want to ask you a question: What do you think is driving your physical sensations right now? Is it something that's related to your anxiety, or is there something else going on? Try to identify what's underlying your physical sensations.

We'll explore this further, but for now, let's focus on understanding what's driving your physical sensations. Can you take a moment to reflect on that, and then we'll move forward from there?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I said "Breathe" and put my phone away my chest loosened a bit but my hands stayed jittery and kept wanting it. My stomach's tight, my heart's kind of racing, and there's this buzzing in my head. I don't know, I guess it's mostly anxiety — there's this background stress from the family stuff and the fear of being judged or bailing that just amplifies it. Can we slow down? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about the causes.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to process and articulate the physical sensations and emotional causes of their anxiety, feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of their emotional state. Goal: Introduce a clear and gentle reassurance, acknowledging the patient's feelings and experiences, and refocusing their attention on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, and it's great that you're acknowledging the various sources of your anxiety. Let's take a deep breath together and try to ground ourselves in the present moment.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge how hard it must be for you to deal with all this emotional and physical complexity. It's not easy to articulate all the different sensations and emotions that you're experiencing. I'm here to support you, and I'm not going to rush you through this.

Let's focus on one thing at a time. Right now, let's just take a moment to acknowledge how your body is feeling. You mentioned that your chest loosened a bit when you said "Breathe", but you also mentioned that your hands stayed jittery and that your stomach is tight. Can you just acknowledge those sensations for a moment, without trying to change them or analyze them too much? Just notice how they are, right now.

We can explore the causes and sources of your anxiety later, but for now, let's just focus on being present with your body and your emotions. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay... I can try. My chest's a bit looser but my stomach's still tight and my hands are jittery. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing this helps later — I don't know, I guess sitting with it makes me want to run. Can we slow down and do one simple grounding thing together, like that 5‑sense check you mentioned?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is looking for a way to build confidence in their ability to manage their anxiety, and is seeking a clear and achievable goal. Goal: Introduce a simple grounding technique, the 5-sense check, to help the patient focus on the present moment and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try some grounding techniques. It's completely normal to feel like you want to run or escape when you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's take a deep breath together and try something simple.

I want to teach you a technique called the 5-sense check. It's just a way to bring yourself back to the present moment by noticing your senses. Can you try it with me? First, let's notice our sense of sight. Can you look around the room and notice what you see? What do you see right in front of you? Notice the colors, the shapes, the textures. Just notice what's there, right now.

As you look around, notice how your body is feeling. Is there any tension or relaxation? Let's focus on that sensation for a moment. Can you just notice it, without trying to change it or analyze it too much?

We'll go through the rest of the 5 senses, one by one, but for now, let's just focus on what you see. Take a moment to just notice.

Patient: I can see my laptop with the code editor open, a blue mug with some coffee stains, the couch across the room, a small plant by the window, and sunlight on the floor. I don't know, I guess noticing that helps a tiny bit, but my hands are still jittery and I keep wanting to check my phone.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is showing a small improvement in their ability to focus on the present moment, but still struggles with managing their anxiety. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder to refocus on the task at hand, while also acknowledging the patient's efforts.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're taking a moment to notice your surroundings. That can be really helpful in calming down and feeling more grounded. Now, let's take a look at your hands. You mentioned they're still a bit jittery. Can you just notice that sensation for a moment? Don't try to change it or do anything with it yet. Just observe it, and see if you can bring your attention to it without getting caught up in it.

Remember, you're trying to take care of yourself and manage your anxiety right now. It's okay if your hands are still a bit jittery. We can work with that. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to your hands. Just notice them, without trying to change anything. Go ahead, try it.

Patient: My hands feel buzzy and jittery, like a little tremor and I keep wanting to fidget. I can notice it, but I don't know — I guess noticing just makes me more aware and a bit panicky. Can we slow down and do the breathing-plus-phone-tuck sequence step-by-step again? I'm feeling kind of scattered right now.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to manage their anxiety and is feeling scattered, which is exacerbating their physical symptoms. Goal: Introduce a gentle and clear instruction to help the patient refocus on the breathing and phone-tucking exercise, while also acknowledging their current state.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel scattered and a bit panicky right now. Let's take a deep breath together and try to refocus. I want to walk you through the breathing and phone-tucking exercise again, step by step, so you can feel more grounded.

First, let's start with the breathing. I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you exhale, slowly say "Breathe" to yourself. Just the word "Breathe" is enough. Don't worry about your hands or anything else right now. Just focus on the breath.

As you breathe, I also want you to tuck your phone away for just a moment. That's it. Just tuck it away, so you can focus on the present moment. Don't think about checking your phone or anything else. Just tuck it away and focus on the breath.

Let's start again, slowly. Take a deep breath in... say "Breathe"... exhale slowly... say "Breathe" again. Just one more time. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: Okay... I can try. I don't know, I guess can we go really slowly? Say "Breathe" with me, then let me take one deep breath, then tell me when to tuck my phone and pause for a few seconds before the next step — my hands are buzzy so maybe count it out loud for me.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is seeking a very slow and gentle approach, which is suitable given their current anxiety and physical sensations. Goal: Adapt the instruction to meet the patient's needs, using clear and concise language to guide them through the exercise.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start very slowly. I'll guide you through the exercise, step by step. We'll take it one deep breath at a time.

First, let's take a deep breath in together. Say "Breathe" with me: "Breathe...". Now, take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you're ready, I'll let you know when to exhale.

As you inhale, I want you to notice how your body feels. Just observe the sensations in your body, without trying to change them or analyze them too much. When you're ready, I'll guide you through the next step.

Take your time. Just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I breathed in and I'm exhaling now. That actually helped a tiny bit, but my hands are still buzzy and my mind keeps jumping. I don't know, can you count slowly like "1...2...3" and tell me when to tuck my phone so I can try the next step?
