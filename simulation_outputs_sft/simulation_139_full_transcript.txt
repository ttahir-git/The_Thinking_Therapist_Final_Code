--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm an older data scientist and lately I've been worrying constantly about my performance at work. I find myself procrastinating because I'm scared of not being good enough, and then that makes the worry worse. I guess I'm just tired of feeling stuck like this.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses core emotion as being stuck, and there's a fear of not being good enough that's causing procrastination and increasing worry. Goal: Explore the pattern of avoidance and how it's impacting the patient's work and overall well-being.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you start working on a task at work? What's the first thing that goes through your mind, and how does that affect your ability to focus?

Patient: When I start a task, the first thought is usually that I’m going to mess it up or it won’t be good enough. That makes me hesitate — I’ll keep fiddling with small parts, reopen old analyses, or get lost in my inbox instead of making progress. I guess that just feeds the worry and makes it harder to focus. I don't know, it's like the more I try to force it, the more everything scatters.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's avoidance strategy of fiddling with small parts and getting lost in distractions is maintaining the worry and anxiety, rather than making progress on the task. This avoidance is unworkable. Goal: Introduce a process to help the patient make room for focused work.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the more you try to control the task, the more your mind is spinning. What if, instead of trying to control every detail, you were to give yourself permission to just start working on the task, even if it's just for a minute or two? What would happen if you were to commit to working on that one part of the task, without any specific outcome in mind, just for the sake of making progress?

Patient: I don't know — I guess in theory that sounds okay. If I tried it, I'd probably still stall, tell myself a minute isn't enough, or get pulled into my inbox. Maybe it would help a bit to break the perfectionism, but I worry it would just feel like slacking. Can you help me figure out how to actually stick to one minute without spiraling?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is hesitant to try a new approach due to fear of slacking and perfectionism, which are closely tied to their core emotion of not being good enough. However, this avoidance is not working. Goal: Help the patient build confidence in taking small, imperfect actions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with something even simpler than one minute. Can you commit to just opening up your project folder or turning to the next slide for the next 30 seconds, without doing anything else? Just getting your eyes on the task for that brief moment. What would you have to do to make yourself stop after 30 seconds? Would you look away, or try to focus on something else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could at least open the project folder for 30 seconds. I'd probably set a timer on my phone so there's a clear stopping point, and then look away or make a cup of tea when it rings. But I'm worried it'll feel pointless and I'll just drift to my inbox instead; I don't know if that would actually help.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a concrete action to take (opening the project folder for 30 seconds), but is concerned that this action won't have the desired effect and might even lead to further procrastination. Goal: Explore the potential benefits of this action and find ways to make it more compelling.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like having a clear stopping point with the timer could help you feel more grounded. Instead of worrying about it feeling pointless, what if, for the first 30 seconds, you simply told yourself, "I'm going to open this project folder and look at what's here. I'm not going to do anything else yet." Just observe what's in front of you, without judgment. Can you commit to that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try opening the folder and setting a 30‑second timer. I'm worried I'll just drift to my inbox though. Could you stay with me while I do it, or give me something small to focus on so I don't wander?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to try a small step, but is concerned about losing focus. A gentle guide or support might help them stay on track. Goal: Offer a minimal level of support while maintaining the patient's autonomy.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a minute to get you set up. I'll be right here beside you. When you open the folder and set the timer for 30 seconds, I'll ask you a simple question every 10 seconds to help you stay focused. We'll start with this: Just look at the first thing that catches your eye. What's the first thing you see when you open the folder?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the first thing is a Jupyter notebook called "modeling.ipynb" and a folder named "old_runs." Seeing them makes my chest tighten and I already want to check my inbox.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is getting distracted by the familiar sight of Jupyter notebooks and old runs, which is causing physical tension in their body. This distraction is also making them want to check their inbox, which is a typical avoidance behavior. Goal: Help the patient gently refocus on the task at hand without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and just acknowledge that feeling of tension. It's okay to feel that way when seeing familiar things that might be triggering. Now, I want you to notice just one thing more about that "modeling.ipynb" Jupyter notebook. What's the first thing that stands out to you about the title of this notebook?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's the word "modeling." It sounds imposing, like there's an expectation to produce something perfect, and that just makes me freeze up a bit.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is correctly identifying the word "modeling" as a source of anxiety, due to its association with perfectionism and high expectations. This is a good opportunity to help the patient explore their thinking and challenge their assumptions. Goal: Help the patient become more aware of their thoughts and learn to observe them without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just observe that thought for a moment. Can you notice how your body is responding to that word "modeling"? How are you sitting, breathing? Just take a moment to explore that physical sensation. What if, for just one more second, you didn't have to think about the word "modeling" being imposing? What if you could just observe it as a word, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow when I see "modeling." My shoulders hunch and my hands curl, and I immediately want to look at something else, like my inbox. Can we slow down? I don't know if I can stay with this for long, it feels kind of overwhelming.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing the physical sensations associated with their anxiety, including the tightness in their chest, shallow breathing, and defensive postures. However, they are finding it difficult to sustain focus, which may be due to the overwhelm. Goal: Help the patient gently acknowledge their limits and consider ways to gradually increase focus and build resilience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down, take a deep breath together. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. We can take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Can we stop the timer for just a second and take a few more deep breaths together? When you're ready, we can start again, even if it's just for a short moment. We don't have to try to do a lot at once. What do you need in this moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I need you to just stay with me and keep it simple. Maybe guide me through a few slow breaths and ask one small, easy thing every ten seconds so I don't drift to my inbox.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is requesting a more gentle and supportive approach, which may help them feel more grounded and in control. The goal is to maintain a simple and gentle interaction while still encouraging the patient to engage with their thoughts and emotions. Goal: Continue to provide a gentle and supportive environment while gradually increasing the patient's engagement with their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... How are you feeling right now, just physically? Is there anything you notice in your body, like a sensation or a feeling?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest feels tight and my breathing's shallow. My shoulders are hunched and my hands feel a bit clenched. Can you keep guiding the breaths? I'm worried I'll check my inbox if you stop.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure.

The goal is to continue to provide a gentle and reassuring interaction while acknowledging the patient's anxiety. Goal: Continue to guide the breaths and provide a sense of stability while gradually increasing the patient's awareness of their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice that, for a second. No need to think about anything else.

Patient: I don't know — my feet feel planted but kind of heavy, like I'm bracing. There's this sudden shame and frustration under it that makes me want to run to my inbox, and my chest is still tight. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? I don't want to drift away from this.


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Can you gently acknowledge the sensation of shame and frustration that you're feeling right now, without trying to push it away or judge it? Just notice that it's there, for a moment.

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how just noticing it helps. I guess I can feel the shame and frustration — a tightness in my chest and this hot knot that makes me want to escape to my inbox. It's uncomfortable and I don't like staying with it. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? I don't want to drift away, but this is getting a bit overwhelming.

Just say it, "I'm feeling this." It doesn't matter what it is, just say it. Can you do that for me, just for one more second?

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how saying that helps, but... I'm feeling this. It’s like a hot knot in my chest and I get this rush to check my inbox, and honestly it makes me want to look away. Can we keep doing the slow breaths? This is getting a bit heavy and I need you to stay with me.

Let's take another slow breath in together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Now, slowly exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... As you breathe out, I want you to bring your attention to your feet, just for a moment. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on the ground. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth. Can you feel that for a second?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my feet feel planted but heavy. The roots image makes me oddly embarrassed and that hot knot in my chest tightens, like I should just run to my inbox. I'm not sure I follow how imagining roots helps. Can we just keep doing slow breaths and have you ask one small thing every now and then so I don't drift?


--- Turn 14 ---

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's heavy and tight, kind of warm, like a hot weight sitting on my chest. There's this shame and frustration under it that makes me want to bolt to my inbox. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that helps, but can we keep doing the slow breaths and have you ask one small thing every now and then so I don't drift?

Just notice that, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: I don't know — I guess the air feels shallow, cool going in and a bit warm coming out, but it's all a bit tight, like it's stuck against that hot knot in my chest. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing it helps; there's a shame and frustration that keeps pulling me toward my inbox.

Patient: I don't know — I guess my fingertips feel a little cool and numb, like a tiny pocket away from that hot knot of shame and frustration. It's faint and I'm already worrying it'll vanish, so can we keep doing the slow breaths and you ask one small, easy thing next?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it feels like a hot knot right under my breastbone, like something tightening and pulling my breathing shallow. My face gets warm, my hands curl up like they're trying to hold something in, and there's this sick, metal taste in my mouth with a rush of thoughts — like error logs scrolling and telling me I'm failing.
