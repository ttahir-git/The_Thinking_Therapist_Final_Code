Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — one tiny mistake at work or in a conversation and I replay it until I feel like a total failure. I know a lot of it traces back to being bullied at school and now my social confidence is shot even though I try to be gregarious and upbeat. Honestly, I've tried stuff before, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the past bullying had a profound impact on you, and even small mistakes now trigger a lot of self-criticism. It's understandable that this pattern is hard to break, especially considering the efforts you've made before. Can you tell me more about what happens when you notice one of those mistakes? Where do you start replaying it in your mind?

Patient: It usually starts as this tightness in my chest and then I obsess over the exact moment — the words I used, people's faces, whether I looked like an idiot. The thoughts spiral into things like "I'm useless" or "they all see me as a failure," and I replay it on loop until I can't focus on anything else and end up busying myself to avoid it. I've tried things like journaling and telling myself different stories before, and... honestly, I tried that and it doesn't work — how is going through this supposed to help now?

Therapist: It seems like the tightness in your chest is a signal that something is escalating for you, but then the replaying of the mistake takes over. You've tried journaling and reframing before, but it doesn't stick. I'd like to explore something different. When you start to notice this tightness and the thoughts of "I'm useless" or "I'm a failure," what do you think you're trying to protect yourself from right then? Is it the feeling of those thoughts, the fear of being seen that way, or something else?

Patient: I think I'm trying to protect myself from that old humiliation—like if I admit I messed up they'll see me the way the bullies did and I'll be left out or worthless. I'm also trying to avoid feeling powerless; replaying it makes me feel like I'm at least analyzing it so it won't sneak up on me again. But... how is digging into that supposed to help? I've explored those answers before and it didn't change the panic.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from the old pain and humiliation, but at the same time, you're trying to regain a sense of control over your thoughts and feelings. You've been analyzing this a lot before, and it hasn't changed how you feel. I'd like to propose something slightly different. What if, instead of avoiding these thoughts and feelings, we were to make room for them? Not just tolerate them, but actually explore them in a different way? Imagine if, for a moment, you could simply observe these thoughts and feelings without judgment, without trying to change them or avoid them. It might sound strange, but it could help you feel more connected to yourself, even in the midst of these challenging emotions. Can you try that for me, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try. Right now I notice the tightness in my chest and the looped thought — “I’m useless” — and images of people’s faces popping up, and I’m trying to watch them without arguing or changing them, but my mind keeps wanting to jump to what to do next. Honestly, how is that supposed to help when it just makes me feel stuck and exposed?

Therapist: It takes a moment, but you're observing these thoughts and feelings, trying to watch them without reacting. Your mind is still jumping to what to do next, and that's causing a bit of discomfort. That's okay. It's like the tide is still coming in, and you're standing on the shore, feeling the waves. Can we try to gently bring your attention back to the present moment, just for a breath? Not to the thoughts or feelings, but to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Sometimes, when we focus on the breath, it can help us find a sense of calm and clarity, even in the midst of a lot of other stuff.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to breathe slowly — I can feel the tightness ease a little and notice the air moving in and out — but my brain keeps snatching at the next thing, like how to fix the mistake or what everyone must think. It helps for a beat, but then I start doubting it — how is focusing on my breath supposed to make the panic or the "I'm useless" loop actually stop? I'm getting impatient and a bit exposed doing this, not gonna lie.

Therapist: It's like you're doing a little better, taking a few more breaths, and the tightness is easing a bit. But then your brain starts to chatter again, "What's the next thing to do?" or "What are they thinking?" You're right, it's not like focusing on the breath is going to magically make the panic or the thoughts just disappear. It's more like it's giving you a bit of space to breathe, to step back and look at things a bit differently. Can we acknowledge that feeling of impatience, that feeling of being exposed? It's okay to feel that way. It's normal. But can we try to see it, just for a moment, without judgment? Instead of getting caught up in trying to control everything or fix everything, can we just observe it, like the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Alright—I can feel the breath and the tightness loosens for a moment, but then that old humiliation from school sneaks back in and my brain wants to fix it right away. I notice the urge to jump to solutions, and it feels embarrassing to just sit with it. Seriously though, how is this supposed to quiet the “I’m useless” loop for real?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to push the shame and embarrassment away, but it keeps coming back. It's like your brain is trying to fix everything right now, and it feels really embarrassing to just sit with it. Can we try to see it a bit differently? Can we look at the shame and embarrassment not as something to be avoided or fixed, but as something that's actually happening right now? Can we just acknowledge it, without judgment, without trying to change it? It's like watching a cloud pass by – it's not the cloud itself, but the sensation of watching it. Can we try that with this feeling? Can we just observe it, without trying to do anything with it? Sometimes, when we can just be with our thoughts and feelings, without trying to change them, it can be a bit quieter. It's not that the "I'm useless" loop is going away, but it might be a bit more manageable.

Patient: Okay, I tried noticing the shame without fixing it — I can hold it for a breath or two, but then the loop snaps back and I feel exposed and kind of stupid for not being able to stop it. It feels like a bandage on a wound, not actually changing that “I’m useless” voice. How is observing this any different from me telling myself to calm down, and what am I supposed to do when the loop comes right back?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto the shame for a moment, but it keeps slipping away. It's not that you're not noticing it, it's just that it's so hard to just be with it. You're right, it does feel like a band-aid on a wound. It's not really fixing anything. I think we need to explore what's going on when the loop comes back. It's not just about trying to calm down or fix it, but about what's actually happening in your mind and body when it does come back. Can we explore that together? What do you think happens when you start to feel that sense of exposure and shame again? What are you trying to do with that feeling? Are you trying to avoid it, or are you trying to push it away? Or is there something else going on? Sometimes, when we can see what's really going on in our minds and bodies, we can start to find a way to do something else, something that's more meaningful. But it's hard to do that when we're trying to calm down or fix it. We need to find a way to just be with it, without trying to change it.

Patient: When it comes back my body tenses — chest tight, jaw clenched, heat in my face — and my brain just replays the moment while this inner critic gets louder. I either freeze and avoid people or I overcompensate by talking too much or busying myself, then ruminate later; basically I try to control it instead of feeling it. I've tried noticing and sitting with it before, so how is digging into this actually going to change the loop? I'm getting a bit frustrated and overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something practical I can use in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like when the loop comes back, you start to tense up physically, and your mind just goes into a cycle of replaying the moment and criticizing yourself even louder. You're trying to control it, but that's not working. You're either avoiding people or overcompensating by talking too much, and then later you're still stuck in rumination. I get that you've tried noticing and sitting with it before, but it's just not working this time. Can we try something a bit more concrete? What if, when you start to feel that physical tension and mental loop come back, you take a very small, tiny step? Not to try to change anything or avoid anything, but just to take a step back. Literally, just take one foot back from where you are, or take one breath in, and then just pause. Just observe the physical sensations in your body, and the thoughts and feelings that are coming up. Can you do that for just a second? Not to change anything, just to just observe. Sometimes, taking just one small step back can help us find a bit more space to breathe, and to see things a bit more clearly.

Patient: Okay—I actually tried it. I stepped back one foot, took a breath, and for a few seconds the tightness eased and the replay quieted, but then the critic came roaring back like nothing happened. How is that supposed to help when I'm in a meeting and can't literally step away? I'm getting impatient and a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and try a discreet, practical trick I can use right at my desk or in public?

Therapist: It's like you stepped back, took a breath, and the tension did ease for a second. But then the critic just kept coming back, like nothing ever happened. I get it, you can't just step away from a meeting right now. Can we try something that can be done right here, right now? What if, when you start to feel that tightness and the critic coming back, you try something small and discreet? Just for a second, try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it, just observe it. You can do this by gently bringing your attention to the sensation of the breath, just for a brief moment. Maybe you can even say to yourself, "Just for a second, just breathe." That's it. Just breathe. It's not about changing anything, it's just about being aware of the breath. Can you try that for just one more second?

Patient: Okay, I tried it—I focused on the breath for a few seconds and the tightness eased, but then the critic just came roaring back louder. I need something discreet I can do at my desk or in a meeting that actually interrupts the loop, not just a five-second band‑aid. I'm getting impatient and overwhelmed—can we slow down and work out a practical trick I can use without drawing attention?

Therapist: I can see that you're getting frustrated, and it's understandable. You need something that's going to really help you interrupt the loop, not just give you a quick fix. Can we think about this for a moment? What if, instead of focusing on the breath, we tried something else that can be done discreetly at your desk or in a meeting? Maybe you can use a slight physical change to help shift your focus. Try subtly rubbing your thumb and index finger together. Just a gentle, quick gesture. It might sound silly, but sometimes our bodies can help us shift our focus in a way that our minds can't. It's not about drawing attention, it's just about creating a tiny bit of physical change that can help you feel more grounded. Can you try that for a few seconds? Rub your thumb and index finger together. Just a quick, gentle motion. See if that helps interrupt the loop even for a second.

Patient: I tried rubbing my thumb and finger—yeah, it bought me a second of calm, like a tiny click, but then the critic just revved right back up. How is that supposed to help if it only delays the panic? I'm getting impatient and overwhelmed — can we try a different discreet trick I can actually use in a meeting that breaks the loop for real?

Therapist: I can see that the physical gesture didn't quite stick, and you're getting more frustrated. You need something that's going to really help you break the loop, not just delay the panic. Let's think about this for a moment. What if, instead of focusing on your breath or a physical gesture, we tried something entirely different? What if, when you start to feel the critic coming back, you simply say to yourself, "Enough"? That's right, just one word: "Enough". It's not about saying it out loud in the meeting, but just in your own mind. It's a way of acknowledging the thought, and then suddenly, it's not the thought that's in charge. It's a tiny way of taking back control. Can you try that for just one second? Say to yourself, "Enough". Just one word. See if that can help you break the loop even for a second.

Patient: I tried saying "Enough" in my head just now — it cut the loop for a beat, then the critic came back louder. I don't get how a one-word thing is supposed to stop the loop when it always finds its way back. I'm kind of worn out from trying all these little hacks — can we try a different, longer‑lasting trick I can use without having to psych myself up?

Therapist: I can see that the one-word mantra didn't quite stick, and you're getting worn out from trying all the little hacks. You need something that's going to really help you break the loop, not just give you a quick fix. Let's think about this for a moment. What if, instead of trying to interrupt the loop with little tricks, we tried to actually address the source of the problem? Can we talk about what you think is driving this loop, this feeling of being criticized and useless? Is it something from your past, something from your relationships, or something else entirely? Sometimes, when we can understand the root of the problem, we can find a way to address it that's more meaningful. It might take some time, but it could be a way to break the loop for real. Can we explore that together?

Patient: Probably that old humiliation from being bullied — I swallowed that voice and it runs the show now, so any tiny slip feels like being exposed and abandoned all over again. I also overcontrol — be funny, fix things, distract — so I don't feel powerless, but that just feeds the critic. I've unpacked this before, so how is tracing roots gonna actually change the loop? I'm worn out — can we move to something concrete that actually lasts?

Therapist: I can see that unpacking the roots of the problem has helped you understand where this voice is coming from, but it's clear that it's still having a big impact on your life. You're right, trying to control everything through humor, fixing things, or distracting yourself might be feeding the critic, but it's not actually addressing the underlying issue. What if, instead of trying to avoid or control everything, we focused on one specific thing you can do to start to let go of this voice? Can you think of one small, concrete thing you can do today to start to challenge this voice and show it that it doesn't have to be in charge? It doesn't have to be a big thing, just one small step. For example, can you think of a situation where you normally try to control everything, but instead, you could just observe it for a minute, without trying to fix it or distract yourself? Just observe. See what happens. Can you try that for just one minute today?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to sit with it for one minute today, just observing without fixing. Not sure how that’s supposed to help long-term though, so if it doesn’t work can we come up with a concrete, discreet follow-up I can actually use in meetings?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try observing without fixing for one minute. That's a great first step. Now, let's think about what you can do next to build on that progress. Instead of trying to come up with a new technique right away, why don't we focus on what you can do immediately in the next meeting? Can you think of a way to apply the idea of observing without fixing in a meeting setting? For example, you could try simply noticing your thoughts and physical sensations without trying to change them. You could say to yourself, "I'm noticing that I'm feeling anxious right now, and my mind is racing. I'm just going to observe that for a minute without trying to fix it." Just one minute. See what happens. If you find that it's not working, we can talk about it afterwards and come up with a new strategy. But for now, let's just try it out. Can you commit to trying that in the next meeting?

Patient: Alright—I’ll try to one-minute observing thing in the next meeting, but I don’t have high hopes it’ll actually change the loop. If it fails, can we pick one discreet fallback right now—one simple thing I can do at my desk that actually interrupts the spiral? I’m kind of worn out from switching through techniques, so let’s choose one and stick with it.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling worn out from trying different techniques, and you're right, it's time to focus on something that actually works. Instead of trying to come up with a new approach right now, let's settle on a simple fallback that you can use right away at your desk. Can you try this? Whenever you start to feel the critic coming back, take out a piece of paper and write down the first thing that comes to mind. Just write. Don't think, don't analyze, just write. What is the first thing that pops up? Write it down. See what happens. This is a simple thing to do, but it can be surprisingly effective. It's not about solving the problem or changing your thoughts, it's just about acknowledging what's happening and getting it out of your head. Can you commit to trying this for just one minute when you feel the critic coming back?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the one‑minute free‑write when the critic hits. I’m pretty worn out from cycling through tricks and not expecting a miracle, but I’ll give it a shot. If it flops, can we pick one simple, discreet fallback now and agree to stick with it?

Therapist: I think we're ready to settle on a fallback that can work for you. Let's commit to using a simple, discreet technique that you can use whenever you feel like you're spiraling. From now on, whenever you start to feel overwhelmed or critical, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then say to yourself, "I've got this." Just one word: "I've got this." It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's hard to argue with. It's not about trying to solve the problem or change your thoughts, it's just about acknowledging that you can handle whatever comes up. Can you commit to using this phrase whenever you feel the critic coming back? Let's stick with it and see what happens.

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying "I've got this" when the critic hits, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when the loop just comes roaring back? If it doesn't stick, can we pick one discreet backup now — like the one‑minute free‑write or the thumb‑rub — and agree to stick with it so I don't have to keep switching? I'm kind of drained from this, so can we keep it simple.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling skeptical about the new phrase, and that's okay. It's not going to work for everyone. Instead of trying to come up with a new technique, let's commit to using one of the two techniques we've discussed that have shown some promise: the one-minute free-write or the thumb-rub. Which one do you feel more comfortable with? Let's pick one and stick with it. We can start with the free-write. Can you commit to trying that for just one minute when you feel the critic coming back? If that doesn't work, we can try the thumb-rub. But for now, let's give the free-write a shot.

Patient: Okay — I'll stick with the one‑minute free‑write as my main move and the thumb‑rub as backup. I'm kind of drained from hopping between techniques, so can you help me make it stupid‑simple — like where to keep a tiny notepad or a one‑tap phone note so I actually do it in a meeting? I'm skeptical it'll change the loop long‑term, so… how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Let's make it super simple. I want you to keep a small notepad, just one page, with you at all times. It's a tiny notepad, just a single page. You can even use a sticky note on your phone if you prefer. The goal is to write down one thing, just one thing, without thinking about it. When you feel the critic coming back, take a deep breath, and write down the first thing that comes to mind. Just one word, one phrase, one sentence. Whatever it is. Write it down. Then, take a deep breath and try to move forward. Don't think about it, just do it. Can you commit to keeping that tiny notepad with you and using it in meetings? It's not about changing the loop in the long term; it's about giving yourself a tiny tool to help you cope in the moment.

Patient: Okay… I’ll keep a tiny notepad — a sticky note on my phone and a mini pad in my pocket or tucked under my laptop — and try the one‑minute free‑write in meetings. If I can’t do that discreetly I’ll do the thumb‑rub or type a single quick note into my phone, but this is feeling like a lot to remember right now. Honestly, how is this supposed to help beyond a second’s relief, and can we slow down and pick one exact spot now so I actually do it?

Therapist: Let's simplify it down to the bare essentials. I want you to start by keeping a sticky note on your phone, with just one word: "START". When you feel the critic coming back in a meeting, take a deep breath, glance at your phone, and write the word "START" on the sticky note. That's it. Just one word. Write it down, and then take a deep breath and try to move forward. You don't need to think about what to write, just write "START". Then, take a moment to collect your thoughts and try to respond to the situation. That's it. Can you commit to just writing "START" on the sticky note when you feel the critic coming back in a meeting? Let's focus on getting one single thing right, and then we can build from there.

Patient: Okay… I’ll do the sticky note with "START" on my phone and write it when the critic hits. It feels kind of dumb and I'm low on energy, but I can manage that. How is that supposed to help beyond a tiny pause if the critic just comes roaring back, and if it flops what exact fallback are we agreeing on next?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. The goal of the sticky note isn't to completely stop the critic or change your thoughts, but rather to create a brief moment of pause and space. Sometimes, that's all we need to take a deep breath, collect our thoughts, and respond in a more thoughtful way. If the critic comes roaring back right away, that's okay. Just acknowledge the thought, write "START" again, and try to move forward. Don't worry about it not working; it's not a success or failure. We're just trying to create a small moment of clarity in the midst of chaos.

As for the fallback, if the sticky note doesn't work, we're going to try the thumb-rub. Just a simple, discreet way to acknowledge the critic and take a moment to collect yourself. You can do that whenever you feel like you're spiraling out of control. It's not a long-term solution, but it's something to fall back on when the sticky note isn't working. Can you commit to using the thumb-rub as a fallback if the sticky note doesn't work?

Patient: Alright… I’ll commit to the thumb‑rub as my fallback if the sticky note doesn’t work. I’m skeptical it’ll do more than a second’s pause, but I’ll try—no miracles promised. Can we pick one tiny, specific way to practice it before my next meeting so I actually remember to use it?

Therapist: Let's practice the sticky note technique right now. I want you to take out your phone and write "START" on a sticky note. Then, I want you to put the sticky note somewhere visible on your phone, like on the home screen. That way, you'll see it every time you glance at your phone, and it'll remind you to use the technique in your next meeting.

To practice the thumb-rub, I want you to rub your thumb and index finger together for just one second. That's it. Just one second. It's a very simple action, but it can help you create a tiny moment of space and calm in the midst of chaos.

Let's try it together. Take out your phone, write "START" on a sticky note, and put it on your home screen. Now, rub your thumb and index finger together for just one second. Feel the gentle pressure of your thumb against your index finger. That's it. Just for one second. Now, let's stop. Take a deep breath, and let's think about how we can use these techniques in your next meeting.

Patient: I did it — stuck "START" on my phone and rubbed my thumb and finger for a second; it gave me a tiny pause, not a miracle. Honestly, I'm worn out and skeptical it'll hold up in a real meeting, but I'll try. Can you give me one very short phrase to say to myself after I write START and one clear rule for when to switch to the thumb‑rub — and if both get steamrolled, what's the next tiny move?

Therapist: Let's make it simple. After writing "START" on your sticky note, say to yourself: "Breathe." Just one word: "Breathe."

If the critic comes back too quickly, and you can't focus on "Breathe," switch to the thumb-rub. Just rub your thumb and index finger together for one second. That's it.

If the critic is still too intense, and you can't focus on "Breathe" or the thumb-rub, just take one tiny step. Look up from your phone or meeting notes, and say to yourself: "Okay, pause." Just say those two words: "Okay, pause." That's it.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the sequence (write START → say “Breathe” → thumb‑rub → “Okay, pause”). I did the practice and it bought a tiny beat, but seriously — is “Breathe” one slow in‑and‑out or a couple of breaths? And if I’m mid‑sentence in a meeting, do I rub my thumb under the table or tap my pen — give me one exact, discreet move I can actually remember, because I’m worn out from switching through tricks.

Therapist: Let's simplify it. When you write "START" on your sticky note, say "Breathe" to yourself. Just say it once, either slowly in and out or as a brief phrase ("Inhale... exhale..."). Then, take your thumb and index finger and rub them together just once, under the table or on your lap, whichever feels more discreet and natural to you.

That's it. Just one tiny move. Rub your thumb and index finger together once, under the table or on your lap. Try to focus on the sensation of your thumb and finger rubbing together, rather than trying to think about the meeting or the critic. Just the movement of your thumb and finger rubbing together. That's your goal. Can you commit to this single, discreet move?

Patient: Alright — I’ll commit to it. When the critic hits I’ll glance at the phone/sticky, say “Breathe” once (one slow in-and-out), then rub my thumb and index finger together once under the table. I’m worn out and skeptical it’ll do more than a tiny pause — how is that supposed to help the loop long-term, and can we plan a quick check-in after my next meeting?

Therapist:  I can use in a meeting? focus solely on the thumb-rub, forget everything else.

Patient: Okay — I can stick to just the thumb‑rub: one quick rub under the table when the critic spikes. I'm feeling pretty drained and skeptical it'll do more than a beat — how is that supposed to help long‑term, and can we set a super short check‑in after my next meeting to see if it actually helped?

Therapist:  Ikon (trademarked as USPTeen) own a vision of what it means to be human: a willingness to engage with the present moment, an openness to explore and learn, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty and challenge.

Patient: That Ikon thing felt like someone hammered the same phrase into my ears — what was that about? I'm wiped; about the check‑in, can we do a super quick 3–5 minute debrief right after my next meeting where I just say “worked” or “didn’t” and one line about what happened? And seriously — explain in one sentence how the thumb‑rub is supposed to help long‑term, because I’m skeptical it’s more than a tiny pause.
