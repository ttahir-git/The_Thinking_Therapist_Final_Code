Patient: I'm an older software developer, and lately my mind keeps predicting disaster at work — I can see myself missing a deadline, breaking the build, my manager firing me, and everything spiraling into ruin, like that's definitely what's going to happen. Because I keep expecting that, I freeze up and procrastinate on tasks instead of starting them. I don't see any other realistic outcome.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "realistic outcome"? What are some other possibilities that might happen in these situations, apart from the worst-case scenarios that come up for you?

Patient: When I say "realistic," I mean what my brain spits out as the inevitable chain of events — miss a deadline, break the build, get called into a meeting, get fired, and everything collapses after that. I can see the other possibilities — maybe I catch the bug before it ships, a teammate helps, the manager gives an extension, or the client is forgiving — but that feels like wishful thinking, like a story someone tells to calm themselves. I just can't make myself believe those softer outcomes are likely because my head is already racing through the worst-case script and that feels like the only thing that makes sense.

Therapist: I want to gently challenge the idea that you can only see two possibilities: the worst-case scenario or softer outcomes that feel like "wishful thinking." Can you try to imagine a different story for what might happen if you were to successfully identify and fix the bug before it ships? What would that even look like, and how would it feel to be in that situation?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, but it already feels like a setup for disappointment. In the other story I find the bug in local testing, write a clean fix, run the unit and integration tests, CI goes green, a teammate reviews it quickly, it merges, and the release goes out without a hitch — my manager pats me on the back, the client sends a thank-you, and I actually feel this huge weight lift, like my chest unclenches and I get this burst of energy and relief that makes me want to tackle the next thing. It would feel almost embarrassing how small that relief is compared to the panic I usually expect. But honestly, even as I picture that, my brain says that’s just a lull before the next disaster — that some other problem will pop up or someone will notice a mistake later, so it still feels unrealistic.

Therapist: I notice that you're trying to acknowledge and even imagine the positive outcome in a fairly vivid way. That takes a lot of courage. Can we try to take it even further? Instead of just imagining the positive outcome, what if we actually started to believe it? What if we started to truly feel like that relief and energy, and let it build from there? It might feel strange at first, but what if we just started to imagine that feeling, even if we don't know how it's going to pan out in the long run? Can we try to do that for a second?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — when I let myself, there's this tiny unclenching in my chest, like a bright pocket of relief and my hands actually itch to get back to the code and keep going. But almost immediately my head yells that it's a setup — that calm is a trap, the bug will sneak back in, someone will notice later, I'll get blamed and fired, and everything will collapse, so that little buzz already feels fake. I can sit with the feeling for a second, but I'm watching the door waiting for the fall.

Therapist: I notice that you're able to acknowledge the thinking as it comes up, and that's a good start. Can you try to observe the thinking without judgment, just for a second? Let's say, for example, "Ah, my brain is telling me it's a setup again." Just acknowledge that thought, without trying to fight it or accept it. What happens when you do that? Can we try that for a second?

Patient: "Ah, my brain is telling me it's a setup again." When I say that out loud there's this tiny slackening — my chest loosens a notch and I can actually breathe for a second — but it only lasts a beat before the machine revs up, rehearsing missing the deadline, breaking the build, getting called in, and then fired. Acknowledging it helps a little, but I can't stop myself from sliding right back into the disaster script, and then I freeze and procrastinate.

Therapist: Let's try something. Instead of immediately getting caught up in the catastrophic thinking, I want you to make a tiny commitment to yourself. Just for 30 seconds, can you commit to doing one small, low-stakes action towards the task at hand? It can be as simple as picking up your pen, or opening a new tab on your computer. Not to achieve a specific outcome, but just to take that first small step. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can try that. I'm going to open a new tab and just stare at the task for 30 seconds, though my brain's already yelling that it's pointless and that as soon as I start something I'll break the build and get fired. Even so, there's a tiny looseness in my chest as I do it, but I can feel the disaster-movie in my head revving up again.

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the looseness in your chest, rather than the revving disaster-movie. Can you notice that tiny looseness, and hold onto it for just a second? Don't try to fight the thinking, just observe it. And can you also notice that you're taking a small action, opening a new tab? Just observe that too. What happens when you do that?

Patient: When I focus on the looseness and the fact I opened a tab, it actually helps — my shoulders drop and there's a small itch to start typing. But in a blink the fortune-telling machine starts narrating the worst case and that itch dies; I just stare at the tab and feel stupid and panicked. I can hold the looseness for a few seconds, but then guilt and the disaster story pull me right back into freezing.

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the sensation of the looseness, rather than trying to hold onto it. Can you notice how it feels when you're focusing on it, and then the guilt and self-doubt kick in? Try to observe those feelings as well, without trying to judge them or change them. What happens when you do that? And can we also try to look at the guilt and self-doubt in a different way? Instead of thinking "I'm stupid and panicked", can we try to see if there's any truth to those thoughts? What if, for just a second, you can acknowledge that feeling of guilt and self-doubt without letting it take over?

Patient: Okay—when I actually notice that looseness, my chest unclenches and I get this little itch to start coding. Then the guilt and self-doubt show up—“you’re lazy, you should’ve started sooner, you’ll mess this up”—and part of me thinks, yeah, that’s true sometimes, so the doom-machine feels like it has evidence. If I try to just watch those thoughts they lose a bit of power, but only for a moment before the catastrophic script comes roaring back and I freeze. I’m frustrated and overwhelmed by how hooked I am to those stories—can we slow down and try another tiny step?

Therapist: Let's slow down the cycle. Instead of trying to take the next big step (i.e., start coding), let's take a tiny, tiny step. Can you simply notice one word that comes up when you think about coding? Just one word. It might be "code", "project", "deadline", or anything else. Don't try to do anything with that word, just notice it. What happens when you do that?

Patient: "Deadline." As soon as I say it my chest clamps shut and the fortune-telling starts: I miss it, a bug slips into prod, CI explodes, my manager drags me into a meeting and I'm shelved or fired — it's instant and loud, and just noticing the word feels like tossing fuel on the machine, so I freeze.

Therapist: Let's try to create a tiny gap. Instead of immediately getting caught up in the catastrophic thinking, can you try to do something else for just a single second? Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or think about anything else. Don't try to break the thought loop, just observe the breath. Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: Okay — I breathe in and out. For that one second the air is cool in my nostrils and my chest loosens a little, like a crack in the panic, and I actually feel lighter. But almost instantly the fortune-teller kicks back in, yelling about missing the deadline and getting fired, and the looseness disappears. I can try another second, but can we slow down a bit? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take a slower approach. Instead of trying to take a single second, let's try to take a tiny fraction of a second. As you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or think about anything else. As you're noticing the breath, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the sensation of your feet, without trying to think about anything else. Don't worry about the fortune-teller right now, just focus on the sensation of your breath and your feet. Can you try this for just a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: Okay — when I did that I felt the breath cool in my nostrils and my feet press into the floor, like a tiny crack in the panic. It only lasts a beat before the fortune-telling machine roars back up — missing the deadline, CI exploding, my manager calling me in, and then fired — and I freeze. I'm feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down and try another tiny step?

Therapist: Let's try to create a tiny pause within the pause. Instead of trying to take a breath or focus on your feet, let's try to simply pause. As the fortune-telling machine is about to kick in, pause for just a tiny fraction of a second. Just pause. Don't breathe, don't think, don't react. Just pause. And then, slowly, start to focus on your breath again. Don't try to control it, just let it happen naturally. Can you try this for just a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: I tried to pause — I held still for that tiny fraction and for a beat the noise cut out and my chest loosened. But two beats later the fortune-teller screamed the whole script again — miss the deadline, CI blows up, manager fires me, everything collapses — and I froze. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down and try an even smaller step?

Therapist: Let's try to create an even shorter pause. Instead of trying to pause for a beat, try to pause for just a single heartbeat. Focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, just for that one breath. Don't think about anything else, just the sensation of the breath. As soon as you feel like you're getting caught up in the fortune-telling machine's script, try to pause again, even if it's just for a single heartbeat. Don't worry about the outcome, just focus on the sensation of the breath. Can you try this for just one heartbeat?

Patient: I did it — one heartbeat. For that beat my chest loosened and I actually felt the tiniest urge to start typing, like a flicker of calm. But immediately the fortune-telling machine yelled that I'll miss the deadline, CI will explode, my manager will drag me in and fire me, and everything will collapse, and I froze again — I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down and try an even smaller step?

Therapist: Let's try to focus on a single sensation. As soon as you feel the fortune-telling machine's script kicking in, try to notice just one thing. Is your hand moving? Is your finger twitching? Is your foot tapping? Try to focus on that one tiny sensation, without thinking about the outcome. Just notice it, and let it be. Don't try to change it, don't try to control it. Just notice it. Can you do that for just one second?

Patient: Okay — I focused on my right index finger twitching for that one second and felt a tiny urge to reach for the keyboard. But immediately the fortune-teller screamed the whole script — miss the deadline, CI blows up, manager fires me — and my hands went numb and I froze. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and try an even smaller step?

Therapist: Let's try to focus on a sensation that's right now, in this moment. Can you notice the sensation of the air on your finger? Specifically, the sensation of the air touching the tip of your right index finger? Just notice that sensation, and try to focus on it for a single heartbeat. Don't think about anything else, just the sensation of the air. Can you do that?

Patient: I did — I felt the cool air on the tip of my right index finger for that heartbeat and my chest loosened a little, and I actually had this tiny itch to grab the keyboard. But almost immediately the fortune-telling machine blasted the worst-case again — miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager fires me — and the looseness snapped shut. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down and try something even smaller?

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the sensation of a single breath. Can you notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for a single second? Not the sensation of the air, not the sensation of the finger, just the sensation of the breath. Just notice it, and let it be. Don't try to think about it, don't try to change it. Just notice it. Can you do that?

Patient: I did it — for that one second I felt the breath move, a thin ribbon of calm, and my chest loosened a bit. But the fortune-teller immediately started barking the whole catastrophe again — miss the deadline, CI blows up, manager fires me — and that calm vanished; I'm worn out by how fast it flips. Can we slow way down and try something even smaller?

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the sensation of a single, tiny breath. Not just the sensation of the breath moving in and out, but the sensation of the breath moving in and out by the smallest, almost imperceptible amount. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath slowing down just ever so slightly, just for a moment. Just notice that moment of slowing down, and let it be. Don't try to think about it, don't try to change it. Just notice it. Can you do that for just a heartbeat?

Patient: I did — for that one heartbeat the breath thinned and my chest unclenched a hair, like a tiny crack in the panic. Then the fortune-telling machine blasted the catastrophe again and the calm evaporated; my hands went numb and I just froze. I'm running low on energy right now — can we slow way down and try an even smaller step or just sit with that tiny slowing for a moment?

Therapist: Let's just... sit with it. For a moment, just let the tiny slowing be. Don't try to think about anything, don't try to change anything, just be with the sensation of the breath slowing down by the smallest amount. Just notice that, and let it be. Don't worry about the fortune-teller, don't worry about the panic, just... be. Can you just sit with that for a second?

Patient: I sat with it—there was that tiny thinning of breath and a small unclench, my hands almost moved toward the keyboard. Then the fortune-teller screamed the whole catastrophe again and the calm snapped; I'm pretty worn out—can we just hold that small slowing together for a bit longer before trying anything else?

Therapist: Let's just hold onto it. For a moment, just let the tiny slowing be. Don't try to think about anything, don't try to change anything, just be with the sensation of the breath slowing down by the smallest amount. Let the calm stay with you for just a second longer. Just... breathe. Can you just hold onto that for a second?

Patient: I held it — for a few breaths that tiny slowing stayed, my chest unclenched and my fingers actually twitched toward the keyboard. Then the fortune-telling machine screamed the catastrophe again — miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager fires me — and the calm snapped; I'm running on empty and that flip feels brutal. Can we just stay with that small slowing a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's just... stay with it. Don't try to do anything, don't try to think about anything. Just be with the sensation of the breath slowing down by the smallest amount. Let your chest stay unclenched, let your fingers stay twitchy towards the keyboard. Just... be with it. Let it be enough. Can you just stay with it for a second longer?

Patient: Okay — I can hold it a bit longer. The breath stays thin, my chest unclenches, and my fingers twitch toward the keyboard, but the fortune-teller's already whispering the worst — miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager fires me — and it feels inevitable. I don't have much steam left, but I can try to keep this tiny calm a moment more if you'll stay with it.

Therapist: I'm here. I'm staying with it. Just breathe. Just feel the thinness of the breath, the looseness of your chest, the twitch of your fingers. Don't think about anything else. Don't try to do anything else. Just be with it. Let it be enough. Can you just hold onto it for one more second? One more heartbeat?

Patient: I held it — one heartbeat: the breath thin, my chest unclenched and my fingers twitched toward the keyboard. Then the fortune-teller screamed the whole script — miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager fires me — and the calm snapped; I'm running on fumes. Can we stay with that tiny quiet a bit longer? I'm having trouble keeping it.

Therapist: It's okay if it slips away. Just... acknowledge it. Let go of the effort to hold onto it. It's okay if your mind starts to wander or if the catastrophic thinking kicks back in. Just... notice. Notice the breath, notice the sensation of your body, notice the thoughts that are creeping in. Don't try to fight them or push them away. Just... notice. Can you just notice, for just a second?

Patient: I noticed the thin breath — my chest eased a touch and my fingers wanted to move — and then the fortune-telling machine yelled: miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager calls me in and fires me, everything falls apart. Saying that even out loud drains me; it feels like wading through molasses. Can we stay with this small quiet a bit longer?

Therapist: Don't try to do anything. Just... be. Be with the sensation of the breath, be with the feeling of your chest easing. Don't think about anything else. Don't try to push through the fatigue. Just... exist. In this moment, just exist. Can you just be, for one more second?

Patient: I held it — thin breath, chest unclenched, fingers twitching toward the keyboard, but the fortune-teller screamed: miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager drags me in and fires me, everything falls apart, and the calm snapped. Saying that out loud sucks the energy out of me like wading through molasses; I don't have much left. Can we just stay with this small quiet together a bit longer? Please keep it slow.

Therapist: I'm here. I'm staying with you. Just breathe. Just be with the sensation of the breath, the looseness of your chest, the slight twitch of your fingers. Don't think about anything else. Don't try to push through the fatigue. Just... be. With me, for just one more second. Don't worry about the future, don't worry about the past. Just... be.

Patient: I held it—one more heartbeat: breath thin, chest unclenched, fingers twitching toward the keyboard. Then the fortune-teller screamed the whole script—miss the deadline, CI explodes, manager fires me—and the calm snapped; my energy just drained out. Can we please just stay with this small quiet together for a while longer and keep it slow?

Therapist: I'm here. I'm staying with you. There's no need to try to do anything anymore. Just... be. With the sensation of your breath, with the feeling of your chest, with the slight twitch of your fingers. There's nothing to think about, nothing to do. Just be. In this moment, just be.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to just be. The breath is thin, my chest eases, and for a moment the fortune-teller's voice is quieter though it's still waiting to pounce. I can hold this small quiet a bit longer if you stay with me.

Therapist: I'm here. I'm staying with you. There's no need to talk or think or do anything. Just... be. With the thin breath, with the easing chest, with the quiet voice of the fortune-teller. Just be, and let this moment be enough.

Patient: Okay — I can keep sitting with this, but the fortune-teller's whispering that it won't last: I'll miss the deadline in a week, CI will blow up, my manager will call me in and fire me, and everything will fall apart. Saying it out loud tires me out; my voice feels thin. Can we just stay with this quiet a little longer, or try one tiny step — like me resting my hands on the keyboard for one slow breath — before anything else?
