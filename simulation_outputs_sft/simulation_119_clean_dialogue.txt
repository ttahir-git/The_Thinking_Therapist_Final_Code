Patient: I've been feeling totally stuck and directionless lately — I don't know who I am beyond being a data scientist, especially after all the job instability. I keep trying to figure out what actually matters to me, but I just end up in the same rut and it's exhausting. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change anything when I've already tried to sort it out on my own?

Therapist: That sense of skepticism is understandable, especially given the feeling of not knowing who you are beyond your job title. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to explore what actually matters to you? What does that process feel like for you? Does it ever lead to a moment where you feel like you're getting somewhere, or is it always just a cycle of more questions?

Patient: When I try to figure out what matters, it quickly turns into a checklist of stuff I used to like or things I'm "supposed" to want, and then my brain jumps straight to practicality — will it pay, can I be good at it, will it get me hired — and that kills any curiosity. Every now and then I get a small spark — like when I help a friend with a project or tinker with a side dataset — but it fades fast and I just end up back in this grinding loop of doubt and exhaustion. I've done the journals, career quizzes, side projects, even therapy before — how is that supposed to help if nothing sticks and I keep doubting myself? I'm honestly frustrated and a bit defensive about doing more exercises unless there's something concrete that actually helps change how I act, not just how I think.

Therapist: I understand why you're skeptical, given how many times you've tried different strategies. It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped in this cycle, and that's really tough. Can I ask, what is it about being able to make concrete changes that feels important to you right now? Is it about having more control over your life, or feeling more confident in your choices? For this session, let's focus on exploring that question, and see if we can find a way to make it feel more concrete, even if it's just a small step.

Patient: Mostly it's about control — I want something that actually shifts my day-to-day so I'm not constantly at the mercy of the job market and my own doubts. I need tangible changes that affect my routines and finances, not just another reframe exercise. But I've tried small experiments and worksheets before and they fizzle out — how is doing more of that supposed to help me actually act differently this time?

Therapist: I understand that you're looking for something more concrete than reframe exercises. You're right that small experiments can feel futile if they don't lead to lasting change. But here's a question: what if, instead of just trying to think differently, we started to explore what it means to act differently, in a way that's connected to what's truly important to you? For example, what if, rather than just trying to find a new job, we started to think about what kind of work or projects you might be passionate about, and how you could start to take small steps towards making that a reality, even if it's just in a tiny way? Would that feel like a more tangible path to control?

Patient: Okay, talk’s cheap — how is “small steps” actually different from the dozens of half-baked experiments I’ve already tried that just fizzle? If you want me to try something, it has to change my day-to-day (routine or income), be time-limited, and have real accountability or I’ll ghost it. Give me one concrete example I could commit to this week that could plausibly affect my routine or finances, and tell me how we’d prevent me from burning out or bailing. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.

Therapist: Let's slow down and focus on one concrete action for this week. I want to propose an experiment that's different from what you've tried before. Here's an idea: for the next 3 days, commit to dedicating 30 minutes each morning to updating your LinkedIn profile. It's a small, manageable task that can impact your professional life, and it's something you can do consistently. To prevent burnout, I want you to tie this task to a specific goal: each morning, ask yourself, "What is one thing I can say on LinkedIn today that will help me feel more confident or connected to my professional network?" This way, you're not just doing something for its own sake, but also with a clear purpose. We can also schedule a check-in for the end of the week to review your progress and discuss any challenges you're facing. Can you commit to this for the next 3 days?

Patient: Okay, I hear the idea, but I’m still skeptical — how is polishing LinkedIn for 30 minutes actually going to move my income or routine instead of feeling like busywork? If I’m willing to try it, it has to be specific and actionable: for the next 3 mornings I’ll do 30 minutes with this plan — Day 1: update headline/summary and add 3 key achievements; Day 2: add 10 relevant connections and follow 3 target companies; Day 3: message 3 people asking for 15-min informational chats and apply to 2 roles. I’ll send you a one-line check-in after each session for accountability, and if I start feeling burnt out we cut it to 15 minutes — does that seem practical, or am I missing something important here?

Therapist: I think you're being realistic about the potential impact of LinkedIn polishing. It's not a magic bullet, but it can be a tangible way to showcase your skills and build connections. I like how you've broken down the plan into specific tasks for each day, with clear goals and accountability. The flexibility to cut it to 15 minutes if you start feeling burnt out is also a good idea. Just one more thing to consider: how will you hold yourself accountable for following up on the conversations and informational chats you initiate on Day 3? Will you schedule a follow-up message or phone call to check in with the people you reach out to? Let's make sure we're not just checking boxes, but actually making progress.

Patient: Alright — here's how I'll hold myself accountable: I'll schedule 15-minute follow-up slots in my calendar for 48–72 hours after each outreach and set reminders so it actually happens. I'll draft three short message templates tonight (intro, follow-up, ask-for-chat) to avoid decision fatigue, and I'll block a 30-minute weekly "convert leads" slot to turn responses into concrete next steps (apply, set a call, send a proposal). I'll send you a one-line check-in after each Day‑3 outreach and an end-of-week summary so it's not just me flaking out. But honestly — how is scheduling follow-ups supposed to make people respond instead of just ghosting me?

Therapist: You're right that scheduling follow-ups might not guarantee a response, but it can help you track whether the people you're reaching out to are even seeing your message. It's also a way to demonstrate your commitment to the process and the potential connections. That being said, I want to acknowledge that ghosting is still a possibility, and it's not something that can be completely controlled. However, by tracking your outreach efforts and scheduling follow-ups, you'll at least have a record of what you've tried, which can be helpful in reflecting on what might be working and what might need to change. Can we talk a bit more about what you hope to achieve with these follow-up conversations? What specific outcomes are you looking for, and how will you know when you've reached them?

Patient: Concretely, what I want from follow-ups is tangible leads — like at least 3 meaningful responses, one informational chat that leads to a referral or a concrete next step (an interview, freelance trial, or an application to submit), and ideally one small paid gig or interview within four weeks. I’ll count it as working if I’m getting replies that turn into scheduled calls or actual opportunities that affect my calendar or income, not just polite noncommittal messages. But honestly — how is landing a gig or an interview supposed to make me feel less stuck about who I am beyond work? And I’m worried I’ll burn out trying to keep up with all this outreach — what if I start ghosting again; how should I handle that without just dropping the whole thing?

Therapist: I think you're right that landing gigs or interviews might not directly address the sense of stuckness you're feeling about your identity beyond work. However, I want to propose that the process of actively seeking out opportunities and taking concrete steps towards them can actually be a powerful way to regain a sense of agency and direction in your life. It's not just about the external outcomes, but about the internal process of taking action and exploring new possibilities.

Regarding burnout, I completely understand your concerns. It's natural to feel overwhelmed when taking on a new challenge like this outreach effort. However, I want to suggest that we approach it with a mindset of self-care and flexibility. If you start to feel overwhelmed, take a step back, and prioritize your own needs. It might mean scaling back your outreach efforts or taking a break to recharge. The goal is to make progress, not to push yourself to burnout. We can work together to identify early warning signs and develop strategies to prevent burnout.

Let's talk more about what's holding you back from feeling like you're making progress in your life beyond work. What are some of the core values, interests, or aspirations that you feel are missing from your current situation?

Patient: I guess what’s missing is control/stability, some actual creativity, and more real human connection — not just networking for a job, but mentoring, teamwork, or projects that feel like they matter beyond metrics. I used to enjoy learning new tools and building stuff for fun, but right now everything gets filtered through “will this pay or get me hired,” which kills curiosity and leaves me stuck. What’s holding me back is that my identity’s so wrapped up in being a data scientist, plus perfectionism and exhaustion — I overthink options and then freeze or bail. But seriously — how is talking about values supposed to change my day-to-day? If we’re going to do this, give me one concrete, low-burn task this week that ties a value (like connection or creativity) to the outreach plan you already suggested.

Therapist: I think you're right that talking about values is not a direct fix, but it can help us identify concrete actions that align with our values. One way to do this is to tie a specific value to a low-burn task within the outreach plan.

Here's a task for this week: Schedule one 15-minute informational chat with a potential mentor or colleague, rather than just reaching out to a random person. Choose someone you've already connected with on LinkedIn, and ask for their advice on how to build a more creative project or team. This task is low-burn because it's a one-on-one chat, and it ties to the value of connection and creativity.

To make it even more concrete, I want you to ask yourself one specific question before the chat: "What's the one thing I hope to learn or take away from this conversation that will help me grow as a professional?" This will help you focus on the outcome and make the most of the time. Can you commit to this task for this week?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it, but I’m skeptical: how is one 15‑minute chat supposed to change anything about feeling stuck? Here’s what I’ll actually do this week if we’re doing this for real: pick someone I’m already connected with, send a short outreach tonight asking for a 15‑minute chat about building creative/collaborative projects, schedule the chat, and prep one focused takeaway question (“What’s one step you’d recommend to move from solo tinkering to collaborative projects that could lead to paid work?”). I’ll set calendar reminders and send you a one‑line check‑in after I send the message and another after the chat; if I start to burn out I’ll cut it to 10 minutes or pause and tell you why. Now help me draft the outreach message so it sounds direct but not needy — and tell me if that question sucks or if there’s a better one.

Therapist: I like how you're thinking about the task. The question you proposed is clear and focused, and it shows you're thinking about the outcome. However, I want to suggest a slight tweak to make it even more effective.

Here's a revised question: "What's the most important thing you've learned about building successful collaborative projects that could lead to paid work, and how can I apply that to my own work?"

I think this question is a bit more specific and actionable, and it shows you're thinking about how to apply the conversation to your own work. The word "most important" also implies that you're looking for a key takeaway, rather than just a general piece of advice.

As for the outreach message itself, here's a draft:

"Hi [Name], I hope you're doing well. I've been reaching out to a few people in the network about building creative/collaborative projects, and I thought of you because of our previous conversations. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat about that? I'd love to pick your brain and learn more about how to move from solo tinkering to projects that could lead to paid work. Let me know if that sounds good, and we can schedule a time that works for you."

Feel free to modify it to fit your style, and I think that question I suggested is a good fit. Can you commit to sending the outreach message tonight?

Patient: Yeah — I’ll send it tonight, though I’m kind of jittery and scattered right now, so keep it short. Here’s a version that sounds direct but not needy — tell me if it’s fine:

"Hi [Name], hope you’re well. I’m trying to move from solo tinkering to collaborative projects that could lead to paid work and thought of you given your experience. Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick chat? One question I’d love to ask: ‘What’s the most important thing you’ve learned about building collaborative projects that lead to paid work, and how could I apply it?’"

I’ll set a 48–72 hour follow-up reminder and DM you a one-line check-in after I hit send. Quick thing — if they ghost, do you recommend one polite follow-up then stop, or a couple nudges? I’m already worrying I’ll overdo it or bail.

Therapist: I think the message is fine as it is. It's direct, concise, and shows that you've taken the time to think about the conversation and the question you want to ask. The tone is professional, but not needy.

Regarding follow-up, if someone ghosts you, it's generally best to send one polite follow-up message, and then stop. Sending multiple messages can come across as pushy or aggressive. A good rule of thumb is to wait 2-3 days before sending a follow-up message, and to keep the message brief and to the point.

For example, you could send a follow-up message like this:

"Hi [Name], just wanted to follow up on our 15-minute chat this week. I'm still thinking about your advice, and I'd love to take the next step on building a collaborative project. If you're available, would you be open to a quick call to discuss next steps?"

If you don't hear back again, it's probably best to move on.

You're being wise to worry about overdoing it or bailing, but I think you're on the right track. Can you commit to sending the message tonight, and then waiting 2-3 days before sending a follow-up message?

Patient: Okay — I’ll send it tonight and wait 2–3 days before one polite follow-up. But honestly, how is one follow-up any more likely to get a reply? Give me a one-line follow-up I can copy-paste, and confirm I should stop if they don’t answer.

Therapist: I think the single follow-up is still a good approach, but I understand your skepticism. Here's a concise and polite follow-up message you can copy-paste:

"Hi [Name], just a quick follow-up on our chat from [Date]. No rush to respond, just wanted to reiterate my interest in learning from you. Thanks for considering it."

If you don't hear back again after sending this message, it's probably best to stop following up and move on. One or two polite attempts are usually enough to demonstrate your interest and courtesy.

Don't worry about being overly aggressive or pushy – a simple follow-up message like this one is unlikely to be seen that way. Just keep it brief, polite, and non-intrusive. Can you commit to sending this follow-up message after 2-3 days if you don't hear back?

Patient: Okay — I’ll send the initial message tonight and, if they don’t reply, I’ll send that follow-up in 2–3 days and then stop. I’m pretty jittery and distracted right now so I’ll probably only manage a one-line DM to you after I hit send. Honestly, I still don’t see how one follow-up really moves the needle, but I’ll try — and if I start flaking, I’ll tell you why instead of ghosting.

Therapist: I think it's great that you're taking a proactive approach and having a plan in place. It's normal to feel jittery and distracted, especially when you're trying something new. Remember that one follow-up message is not a guarantee, but it's a polite and professional way to check in and show interest.

It's also good that you're aware of your own limitations and are prepared to stop if you're flaking. That's a sign of self-awareness and accountability, which are both important qualities for making progress in this process.

Take a deep breath, focus on sending the message, and then send that one-line DM to me. Don't worry too much about the outcome, just take it one step at a time. If you need to talk more about your progress or have any questions, I'm here to listen. Go ahead and send the message.

Patient: Sent.

Here’s what I messaged them: "Hi [Name], hope you’re well. I’m trying to move from solo tinkering to collaborative projects that could lead to paid work — would you have 15 minutes this week to chat? Thanks."

My chest’s tight and I’m already overthinking, so keep this short: if they say yes, give me a 3‑question agenda I can use to keep the chat focused and end with a clear next step. If they don’t reply, confirm: one polite follow-up in 2–3 days and then stop. Also — if I freeze on the call, what’s a tiny script I can use to sound competent and steer it back to that one takeaway?

Therapist: Let's focus on the positive outcome first. If they respond positively to your message, here's a 3-question agenda you can use to keep the chat focused:

1. What's the most significant challenge you've faced in building collaborative projects that have led to paid work?
2. Can you share an example of a successful project you've led or contributed to, and what was the key factor that made it successful?
3. What's one actionable step you'd recommend for someone looking to transition from solo tinkering to collaborative projects, and what resources do you think would be most helpful?

If they say yes, you can ask for a specific time and date, and make sure to send a confirmation email with the agenda and next steps.

If they don't reply, don't worry. One polite follow-up in 2-3 days should be enough to reiterate your interest and inquire about their availability. Keep the message brief and to the point: "Hi [Name], just a quick follow-up on our chat from [Date]. No rush to respond, just wanted to check in and see if you're still interested in discussing collaborative projects. Thanks for considering it."

Regarding the script for handling uncertainty, here's a tiny phrase you can use if you freeze on the call:

"I want to make sure we're on the same page. Can you help me summarize what we've talked about so far, and what you're looking for in terms of next steps?"

This phrase acknowledges your uncertainty, shows that you're actively listening, and helps to steer the conversation back to the main topic.

Patient: Okay — thanks. I already sent the message and my chest’s tight and my head’s fuzzy, so keep this short.

The three questions are fine but feel a little formal — can you rewrite them to sound more conversational and blunt? Something like:
- “What’s one mistake people make when trying to turn hobby projects into paid collaborations?”  
- “What’s one tiny step I could try this month that actually leads to paid work?”  
- “Who should I talk to next or what should I do right after this call?”

Also give me a one‑line opener to start the call confidently, and a one‑line closer that turns the chat into a concrete next step (intro, resource, or a 15‑minute follow-up). And yeah — how is this actually supposed to help me stop freezing up and feeling stuck? I’m already imagining screwing it up — but I’ll DM you one line after I send the follow-up and after the call.

Therapist: Here are the rewritten questions:

1. What's the biggest mistake you've seen people make when trying to turn a hobby into a paid gig?
2. What's one tiny experiment you could try this month to start getting paid work?
3. What's the next best step I should take after this call?

As for the opener and closer, here are some suggestions:

Opener:
"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. I'm excited to learn from your experience and see if we can figure out a way to get paid work for my hobby project."

Closer:
"Great, I think we've covered a good bit of ground. Let's schedule a follow-up call for [Date] at [Time] to check in on how things are going. Sound good?"

As for how this will help you stop freezing up, I want to emphasize that it's okay to feel nervous and uncertain. The goal of this framework is to provide a structure for the call that will help you feel more confident and in control. By having a clear agenda and a conversational tone, you'll be better able to focus on the conversation and less likely to get caught up in negative self-talk.

Remember, it's not about being perfect – it's about taking small steps towards progress. By showing up for the call, asking questions, and taking notes, you're already taking action. The fact that you're feeling stuck is a sign that you're thinking critically about your situation, and that's a good thing.

Patient: Those rewrites feel sharper — thanks, though I'm already jittery imagining screwing it up. Change the opener to: "Hey [Name], thanks for a quick minute — I'm trying to turn tinkering into paid projects, any practical next step you'd recommend?" Change the closer to: "Can I follow up with a 2‑week update, or would you mind an intro to someone who might be interested?" 

Now give me a 5‑word fallback I can say if I blank, and one tiny grounding line I can silently repeat to stop spiraling mid-call — something I can actually do without sounding weird. Also, I'm feeling... kind of ashamed about past flops, so tell me one blunt thing I can do after the call to make it feel like progress even if it goes badly.

Therapist: Fallback:
"I'm not sure, can we come back to that later?"

This phrase acknowledges that you're not sure, but also shows that you're willing to revisit the topic later.

Grounding line:
"Breathe in, 'I can handle this.'"

This line is short, simple, and easy to repeat. It helps to calm your nervous system and remind you that you can handle the uncertainty of the call.

After the call, to make it feel like progress even if it goes badly, do this:
"Write down 3 things that went okay, even if it felt like a disaster."

This simple exercise helps to reframe your thinking and focus on what you can learn from the experience, rather than beating yourself up over perceived failures. It's a small step towards acknowledging progress and moving forward.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it. I’ll use your opener/closer, fallback line, and the silent mantra. Saying that mantra already feels a bit pathetic given past flops, but I’ll do the post‑call list if only to prove I didn’t totally tank. 

Quick question before I send anything: if the person gives vague advice but doesn’t offer intros or concrete next steps, is it okay to directly ask, “Could you introduce me to X person?” or to ask for a 10‑minute follow‑up, or does that come off as pushy? I’m jittery and overthinking this, so tell me bluntly.

Therapist: It's completely okay to ask directly for a next step, whether it's introducing you to someone or scheduling a follow-up call. If the person is being vague or unclear, it's a good idea to ask for more specificity.

You don't need to phrase it as "Could you introduce me to X person?" - that might come across as too direct. Instead, try saying something like:

"I appreciate your advice, but I'm not sure how to take it forward. Would it be possible to schedule a follow-up call to discuss next steps?"

or

"I'd love to learn more about your approach and how it could apply to my situation. Could we schedule a call to explore further?"

This approach shows that you're interested in taking action and learning more, without being too pushy or aggressive.

Remember, it's okay to ask for more information or clarification. It's better to ask and get a clear answer than to assume and risk misunderstanding the situation. Take a deep breath, relax, and ask for what you need.

Patient: Okay — I'm jittery and drained, so keep this short. Is this okay to ask for an intro? "Hey [Name], would you mind introducing me to [X]? I'm trying to turn some hobby projects into paid work and I think they'd have useful perspective." Too needy or blunt?  

Also — honestly, how is collecting intros supposed to fix the deeper stuckness about who I am beyond work, and not just be another hustle I'll bail on? I'll send the follow-up tonight and DM you one line after; if I freeze on the call, nudge me to use the fallback.

Therapist: The revised ask is concise and clear. You're not being too needy or blunt - you're simply asking for an introduction to someone who might be able to help. It's okay to ask for an intro; it's a normal part of networking and building relationships.

Regarding the deeper stuckness, collecting intros is not a magic solution. It's a way to build connections and gather perspectives, but it won't necessarily address the underlying issues of identity or purpose. However, it can help you identify patterns, themes, and areas of interest that might inform your exploration of identity and purpose.

Remember that this is a process, not a quick fix. You're taking small steps towards understanding yourself and your goals. It's okay to take it one step at a time, and it's okay to make mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself if you freeze on the call - just take a deep breath and use the fallback if needed.

Tonight, send the follow-up message and DM me a single line to check in. After the call, take some time to reflect on what happened and how it made you feel. Use the intros you collected to inform your next steps, and don't be afraid to ask more questions or seek further guidance.

Patient: Okay — that intro line sounds fine, not needy. I’ll send the follow-up tonight and DM you one line after I hit send, but I’m already bracing for it to go badly — past flops keep replaying and it makes me feel small. If I start to freeze, please nudge me to use the fallback and after the call remind me to write the three things that went okay. Also — I keep circling back to this: isn’t collecting intros just another hustle? How is that actually going to help the deeper stuckness?

Therapist: It's natural to have past flops replaying in your mind, but try not to let them dictate your emotions right now. You've taken steps to prepare, and that's all you can control.

When you start to freeze, I'll nudge you gently to use the fallback. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous, but it's not okay to let it paralyze you. Take a deep breath, and try to focus on the conversation.

Regarding collecting intros, I know it might feel like another hustle, but it's different. It's not just about collecting names and contacts; it's about building connections and gathering perspectives. Think of it as a way to collect seeds, not a full-grown tree. Each intro can lead to new opportunities, and it's worth taking the time to nurture those relationships.

As for the deeper stuckness, collecting intros can help you identify patterns and themes that might inform your exploration of identity and purpose. It's not a magic solution, but it can be a valuable tool in your journey. Remember that this is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

Tonight, send the follow-up message and DM me a single line to check in. After the call, take a few minutes to reflect on what happened and how it made you feel. Use the intros you collected to inform your next steps, and don't be afraid to ask more questions or seek further guidance.

And don't forget to write down the three things that went okay during the call. It might seem small, but acknowledging those moments can help you build momentum and confidence.

Patient: Okay — I’ll send the follow-up tonight and DM you one line after. My chest’s tight and past flops are already replaying, so I’m pretty shaky about this. If they ghost, what’s one concrete, low‑burn thing I can do this week that actually ties to creativity (not just more hustle)? And nudge me to use the fallback if I start blanking on the call.

Therapist: If they ghost, one low-burn thing you can do this week that ties to creativity is to spend 10 minutes on a random hobby or creative project. For example, if you're a writer, open a new document and write a single sentence. If you're a painter, grab a brush and paint a small section of a single color. The goal is not to create something masterpiece, but to simply show up and engage with the creative process.

If you start blanking on the call, I'll nudge you to use the fallback. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous, but it's not okay to let it paralyze you. Take a deep breath, and try to focus on the conversation. If you need a moment to collect yourself, it's okay to ask for a brief pause before responding.

Tonight, send the follow-up message and DM me a single line to check in. After the call, take a few minutes to reflect on what happened and how it made you feel. Use the intros you collected to inform your next steps, and don't be afraid to ask more questions or seek further guidance.

And don't forget to write down the three things that went okay during the call, even if it was just a small spark. It might seem insignificant, but acknowledging those moments can help you build momentum and confidence.

Patient: Okay — I’ll do the 10‑minute creative thing if they ghost, but keep this really small because I’m already wiped and jittery. Give me one concrete prompt that feels tied to data-science creativity and is finishable in 10 minutes (something like: “open one small public dataset, make one quickplot that surprises you, and commit it to a Gist or screenshot to share later”). That’s it — no polishing, no explanations.

Also: please nudge me to use the fallback if I start blanking on the call, and after the call remind me to write the three things that went okay. My chest’s tight and my head’s fuzzy, so keep the nudges short. I’ll send the one‑line DM after I hit send tonight.

Therapist: "Create a simple scatterplot of 3 public datasets related to COVID-19 cases, focusing on one variable (e.g., deaths, cases, hospitalizations), and save it as an image file."

If you start blanking, use fallback. After the call, write 3 things that went okay.

Patient: Okay. The COVID plot feels… heavy, so can we swap to something lighter? I'll do a quick, 10‑minute data task: pick a small public dataset (movies/ratings or a simple repo), make one quick plot that surprises me, screenshot or Gist it—no polish. 

I’ll DM you one line after I send the outreach tonight. If I freeze on the call, nudge me to use the fallback line; after the call, remind me to write the three things that went okay. Honestly, I’m already bracing for it to go badly, but I’ll try.

Therapist:  cases, deaths, or hospitalization numbers, but only if they look interesting, are easy to explain, and feel related to the topic."

Follow-up: Ghost, send 10-minute prompt, DM after hit send.

Patient: Okay — I’ll do the lighter task: grab a small movies/ratings dataset, make one quick plot that surprises me, screenshot or Gist it, 10 minutes, no polish. I’m sending the outreach now and I’ll DM you one line after I hit send. My chest’s tight and I already have that stupid flashback of past screw‑ups, so keep nudges tiny: if I freeze on the call just say “use fallback” and after the call remind me to write three things that went okay. Anything else I should do before I send?

Patient: Okay — I’m sending it now, but my chest’s tight and old failures are buzzing so I’m shaky. Just do two tiny nudges: if I blank on the call, say “use fallback,” and after the call remind me to write the three things that went okay. If they ghost, nudge me tomorrow to do the 10‑minute movie-data plot — keep the nudges really short.

Patient: I can’t parse that mess — my chest’s tight and my brain’s scattering. Give me one single, concrete thing to do in the next 10 minutes that’s creative (not another hustle) — no options, no fluff — and I’ll do it and DM you one line after.

Patient: Okay. Here’s one thing — no options, no fluff: in the next 10 minutes open a small movies/ratings dataset (or any small CSV you have), make one quick scatterplot of rating vs. vote_count, circle or note the 3 most surprising points, take a screenshot and save it as quick_plot.png — no polish, no explanation. My chest’s tight and I’m weirdly shaky, but I’ll do it and DM you one line after.

Patient: I can't make sense of that last block — my head's fuzzy and my chest is tight. I sent the message (my hands shook; felt small), so just two tiny nudges please: say "use fallback" if I blank on the call, and remind me after the call to write the three things that went okay — and nudge me tomorrow to do the 10‑minute movie-data plot if they ghost. I'll DM one line after I hit send.
