--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm an accountant and lately what's been on my mind is that I can't seem to manage my anger and frustration when financial stress comes up. When bills or money conversations happen—at work or with family—I get really tense and sometimes I snap, and it's been wearing me down. I don't know, I guess I'm just overwhelmed and don't know how to handle it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express feeling overwhelmed by financial stress and anger, which is impacting your daily life. Core emotion is probably frustration. Goal: Explore the impact of these feelings and their relation to financial stress.

Therapist Answer:
That tension and snapping sound really draining. Can you tell me more about what happens right before you snap? Is it when someone asks you to deal with a financial issue, or when you're thinking about your own finances? What's going through your mind in those moments?

Patient: Usually it's when someone brings up money out of the blue—like a bill or a decision I wasn't expecting to handle. My chest gets tight and my mind jumps to worst-case stuff, like I'll mess up the numbers or people will think I'm incompetent, and then this hot, guilty anger builds until I snap. I don't know, I guess I just feel overwhelmed and try to avoid it, but it keeps coming out as frustration.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your snap is linked to unexpected financial conversations, which triggers worst-case scenarios, guilt, and anger. Core emotion is likely panic and self-doubt. Goal: Examine how these worst-case thoughts arise and explore possible connections to your values and work as an accountant.

Therapist Answer:
Those worst-case thoughts sound really intense. Can you see how your mind starts to spiral when someone mentions a bill or financial decision? Is there a part of you that feels like you need to be in control of the numbers and the situation? What's important to you in your work as an accountant? How does the desire to do a good job impact your frustration when things don't go as planned?

Patient: Yeah, it spirals really fast—someone says “bill” or “we need a number,” and my brain goes straight to “you messed up” and I have to fix it or everyone’ll notice. I do feel this need to be in control of the numbers—being accurate is how I prove I’m competent—so when things go off I get angry at myself and then snap. I don't know, I guess talking about this is kind of hard… can we maybe look at what happens in my body when it starts?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the spiraling thought process linked to self-doubt and control. Exploring how your body responds might offer a new perspective. Goal: Introduce body scan to observe sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to look at what's happening in your body right now. Can you bring your attention to your physical sensations? Where do you feel the tension or tightness? Is it in your chest, shoulders, or somewhere else? Are there any other sensations you're aware of? Just notice these sensations without trying to change them or interpret them yet. We can come back to this later.

Patient: I guess my chest gets really tight and my shoulders tense up, and my breathing gets shallow. My stomach knots and my hands feel like they want to clench—my heart races a bit too. I don't know, it's hard to sit with this stuff—can we go a little slower?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified physical sensations, which are likely contributing to your emotional state. Goal: Introduce defusion with a gentle, slow approach.

Therapist Answer:
It can be hard to sit with these sensations, especially when they're coming up suddenly. Let's take a very slow, gentle approach. Can you bring your attention to one of these sensations, just one? For example, let's start with your chest. Just notice the sensation in your chest, without trying to think about it or do anything with it. Just observe it, like looking at a leaf. Can you do that for me? Just be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or anything else.

Patient: I don't know. I guess my chest feels like a heavy pressure, like something's sitting on it, and my breathing gets really shallow. It's hard to just notice it without wanting to make it stop—can we go a bit slower?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're finding it challenging to defuse the sensation of the heavy pressure in your chest. Goal: Introduce brief pause before next step.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if your mind starts to wander or if the sensation becomes overwhelming again. Can we take a brief pause for just a second before we continue? You can take a deep breath, and when you're ready, we can come back to noticing the sensation in your chest. When you're ready to continue, just say "I'm back." There's no need to rush.

Patient: I'm back. I took a slow breath. My chest still feels heavy and my breathing's tight — I don't know, I guess it eases a little but it's really hard to stay with it. Can we keep going slowly?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've returned to the sensation, and it's still challenging to stay with it. Goal: Introduce gentle exploration of the sensation, then introduce the thought about being in control.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to gently explore the sensation a bit more. Can you imagine that the heavy pressure in your chest is a weight that's resting on your chest right now? It's not moving, it's not changing, it's just sitting there. Can you imagine that this weight is a sensation, just a feeling, without any meaning or judgment attached to it? Just observe it as a sensation. Now, I want to introduce a thought that's come up for you before. It's about feeling like you need to be in control of the numbers and the situation. Can you notice this thought as it arises, without judgment or attachment? Just observe it as a thought.

Patient: I notice the thought—like "I have to be in control"—and when it shows up my chest tightens and I get this prickly heat, like I'm bracing for everyone to notice I messed up. I don't know, I guess it's really hard to just watch it without wanting to fix or explain it. Can we slow down? It feels like you're getting close to something and I'm kind of panicking.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The thought of needing control is triggering a physical response, which is understandable. Goal: Introduce a pause and reassurance before next step.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the thought is triggering a strong physical response, and it's understandable that you're panicking. Let's take a step back for just a moment. It's okay to feel this way. We're just exploring your sensations and thoughts right now, and it's normal to feel uncomfortable. You're not in danger, and you're not alone. Take a deep breath with me, and when you're ready, we can continue at your pace. Remember, our goal is to understand what's happening in the moment, not to fix anything.

Patient: I took a deep breath and it helps a little, but my chest is still tight and my mind jumps to "they'll notice I messed up" and I feel kind of panicky. I don't know, I guess I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — can we go slower or do something grounding I can actually handle?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling a bit panicky, and the mind is jumping to worst-case scenarios. Goal: Introduce a grounding exercise to help stabilize the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something that might help you feel more grounded in the moment. Can you bring your attention to your feet, right now? Just notice how they feel on the ground, without thinking about anything else. Feel the weight of your body distributed on both feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground, keeping you steady and stable. As you exhale, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body through the soles of your feet. Just stay with this sensation for a moment, without trying to think about anything else. When you're ready, we can come back to noticing the sensations in your chest and the thoughts that arise.

Patient: Okay, I did the feet thing — I guess it helps a little, I feel a bit steadier and less like I'm floating. My chest is still tight though and my mind keeps jumping to "they'll notice I messed up." I don't know, can we try a slower grounding with my hands or something I can actually hold onto?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've found some stability with the feet grounding, but the chest tension and self-doubt thoughts persist. Goal: Introduce a tactile grounding exercise that can provide a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something that might help you feel more grounded and in control. Can you bring your attention to your hands right now? Notice how they feel in the present moment, without thinking about anything else. Look at your hands, feel the shape of your fingers, the texture of your skin. Now, intentionally choose one hand and notice how it feels to hold onto something - a pen, a glass, a cushion. Just focus on the sensation of holding onto this object, without thinking about anything else. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the sensation of holding onto this object. Just stay with this for a moment, without trying to think about anything else.

Patient: I picked up a pen — it's cold and a little heavy in my hand, and focusing on it makes my fingers unclench a bit. My chest is still tight and that thought "they'll notice I messed up" keeps popping up. I don't know, I guess I feel weird getting this close to it; can we slow down or maybe talk about something concrete I can do at work when I feel like I'm about to snap?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've found some relief in holding the pen, but the underlying tension and self-doubt thoughts remain. Goal: Introduce a concrete, work-related strategy to help manage the feeling of being on the verge of snapping.

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to feel apprehensive about confronting these feelings, but let's try to break it down into something more manageable. Can you think of a specific situation at work where you feel like you're about to snap, but you haven't snapped yet? It might be a particular task, a meeting, or a conversation with a colleague. Try to remember the details of that situation. What's the trigger that usually sets it off? What's the worst-case scenario that goes through your mind? Let's take a closer look at this specific situation together. What concrete steps can you take to manage your reaction when you're feeling overwhelmed? We can work on developing a plan to help you navigate these situations more effectively.

Patient: There's this end-of-month close meeting where someone will suddenly ask me for a reconciliation or a number I didn't expect. My chest tightens, I go straight to “they’ll notice I messed up” and I can feel myself getting ready to snap. I don't know, I guess a few concrete steps might help: ask for a few minutes to pull the file, use the pen-holding grounding trick and a couple slow breaths, run my quick checklist to confirm the number, and if I still feel shaky, say I'll follow up after a short break or ask a colleague to double-check with me.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a specific situation that triggers your anxiety and self-doubt, and you've outlined concrete steps to manage your reaction. Goal: Introduce a final, final thought to help solidify the plan.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've got a solid plan in place to help you navigate those end-of-month close meetings. I want to leave you with one final thought: it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel anxious, to feel like you're on the verge of snapping. But what's important is that you acknowledge those feelings, and you take steps to manage them. You're not alone in this, and you're taking proactive steps to take care of yourself. Remember that plan, and that it's okay to adapt it as needed. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, we can wrap up this session.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'm kind of wiped out and it's hard to just finish up. Can we not wrap up yet—could we do one quick role-play of how to say "I need a minute" in that meeting without sounding incompetent?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling a bit drained, and a quick role-play can help you practice and reinforce the new skills. Goal: Introduce a brief role-play to practice the "I need a minute" statement.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a quick role-play. Imagine you're sitting in that end-of-month close meeting, and someone asks you for a reconciliation or a number you didn't expect. You take a deep breath, look at your notes, and say: "I need a minute to review this. Can I pull up the file and take a look at the numbers again?" Now, I want you to notice how you feel, and then I'll ask you to reflect on it afterwards. Go ahead, take a minute.

Patient: Okay... I did it. When I said "I need a minute..." my voice felt kind of shaky and my chest tightened, and I kept worrying they'd think I'm incompetent. I did notice a tiny bit of relief though—like a drop in the pressure—so I guess it helps, but my mind's still jittery and I can't stop thinking of worst-case stuff. Can we try a couple more ways to say it, maybe something shorter I can actually remember when I'm panicking?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the physical response to the "I need a minute" statement, and recognizing that it's still triggering some worst-case thinking. Goal: Introduce shorter, more concise variations of the "I need a minute" statement to help you remember and reduce anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a few shorter alternatives. Imagine you're saying it again, but this time, you're trying a different phrase. How about: "Can I just double-check the numbers real quick?" or "Can I review this briefly?" or even just: "Let me just check something real fast?" Notice how much shorter these phrases are, and how much easier it might be to remember them when you're feeling anxious. Try one of these, and see how it feels.

Patient: I tried saying, "Let me just check something real fast," and my voice came out shaky—there was a tiny drop in pressure but my chest's still tight and my mind's yelling that they think I'm incompetent. I don't know, I guess that phrase is easier to remember than the longer ones, but I'm still jittery and can't shake the worst-case thoughts. Can we try something even shorter—like "one minute"—or a quick nonverbal cue I can use? I'm kind of scattered right now.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried a shorter phrase and a nonverbal cue, but still feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce an extremely brief and nonverbal cue to signal that you need a moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something even simpler. Imagine you're about to say something, and then just pause for a second before you start speaking. That one second pause can be a powerful cue that says, "I need a moment." It's a tiny, almost imperceptible moment, but it can be enough to give you time to collect yourself. Try it: say the thing you're about to say, and then just pause for a second before speaking.

Patient: I tried it — I started to say "Let me just check…" and then paused for a second. My voice was small and my chest eased a tiny bit, but my mind immediately screamed they'll think I'm incompetent. I don't know, I guess can we do it a few more times or try a tiny nonverbal cue I can actually remember when I'm panicking?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're getting closer to recognizing the value of a brief pause, but still struggling with the mental self-doubt. Goal: Introduce an extremely simple, single-point gesture that can serve as a quick reminder to pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something that's even more straightforward. Imagine you're about to say something, and then just raise your hand ever so slightly, just above your mouth. It's a tiny gesture, almost imperceptible, but it can be enough to remind you to pause and collect yourself. Try it: say the thing you're about to say, and then just raise your hand like that. See if it helps you remember to take a moment before speaking.

Patient: I tried it — I barely lifted my hand and said "Let me check that," and my voice came out small; my chest eased a bit but my mind's still racing with "they'll think I'm incompetent." I don't know, I guess it helps a little, but I'm kind of distracted and it's hard to focus right now. Can we do one more really short role-play with the hand raise and practice one tiny line I can actually remember when I'm panicking?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're using the hand raise effectively, but still struggling to focus and manage your mental self-doubt. Goal: Introduce an extremely brief and simple role-play to practice a single line using the hand raise.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do one last quick role-play. Imagine you're in the meeting, and someone asks you for a reconciliation or a number you didn't expect. You take a deep breath, raise your hand just slightly, and say: "One minute." That's it. Just one word, one simple phrase. See if it helps you feel more grounded and in control. Take your time, and don't worry about the rest. Just focus on that one phrase and the hand raise.

Patient: Okay... I did it. I raised my hand and said "One minute." My voice was tiny, my chest loosened a little, but my mind kept yelling they'll think I'm incompetent and I felt jumpy. I don't know, I guess it helped a bit, but I'm kind of scattered and finding it hard to focus. Can we do it one more time and maybe practice how to make that one word sound firmer? Or a tiny follow-up line I can use if someone pushes back?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the hand raise effectively, and trying to use the phrase "One minute" to buy yourself time. Goal: Introduce a simple exercise to practice making the phrase sound firmer and more confident.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another quick role-play. Imagine you're in the meeting, and someone asks you for a reconciliation or a number you didn't expect. You take a deep breath, raise your hand just slightly, and say: "One minute." Now, let's practice making the phrase sound a bit firmer. Try saying it with a bit more conviction: "One minute, I've got it." See if that helps you feel more grounded. Now, let's add a tiny follow-up line. If the person asks for clarification or pushes back, you can say: "Can I just confirm?" or "Can you give me a minute to review?" Just one tiny line to help you stay on track. Take your time, and don't worry about the rest.

Patient: I tried it — I said, "One minute, I've got it." My voice came out a bit firmer and my chest eased a little, but my mind's still jittery and I worry I won't remember it; I guess if someone pushes back I'd say, "Can I just confirm?" I don't know — can we rehearse that pushback line a few times? I'm kind of scattered right now.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the firmer phrase effectively, and trying to use the "Can I just confirm?" line to handle pushback. Goal: Introduce a brief exercise to practice the pushback line in different scenarios.

Therapist Answer:
Let's rehearse the "Can I just confirm?" line a few times. Imagine you're in the meeting, and someone asks you for a reconciliation or a number you didn't expect. You take a deep breath, raise your hand just slightly, and say: "One minute, I've got it." Now, let's add a tiny pushback. Ask me: "Do you have the latest numbers?" or "Can you confirm that?" See how you respond to those questions. Just try to stay calm and focused on the question being asked. We'll do a few more iterations, and then we'll wrap up this session.

Patient: Do you have the latest numbers? Can you confirm that?

I don't know, I guess can we run those a few more times? My chest's still tight and I don't feel ready to stop.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the pushback line effectively, but still feeling a bit tight. Goal: Keep practicing the pushback line in a calm and focused manner.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a few more iterations. I'll ask you a question, and you respond with the pushback line. Then, I'll ask another question based on your response. Remember, the goal is to stay calm and focused.

You initially asked me: "Do you have the latest numbers?" I'll respond with: "I can confirm the numbers are updated as of last week."

Your turn: How would you respond to that question with the "Can I just confirm?" line?

(Continue to practice, taking deep breaths and staying focused. We'll keep going until you feel ready to stop.)

Patient: "Can I just confirm — do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments? I'll double-check now." 

I don't know, I guess my voice would be kind of shaky. Can we run that again?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the "Can I just confirm?" line effectively, and showing a good understanding of the context. Goal: Continue to practice the line in a calm and focused manner.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another iteration. Remember, you're asking for clarification on the numbers after last week's adjustments. I'll respond in a way that might require a bit more clarification.

You initially asked: "Can I just confirm — do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments? I'll double-check now."

My response: "Yes, that's correct. The numbers after the adjustments should be the ones you're looking for. However, I just realized that I need to update the spreadsheet one more time before I can confirm everything."

Your turn: How would you respond to that question with the "Can I just confirm?" line?

(Continue to practice, taking deep breaths and staying focused. We'll keep going until you feel ready to stop.)

Patient: "Can I just confirm — when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward? I'll double-check it once it's updated."

I don't know, my voice would probably be shaky saying that. Can we run that again?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the "Can I just confirm?" line effectively, and asking for clarification on the status of the spreadsheet update. Goal: Continue to practice the line in a calm and focused manner.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do another iteration. Remember, you're asking for confirmation on when the spreadsheet update will be completed, and when you can re-check the numbers.

You initially asked: "Can I just confirm — when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward? I'll double-check it once it's updated."

My response: "Yes, that's correct. I'll finish the update now, and you can re-check the numbers as soon as I'm done."

Your turn: How would you respond to that question with the "Can I just confirm?" line?

(Continue to practice, taking deep breaths and staying focused. We'll keep going until you feel ready to stop.)

Also, I want to notice that your voice is indeed shaking a bit, but that's okay. It's a natural response to feeling a bit nervous. Just acknowledge that feeling and take a deep breath to calm down. We're doing great so far.

Patient: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after? I'll double-check everything as soon as it's done."

I don't know, I guess my voice is still shaky and my chest's tight. Can we run that again once more?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're using the "Can I just confirm?" line effectively, and asking for confirmation on when you can re-check the numbers. Goal: One more iteration to feel confident and prepared.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do one more iteration. Remember, you're asking for confirmation on when you can re-check the numbers.

You initially asked: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after? I'll double-check everything as soon as it's done."

My response: "Yes, that's correct. I'll finish the update now, and you can re-check the numbers as soon as I'm done. Let me just finish this one task, and then I'll walk you through everything again."

Your turn: How would you respond to that question with the "Can I just confirm?" line?

(This is the last iteration. You've done great so far. Take a deep breath, relax, and respond naturally.)

(Note: I'll respond with a simple "Yes" or "Okay" to confirm your understanding, and then we'll wrap up this session.)

Patient: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after? I'll double-check everything as soon as it's done." 

I don't know, I guess my voice is still shaky and I don't feel ready to stop—can we do one more quick practice of the "One minute" plus the pushback, or run through one grounding cue I can use right after I say it?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still feeling a bit shaky, but you're willing to practice one more time. Goal: Quick practice to help you feel more confident and prepared.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a quick practice. We'll start with the "One minute" phrase, followed by the pushback. Then, we'll add a grounding cue to help you feel more centered.

Imagine you're in the meeting, and you say: "One minute, I've got it."

I'll respond with a question that requires a bit of clarification.

You'll respond with the "Can I just confirm?" line.

Finally, I'll suggest a grounding cue for you to try.

Here we go:

You say: "One minute, I've got it."
I ask: "Do you have the latest numbers?"
You respond with: "Can I just confirm — do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You can now say: "Can I just confirm — when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You can now say: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct. I'll finish the update now, and you can re-check the numbers as soon as I'm done."

After this practice, we'll add a grounding cue for you to try.

Remember, take a deep breath, and respond naturally.

Let's get through this practice, and then we can wrap up this session.

Patient: Okay... I did the whole sequence once. It helped a tiny bit — my chest loosened a little — but I'm still jumpy and my voice is shaky. I don't know, can we practice this exact sequence a few more times with the grounding cue right after I say "One minute"? Maybe: raise hand + "One minute" + one slow counted breath while holding the pen, then check. I guess I need to run that a few times before I can even think about stopping.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to practice the sequence a few more times to help you feel more grounded and confident. Goal: Continue to practice the sequence with the grounding cue to help you manage your physical responses.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do the sequence again, and then again, and again. Each time, we'll add a grounding cue right after you say "One minute". We'll use the raised hand and slow breath exercise to help you feel more centered.

Imagine you're in the meeting, and you say: "One minute, I've got it." as you raise your hand and take one slow, counted breath while holding the pen. Check.

We'll start again from the beginning.

You say: "One minute, I've got it."
I ask: "Do you have the latest numbers?"
You respond with: "Can I just confirm — do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You say: "Can I just confirm — when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You say: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct. I'll finish the update now, and you can re-check the numbers as soon as I'm done."

Let's do it again. This time, we'll start right after the first "One minute".

Remember, focus on your breath and your body. Try to let go of any tension or jitters. We're just going through this exercise to help you feel more grounded and confident.

Take a deep breath, and let's start again.

Patient: "One minute, I've got it." (I raised my hand a little, held the pen, and took one slow counted breath.)

Do you have the latest numbers?

"Can I just confirm—do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments?" 

Yes, that's correct.

"Can I just confirm—when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward?"

Yes, that's correct.

"Can I just confirm—so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after? I'll double-check everything as soon as it's done."

Yes, that's correct. I'll finish the update now, and you can re-check the numbers as soon as I'm done.

Okay… I did the whole sequence while holding the pen and doing that one slow breath. My chest eased a tiny bit and my voice was a little firmer, but I'm still jittery and my mind's racing. Can we run that same sequence one more time? I feel like I need to do it again to remember it.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've repeated the sequence, and while you still feel some physical and mental jitters, you've made some progress. Goal: One final repetition to help solidify the new behavior and reduce anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do the sequence one more time, exactly as before. We'll focus on the "One minute" phrase, the slow breath, and the grounding gesture with the pen. Remember to take your time, breathe slowly, and respond naturally.

You say: "One minute, I've got it." as you raise your hand and take one slow, counted breath while holding the pen. Check.

We'll start again from the beginning.

You say: "One minute, I've got it."
I ask: "Do you have the latest numbers?"
You respond with: "Can I just confirm — do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You say: "Can I just confirm — when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward?"
I respond: "Yes, that's correct."
You say: "Can I just confirm — so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after?"

Take a deep breath, and let's do this one last time. Remember to focus on your breath, your body, and the words coming out of your mouth. You've got this.

Patient: "One minute, I've got it." I raised my hand a little, held the pen, and took one slow counted breath.

Do you have the latest numbers?
Can I just confirm—do you mean the numbers after last week's adjustments?
Yes, that's correct.
Can I just confirm—when you say you'll update the spreadsheet, do you mean you'll finish that now and I should re-check afterward?
Yes, that's correct.
Can I just confirm—so you'll finish the update now and I'll re-check it right after? I'll double-check everything as soon as it's done.
Yes, that's correct.

Okay... I did it. My chest eased a tiny bit and my voice was a bit firmer, but I'm still jittery. I don't know, I guess can we run it one more time or practice that grounding cue to use right after I say "One minute"?
