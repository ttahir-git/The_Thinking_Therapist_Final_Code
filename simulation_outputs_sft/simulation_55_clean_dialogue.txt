Patient: I've been dodging get-togethers because the second I think about going my head starts predicting disaster — like I'll say something dumb, everyone will laugh, I'll lose friends, and I'll end up completely isolated and helpless. I'm an older data scientist, so my brain runs these worst-case simulations on loop and treats them like certainty. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't seem to stop believing those stories.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios about social interactions sound incredibly burdensome. Can you tell me more about what happens right before you think about going to a gathering? What's the first thought that pops into your head, and how do you know it's going to be a disaster? Is there a particular feeling or sensation that signals that you're going to have to dodge this event?

Patient: The first thought is always that I'll blurt something stupid or make a joke that dies, and everyone will suddenly see me as pathetic — then they'll gossip and I'll end up completely cut off. My brain immediately strings that into a full-run scenario, like a data model that only outputs disaster, so it feels inevitable. Physically I get a tight chest, my hands tremble, my stomach drops, and this buzzing in my head like it's running the worst-case code on loop.

Therapist: The way you describe the physical sensations, like a computer running a program, is really interesting. It sounds like your mind has become a bit of a simulation itself, predicting disasters and recreating them in vivid detail. Can you try to imagine what would happen if, for just a moment, the simulation stopped running? What if you took a deep breath and decided to explore the possibility of not having a disaster, rather than expecting one?

Patient: I try that, but my brain won't let the simulation stop — it's like an old model stuck on crash mode. Even if I take a deep breath, I instantly see the joke failing, people exchanging looks, someone whispering, my reputation tanking at work, and eventually I'm completely shut out; it unfolds so fast it feels inevitable. Imagining a calm, normal evening just feels like pretending — not realistic.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to imagine a different outcome is like trying to reboot the system, but it's not working because the crash mode is too strong. Can we try something smaller? What if, instead of imagining a whole evening, we just focus on one tiny step: what if you take a single deep breath before checking your emails? Or what if you say one simple "hello" to a friend when you call them? Just a tiny, tiny step. No pressure, no expectation. Just one tiny step. What do you think?

Patient: I wish I could, but the instant I try a tiny step my brain already spins the whole collapse — take a breath before checking email and I picture myself choking, sending a garbled reply, everyone laughing, my reputation ruined. Even a simple "hello" turns into me freezing, my voice cracking, someone whispering about me later, and it escalates from there. It feels impossible to let a small step stand on its own; the simulation just magnifies it into total catastrophe.

Therapist: It sounds like no matter how small the step, your brain is able to create a worst-case scenario that's almost impossible to live with. I think it's time we tried something different. Instead of focusing on predicting outcomes, let's focus on what's happening right now. Can you take a moment to notice how your body is feeling? Is there any tension, any relaxation? Is your breath feeling more or less labored? Let's just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, without trying to do anything else. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — my chest is tight, my breathing's shallow, my hands are trembling and there's that constant buzzing in my head. I try to track the in-and-out, but the disaster-simulation kicks in instantly, turning a slow breath into a choke or a cough and then everyone laughing, so I can't hold attention; it's like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane. I'm frustrated and worried this breathing thing won't work because my brain just hijacks it with the worst stories.

Therapist: It sounds like we're right back where we started. The breathing exercise didn't work because your brain just took over with the same worst-case scenarios. That's okay. Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the breath, let's just acknowledge the sensation of the tension in your body. Can you feel the tightness in your chest, the trembling in your hands? Just notice it, without trying to do anything about it. Just be with it. And then, instead of trying to control it, let's ask ourselves one simple question: "Is this feeling really about the breathing right now?"

Patient: No — it never feels like it's just about the breath. The tightness is the alarm bell that my brain-model flips when it starts running its disaster script: one shallow inhale and I already see myself choking, people laughing, gossip, losing my job — the physical stuff just feels like evidence for that story. I know it sounds irrational, but I can't quiet the loop and it's making me tense and really frustrated.

Therapist: It sounds like we're dealing with a more complex situation here than just a simple breathing exercise. The physical sensations are not just a result of the breathing, but a trigger for the whole worst-case thinking loop. This is not something you can just "fix" or "get over." It's a pattern that's been established through your brain's attempts to cope with anxiety. Can we try something different? Can we explore the idea that it's okay to experience this level of anxiety and fear, and that it's not something that needs to be eliminated or controlled? Maybe, just maybe, this is an opportunity to learn something new about yourself and how you respond to challenging situations.

Patient: I hear you, but when I try to accept the anxiety it just becomes more ammo for the simulation — I picture being visibly shaky, someone making a snide remark, whispers spreading, then I'm the punchline and even my colleagues stop asking me to join projects. I know that sounds extreme, but my brain treats that chain like a certainty, so "letting it be" feels like handing it the keys to wreck my life. I’m frustrated and stuck — I don’t know how to learn from it when the only lesson my mind ever offers is "disaster."

Therapist: It sounds like we're hitting a wall here. The more you try to accept the anxiety, the more it's just fueling the simulation. I want to try something different. Can we take a step back and look at the simulation itself? Can you show me what's happening when you see yourself being shaky, someone making a snide remark, and whispers spreading? What exactly is happening in that mental picture? Is it like a movie playing out in your mind? Can we try to break down that chain of thoughts and see if we can identify any patterns or commonalities? Maybe, just maybe, by exploring the simulation itself, we can start to gain some insight into what's driving it.

Patient: It's like a little movie that starts the second I open my mouth — slow, ugly silence, everyone's faces turning away, someone whispering, the laugh that isn't kind. Then it jumps forward: gossip spreads, I'm left out of conversations, projects dry up, my boss notices, performance ratings fall, and before I know it I'm boxed out at work and alone at home. My brain runs that exact chain like a script — as a data scientist I can tell you it's a deterministic model in there, every trigger maps to the same collapse — and I'm weirdly hooked on watching it even though it terrifies me. I know you'll suggest other possibilities, but that just feels like wishful thinking; this is the only realistic outcome my head ever shows.

Therapist: It sounds like we're dealing with a very specific and detailed script here. The way you break it down, step by step, is really interesting. It's like a little movie that you can watch in your mind. But here's the thing: just because this is the script that your brain is running, it doesn't mean that it's the only possible outcome. Can we try to explore the idea that there might be other possible scripts, other ways that your brain could be playing out this scenario? Not necessarily different outcomes, but different ways of thinking about it, different ways of experiencing it? It's not about changing the script, but about adding some complexity to it. Can we try to introduce some nuance to this deterministic model?

Patient: I get what you're saying, but my brain just won't take the extra complexity — when I try to imagine a gentler script it feels like a badly edited version of the disaster movie, like someone's pasted in a scene that doesn't belong. As a data scientist I keep looking for the bug, but every tweak I imagine gets overruled by that same old deterministic collapse, and that makes me angry and exhausted. I can try to picture something different, but I already know I'll end up back at the exact same ending, so it feels pointless.

Therapist: It sounds like we're hitting a wall here. The more we try to introduce complexity, the more your brain is pushing back. I think we need to take a step back and look at this from a different angle. Instead of trying to change the script, let's talk about why this script is so important to you. What is it about this scenario that's so crucial that you feel like you need to be able to change it? Is it related to your sense of identity, or your values, or something else? Let's explore what's driving this need to change the script, rather than trying to change the script itself.

Patient: I think it's about control and who I am — after the breakup and a lifetime of being the competent, sociable data scientist, the idea that one awkward moment could prove I'm suddenly worthless terrifies me. The worst-case script, awful as it is, gives me a sick kind of certainty: if I can predict the collapse I can brace for it, and not be blindsided. I know that sounds twisted, but imagining kinder outcomes just feels like lying to myself — my brain immediately calls them naive and rewinds the disaster movie, and I get stuck, angry and exhausted.

Therapist: It sounds like we're dealing with a very fundamental fear here. The idea that one moment could undermine your entire sense of self-worth is a daunting one, and it's understandable that you're trying to prepare for it. I want to acknowledge that this fear is not twisted, but rather a natural response to a deep-seated threat. However, I also want to gently suggest that maybe, just maybe, there's a way to approach this fear that doesn't involve reinforcing the worst-case scenario. Can we explore the idea that it's possible to reframe this fear in a way that doesn't rely on the certainty of the worst-case outcome? Instead, what if we focused on developing a sense of resilience and coping that allows you to navigate uncertain situations with greater ease and flexibility? It's not about avoiding the fear, but about developing a more nuanced and adaptive relationship with it.

Patient: I get what you're saying about resilience, but my brain treats kinder outcomes like garbage data — as a data scientist I look for ways to falsify it, and every time the model still spits out collapse: one awkward joke, someone snickering, whispers, exclusion from projects, then I'm isolated and floundering. Saying "reframe" feels like sugarcoating to me; it doesn't show me how to actually break the loop. I'm tired and frustrated—can you show me a concrete step or test that could actually disrupt that deterministic script instead of just asking me to believe in alternatives?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the script. Can you tell me more about the specific sequence of events that you've been running? What happens exactly when someone makes a snickering comment? What's the exact phrase that's said, and how does it lead to your exclusion from projects? Let's break down the script, step by step, and see if we can find a tiny inconsistency or a weak link somewhere in there. Maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to exploit that weakness and start disrupting the script.

Patient: It usually starts with one person saying something like, "Uh... did you mean that?" in a way that's thinly polite — then a nervous chuckle, someone adds, "Wow, that was…awkward," and that tiny sound becomes a ripple: looks, the room goes quiet, somebody whispers "he's not with it lately," and within a day it's Slack jokes, the boss stops inviting me to brainstorms, and by the next quarter I'm off the key project rota. My brain treats each line of that chain as a deterministic rule: snicker -> whisper -> reputation drop -> project exclusion -> isolation. Maybe the weak link is that gossip takes time and not everyone instantly decides someone's finished, but honestly that feels like grasping at stray data — my head just overwrites that possibility and rewinds the collapse every time.

Therapist: It seems like we've found a good starting point. Let's take a closer look at the first step in the chain, where someone says "Uh... did you mean that?" in a way that's thinly polite. Can you tell me more about what happens right after that? How do you react to the nervous chuckle, and how does the conversation progress? Let's try to identify a specific moment where you could potentially introduce some uncertainty or hesitation into the script. Maybe, just maybe, we can create a small crack in the armor that would allow us to start disrupting the deterministic script. As we explore this, I want you to remember that it's okay if you don't know exactly what to do. We're just trying to introduce some uncertainty and hesitation into the script, and see where that takes us.

Patient: Right after the "Uh... did you mean that?" I go blank — my mouth dries, I either blurt an awkward explanation or try to make a joke to cover it and my voice ends up cracking. That reaction always becomes the "proof" in the movie: people laugh, someone whispers, and the whole ripple starts. I can kind of see a tiny weak spot — maybe if I didn't rush to explain and instead asked a simple, neutral question like "What did you mean?" or just held a calm silence, it might stop the momentum — but my brain screams that a pause will just look worse, like I'm fumbling or hiding something, so I immediately dismiss it as unrealistic. I'm frustrated because I want a concrete test but my head keeps vetoing the only possible openings I can imagine.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to convince yourself that a pause or a question will be catastrophic, but your brain is telling you that it's the only way to avoid disaster. I want to try something different. Instead of trying to convince your brain that it's okay to take a pause or ask a question, let's try to imagine a scenario where it actually happens. Let's say that instead of rushing to explain, you hold a calm silence for just a few seconds. What happens? How do people react? Do they start talking again, or do they keep quiet? Let's explore this scenario together, and see if we can find any way to make it work. Can you imagine yourself holding that silence, and then responding with a simple question like "What did you mean?"?

Patient: I try to hold that silence in my head and it immediately rewrites itself: a long, awkward pause, someone’s smirk, a snide, “Guess he forgot what he was saying,” nervous chuckles, and when I finally say “What did you mean?” it comes out thin and defensive so they double down on the joke — within hours it's being retold as proof I'm losing it. I can almost taste the Slack messages and the project invites drying up; as a data scientist my brain treats that silent pause as just another input that guarantees collapse. I'm tired of picturing this and I don't know how to test the pause without my head vetoing it as proof of the worst outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're hitting a wall again, where your brain is predicting a negative outcome and then acting in a way that confirms it. I want to try something different. Instead of trying to hold onto the idea of a silent pause, let's try to imagine a scenario where it happens without judgment. Let's say that you hold a silent pause for just a few seconds, and then respond with a simple question like "What did you mean?" without thinking about how it will be received. What happens? Does it actually lead to a productive conversation, or does it still trigger the same negative responses? I want you to imagine yourself in this scenario, without trying to predict the outcome or judge your own behavior. Just be present with what happens, and see if you can learn anything from it. Can you try this for me? Just imagine holding the silent pause, and then responding with the question. See what happens.

Patient: I try to picture the quiet beat and then asking, but as soon as I hold that pause the movie starts: the silence stretches, someone smirks, someone says “he’s off his game,” it gets told as proof I’m slipping and within days the projects dry up. My head treats that neutral pause as another input that guarantees collapse, and honestly I don’t have the energy left to keep arguing with it right now.

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that you're exhausted from trying to fight this pattern. It's clear that you've been putting a lot of mental effort into trying to convince yourself that a neutral pause won't lead to disaster, and it's taking a toll on your energy. I want to try something different. Instead of trying to convince your brain that a neutral pause is a good idea, let's try to accept that it's a possibility. Can you try to accept that the silence might not be the end of the world, and that it might even be a chance for a new conversation to start? It's not about judging yourself or your behavior, it's just about being present with the moment and seeing what happens. Can you try to approach this with a little more curiosity and openness, rather than resistance? Just observe what happens when you hold the silence, and see if you can learn anything from it.

Patient: I can try to *pretend* to be curious, but the moment I picture that pause my brain turns it into proof and the whole collapse reruns like a bad script. I can't keep arguing with it right now — can we slow down and pick one tiny, concrete test I could do later, something I don't have to imagine this minute?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on a tiny, concrete test that you can do later. Something that doesn't require you to imagine or think about the pause right now. How about this: can you make a simple observation about your own behavior when you're in a conversation? For example, can you notice how often you interrupt others, or how often you feel the need to fill an awkward silence? Just observe this behavior without judgment, and see what you notice. This can help you build some awareness and confidence about your own interactions, and maybe even lay some groundwork for exploring the idea of a neutral pause in the future. Can you try to make this observation for just a few minutes, and see what you notice?

Patient: Okay... I can try that — I'll watch for how often I interrupt or jump in during the next call for maybe five minutes. My brain's already squawking that I'll notice a hundred slips and that'll be instant proof I'm failing, but I'll try to just count them without turning it into a verdict. I don't know if I can do it calmly, but I'll give it a go.

Therapist: Remember to focus on counting the interruptions or jumps in without immediately interpreting them as evidence of your failure. Try to maintain a neutral, observational mindset. It's okay if you feel your brain trying to squirm away or make excuses - simply acknowledge the thought and gently refocus your attention on the task at hand. Take a few deep breaths if you need to, and remind yourself that you're just trying to observe your behavior for a few minutes. Don't worry too much about whether you can do it calmly - just try to be present with the moment and see what happens. Five minutes might feel like a long time right now, but it's just a small step towards building your confidence and developing a more neutral relationship with your thoughts. Go ahead and give it a try.

Patient: Alright — I'll try to five-minute tally on the next call. My brain's already yelling that the count will be proof the movie's right and that everything will collapse, and doing this feels like a huge drag, but I'll force myself to just tally without turning it into a verdict. If I get sucked into the script, can you remind me how to bring my attention back to counting?

Therapist: Don't worry if you do get sucked into the script - it's a natural response, and it's not a failure. If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts like "This is going to prove everything is wrong" or "I'm such a failure for even trying," just gently bring your attention back to counting. Take a deep breath, and remind yourself that you're just trying to observe your behavior for a few minutes. Ask yourself, "What's the task at hand?" or "What do I need to focus on right now?" This can help you refocus your attention and get back on track. If you need to, you can even say to yourself, "Let's start again. What's the first interruption?" This can help you break the cycle of negative thinking and get back to the task at hand. Just remember to be kind to yourself, and try to stay present. You got this.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try to snap back to counting, but my head’s already buzzing and I might go blank. Can you give me one very short cue I can say to myself—like “What’s the task?”—that I can use if the movie starts up? My brain’s already yelling the tally’ll prove everything, but I’ll try to use the cue on the next call.

Therapist: How about this: "Start again" (SA). Say it to yourself immediately if you feel your brain starting to pull you back into the script. It's short, simple, and direct. It can help you refocus your attention and get back to the task at hand. Try it out on the next call and see how it goes. Remember, the goal is to get back to counting, not to worry about whether you're doing it "right" or not. Just focus on starting again.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to use "Start again" (SA) on the next call. My brain's already yelling that it'll fail and be proof everything's collapsing, but I'll force myself to say it if the movie starts. If SA doesn't snap me back, can you give me one other tiny backup—like "What’s the task?"—I can say to myself?

Therapist: How about this: "Just count" (JC). If SA doesn't work, try saying "Just count" to yourself. It's a simple and direct reminder to focus on counting, without getting caught up in thinking about whether you're doing it "right" or not. Try to say it to yourself with a calm and neutral tone, and see if it helps you get back to the task at hand. Remember, the goal is not to avoid failure, but to stay present and focused on the task. If JC doesn't work either, we can try other strategies.

Patient: Okay — I'll try "Just count" if "Start again" fails, but my head's already yelling that I'll lose track and that'll be proof I'm failing. If I do blank out, should I restart the tally from zero or just pick up where I think I left off? I feel foggy and it's a lot to manage, so a really simple rule would help.

Therapist: If you do blank out, I recommend simply picking up where you think you left off. Don't worry about restarting the tally from zero. Instead, focus on recalling the last count or estimate you made. Try to maintain a consistent count from there, even if you're not entirely sure what the exact number is. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting too bogged down in details. Remember, the goal is to observe your behavior and stay present, not to create unnecessary complexity or stress. Just focus on picking up where you left off and keeping the count going.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to pick up where I think I left off instead of restarting. If I go completely blank I'll... try to make a best guess and keep counting, but I can already feel my head tightening at the thought. If you notice me zoning, could you gently say "SA" or "Just count" out loud to nudge me back?

Therapist: I'll do my best to subtly nudge you back when I notice you zoning out. If I catch you saying "Just count" to yourself, I might respond with a gentle "SA" to help you refocus. If I see you physically blanking out or struggling to recall the last count, I might say "SA" more explicitly to help you get back on track. Remember, I'm not trying to tell you what to do or be too pushy. My goal is to gently guide you back to your counting, using verbal cues that are subtle yet effective.

Patient: Okay — hearing you say you'll nudge me helps a little, though my chest just clenched thinking about it and I don't know if it'll break through the movie. If you hear me go blank, please say "SA" out loud, and if that doesn't land say "Just count" — I don't have the energy to argue with my head right now, so those two spoken cues are all I can handle.

Therapist: I'll do my best to help you stay on track. If you start to feel yourself going blank or zoning out, I'll say "SA" out loud to try and snap you back to focus. If that doesn't work, I'll try saying "Just count" in a calm and gentle voice. Remember, my goal is to support you, not add to your anxiety. Take a deep breath, stay present, and try to focus on the task at hand. If it's too much, just let me know.

Patient: Okay... I'll try the five-minute count, but my chest's tight and my head's already humming that the tally will just prove the movie right. If I start blanking, please say "SA" straight away — louder if you have to — and then "Just count" if that doesn't snap me back. I don't know if I can do it, but I'll try.

Therapist: 'read'  might'right'  ''-dumbfoundingly simple- But still'ingesting my brain'right now'right.  *sigh* I can’t remember everything I was taught in class—this isn’t right — but I'll try something simple. If I go blank, I want you to remind me what I should be focusing on. I want to try something new instead of the usual loop. *takes a deep breath* I'll try it. I'll attempt to stay present and present-focused. Right now, with your encouragement, I can stay here for a bit.

Patient: Okay. I’ll try the five-minute count on the next call, but my head’s already racing — I can almost see the whole collapse and it makes me want to bail. If I go blank, please say SA out loud right away, then “Just count” if that doesn’t work; as a data scientist my brain’s already modeling how the tally will prove the movie right, so I’ll need the nudge. I don’t know how long I can hold this—my thoughts are fuzzy—but I’ll try.

Patient: Ugh — that block of repeated words just makes my head spin and turns into a new disaster movie: everyone speaking in buzzwords while I'm invisible, projects outsourced, me left out because I'm "dated." I can't parse it right now; my chest's tight and I feel foggy and useless. Can we slow down and go back to the simple plan — remind me to "SA" then "Just count" if I start blanking?
