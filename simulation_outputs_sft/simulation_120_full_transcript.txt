--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early sixties, an accountant, and lately what's been on my mind is that since the kids left I've been leaning on talking to friends and family to dull the uncomfortable feelings — it feels like a safety valve. It quiets the anxiety for a while but doesn't actually fix anything, and I've been doing it for months. How is talking about it here supposed to help when I've tried similar things and it doesn't work?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes using talking to friends and family as a safety valve to manage uncomfortable feelings of anxiety, but notes it doesn't actually address the issue. The goal is to explore why this coping mechanism isn't working as intended and to introduce an alternative process.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you stop talking to friends and family for a while? Does the anxiety come back in a different way, or is it like a constant hum in the background? I'm not looking for solutions, but rather trying to understand what might be left unaddressed after you've talked about these feelings.
Note: The goal is to ask a specific question, encourage exploration, and introduce the therapeutic process. The response avoids offering solutions, reframing, or praising.

Patient: When I stop talking to people, the anxiety mostly settles into this constant hum — sometimes quieter, sometimes it flares up into sharp waves out of nowhere. I start replaying things, feeling restless and a bit hollow, like the quiet just makes everything louder. I've tried sitting with it before and it doesn't help much — how is that supposed to help here?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes how the anxiety manifests as a constant hum or sharp waves when not talking to others, and how sitting with it doesn't provide relief. The goal is to explore the patient's experience with acceptance and defusion.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of physical sensations when you're not talking to others - the hum, the waves, the restlessness. Can you bring one of those sensations into the present right now, just for a moment? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to change it or make it go away. Just observe it as it is.

Patient: Alright — I can feel my feet on the floor, they're steady and a bit warm. The air on my skin is cool, and there's that low hum in my chest that doesn't go away, even when I notice it; my mind wants to jump up and find someone to talk to. Sitting with it makes me restless and a little panicky, honestly — I keep thinking, what am I supposed to do with this? How is noticing it really supposed to help when I've tried this before and it didn't change much?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to notice and describe a physical sensation (feet on the floor, air on the skin) and a subtle emotional sensation (the low hum). However, when focusing on the hum, they become restless and panicky, recalling their previous experience with sitting with it. The goal is to gently explore the patient's willingness to explore further.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to be here, and I appreciate your willingness to explore even when it feels uncomfortable or familiar. Can you say to yourself right now, "It's okay to not know what to do with this. It's okay to not have an answer. I'm just going to notice this hum, and I'm going to sit with it, for the next few breaths." Let's see what happens when we start to lean into the uncertainty a bit more.

Patient: Okay — I said it: "It's okay to not know..." Saying it felt a little silly, but my shoulders did relax a bit and the hum got a notch quieter. Still, my mind immediately starts making a to-do list and the restlessness kicks back in, so how is that supposed to help when I usually end up calling someone anyway?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to acknowledge and articulate their willingness to not know what to do, which led to a slight decrease in physical tension. However, their mind quickly returns to familiar coping strategies (to-do lists, calling others), and the restlessness resumes. The goal is to gently explore the possibility of exploring alternative ways to cope.

Therapist Answer:
It's interesting that your mind immediately starts making a list again. Can you notice what happens when you look at that list? What sensations arise in your body, what thoughts run through your mind? Let's try to observe the list itself, rather than acting on it. Just look at the words on the page, or the thoughts in your head, without trying to do anything with them yet. See what happens when we pause like this.

Patient: When I look at that list my chest tightens and my hands itch to reach for the phone — it's like a reflex. Thoughts immediately pop up: "If I don't call someone I'll spiral," and I start rehearsing what I'll say, who to ring; the list feels like a script to keep me from sitting with the feeling. Noticing it for a moment makes me a little calmer because I can see the pattern, but mostly the urge to act still wins — how is just watching that supposed to stop me from doing it?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to notice the physical sensations (chest tightening, itching hands) and thoughts that arise when looking at the list, which are similar to their previous coping mechanisms. The goal is to explore the possibility of defusion and introducing a different process.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that just noticing the list isn't enough to stop the urge to act on it. Can we try something slightly different? Instead of just observing the list, I'd like you to bring the physical sensations into focus for a moment. Just notice the tightness in your chest, the itchiness in your hands, without trying to change them or use them to act on the list. See if you can observe these sensations just for a breath, without judgment. Then, we can come back to the list and see what happens.

Patient: Okay — I did it. The chest felt heavy and tight, my breathing got shallower for a moment, and my hands had that prickly itch; after one breath the urge to reach for the phone quieted a bit, but it didn't go away. My mind's already saying this is pointless — how is one breath supposed to change that when usually I just end up calling someone?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to focus on the physical sensations (chest tightness, breathing, hands) for a brief moment, which led to a slight decrease in the urge to act. However, their mind quickly returns to its critical and skeptical tone, questioning the effectiveness of such a short intervention. The goal is to explore the possibility of exploring more of the process.

Therapist Answer:
It's not about changing everything with one breath. It's about taking a small step, noticing a tiny detail, and exploring it a bit further. Can you try to keep focusing on the sensation in your chest, without judgment? Try to notice how the sensation changes as you continue to breathe, even if it's just for a few more breaths. Don't try to do anything with it yet; just observe it. See what happens if we pause like this for a little longer.

Patient: Okay — I kept my attention on the chest for a few breaths: it did loosen a notch, my breathing got a bit deeper, the hum dropped a little. But after a minute the itch in my hands came back and my head was already rehearsing who to call. I get that this is about noticing patterns, but honestly, how is pausing like this supposed to stop me from reaching for the phone when that's been my go-to for months? I'm willing to keep trying, but I'm doubtful it'll change much unless there's something more to it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to maintain their focus on the physical sensations for a slightly longer period, which leads to a minor improvement in their state. However, their mind continues to return to its skeptical and critical tone, questioning the effectiveness of this process. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more fundamental question about their relationship with the phone.

Therapist Answer:
It's not about pausing or noticing patterns anymore. It's about questioning what's driving your need to reach for the phone. Is it just a habit, or is there something else at play? What's the purpose of calling someone when you're feeling this way? What would happen if you didn't reach for the phone, just for a moment? See if we can explore this question a bit further. Can you say to yourself, "I'm not sure why I'm reaching for the phone right now. I'm just going to pause and see what comes up?"

Patient: Okay — I said it: "I'm not sure why I'm reaching for the phone right now. I'm just going to pause and see what comes up." What came up was a hollow sort of sadness and this sharper little fear that if I don't talk I'll feel useless or like the house is just too quiet — a memory of the kids' rooms empty. My chest tightened, the itch in my hands stayed, and a thought popped up: "If someone answers, I won't have to sit with this." But honestly, naming it feels small — how is that supposed to stop the reflex when the need to be needed hits so fast? Can we slow down a bit — I want to keep at this but it's starting to feel like we're circling the same thing.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to pause and acknowledge their underlying emotions (hollow sadness, fear of being useless, memory of the kids' rooms), which reveals a deeper layer of their experience. However, their mind still returns to its familiar coping strategies (reflex to reach for the phone) and their critical tone questions the effectiveness of this process. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more fundamental question about their relationship with their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It's not about slowing down, it's about taking a different kind of pause. Can you try to notice the difference between the thoughts that came up when you said "I'm not sure why I'm reaching for the phone right now" and the thoughts that are coming up now? The first time, you noticed a sense of emptiness and a specific fear. This time, it feels like the same old familiar thoughts. Let's try to explore that difference. Can you say to yourself, "I'm not just looking for a reason to reach for the phone, I'm looking to understand why these thoughts are showing up now. What's different this time?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow what you mean by "what's different this time" — how is that supposed to help? Saying it, I notice the first thoughts were more raw — emptiness and that fear about the quiet — and now it's more like an automatic script, rehearsed reasons to call so I don't have to sit with the hollow. I can see a small shift when I name that, but it still feels like the same reflex and I'm getting a bit uneasy, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to reflect on the process and notice a subtle shift in their experience, from raw emotions to a more rehearsed script. However, their unease and sense of stuckness are still present. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more gentle and gentle pace to the process.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and look at the process as a whole, rather than just focusing on the last few moments. We've been exploring the pattern of reaching for the phone, and how that's related to the feeling of emptiness and the need to be needed. Can you tell me more about what's been working for you so far, and what's been feeling challenging? Is there anything in particular that's been feeling stuck or difficult for you in our conversation today?

Patient: What's helped a bit are those tiny pauses and naming the tightness — it actually loosens my chest a notch. What's hard is the reflex to call, the rehearsed scripts, and this gnawing shame that I shouldn't be having to deal with this at my age — it makes me want to hide instead of sit with it. I'm frustrated because naming it feels small and pointless, and I keep thinking, "How is digging into this supposed to stop me from reaching for the phone when it just reminds me of how I've messed up?" I want to keep at it, but I'm uneasy and need us to slow down a bit — I don't want to feel like we're just circling the same blame.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to acknowledge what's been slightly helpful (tiny pauses and naming the tightness) and what's been difficult (reflex to call, rehearsed scripts, shame, and frustration). They express a sense of unease and feeling like they're not making progress, which is leading to a desire to slow down and move in a different direction. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more supportive and validating tone to help the patient feel more grounded and less defensive.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge how hard this is for you, and how frustrating it can feel like we're not making progress. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of shame and self-criticism, which is understandable given the situation. Can I offer you a different perspective on this conversation? Instead of focusing on "digging into" the issue, what if we focused on creating a safe space for you to explore your feelings and experiences without judgment? What if we worked together to understand what's driving your desire to reach for the phone, and what you hope to achieve when you do? Let's take a step back and focus on understanding, rather than fixing or changing anything. How does that sound?

Patient: That actually sounds… tolerable — less like I'm being told to fix myself. I'm not sure I follow how just "understanding" will change the reflex; I feel this sharp shame like I’ve failed, and my chest’s tighter and my thoughts are jumpy right now. I can try to explore what I hope to get when I call, but honestly I'm skeptical — how is that supposed to help me stop reaching for the phone? Can we take it slow?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to acknowledge that the previous suggestion was more tolerable, but still skeptical about how it will help them stop reaching for the phone. They express ongoing shame, physical tension, and jumpy thoughts, which suggests that the issue is still quite pressing. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more gentle and gradual approach to help the patient feel more grounded and less reactive.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it very slow. Can we start with just noticing how you're feeling right now, without trying to do anything with those feelings? Just bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, the thoughts in your head, and the physical sensations in your body. Don't try to change anything, just observe it as it is. Let's do this for just one breath, and then we'll see how it goes from there. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I did the one breath. My chest eased a little and my breathing got a touch deeper, but my hands still itch and my mind's already rehearsing who to call; there's that low shame under it all making me want to hide. I'm trying to stay with it, but honestly, how is one breath supposed to stop the reflex when it always comes back? Can we keep at this more slowly — a few more breaths — and stay with whatever shows up?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to notice some small improvements (chest easing, breathing deepening) but still experiences the itchiness, rehearsed thoughts, and underlying shame. They express frustration with the idea that one breath can stop the reflex, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more mindful and accepting approach to help the patient learn to tolerate the difficult sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a few more breaths, just for now. Can you gently bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it? Just notice how it feels, as it is. Don't try to force anything, just observe. And when you notice the itchiness in your hands, or the thoughts starting to run away, can you just gently acknowledge them, without trying to do anything with them? Just say to yourself, "Ah, my hands are itchy," or "I'm thinking about calling." Can you do that, just for a few more breaths?

Patient: I did the breaths and said the little acknowledgements — "Ah, my hands are itchy," "I'm thinking about calling." It loosened the chest a hair, but my hands still itch and my head's already listing names and what I'd say; I'm anxious and jumpy and a bit distracted. I don't know, it's just — how is noticing this supposed to stop the reflex when everything in me wants to pick up the phone? Can we really take it slower and stay with whatever comes up next?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to continue the process with the gentle acknowledgment of their physical sensations and thoughts. However, they express ongoing discomfort and anxiety, feeling that the process is not yielding the desired results. They question the effectiveness of simply noticing their experiences and wonder if it's truly possible to change their reflexive behavior. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more subtle and nuanced approach to help the patient cultivate a sense of acceptance and tolerance.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if it's not working the way you think it should. It's okay if you're still feeling anxious and jumpy. Let's not worry about stopping the reflex right now. Let's just focus on what's happening right now. Can you bring your attention to your breath, just for a moment? Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it or change it, just observe it as it is. When you're ready, we can gently bring our attention back to the sensation in your chest, or to the itchiness in your hands. But for now, let's just focus on the breath. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Alright — I focused on the breath for a moment. It’s pretty shallow and fast, and noticing it did ease my chest a hair, but my hands still itch, my heart's a bit quicker, and my mind's already drafting who to call. How is paying attention to breathing supposed to stop that reflex? I can try a few more breaths if we really take it slow and stay with whatever comes up.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to continue the process with a brief focus on their breath, which shows some small improvements (eased chest). However, they express frustration with the idea that this alone can stop their reflexive behavior, and their mind is already drifting back to the urge to call. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more subtle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
It's not about stopping the reflex right now. It's not about making it go away completely. It's about learning to be with it, in a different way. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for a moment? Not on trying to control it, not on changing it, just on observing it as it is. Notice the sensation of your hands, too. Feel the itchiness, but also notice the sensation of your hands touching the air, or the sensation of the skin on your hands. Can you bring that attention to your attention, just for a moment?

Patient: I did it — I felt the breath, it eased a little, and I could feel the skin on my hands and the itch, but it didn’t disappear. I'm not sure I follow how focusing on the breath or the feel of my hands is supposed to stop the reflex — there's this shame under it all that makes me feel like I've failed, and right now I'm jumpy and kind of scattered. Can we really slow down and keep sitting with whatever comes up next? I'm willing to try, but I need us to go much slower.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to continue the process with a focus on their breath and physical sensations, but expresses ongoing struggle with their reflexive behavior and underlying shame. They question the effectiveness of simply paying attention to their experiences and wonder if it's truly possible to change their behavior. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more gentle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge how hard this is for you. It's okay to feel like you've failed, and it's okay to be jumpy and scattered. Let's not try to push through it or force anything. Can we just sit with it, for a moment? Just notice how you're feeling, without trying to do anything with it. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your attention to rest on the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it. Not try to ease it, not try to make it go away. Just rest on it. And then, if you're ready, we can bring our attention to your hands, just for a moment. Notice the sensation of the itchiness, and the sensation of the skin on your hands. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I did the deep breath and let my attention rest on my chest — it loosened a little, but my hands still itch and my mind's already drafting who to call; there's that underlying shame making me feel small and jumpy. I'm not sure I follow how just resting on the feeling is supposed to stop the reflex to reach for the phone — how is that supposed to help? I'm feeling a bit scattered and uneasy, so can we really slow down and stay with whatever comes up next?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to continue the process with a focus on their chest, but still experiences the itchiness and underlying shame. They express frustration with the idea that resting on their feelings will stop their reflexive behavior, and are feeling increasingly scattered and uneasy. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more gentle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want to take a step back and look at this process as a whole. It's not about stopping the reflex right now. It's not about changing how you feel. It's about being with how you feel, in a different way. Can you try to notice how you're feeling, without trying to change it? Just observe it, like you're watching a thought or a sensation pass through your mind. Don't try to grasp it, don't try to push it away. Just be with it. And then, if you're ready, we can try something new. We can try noticing the sensations in your hands, without trying to change them. Just notice how they feel, as they feel. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I did — my hands feel warm and a bit tingly, the itch is sharp near my fingertips and my fingers actually want to move like they’re about to pick up the phone. Noticing it loosens things a tiny bit, but the urge's still loud and my chest's jumpy. I don't really follow how just observing the itch is supposed to stop the reflex — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer? I'm getting anxious and scattered.

The patient is able to continue the process with a focus on their hands, but still experiences a strong urge to pick up the phone. They express frustration with the idea that observing the itch will stop their reflexive behavior, and are feeling increasingly anxious and scattered. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more subtle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something very different. Can you please, for just a moment, say to yourself: "I am exactly where I am right now." Just those words. Say them out loud, if you need to. "I am exactly where I am right now." Just focus on those words, and the sensation of your body right now. Don't try to think about anything else, don't try to feel anything else. Just be with these words, and the sensation of your body. Can you do that for me?

Patient: "I am exactly where I am right now." I said it out loud — my chest eased a little and my breathing got a touch steadier, but my hands still itch and my head's already listing names to call. I don't really follow how repeating that is supposed to stop the reflex or the shame — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and stay with whatever comes up next?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to continue the process with a focus on the specific phrase, but still experiences the urge to pick up the phone. They express confusion about how repeating the phrase will help, and are feeling increasingly frustrated. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more subtle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want to take a step back and look at this process as a whole. It's not about repeating a phrase to stop the reflex or the shame. It's not about trying to change how you feel or what you think. It's about being present with yourself, exactly as you are right now. Can you please try to let go of the need to do anything with your thoughts or feelings? Just let them be. Not try to change them, not try to push them away, not try to understand them. Just let them be. And at the same time, please try to focus on the sensation of your body, right now. The sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just focus on that. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I did that — I focused on my feet, the air on my skin, and the breath. My feet feel solid and a bit heavy, the air's cool, my breathing's shallow but steadier, and that prickly shame's still under everything like a background hum; my hands still itch to move. I'm not sure I follow how just letting it be is supposed to stop the reflex to call — how is staying with this supposed to help? Can we really stay here a bit longer and not rush to the next step?

The patient is able to continue the process with a focus on their body sensations, but still experiences the urge to pick up the phone. They express frustration with the idea that letting things be will help, and are feeling increasingly uneasy. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more subtle and gradual approach to help the patient build tolerance and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel uneasy. It's okay to feel like you're not making progress. It's okay to feel like you're just sitting here. Can you try to accept that, for just a moment? Just acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. Don't try to change it, don't try to push it away. Just acknowledge it. And then, please, try to bring your attention back to the sensation in your hands. Not try to change it, not try to push it away. Just observe it. Notice how it feels, exactly as it feels. Can you do that for me? Take one more deep breath, and then bring your attention to your hands. Just observe.

Patient: I took the deep breath and put my attention on my hands — they feel warm, tingling, and that sharp itch at the fingertips like they're about to grab the phone; my fingers actually want to move. A hot shame rises under it, makes me feel clumsy and like I've failed, which just makes it harder to observe — I'm not sure I follow how staying with this stops the reflex. Can we really slow down and just stay here for a few more breaths?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on their hands despite the intense physical sensations and shame. They express frustration that staying with this process is not helping, and are feeling increasingly overwhelmed. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a gentle pause, allowing the patient to reassess their experience before continuing.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something gentle. Can you please bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for a moment? Not try to change it, not try to control it. Just observe it. Notice how it feels, exactly as it feels. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your eyes to gently close. Just rest on the sensation of the breath, without trying to focus on anything else. Can you do that for me? For just one more breath?

Patient: Alright — I'll try one more breath. I closed my eyes and breathed in; my chest eased a little and my breathing slowed a notch, but my hands still itch and there's that hot shame under everything making me feel clumsy and useless. I'm not sure I follow how this really helps stop the reflex to call — it calms me a hair, then the urge comes back — can we stay here a bit longer and go really slow?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to take a brief pause and experience a small improvement, but the reflexive behavior persists. They express frustration that the calming effect is temporary and the urge to call returns. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more prolonged pause, allowing the patient to explore their experience in greater detail.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something different. Instead of trying to focus on the physical sensations or the shame, I want you to try to notice how you're holding the pause. Are you feeling tense, or relaxed? Are you feeling like you're trying to control something, or are you allowing yourself to be present? Notice how you're using your body, how you're breathing, how you're feeling. Can you do that for me? For just a moment, can you focus on how you're holding this pause, rather than what's happening inside or outside of you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I focus on how I'm holding the pause I notice my shoulders are up near my ears, I'm gripping the edge of the chair, my jaw's tight and I'm leaning forward like I'm about to move. My breath is shallow and my hands are poised, like they're already reaching for the phone; a hot wave of shame and frustration rises and makes me feel clumsy. How is noticing all that supposed to help when I've noticed it a hundred times and still end up calling? I can keep doing this, but please — can we go much slower and sit here a bit longer?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to notice their physical tension and their body's automatic response to the pause, which suggests a high level of automaticity and habituation. They express frustration that noticing these patterns doesn't seem to help and that they've been doing this process before without changing their behavior. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more gentle and gradual approach that acknowledges the patient's high level of habituation and automaticity.

Therapist Answer:
I think it's time we take a step back and look at this process as a whole. You've been doing this for a while now, and it's clear that you've developed some very automatic responses to the pause. I want to try something that might help you feel more comfortable with this process, rather than trying to change it. Can you please sit here with me for just a minute, without doing anything? Just be present with yourself, and let's see what happens. No trying to relax, no trying to focus, no trying to change anything. Just be. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I can try to sit here for a minute. Right now my shoulders are up, my hands are itching like they're already reaching for the phone, and this hot shame is buzzing under everything — it makes me feel exposed and kind of useless. How is just "being" supposed to help with that? I'll stay, but please go really slow and stay with me while I do.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to maintain their physical tension and emotional state, despite their best efforts to relax. They express skepticism about how simply "being" can help with their shame and helplessness. The goal is to explore the possibility of using a gentle, gradual approach to help the patient become more aware of their experiences in the present moment, without trying to change or control them.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to think about it slowly. Can you tell me what you're feeling right now, exactly as you're feeling it? Not what you think you should be feeling, or what you think might happen next. Just what you're feeling right now. It's okay if it's hard to put into words. Just try to notice it. What's it like to feel this shame and helplessness right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — right now it's this hot, prickly shame in my chest that makes me want to disappear, and a hollow, helpless feeling like I should've figured this out by now. My shoulders are tight, my hands keep twitching toward the phone, and my mind's jumpy and scattered, replaying things I messed up. I can name it, but naming it just makes me feel clumsy and small — how is talking about this supposed to help me stop reaching for the phone? Can we really slow down and stay here a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to articulate their physical and emotional sensations in detail, which suggests a high level of awareness and introspection. They express frustration that talking about their feelings doesn't seem to be helping them stop their compulsive behavior, and they request a slower pace. The goal is to explore the possibility of introducing a more mindful and gentle approach that acknowledges the patient's struggles with introspection and self-awareness.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're able to acknowledge and describe your feelings quite accurately. I'm going to ask you to do something similar, but with a different focus. Can you tell me what you're noticing about your body right now, as you sit here? Are there any sensations, feelings, or thoughts that are particularly present or dominant? Try to focus on one thing at a time, and see if you can notice anything specific. It's okay if it's hard to focus on just one thing - just try to notice what's happening right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I check in with my body right now my shoulders are up by my ears, my jaw's tight, and my breath's shallow. The most dominant things are a hot, prickly shame in my chest and an almost physical itch in my fingertips like they're already reaching for the phone; my hands actually want to move. It makes me feel clumsy and like I've failed, which just adds to the tension. How is noticing all this supposed to help me stop the reflex — can we just stay with the hands and the chest a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to maintain their focus on their physical sensations and emotional state, despite some initial confusion. They express a desire to continue exploring their bodily sensations and emotional responses, particularly with regards to their hands and chest. The goal is to explore the possibility of using a more specific and targeted approach to help the patient become more aware of their reflexive behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at those sensations in your chest. What's the quality of that hot, prickly shame like right now? Is it sharp, dull, or somewhere in between? And how does it feel to have this sense of clumsiness and failure? Can you notice how these sensations are interacting with each other, or with your overall physical sensations like the tension in your shoulders and the shallow breath? Try to just observe these sensations for a moment, without trying to change them or react to them. See what happens.

Patient: It's sharp and prickly — like quick little jabs and a low heat behind my sternum, not a dull ache but stinging pins that make me want to move. The feeling of clumsiness/failure is a heavy sinking in my gut and a hot flush in my face that makes me want to disappear; my shoulders tighten, my breath goes shallow, and my fingers twitch toward the phone. Noticing them together sometimes just makes the urge louder, like the shame feeds the itch and the itch feeds the reflex. I can sit with this longer, but honestly I'm not sure I follow how describing it is supposed to stop me from picking up the phone — can we slow down and stay with the chest and hands a bit more?
