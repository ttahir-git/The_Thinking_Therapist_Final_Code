Patient: I'm a high-school teacher in my mid-fifties, and I've been stuck with this constant worry that I'm not performing well at work. That worry makes me procrastinate — I put things off until the last minute and then feel awful about it, which just makes the cycle worse. I've tried things before and they haven't really helped, so I'm skeptical this will be any different.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your performance at work? What is it about not doing well that feels so unbearable?
Your concerns about teaching and your students' well-being are likely deeply intertwined. Are there certain aspects of your job, such as lesson planning or classroom management, that trigger these worries, or is it more about the broader sense of responsibility as a teacher?

Patient: Mostly I'm terrified I'll let the students down — that my lessons will be boring or ineffective and they'll fall behind, and I can't afford the consequences of that. The things that trigger it most are lesson planning and grading; when I have to design a unit or assess work I freeze and worry it's not good enough, and classroom management moments make me feel exposed. There's also the bigger fear of being judged by parents or administration and the financial fallout if something goes wrong, and that makes it feel unbearable. I've tried forcing myself to just start before and it hasn't stuck — how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: I understand that it's hard to see how talking about this will make a difference, but I'd like to explore something with you. Can you think of one thing, just one thing, that you value about your teaching that feels important to you? It could be something as simple as "I value creating a positive learning environment" or "I value seeing my students grow and succeed." What is that one thing, and how can we start to make it a more realistic goal for you in the short term, even if it's just for one small lesson or interaction with a student?

Patient: I guess what I still care about is sparking curiosity in a kid — that moment when something clicks and they actually want to know more. Maybe a realistic short-term goal is just one small thing: plan a 10-minute discussion or activity for tomorrow and set a timer so I don't overthink it. But I've tried focusing on small wins before and they don't stick — how is that supposed to help when I freeze at the start?

Therapist: I think you're on the right track with setting a specific goal, but let's explore something else for a moment. When you say you "freeze at the start," what does that feel like in your body? Is it a physical sensation, like tension in your shoulders or stomach? Or is it more of a mental feeling, like your mind racing or feeling overwhelmed? Can you try to bring your attention to that sensation right now, without trying to think about the outcome or what's going to happen? Just notice what's present, right here, in this moment. As you do that, I want you to make a small commitment to yourself: for the next 30 seconds, whenever you start to feel that freeze, take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. That's it. Just the breath. Can you do that with me?

Patient: Alright. When I freeze it's like my shoulders clench up, my stomach knots, and my mind fills with a stream of what-ifs — will they learn this? Will I look incompetent? — and then I can't move. I did the breathing for the last few seconds and... my shoulders eased a touch and the racing quieted a little, but it felt temporary, like a small bandage. How is that supposed to help me actually start planning instead of just calming down for a moment?

Therapist: Let's take it a step back. You've done the breathing exercise, which helped you calm down for a moment. Now, I want to ask you to do something else. Instead of focusing on the what-ifs or the outcome, I want you to focus on the physical sensation of making a small, deliberate movement. Can you pick up a pen, a pencil, or even just your hand and bring it to the piece of paper in front of you? Just pick it up, and hold it there for a second. What does that feel like in your hand? What does the pen or pencil feel like in your hand? Can you just notice that sensation for a second? Now, I want you to make a very small commitment to yourself: for the next 5 seconds, do not think about planning or what you're going to do with your lesson. Just hold the pen or pencil, and focus on that sensation. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I picked up the pen and held it. It felt cool against my fingertips, a bit rough where I grip it, and my shoulders did ease a notch while I focused on that for the five seconds. But as soon as I start thinking about the lesson the knot comes back — how is holding a pen supposed to get me to actually start planning?

Therapist: I think you're overthinking this a bit. You're trying to figure out how holding a pen is going to magically get you to start planning, which isn't going to happen. What's actually happening is that you're bringing your attention to the present moment, right now, with your pen in your hand. You're noticing the sensation of the pen against your fingertips, the feel of it in your hand. That's where the power is. Not in thinking about the lesson or what you're going to do, but in being present with your physical sensations.

Let's try something else. Instead of holding the pen, I want you to notice your breath. Just bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the sensation of the air touching your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of your belly moving in and out. Can you do that? Just bring your attention to your breath, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: I did — I noticed the air at my nostrils, my chest rising and falling, and my shoulders loosened a bit. It quieted the racing thoughts for a few breaths, but the knot and the what-ifs come right back, especially with the worry about students and the financial fallout. I've tried this breathing before and it doesn't stick — how is that actually supposed to get me to sit down and start planning instead of just giving me a momentary calm?

Therapist: I think we've been getting stuck in a loop here. We've been trying to calm the mind and bring awareness to the present moment, but it seems like we're getting nowhere. Let's try something different. Instead of trying to clear the mind or bring calm, let's focus on making a small, tangible decision.

You've got a piece of paper in front of you. Can you take a minute to write down one single sentence about what you want to do with your lesson tomorrow? Just one sentence. What is it? What do you want to focus on? Write it down. Don't worry about what it looks like or whether it's perfect. Just write one sentence. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I wrote: "Tomorrow I'll run a 10-minute discussion that starts with one open question to spark curiosity about the unit." Writing it down made it feel a bit smaller, like something I could actually picture doing. But I'm already thinking of reasons it'll fail and I can feel that knot coming back — how is a sentence on paper supposed to make me actually sit down and plan those ten minutes when I freeze?

Therapist: I can see that you're getting caught up in the what-ifs again. But let's take a step back. You've written down a sentence that says exactly what you want to do. Now, I want you to add a few more details to it. Can you specify exactly where you'll be doing this discussion? Where will you be sitting? What time of day will you do it? Can you add a specific detail that tells you exactly what to do when you start feeling the knot or getting caught up in the what-ifs?

For example, you could say something like: "I'll sit at my desk, right after the morning meeting, at 9:30 am sharp. When I start feeling the knot or getting caught up in thoughts about failure, I'll take a deep breath in through my nose and out through my mouth. I'll focus on the sensation of the pen in my hand and the paper in front of me. I'll start by saying out loud: 'I will take one small step, one question, and one breath at a time.'"

Can you add these kinds of details to your sentence?

Patient: Okay — here's what I wrote down: "Tomorrow at 9:30 AM, right after the morning meeting, I'll sit at my desk near the front and run a 10-minute discussion starting with the open question: 'What's one thing about this topic that makes you curious?' If I feel the knot coming, I'll take three slow breaths, put my pen on the paper, and say out loud: 'One question, one step, one breath.'"

That makes it feel more concrete, but honestly — I've tried scripts and cues before and they fade fast. How is saying a line and taking a breath supposed to stop me freezing when a kid blankly stares back or the principal drops by?

Therapist: I think we're getting close. You've written down a very specific plan, including the when, where, and what. Now, I want you to take it a step further. Can you take a moment to reflect on why this plan is important to you? What values are at stake here? What will it mean for you if you actually follow through on this plan?

For example, you could say something like: "If I follow through on this plan, it means I'm committing to creating a learning environment that sparks curiosity in my students. It means I'm taking ownership of my teaching and taking small steps to make a bigger impact. It means I'm showing up for my students and for myself, even when it's hard."

Can you take a moment to really connect with those feelings? Can you say to yourself, "I am committed to making this happen. I am committed to showing up for myself and for my students"?

Also, I want you to make a small commitment to yourself. I want you to look at this plan, right now, and say to yourself, "I am going to do this. I am going to sit down at 9:30 AM, right after the morning meeting, and run that 10-minute discussion. I am going to follow through on this plan, no matter what." Can you do that?

Patient: I can say that sparking curiosity still matters to me — it makes this feel like more than just a pile of tasks, and if I actually pull it off it would mean I'm still doing something right for the kids. I can tell myself, "I am committed to making this happen," but "no matter what" feels like too big a promise; what I will do is sit at 9:30 after the meeting, run the 10-minute discussion, and use the three breaths and the pen-cue if the knot starts. Saying that takes a lot of effort right now and I don't know if it'll stick, but I'm willing to try — can we figure out a simple way for me to check in afterward so this doesn't just fade?

Therapist: I think that's a great start. You've made a commitment to yourself and identified the actions you want to take. Now, I want to suggest a simple way to check in and build accountability.

Can you think of one small thing you can do, right now, to confirm that you're taking this step? Maybe it's just a simple gesture, like taking a sip of water, or checking your watch to see the time. Just something small that tells you you're taking action.

Also, I want to suggest a simple check-in process for later. Can you think of someone you can talk to, right after the 10-minute discussion, to confirm that you took action? Maybe it's a colleague, a friend, or even a family member. Just someone who can ask you a simple question, like "Did you do the 10-minute discussion?" or "How did it go?".

This can help you build accountability and ensure that you don't just forget about this plan. It's a small step, but it can help you build momentum and confidence. What do you think?

Patient: Alright—I can do something tiny now: take a sip of water and set an alarm for 9:25 as a nudge. I could ask Mark from the staff room to text me after school with "Did you run the 10-minute discussion?" But honestly, that feels flimsy—how is a text supposed to make me push through the freeze when the knot comes back and I don't have the energy for another pep talk?

Therapist: I think that's a fair concern. Texts can be a convenient way to check in, but they may not be enough to motivate you to push through the freeze. Let's think of something more grounded and realistic.

Can you think of someone you trust who is already in the building, like a janitor or a custodian? Maybe you could ask them to simply check in with you for a minute, after the 10-minute discussion, to say "Hi, how was it?" or "Did you take a break?" Just a brief conversation with someone who is already there.

This way, you're not relying on a phone call or text message, but you're still getting a check-in from someone who is physically present. It's a more tangible way to build accountability, and it may help you feel more grounded and supported. What do you think?

Patient: I could maybe ask Mark to pop by after class instead of a text — but it feels awkward and like I'm bothering people. How is having someone ask me a simple question supposed to make the knot stop when it hits? Still, I guess I'll set the 9:25 alarm and quietly ask Mark to check in; it's not confidence-boosting, but it's something I can do right now.

Therapist: I think you're being realistic about the potential awkwardness of having someone ask you a simple question. It's not going to magically fix the knot, but it can be a small step to help you feel more connected to your plan and more motivated to take action.

By setting the 9:25 alarm and quietly asking Mark to check in, you're taking a small concrete action that can help you build momentum. It's not going to be a confidence booster, but it's something you can do right now to move forward. Remember, it's not about the outcome of the question, but about the act of taking a small step towards your goal. Can you commit to taking that small step, even if it feels a little awkward?

Patient: Alright — I'll set the 9:25 alarm and quietly ask Mark to pop by after class. It still feels awkward and I doubt it'll make the knot disappear, but it's something I can try. Can you help me pick one very simple opening line or fallback I can use if a kid just stares at me, so I have something to say without overthinking and freezing?

Therapist: I'd like to help you with that. Sometimes, having a simple opening line or fallback can make a big difference. Here are a few options you can try:

* "How's your morning going so far?"
* "What's one thing you're looking forward to in today's lesson?"
* "Is there something that's been on your mind lately that you'd like to talk about?"
* "Can you tell me something about yourself that's new this week?"
* "What's your favorite part of the unit we're studying right now?"

These lines are all simple, open-ended, and non-threatening. They give the student a chance to share something about themselves, and help you get started on a conversation. If they stare at you or seem unresponsive, you can always try:

* "No worries, let's try again sometime. How's your day going so far?"
* "It's okay if you're not feeling it today. Let's take a look at something else."

These fallbacks acknowledge the student's silence and give them a chance to respond when they're ready. They also help you keep the conversation going without putting too much pressure on the student.

Can you try one of these opening lines or fallbacks, and see how it feels?

Patient: I'll try: "What's one thing you're looking forward to in today's lesson?" It seems simple enough to get something going, and if a kid just stares I'll use, "No worries — let's try again sometime." Honestly, it's taking a lot of effort to even say this and I don't expect miracles, but I'll use those lines and see if it helps at all.

Therapist: I think that's a great start. It's taking a lot of effort to even say those lines, and that's something to be proud of. Remember, it's not about getting a specific response or outcome, but about taking small steps to build momentum and confidence.

You're committing to using these tools, even if they don't seem like they'll work right away. That's a big step, and it shows that you're willing to try new things and adapt to the situation. It's okay if it doesn't work out perfectly at first – just acknowledge the effort you're putting in, and keep moving forward.

Take a deep breath, and remember that you've got this. You've set an alarm, you've asked Mark to check in, and you've chosen a simple question to ask the students. Now, just take it one step at a time, and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I'll set the 9:25 alarm, quietly ask Mark to pop by, and try the opening line tomorrow. I don't have much energy left; this all feels like a lot to carry and I'm not convinced any of it will stop the knot when a kid just stares — how is that supposed to help? Can you give me one very short, non-awkward thing to say to Mark so it doesn't feel like a big ask, and one tiny fallback I can use in the moment if the question just dies?

Therapist: For Mark, I suggest saying: "Hey, just wanted to touch base real quick." It's short, friendly, and doesn't put too much pressure on the interaction.

If the question dies, you can use: "Thanks, no worries." It's a brief acknowledgement that the question didn't work out, and it allows you to move on without making a big deal about it.

Remember, these are just tiny things to help you feel more grounded and confident in the moment. They're not about fixing the knot or making the students respond, but about taking small steps to build momentum and take care of yourself.

Patient: Alright — I'll tell Mark that. And if it dies I'll say, "Thanks, no worries." Saying it already feels like an effort; I'm running on empty and it still seems flimsy. How is that supposed to stop me from freezing if a kid stares or the principal walks in? Can you give me one ultra-short phrase I can whisper to myself in the moment to help me not spiral?

Therapist: For a tiny whisper to yourself, I suggest: "Breathe." It's just two words, and it's all you need to focus on in that moment. Take one deep breath, and let go of the rest. It's not about fixing anything or dealing with the situation; it's just about staying present. Whisper it to yourself, feel the air moving in and out of your body, and let it help you calm down and refocus.

Patient: Okay — I'll try whispering "Breathe" if the knot starts. It feels almost too simple, but when I'm out of steam I need something I can actually do. Can you give me one very short line I can say to myself afterward so I don't immediately start tearing it apart? I don't know if this will stick, but I'll try.

Therapist: For a short line to say to yourself afterward, I suggest: "It's one step." Just one word, just one phrase. It acknowledges that you took action, even if it was small. It's not about the outcome or whether it "worked" or not. It's just about acknowledging the effort you put in. Say it to yourself, and see if it helps you move forward without immediately tearing it apart.

Patient: Alright — I'll try saying "It's one step" afterward. It feels thin and temporary, like the other things I've tried, so how is that supposed to stop me replaying every awkward moment? If it doesn't, what's one tiny, concrete thing I can do right after class, in under a minute, to break the loop so I don't tear it apart all evening?

Therapist: For a tiny, concrete thing to do right after class, I suggest: "Drink a glass of water." It's something simple, yet tangible. Take a minute to grab a glass of water from the fridge and drink it. This small action can help distract you from replaying the awkward moments and give you a chance to clear your head. The physical act of drinking water can also help calm your nervous system. By doing this small action, you're taking a concrete step to break the loop and move forward.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the water. I can grab a quick glass after class, but I'm already jittery and can't shake thinking it won't stop me replaying every awkward moment — how is sipping water supposed to make the knot go away? If that doesn't help, what's one ultra-quick thing I can do in under 30 seconds to break the loop so I don't stew all evening?

Therapist: For an ultra-quick action, I suggest: "Take three deep breaths." Just sit, close your eyes, and take three slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This small action can help calm your nervous system and break the replaying of awkward moments. It's not about fixing anything or dealing with the situation; it's just about taking a brief moment to calm down and refocus. Try to do it as quickly as possible, in under 30 seconds, and see if it helps break the loop.

Patient: I did the three breaths — they helped for a moment, but I'm still jittery and the replay's already crawling back in. It didn't really break the loop. If that fails, what's one ultra-quick, non-silly thing I can do in under 30 seconds to stop ruminating so I don't stew all evening, and how is that supposed to actually help when I'm this wired?

Therapist: For an ultra-quick, non-silly action, I suggest: "Write 'done' on a piece of paper." Just take a minute to grab a piece of paper and write the word "done" on it. It's a simple, concrete action that can help you acknowledge that you're taking control of your thoughts and emotions. The act of writing can also help you focus on the present moment and distract you from ruminating on the past. It's not about achieving a specific outcome or fixing anything; it's just about taking a small action to stop ruminating. Try to do it as quickly as possible, in under 30 seconds, and see if it helps.

Note: This is a very simple action, and its effectiveness may be limited. However, it's a last resort, and it's worth trying if you're feeling stuck and ruminating.

Patient: Alright — I'll try writing "done" if the breaths and the water don't cut it. I'm running on fumes and my mind's already buzzing, so it feels kind of pointless, but I'll do it. If that doesn't break the loop, what's one other ultra-quick, really concrete thing — nothing cheesy — I can do in under 30 seconds that might actually stop me replaying it all evening?

Therapist: For a final, ultra-quick action, I suggest: "Look at a clock." Just take a minute to glance at a clock, any clock. It doesn't matter what time it is, just look at the numbers. This small action can help you focus on the present moment and distract you from replaying the past. It's a concrete, tangible action that can help you move forward. Try to do it as quickly as possible, in under 30 seconds, and see if it helps.

Note: This action is very simple, but it can be effective. The idea is to shift your attention from your thoughts and emotions to the physical present moment. By looking at a clock, you're forced to focus on something concrete and tangible, rather than getting caught up in your thoughts. It's a last resort, but it might help.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the clock; I can picture myself glancing at the numbers. But how is looking at a clock supposed to stop the replay — it just feels like another distraction I won't buy when I'm rattled. Give me one last, really concrete 10‑second thing I can do that isn't breathing, water, or writing "done" — something plain and believable I can actually do when my hands are shaking.

Therapist: For a final, ultra-quick action, I suggest: "Pinch your earlobe." Just pinch the soft skin of your earlobe between your thumb and index finger. This small action can help you focus on the physical sensation of pinching your earlobe, which can distract you from replaying the past. Try to do it quickly, in under 10 seconds, and see if it helps.

Note: This action is very simple and physical, which can be helpful when your hands are shaking. It's not about achieving a specific outcome or fixing anything; it's just about taking a brief moment to focus on something tangible. If you can't even do this, you're not in a good place.

Patient: Alright… I can try pinching my earlobe if my hands are shaking. It feels kind of silly and I'm already jittery and unfocused — how is that supposed to stop the replay when I'm this wired? Can you give me one slightly longer, 20–30 second thing that's not breathing or childish, something I can actually do when I'm this rattled?

Therapist: For a slightly longer action, I suggest: "Take a short walk to the water cooler." Just get up from your seat, walk to the water cooler, and take a few sips of water. This small action can help you get up, move around, and clear your head. It's not about achieving a specific outcome, but about taking a brief moment to shift your focus away from your thoughts. Try to do it slowly and deliberately, taking your time to get to the water cooler and back to your seat. See if it helps calm you down.

Note: This action is slightly longer than pinching your earlobe, but still relatively quick and manageable. It's a physical action that can help you get up and move around, which can be helpful when you're feeling stuck or jittery.

Patient: I could try the walk to the water cooler — I'm running on empty and my chest's tight and my mind's already jumping around, so I can't really picture it stopping the replay. If I do get up, give me one short, non-cheesy phrase I can say to myself on the way back so I don't just stew the whole evening. How is that supposed to help when my mind's already racing?

Therapist: For a short phrase, I suggest: "Let's take it one step." Say this to yourself on the way back to your seat, or as soon as you sit back down. It's a simple, non-cheesy phrase that can help you focus on the present moment. Try to say it to yourself with a calm, gentle tone, and see if it helps slow down your racing mind.

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying "Let's take it one step" on the way back. It feels thin and I'm already exhausted, so I'm not confident it'll stop the replay — how is that actually supposed to help when my head won't shut off? If that doesn't work, give me one very concrete thing I can do at home for under two minutes that isn't breathing, water, or writing "done" — something I won't talk myself out of.

Therapist: For a very concrete action, I suggest: "Put on a pair of warm socks." Just get up from your seat, go to your shoe rack, and put on a pair of warm socks. This small action can help you feel more grounded and calm. It's a tangible, physical thing that you can do to help calm yourself down. Try to do it quickly, without thinking too much about it, and see if it helps.

Note: This action is very concrete and physical, which can be helpful when you're feeling stuck or exhausted. It's something you can do without thinking too much about it, and it's unlikely you'll talk yourself out of it.

Patient: I can try the socks — sounds silly, but I’ll do it if it’s that simple. Still… how is putting on socks actually supposed to stop my brain from replaying every awkward moment tonight? If that fizzles, can you give me one last, no-nonsense 90-second thing I can do at home that doesn’t feel childish?

Therapist: For a final action, I suggest: "Write down 3 things you're grateful for." Get a piece of paper and pen, and write down three things that come to mind that you're grateful for in your life right now. It doesn't matter what they are, just focus on finding three things that bring you some level of comfort or peace. Try to do this in exactly 90 seconds, without thinking too much about it. When the time is up, put the paper down and take a moment to acknowledge that you've taken some small action to calm yourself down.

Note: This action is simple, yet effective. Focusing on gratitude can help shift your attention away from negative thoughts and emotions. It's not a long-term solution, but it might help you feel a bit more grounded and centered.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 90 seconds and write three things down, even if it feels a bit thin. I'm already jittery and don't expect it to shut my head off, so if that fizzles, give me one last, no-nonsense 90‑second thing I can do at home that doesn’t feel childish and I actually won’t talk myself out of.
