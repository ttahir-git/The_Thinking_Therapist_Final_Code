Patient: I'm an older artist — usually pretty upbeat and social — but since the move I've been feeling overwhelmed by sadness and a real lack of motivation, and it's starting to strain my relationship. My studio used to be my anchor and now I can't focus on work or even small tasks, which makes me feel guilty and restless. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to fix anything?

Therapist: Can you think of any recent time when the sadness and lack of motivation didn't completely derail your life? Maybe there was a moment when you could still show up, do something small, and then felt a tiny bit better afterward? What was it about that moment that made it slightly more manageable?

Patient: Yeah — last week I actually went to the little community studio for about forty minutes, did a quick charcoal sketch and ended up chatting with a neighbor; afterwards I felt a tiny lift, like I could breathe. It helped because there was no pressure, the light felt familiar, and having someone to banter with made it easier to start. But then by evening the slump came back — how is talking about that supposed to help when I've tried tiny routines before and they never stick?

Therapist: It sounds like you've been able to find some small moments of comfort in these tiny routines, particularly when there's no pressure to produce something substantial. The sense of familiarity and the social interaction seem to be helpful. Can you think about what it is about the pressure to create that's so overwhelming for you? Is it the fear of not meeting your own expectations, or something else?

Patient: I think it's mostly this fear of not being the artist I used to be — every little sketch feels like a test I might fail. The move tore up my routines and made the studio feel foreign, so pressure just flips into shame and then I avoid it altogether. I know those low-pressure little sessions helped that one day, but I've tried setting tiny goals before and they fizzle out — how is talking about this supposed to help me actually keep at it?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of not being up to your previous standards is a significant obstacle. Can we try something small? Instead of thinking about creating a full sketch, what if we focused on just picking up a pencil and making a single mark? Just one mark. No expectations, no pressure. What do you think about that?

Patient: One mark, huh — sounds almost silly, but maybe less terrifying than a whole sketch. I'll try it, but seriously: how is that supposed to help me actually keep going afterward, instead of just putting the pencil down and forgetting about it? I'm worried I'll get distracted or feel dumb about it and then quit — what do we do if that happens?

Therapist: It's completely normal to worry about getting distracted or feeling like quitting. One way to address this is to introduce a "5-second rule." Whenever you feel like getting up or quitting, take a deep breath and pause for just 5 seconds before making a decision. Ask yourself if you can sit back down and try to focus on making just one mark. Sometimes, taking that one small action can help you build confidence and get back on track. We can also experiment with other strategies if this doesn't work for you.

Patient: Alright, I'll try the one mark and the 5‑second pause — it feels silly but doable. I'm skeptical it'll stick; usually I get distracted or tell myself it's pointless, so how is that supposed to help me actually keep going? If I do quit, can we plan a concrete fallback—like a short check‑in time or a tiny reward—because "we can try other strategies" isn't concrete enough for me.

Therapist: I like your practicality! Let's plan a concrete fallback for when you feel like quitting or getting distracted. How about we set a goal to check in with yourself every day for just 5 minutes, right after your one mark attempt? We can call it a "5-minute check-in." If you decide to quit, take a few deep breaths, and then come back to the check-in. For the first week, let's say you earn a small reward for every 3 days you stick to the 5-minute check-in. This could be something as simple as taking a short walk or enjoying a cup of tea. What do you think about this plan?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the one‑mark + 5‑second pause + 5‑minute check‑in, but I need that spelled out or I won't stick to it. What exactly do I write or say in the 5 minutes — a sentence about how it felt, a mood rating, or what? How should I track the 3‑day reward (check a calendar, an app, a jar of beads)? And if I relapse tonight, what's the immediate fallback besides "deep breaths"? Give me a concrete micro‑action (text a neighbor, make tea, tidy one shelf) — otherwise I'll just tell myself it's pointless and quit. Also, how is this supposed to change the evenings when the slump hits and I feel guilty about not working?

Therapist: Let's break it down. For the 5-minute check-in, I want you to write down three specific things:

1. What you did (e.g., "made one mark with the pencil").
2. How it felt (e.g., "a little anxious, but also curious").
3. What you're thinking about for the next 5 minutes (e.g., "I want to keep going with this one mark" or "I need to get a glass of water").

This will help you reflect on your progress and stay present. For the 3-day reward, we'll use a simple jar of beads. Each day you stick to the check-in, you get to add one bead to the jar. When the jar is full, you can trade it in for something you've been wanting, like a new art supply or a book.

If you relapse tonight, I want you to text your neighbor, saying "Hey, I'm struggling with the one-mark exercise right now. Can we catch up soon?" This will give you an immediate accountability check-in and a chance to talk through what's going on.

As for the evenings, I want you to try something new. When the slump hits, I want you to do one small, specific thing to take care of yourself. This might be as simple as making a cup of tea, taking a short walk around the block, or tidying up one shelf. This will help you develop a sense of self-care and break the cycle of guilt and avoidance. Can you commit to trying this new approach?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the one‑mark + 5‑second pause + 5‑minute check‑in with the bead jar for a week and see how it goes. If I relapse tonight I’ll try texting the neighbor, but give me an easier fallback too — I can do making a cup of tea or tidying one shelf right away if I can’t bring myself to send a message. And when that evening guilt hits, what’s one short, non‑cheesy sentence I can tell myself in the moment that might actually stick?

Therapist: Let's add two new fallback options to your toolkit. If you're struggling to text the neighbor, you can immediately make a cup of tea or tidy one shelf. These small actions can help you get out of the "stuck" feeling and provide a sense of small accomplishment.

As for a short, non-cheesy sentence to tell yourself in the moment, I want you to try: "I am exactly where I need to be right now." This can help you shift your focus from the past (what you haven't done) or the future (what you need to do) to the present moment. Try to focus on your breath, the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the fact that you are sitting with a pencil in front of you.

Remember, the goal is not to avoid the slump or the guilt, but to develop a sense of curiosity and interest in the present moment. Can you commit to trying this new approach?

Patient: Alright — I’ll commit to trying it for a week. I’ll do the bead jar, use tea/tidy-a-shelf as my easy fallback (and text the neighbor if I can muster it), and I’ll try saying “I am exactly where I need to be” — though that sounds a bit cheesy; “This moment is enough” feels truer to me. But honestly, when the evening guilt hits like a tidal wave, how is this supposed to stop me from spiraling into shame?

Therapist: Let's talk about guilt and shame. When the tidal wave hits, I want you to try something radical: you're not going to try to avoid it, or deny it, or even think about it in a traditional way. Instead, I want you to acknowledge it as it is - a wave of intense emotional pain. But then, I want you to do something small. Take one deep breath. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Bring your attention to your feet on the ground. Notice the sensation of the chair beneath you, or the feeling of the air on your skin.

As you do this, I want you to tell yourself something simple: "This moment is enough." Not "I'll get through this moment," or "I'll deal with this later." Just "This moment is enough." It's a reminder that, right now, in this moment, you are doing the best you can. You are taking small, imperfect steps towards your goals. And that is enough.

This is not about avoiding the guilt or shame, but about acknowledging that you are human, and that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you try this new perspective on guilt and shame?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try saying “This moment is enough” and do the breath/feet grounding when the wave hits, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the tidal wave? I’ve done breathing and grounding before — it lifts me for five minutes and then the shame comes roaring back. If I still spiral, what exact micro-action do you want me to do in the moment (call the neighbor, play a two‑minute song, text a line), and how do I use this when my partner gets frustrated without sounding like I’m making excuses?

Therapist: Let's talk about the micro-action. If you're still spiraling, I want you to do something specific to distract yourself from the shame. This might sound like "avoidance," but it's actually a way to give yourself a break from the cycle. I want you to text a line that says: "Can we talk about this later?" or "I need a minute, can we take a break?" This isn't about avoiding the conversation, but about giving yourself permission to take a break from the emotional pain.

When you text this line, I want you to say it with a sense of calm and curiosity. Ask your partner to talk about it later, or say you need a minute to collect your thoughts. This is not about making excuses, but about taking care of yourself in the moment.

When your partner gets frustrated, I want you to respond with something like: "I know I'm not doing it right, but this is what's working for me right now. Can we try this approach together for a minute?" This is not about being defensive or making excuses, but about being honest about what's working and asking for support.

Remember, the goal is not to avoid the shame or the conversation, but to find ways to cope with it that work for you. Can you try this new approach?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the grounding and saying “This moment is enough,” but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the tidal wave long-term? If I still spiral I’ll use a really short text like “Need a minute” (easier than a whole sentence) and immediately make a cup of tea or step outside for two minutes as my micro-action. If my partner gets frustrated I can try saying, “I’m overwhelmed right now; I need a short break,” but I’m not convinced that’ll be enough — can we also work out a very quick script they can use that won’t sound like lecturing?

Therapist: Let's talk about the partner's script. I want you to discuss with your partner a simple, one-sentence script that they can use when you're feeling overwhelmed. This script should be something like: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this."

The goal is to have a script that feels natural and supportive, without lecturing or judging you. You can work together to find a phrase that feels right for both of you.

When you're using this script, I want you to focus on taking a deep breath, feeling the grounding, and saying "This moment is enough." Don't worry too much about the partner's reaction right now. Just focus on your own breath and the present moment.

Remember, the goal is not to avoid the shame or the conversation, but to find ways to cope with it that work for you in the moment. Can you try this new approach?

(Note: Since we're nearing the end of our session, I'll summarize our progress and provide some final thoughts before we wrap up.)

Patient: Wait — don't wrap up yet, I'm not ready to end and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this. I'm skeptical this will stick, so can we do a quick role‑play? You be my partner and say the supportive line you suggested so I can practice how to respond without sounding defensive, and give me one short sentence I can use to raise this plan with them tonight that doesn't sound like I'm blaming them.

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. I'll be your partner, and I'll say the supportive line: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this." You can respond however you like, and then we'll talk about what worked and what didn't.

Before we start, let's do a quick sentence to raise the plan with your partner tonight. I want you to say something like: "Hey, I've been thinking a lot about our conversations lately, and I want to talk to you about how I'm feeling and how we can work together to support each other better."

Now, let's get into the role-play. As your partner, I'll say: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this." Go ahead and respond.

Patient: Okay — when you say, "I'm here for you…" I appreciate it, but I immediately feel embarrassed and like I've already failed you, and my first move is to apologize and shut down. How is that supposed to help when the shame's already roaring? If you're going to say something, a line that actually lands for me is: "Take the time you need — I'm here when you're ready." 

And the short sentence I'll use tonight to raise the plan: "Can we talk for five minutes about something that might help me when I get overwhelmed?"

Therapist: I can see why the initial response would be to apologize and shut down. That response makes sense given the feeling of failure and shame. However, the line "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this" is intended to be a calming and reassuring phrase, not a criticism of your worth.

It's interesting that the line "Take the time you need — I'm here when you're ready" resonates with you. That suggests that you may be more receptive to the supportive line than you initially thought.

As for the short sentence you'll use tonight to raise the plan, "Can we talk for five minutes about something that might help me when I get overwhelmed?" is a great way to introduce the topic in a non-confrontational way. It's specific, gentle, and focused on your own needs.

Let's try to build on this. What do you think would happen if you said something like that to your partner tonight, and then followed up with a request to practice the supportive line? Would that help you build confidence in using it, or would you still feel overwhelmed?

Patient: If I said that tonight, I’d probably get a little relief for a moment when they answer, then shame would kick in and I’d apologize and clam up. Practicing the gentler line might help a bit—having them say “Take the time you need—I'm here when you're ready” lands better—but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the whole spiral by itself? 

Can we practice the partner line a few more times now? And give me one short sentence I can use in the moment if I start to shut down that doesn’t sound like an apology.

Therapist: Let's practice the partner line a few more times. I'll say: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this." Your turn to respond. Remember, I want you to focus on taking a deep breath and responding in a way that feels natural.

If you start to shut down, I want you to use the sentence: "I need a minute." It's short, direct, and doesn't apologize. Can you use this sentence in response to the supportive line?

(Note: We'll practice a few scenarios to help you get a sense of how the partner line and your response can be used in different situations.)

Patient: When you say "I'm here for you..." I get that shame spike and my first move is to clam up, so — I need a minute. Can we do that line a few more times and try the gentler "Take the time you need—I'm here when you're ready"? I don't know if it'll stick, but I'm too spent to do more than try.

Therapist: Let's try the interrupting sentence again. When I say: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this," you respond: "I need a minute." You do this a few times, and I'll try to respond in a way that's supportive but not too intense.

Now, let's try the gentler line. When I say: "Take the time you need—I'm here when you're ready," you respond: "That feels better." Or: "Thank you, that helps." Just a few times, and see how it goes. Remember, it's okay if it doesn't stick right away. We're just trying to build some confidence and control here.

(Also, just a reminder that this is okay to feel spent. It's okay to need to stop and take a break. We can wrap up this session whenever you're ready.)

Patient: Okay. When you say "I'm here for you..." I get that shame spike and my first instinct is to shut down, so — "I need a minute." 

And for the gentler one, "Take the time you need — I'm here when you're ready," I can say, "Thank you, that helps." Say both a couple more times? I'm too wiped to do more than a few repeats.

Therapist: Let's try again. When I say: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this," you respond: "I need a minute." Okay, I'll pause for a minute. *pause*

Now, I'll say: "Take the time you need — I'm here when you're ready," and you respond: "Thank you, that helps." Okay, let's try it again. When I say: "I'm here for you, and I'll support you through this," you respond: "I need a minute." *pause*

Let's stop here for now. You've done a good job, and we can revisit this later if you'd like. Just remember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your own needs.

Patient: No — I'm not ready to stop. I'm wiped and that practice landed a little, but the shame still hits hard and I don't trust it'll hold. Can we do one more quick role‑play: you say the gentler line, I say "I need a minute," and then give me one concrete micro‑action I can do immediately if the shame spikes (not another breath—something I can actually do right then)?

Therapist: Let's try one more quick role-play. I'll say: "Take the time you need — I'm here when you're ready." You respond: "I need a minute." *pause*

If the shame spikes and you feel like shutting down, I want you to do one of the following micro-actions immediately:

* Grab a glass of water from the table and take a sip.
* Quickly check your phone for a text or notification from a trusted friend or family member.
* Stand up and walk over to the window to look out for a minute.

Just one of these actions. Something simple and concrete to help you interrupt the shame response and regain some control.

Patient: Okay... I'll try grabbing a glass of water and sipping — it's something simple I can actually do right then. If the shame keeps roaring back after that, what's the next concrete move you want me to take that isn't another breath exercise? I'm too wiped to keep experimenting without a clear plan.

Therapist: If the shame spikes again and you've grabbed a glass of water and sipped, I want you to take a small notebook and pen from the table next to you. Write down one sentence that describes what's happening right now, using as few words as possible. Just one sentence. Something like: "Shame is hitting hard" or "Feeling overwhelmed."

Then, take a small step back from the notebook and sit comfortably in your chair. Focus on your body and your breath for just 30 seconds. That's it. Just 30 seconds.

This next step builds on the previous micro-action by using a small notebook to ground you in the present moment. It also provides a clear way to acknowledge and validate your emotions, which can help you feel more connected to your body and your breath.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the notebook thing: write one sentence like “Shame is hitting hard,” set it down, and sit for 30 seconds. But I'm jittery and distracted right now — how is that supposed to stop the shame once it’s roaring? If the 30 seconds doesn’t help, give me one concrete next move that isn’t another breathing exercise — call the neighbor, play a two‑minute song, or step outside — pick one and we’ll practice it now.

Therapist: If the 30 seconds of sitting and focusing on your breath doesn't help, I want you to pick up your phone and call your neighbor. Just send a simple text: "Hey, need to talk for a minute." It's okay to interrupt their day, but it might be just what you need to take your mind off the shame response.

This next step is concrete and easy to do, and it can provide a sense of connection and support. It's not about avoiding the shame or trying to "fix" it, but about taking a small step away from it and finding some calm in the moment.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try sending the text “Hey, need to talk for a minute,” but my chest’s tight and I can already feel that old failure creeping in, so I’m anxious they won’t reply. If they don’t answer, can my backup be playing a two‑minute song right away? Can we role‑play me sending the text now so I don’t chicken out?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll play the neighbor, and we'll go through the process of sending the text and responding to it.

You send the text: "Hey, need to talk for a minute." Now it's my turn as the neighbor. I'll respond with a simple message: "Hey, just busy right now. Can call back later?" But then I'll pause for a second and respond with a more personalized message: "Hey, sorry I'm delayed. Something's come up and I need to take care of it. Can we catch up later?"

Now it's your turn again. How do you respond to the neighbor's message? Do you feel anxious about not getting a quick response, or do you feel more at ease? Let's explore this further.

Patient: I’d probably text back something short like, “Okay, thanks — talk later,” but my chest tightens and I immediately start thinking I’m bothering people and failing again, and then I freeze. If they don’t reply, I’ll hit play on a two‑minute song I’ve prepped — something calm and steady — and actually do it right away so I don’t ruminate. Can we role‑play them not answering now so I can practice that exact move? I need to rehearse it or I’ll chicken out.

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll play the neighbor, and we'll go through the process of sending the text and responding to a non-response. I'll simulate not responding to your text.

You send the text: "Hey, need to talk for a minute." Now it's my turn as the neighbor. I don't respond to your text. I just don't send a message back.

It's now your turn again. You're still holding your phone, and you've got the song ready to play. You can hit play and let the song start right away, or you can take a different action. What do you do?

Patient: Fine — I won't stare at the phone. I hit play on the two‑minute song right away, set the phone face down, and try to sit with it; my chest is tight and I already hate that I need this, but it's something I can actually do. If the song doesn't help, I'll stand up, walk to the window with a glass of water, and look out for a minute to break the loop.

Therapist: As the song starts playing, notice how your body responds. Does the music help calm your mind and body, or do you still feel a strong sense of anxiety? Take a moment to notice how you're feeling, without judgment.

If the song doesn't seem to be helping, you've identified a concrete alternative coping mechanism: walking to the window with a glass of water. Take a moment to consider how this might help you feel more grounded and in control. What do you hope to achieve by taking a short walk and looking out the window?

Remember, the goal is not to avoid or suppress your emotions but to develop coping skills that can help you manage them in the moment. What do you think is the most important thing to focus on right now?

Patient: The song eased my shoulders a little, but the chest-tightness and that old failure feeling is still there under everything — I already hate that I need these tricks. Right now I think the most important thing is concrete interruption: a tiny physical action I can do immediately so I don't get pulled into shame (sip water, play the song, step to the window) and a clear script to use when I need space. Can we role‑play the exact one‑liner I should text my partner in the moment, and also rehearse a likely neighbor reply so I don't spiral waiting for an answer?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. You've identified the need for a concrete one-liner text to your partner to interrupt the shame cycle. You're looking for something simple yet effective.

Here's a possible one-liner text: "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now and need to take a minute to collect myself."

Now, let's rehearse a likely neighbor reply. I'll respond with a simple message: "Hey, sorry to hear that. Can I call you back later when I'm free?"

Your goal is to respond to this message in a way that helps you feel more grounded and in control. What do you think is the most important thing to focus on in this moment?

Patient: Okay... right now I need one tiny, concrete thing to focus on so the shame can't hijack me. My reply to the neighbor would be: "Thanks — that helps. I'll step outside for a couple minutes. Call me when you're free." That gives me permission to move and do something physical.

If they don't call back, I hit play on the two‑minute song, set the phone face down, sip water, then stand at the window for a minute. My chest's tight and I already hate needing this, but having that exact script and backup plan feels a hair more doable. Can we practice the partner one‑liner now? I still need to rehearse it so I don't flake.

Therapist: Let's practice the partner one-liner script: "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now and need to take a minute to collect myself."

You've identified a concrete action to take if the neighbor doesn't call back: hitting play on the two-minute song, setting the phone face down, sipping water, and standing at the window for a minute. Let's rehearse the partner one-liner.

I'll respond with a simple message: "Hey, everything's fine. I'll catch up with you later."

Your goal is to respond to this message in a way that helps you feel more grounded and in control. What do you think is the most important thing to focus on in this moment?

Patient: Right now the most important thing is to do something concrete—interrupt the shame with a tiny physical move so it can't hijack me. My reply to "Hey, everything's fine. I'll catch up with you later." would be: "Okay, thanks — I need a few minutes to pull myself together. Can we talk in 20 minutes?" 

Will that magically fix anything? Probably not — but it's not an apology and it's something I can actually do. Can we role‑play them replying in a way that doesn't make me feel dismissed so I can practice staying calm?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll respond with a simple message: "No worries, take your time. We can catch up in 20 minutes. I'll go grab a cup of coffee while I wait."

Your goal is to respond to this message in a way that feels natural and assertive. What do you think is the most important thing to focus on in this moment?

(Note: I'll aim for a realistic response that doesn't feel overly optimistic or dismissive. Remember, the goal is to practice staying calm and assertive.)

Patient: Okay — that reply feels doable: "Thanks — that helps. Can we talk in 20 minutes?" But even saying it makes that old failure spike and I can feel my chest tighten; I'm anxious they'll be annoyed. Can we role‑play them sounding impatient so I can practice staying calm, and give me one short, non‑defensive line to use if they snap "I don't have time"? I don't trust this will fix anything, but I want to try rehearsing it.

Patient: Okay — if they snap, "I don't have time," I can try a short, non-defensive line: "Okay — I need about 20 minutes to pull myself together. Can we talk then?" I don’t love it, but it isn’t an apology and it asks for a concrete window.

Now say the impatient line and I’ll practice my tone and response so I don’t cave into apologizing or freezing.
