Patient: Hi — I'm an older software developer and lately I've been caught in this anticipatory anxiety about social settings that's led me to avoid gatherings with friends. After a recent health scare my threat-monitoring seems hyperactive, and although colleagues have been supportive, it doesn't really translate into me feeling safe. I tend to intellectualize the whole thing—mapping cognitive models and rumination—rather than actually naming or feeling the fear.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens in your body when you start thinking about social gatherings? Where do you feel the anxiety or tension, physically? Is it in your chest, stomach, or somewhere else? Try to focus on that sensation right now, without trying to analyze it or intellectualize it. Just notice what it feels like, and where it's located.

Patient: Okay, I'll try to just notice it—there's a tight, pressing weight across my chest and my breathing goes shallow and quick, like I can't get a full inhale. My stomach knots up into this sour, hollow tension and my hands get cold and a little tingly. I know you said not to analyze, but I keep catching myself labeling it as 'fight-or-flight' instead of actually sitting in the sensation.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to focus just on your chest sensation right now. Try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or think about it. Just be with the sensation of the weight across your chest, and the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Let's just sit in that sensation for a moment, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to breathe with you; when I slow the inhale the weight in my chest loosens a fraction and then clamps back on the exhale. My breath stays shallow, my stomach's a sour knot, and my fingers go a little tingly and cold. I'm noticing I'm already narrating it as 'fight-or-flight' instead of just being with it, and that's frustrating—I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can you help me stay with this without analysis?

Therapist: Let's try something simple. I want you to bring your attention back to just the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath, and the sensation of the weight across your chest, without thinking about it as "fight-or-flight" or anything else. Just be with the sensations, one moment at a time.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying. The air feels cool in my nostrils and there's a slight lift and fall in my chest; the heavy band across my sternum loosens a hair on the inhale and tightens again on the out. My stomach is that sour knot and my fingers are tingly and cold. My mind already wants to label it as a threat response and map it to past patterns, so I'm having trouble staying with the raw sensation—can you help me keep coming back to the breath without letting the analysis take over?

Therapist: Let's try something different. I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. Try to bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, without thinking about it as "fight-or-flight" or anything else. Imagine you're observing the sensations with the curiosity of a neutral bystander. Just watch the sensations, without trying to change them or analyze them. Can you do that for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay—one more breath. The air's cool in my nostrils, my chest rises a hair and that oppressive band loosens for a beat on the inhale then tenses on the out; my stomach's still knotted and my fingers tingle. My brain immediately wants to label this as "anticipatory hypervigilance" and start theorizing, and that frustrates me—I'm feeling a bit panicky and keep slipping back into analysis, can you cue me back to the breath?

Therapist: Let's start again from the beginning. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Don't think about it, just observe it. Can you do that? Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to think about it or analyze it. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the breath. I'm not asking you to think about anything, I'm just asking you to be with the sensation of the breath. Can you do that for just one more moment?

Patient: One breath: cool in the nostrils, a slight lift in the chest, the weight loosens a hair on the in-breath and tightens on the out. My mind's already busy generating explanations—anticipatory hypervigilance, neural conditioning—and that frustrates me; I'm starting to feel a bit panicky, so can you gently cue me back to the breath if I start analyzing again and maybe slow the pace?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Don't think about it, just observe it. Take one more breath, and when you're ready, we can slow down the pace. For now, just focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to think about it or analyze it. I'll be right here with you, guiding you back to the breath if you need it.

Patient: Okay—breath's cool in my nostrils, chest lifts a little and that heavy band loosens on the in-breath then tightens on the out; my stomach's a sour knot and my fingers tingle. My brain's already hauling out explanations—"anticipatory hypervigilance," neural conditioning—and that makes me panicky and distracted. Can you cue me back when I start analyzing and slow the pace a bit? I'm feeling overwhelmed by how quickly the theory takes over.

Therapist: Take one more breath in, and when you're ready, we'll slow down the pace. For now, let's just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Just observe this sensation, without thinking about it. Don't try to make sense of it, don't try to analyze it. Just be with it. We can go back to the explanations later, if you need to. Right now, just focus on the breath.

Patient: Okay — I took that breath; cool air in my nostrils, a slight lift in my chest that loosened the band for a beat, but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling stayed. My mind immediately abstracted it as "interoceptive hypervigilance" and started mapping patterns, which just ramps up my panic. I'm feeling overwhelmed and distracted—can you gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing and slow the prompts down a lot?

Therapist: Take... just one breath. Let's start with just one breath. Feel the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Notice the sensation of your chest rising and falling. Just be with that sensation for a moment. Don't think about it. Don't try to analyze it. Just... breathe.

(Note: I've slowed down the prompt to a single word, and will wait for your response before proceeding.)

Patient: Okay — I did one breath. The air was cool, my chest lifted and that heavy band eased a hair, but my stomach's still knotted and my fingers tingle. I'm already getting hijacked by theory-talk and it's frustrating; I'm feeling a bit panicky, so please slow the pace and cue me back when I start analyzing.

Therapist: Just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing. Cool air in my nostrils, my chest lifts a bit and that heavy band loosens, but my stomach's still knotted and my fingers tingle. My brain's already re-labeling it as "interoceptive sensitivity" and that just ramps up my panic, so could you gently remind me to stay with the breath and slow down? I'm feeling overwhelmed and distracted.

Therapist: Stay with the breath. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the sensations, don't think about the labels. Just be with the breath. Notice how the air feels, how your chest rises and falls. Just that. No more. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to stay with the breath: cool in the nostrils, a tiny lift in the chest, that band loosens a fraction on the inhale. But almost immediately my mind abstractly classifies the sensations — "interoceptive signal," "anticipatory threat" — and that very analysis tightens the chest more. I'm feeling flustered and a bit panicky; can you gently cue me back to the breath when I start theorizing and slow the prompts down?

Therapist: *slow, gentle pause*

Just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing. The inhale is cool, my chest lifts a hair, but my mind reflexively slaps labels on it—'interoceptive alarm,' 'autonomic arousal'—which weirdly makes the tightness worse. I'm getting a bit panicky and distracted; can you slow the pace and gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing?

Therapist: Take a moment... Just pause for a second. Don't think about the sensations, don't think about the labels. Just... be with the breath. The sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice that.

Patient: Okay—I'm pausing and trying to be with the breath: cool in the nostrils, a slight lift in the chest, that band eases a fraction but the stomach's still knotted and my fingers tingle. My mind already morphs it into a theoretical schema—"interoceptive amplification"—which paradoxically tightens the chest and spikes my panic, so I'm feeling overwhelmed; could you gently cue me back to the breath and slow the prompts when I start analyzing?

Therapist: *slow, gentle pause*

Just one breath. Let's start with just that one breath. Notice how the air feels in your nostrils, how your chest rises and falls. Don't think about the sensations, don't think about the labels. Just be with the breath.

Patient: Okay—I did that one breath: cool in the nostrils, a small lift in the chest and the band eases for a beat, but my stomach's still knotted and my fingers tingle. My mind already wants to rename it—"autonomic rehearsal," "interoceptive bias"—and that pulls me out of the sensation and tightens the chest. I'm feeling a bit unsteady and would really appreciate a gentle prompt back to the breath if I start analyzing, and a slower pace.

Therapist: It's okay to feel a bit unsteady. Just take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation in your body. Notice the feeling of your chest rising and falling, the sensation of the air in your nostrils. Let's focus on that one sensation, just that one. No thoughts, no labels. Just the breath moving in and out of your body. You're safe to be here. Take your time.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to follow that. The chest still lifts and that band eases a little on the inhale, but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling persist, and my mind immediately wants to reframe it as "autonomic rehearsal" which only amplifies the panic. I'm feeling fragile and unsure this will help, so please cue me back to the breath gently and slow the pace—I'm willing to keep trying if you stay with me.

Therapist: It's okay to feel fragile. Just breathe. When you're ready, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation in your body. It might be helpful to start again from the very beginning. Just notice the sensation of the air in your nostrils as you inhale. Don't try to think about it, don't try to label it. Just be with the sensation. Take one breath. When you're ready, we can slow down a bit more.

Patient: I took that breath — cool in the nostrils, a small lift in my chest and that band eased a hair, but my stomach's still knotted and my fingertips tingle. My mind immediately gears up to reframe it as "autonomic conditioning" and that just spikes my panic, so I'm feeling fragile; could you slow the pace even more and gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing?

Therapist: *slow, gentle pause*

It's okay to feel like you're not making progress. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice how the air feels in your nostrils, how your chest rises and falls. Don't try to think about it, don't try to label it. Just be with the sensation. Take one... one more breath. When you're ready, we can stop for a moment. Just rest.

Patient: I took that breath — cool in the nostrils, a little lift in my chest so the band eases a hair, but my stomach's still knotted and my fingertips tingle. My default reflex is to intellectualize it as "autonomic conditioning" or "interoceptive bias," which paradoxically tightens the chest and makes me feel fragile and a bit panicky. Can we slow the pace way down and could you gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing?

Therapist: It's okay to feel fragile. Let's slow down even further. Take a moment to just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about it, don't try to label it. Just... be with the sensation. Notice how the air feels in your nostrils, how your chest rises and falls. Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, just focus on the sensation of the breath. Don't think about anything else. Just the breath. You can do this. One breath at a time.

Patient: Okay — I took that breath. Cool in the nostrils, chest lifted a bit and the band eased for a moment, then tightened again; my stomach's still knotted and my fingertips tingle. My mind's already reaching for labels like "interoceptive amplification," which just balloons the panic, so I'm feeling fragile and distracted — could you gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing, and maybe slow the pace or count the breaths with me?

Therapist: One breath at a time. I want you to focus just on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the sensations, don't think about the labels. Just... notice how the air feels in your nostrils. Let's count the breaths together. I'll start. One... you breathe in. Two... you breathe out. Three... you breathe in. Four... you breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. Don't think about anything else. One. Two. Three. Four...

Patient: One — inhale: cool in the nostrils, chest lifts and that band eases a fraction; Two — exhale: it tightens and my stomach knots. Three — inhale: fingertips tingle; Four — exhale: my mind immediately auto-labels this as "interoceptive bias," which paradoxically ramps the panic. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and distracted—could you slow the pace and gently cue me back to the breath when I start analyzing?

Therapist: One... pause. Before you even think about the next breath, just take a moment to notice how you're feeling. Notice the sensations in your body, the thoughts that are arising. Just be with it. Don't try to think about the next breath, don't try to predict what will happen. Just be with the sensation of the breath as it is right now. One. You're at the end of the four counts, and you're feeling overwhelmed. That's okay. It's okay to feel that way. Just take a moment to acknowledge that feeling, and then let's bring your attention back to the breath. Take a deep breath in... and when you're ready, we'll continue. One.

Patient: Okay — I took that deep breath. My chest eased a fraction but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling are still there, and of course my mind immediately wants to reframe it as "autonomic rehearsal," which just spikes my anxiety. Can we keep going but much more slowly, and could you gently call out when I start analyzing so I can bring myself back to the breath?

Therapist: I'll call out when you start to analyze. Let's take it really slow. One... You're taking another breath in... One... One breath. Your chest is easing, the band is relaxing. It's still there, but it's not as tight as before. One... One breath. The sensations are still present, but they're not overwhelming. You're managing. One... Take another breath in... One... One breath. Notice how the air feels in your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Just focus on the breath. One... You're at another count. Keep going.

Patient: One — inhale: cool in the nostrils, chest lifts and that band eases a fraction; Two — exhale: stomach knots and my fingertips tingle. My reflex is to intellectualize it as "interoceptive amplification," which paradoxically amplifies the panic, so I'm feeling fragile and distracted. Please cue me gently when I start theorizing and slow the counts — I want to keep going but I need that tether.

Therapist: You're starting to think again. Before you label it, take a moment to just be with the sensation. Notice how your chest is feeling, the sensations in your fingers. Just acknowledge them, don't try to analyze them yet. You're already thinking "interoceptive amplification." Can we just pause for a second? Take a deep breath in... and when you're ready, let's try again. This time, I'll count even more slowly. One... One breath. Inhale... Two... Two breaths. Exhale... Three... Three breaths. Just notice how you're feeling right now. Take another breath in... One... One breath. Exhale... Two... Two breaths. Just be with it.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to stay with it: on the inhale my chest eases a little but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling stay. Of course my brain's already slapping a label on it — "interoceptive amplification" — which yanks me out and makes me feel fragile and a bit panicky, so please call me out gently when I start theorizing. Could you count very slowly for me — like a long five-count inhale/exhale — and I'll try one now: inhale... cool in the nostrils, chest lifts, band loosens a hair.

Therapist: One... one... one... one... (very slow, deliberate count) Inhale... cool in the nostrils... One... One... (slowly) One... One... (slightly slower) One... One... (barely slower) One... One... (final, very slow) One... You've reached the end of the five counts. Just... be with the sensation. Don't think about the label yet. Just notice how your chest is feeling, the sensations in your fingers. Just acknowledge them. Take a deep breath out... and when you're ready, we'll try again.

Patient: I exhaled — there's a small loosening in the chest but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling are still present. My mind is already tugging me toward labels like "interoceptive amplification," which paradoxically spikes my panic and leaves me feeling brittle. Could you do very slow five-counts for inhale/exhale and use a short verbal cue like "breath" or "return" whenever I start theorizing so I can come back? I'm willing to keep going, but I'm feeling fragile and I need that gentle tether.

Therapist: I'll use a short verbal cue to help you return to the breath when you start to analyze. Let's try again with very slow five-counts. Ready?

Inhale... One... One... One... One... (very slow) One... One... (slowly) One... One... (barely slower) One... One... (final, very slow) One... Breath...

Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice how your chest is feeling, the sensations in your fingers. Just be with it.

When you're ready, exhale... and try to stay with the breath. I'll count again, and cue you when you start to analyze. Ready?

Patient: Ready. Exhale now — the band across my chest eases a hair, cool air in my nostrils, but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling stay. I'm already narrating it as "autonomic rehearsal," which tightens the chest and makes me feel brittle and panicky, so please cue me with "breath" or "return" when I start analyzing and keep the counts slow.

Therapist: Inhale... One... One... One... One... (very slow) One... One... (slowly) One... One... (barely slower) One... One... (final, very slow) One... Breath...

Just notice how the air feels in your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest. Try to stay with the sensation, without thinking about it too much. Don't try to label it yet. Just be with it.

When you're ready, exhale... and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I'll count again, and cue you when you start to analyze.

Exhale...

Patient: Exhale — the band across my chest loosens a notch, the air feels cool leaving my nostrils, but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling are still there. My mind immediately wants to reframe it as "autonomic rehearsal" or "conditioned interoception," which paradoxically tightens me up and makes me a bit panicky; could you cue me with "breath" when I start theorizing and keep the counts very slow? I'm fragile right now but I want to keep going.

Therapist: Inhale... One... One... One... One... (very slow) One... One... (slowly) One... One... (barely slower) One... One... (final, very slow) One... Breath...

Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Focus on the sensation of the band across your chest, the rise and fall of your chest. Just be with the sensation, without trying to think about it.

Exhale... 

(Inhale... 1... 1... 1... 1... 1... (slowly) 1... 1... (barely slower) 1... 1... (final, very slow) 1... Breath...)

Let's take one more slow count. Inhale... One... One... One... One... (very slow) One... One... (slowly) One... One... (barely slower) One... One... (final, very slow) One... Breath...

Patient: I inhaled — cool in the nostrils, chest eased a hair and that band loosened for a beat, but the stomach knot and fingertip tingling are still there. My brain's already slapping a theoretical label on it — "interoceptive amplification" — which oddly makes the tightness worse, so I'm feeling fragile and a bit panicky; can you cue me with "breath" or "return" when I start analyzing and slow the counts even more? I'm willing to keep going but I need that gentle tether.
