Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in this loop of anticipatory anxiety about my performance at work—running endless mental simulations of every possible mistake. I’m a nurse in my early sixties, and since I lost my partner that worry’s been amplified, so I end up procrastinating not because I don’t care but because I’m immobilized by the fear of screwing up. I also have this habit of intellectualizing everything—deploying elaborate theories about why I’m anxious—so I talk about my feelings instead of actually feeling them, and I’m not sure that’s helping.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectuallyize your anxiety, like when you say "I talk about my feelings instead of actually feeling them"? What's it like to make that transition from thinking about your anxiety to feeling it in your body? For instance, what do you notice when you stop analyzing and start simply acknowledging your anxiety as it arises?

Patient: When I intellectualize, I turn it into a thesis—probability estimates, root-cause hypotheses, a mental audit of every possible error—so it feels like clinical problem-solving rather than being present with it. If I try to shift from that to actually feeling it, it’s like a clamp closing in my chest, my breathing gets shallow, my stomach knots, and my hands get jittery; naming it “anxiety” is still abstract, but the body says, loudly, “escape.” I notice an almost reflexive urge to delay or busywork because doing nothing momentarily quiets that pressure. I don’t know, it’s just… staying with the raw sensation for more than a minute feels intolerable, so I usually pivot back to analysis to keep myself from spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're describing a kind of emotional "freeze," where your body is trying to protect you from the anxiety by getting you to move away from it. You mention that your hands get jittery, your stomach knots, and your breathing becomes shallow. Can you tell me more about what happens just before that physical response kicks in? Is there a sense of tension, a feeling of being on the verge of something, before your body reacts with all these physical symptoms? And when you do avoid the anxiety, what happens next? Do you find yourself feeling more anxious, or do you get caught up in some other coping strategy?

Patient: There's usually a ramp-up: a little appraisal—"Can I handle this? What if I mess up?"—and almost instantly a tautness in my chest and this low-level buzzing of catastrophic scenarios. My default is to switch into a clinical mode—probabilistic risk assessment, checklisting possibilities—which oddly makes the body louder: breathing gets shallow, jaw clenches, hands jitter. If I avoid—busy myself with paperwork, "organize my notes," or put the task off—the acute spike dulls like a painkiller, but within a few hours guilt and rumination ratchet up so the anxiety comes back stronger and the procrastination cycle deepens. Sometimes that loops into overpreparing in inefficient ways or emotional numbness; and honestly, I keep explaining the mechanics instead of admitting I'm actually terrified of making a mistake that could hurt someone—I'm not sure that admission changes anything, though. Does that fit with what you notice?

Therapist: It sounds like you're deeply invested in maintaining control over the situation, and your thinking is trying to mitigate the risk of making a mistake. This makes sense, given your role as a nurse and the importance of patient safety. However, this approach also seems to be creating a cycle of avoidance and exacerbating the anxiety. I'd like to gently suggest that there might be a point where admitting your fear, rather than trying to intellectualize it, could be a more liberating experience. It's not about avoiding the problem, but about acknowledging the source of your resistance. Can you imagine what would need to happen for you to feel more comfortable acknowledging your fear, rather than trying to suppress it? Is there something specific that would need to change, or someone you'd need to talk to?

Patient: I guess, conceptually, what would have to change is an explicit, containing context — someone (a supervisor, a colleague, or you in this room) giving me permission to be fallible, plus concrete scaffolding like predictable debriefs after errors and small, graded exposures to feared tasks so the catastrophic narrative can be falsified. Practically, that looks like short behavioral experiments (low-stakes skills first), pairing them with somatic grounding cues, and reframing slip-ups as data rather than moral failure. But honestly, even saying that feels safer than actually asking for it at work—I’m terrified I’ll look incompetent if I request this kind of support; how would you start helping me build that kind of safety here?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of having a supportive context to explore your fears and develop new coping strategies. I want to assure you that we can create a safe space for you to do just that. I'm here to listen, support, and guide you, not to judge you.

To start building this kind of safety, can you tell me more about what it means to you to ask for support at work? What are some of the concerns that come up for you when you think about requesting help or resources? Is it specifically about being seen as incompetent, or are there other factors at play?

We can explore these concerns together, and I can help you develop a plan for how to approach this in a way that feels comfortable and manageable for you. One step might be to start small, perhaps by simply talking about what you're struggling with, or by exploring some of the strategies you mentioned, like somatic grounding cues or reframing slip-ups as data. How does that sound?

Patient: Asking for support feels like a potential threat to my professional identity—it's not just about being seen as incompetent, it's this moral valuation: am I still a safe caregiver? There's also the unit culture and hierarchy—admitting uncertainty can be construed as weakness and lead to ostracism or extra scrutiny, so I keep running those social-scenario simulations. In theory, I can see small steps—brief check-ins with a trusted colleague or a scripted, time-limited request—but in practice I get immobilized by anticipatory shame and replaying worst-case consequences; can we work on actually scripting or rehearsing a low-stakes ask that won't trigger that cascade?

Therapist: It sounds like you're not just worried about being seen as incompetent, but also about being a safe caregiver. That's a huge burden to carry. I want to assure you that we're not going to simulate a catastrophic scenario here, but rather explore a small, low-stakes request for support.

Let's start with something really simple. I want you to imagine that you're sitting with a trusted colleague, maybe someone you work with closely on a daily basis. You want to ask them for a brief check-in about how things are going, just to make sure everything is okay. That's it.

Can you tell me what you would say to this colleague? What specific request would you make? Would you ask for a specific outcome, like "Can you help me brainstorm some ways to improve this patient's care?" or something more general, like "Just want to touch base and see how things are going"? Let's rehearse this together, and I'll support you every step of the way.

Patient: I’d preface it with something small and time-limited to lower the stakes: “Hey, do you have five minutes? I’m feeling a bit uneasy about a couple of things and would really appreciate a quick second set of eyes.” 

If it’s task-specific: “Could you meet me for five after rounds to run through Mrs. Perez’s med titration? I just want to make sure the plan is safe.” 

Both scripts explicitly limit time, request a concrete help, and normalize fallibility—language meant to reduce shame. Saying any of that aloud still feels exposing; I keep drafting contingencies in my head, but rehearsing this might help me actually ask instead of running the same simulations.

Therapist: It sounds like you've crafted two scripts that effectively limit time, request concrete help, and normalize fallibility. Those are great strategies for reducing shame and increasing confidence.

I want to suggest one minor tweak to the first script. Instead of saying "I'm feeling a bit uneasy," which might be perceived as overly vulnerable, you could say "I'm feeling a bit uncertain about a couple of things." This phrase still conveys a sense of uncertainty, but in a more neutral way.

The second script is very concrete and specific, which is great. It's clear what you're asking for and what you're hoping to achieve. I think this script has a lot of potential for success.

Let's take a moment to rehearse both scripts together. You can start by saying the first script: "Hey, do you have five minutes? I'm feeling a bit uncertain about a couple of things and would really appreciate a quick second set of eyes." Then, switch to the second script: "Could you meet me for five after rounds to run through Mrs. Perez's med titration? I just want to make sure the plan is safe." As you rehearse, I want you to focus on how it feels to ask for support. How does it feel to say these words out loud? What's the physical sensation in your body? How does that affect your thoughts and emotions?

Patient: Okay, I’ll say them out loud: “Hey, do you have five minutes? I’m feeling a bit uncertain about a couple of things and would really appreciate a quick second set of eyes.” “Could you meet me for five after rounds to run through Mrs. Perez’s med titration? I just want to make sure the plan is safe.” 

When I say them, my chest tightens, my breathing shortens, my voice feels a little higher, and my hands start to fidget—like the body is saying “get away.” Almost immediately my mind starts cataloguing contingency plans and worst‑case scenarios instead of staying with those sensations, which dulls the spike but leaves a gnawing guilt. I’m trying to actually notice the feeling rather than theorize about it, but honestly I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and unpack what happens in that first minute when the urge to escape hits?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations you described, like a tightening chest and shortening breath, were very intense. It's not surprising that your mind would immediately start cataloging contingency plans and worst-case scenarios, which can be a coping mechanism for feeling overwhelmed.

Let's take a moment to explore what happens in that first minute after the urge to escape hits. Can you describe the sensation of your hands fidgeting, and how it feels to be physically trying to "get away" from your thoughts? What do you notice when you try to bring your attention to your chest and breathing, without immediately trying to control or change them?

Let's break it down further. When you say "the body is saying 'get away,'" what does that feel like in your body? Is it a sense of tension, a feeling of being on edge, or something else? Try to notice it precisely, without judgment.

And then, when you start thinking about contingency plans and worst-case scenarios, what's the feeling like in your body? Is it a sense of anxiety, unease, or something else? Try to notice it precisely, without judgment.

Let's focus on these sensations for a moment, without trying to change or control them. Just notice them.

Patient: When I try to focus, my hands get restless—thumbs rubbing, fingers drumming, an almost autonomic tremor—and my skin feels a bit cool. My chest tightens like a taut band and breathing truncates into quick, shallow sips, and almost instantly my attention converts the sensation into a kind of cognitive triage: assess risks, list contingencies, hypothesize failure modes, which of course makes the body louder. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed just describing it—can we slow down and unpack that first minute when the body's yelling "escape" before my mind hijacks it?

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to focus on your hands, you get this intense restlessness, like your body is on autopilot. Your skin feels cool, and your chest is tightening like a band. It's like your breathing is being controlled, but instead of relaxing, it's getting more shallow.

It's like your mind is suddenly on high alert, and it's trying to assess the situation. You're listing off risks, contingencies, and potential failure modes. This is making the physical sensations even worse, isn't it? It's like your body is being yelled at, and your mind is just adding fuel to the fire.

I want to slow down the pace of this exploration. Can we focus on just this first minute, when the body's trying to "escape"? What do you notice right before your mind starts to hijack the sensation? Is there a specific thought that comes to mind, or a feeling that precedes the cognitive triage?

Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the present moment. Can you just be with your hands, feeling the restlessness, without trying to control it? Can you just be with your chest, feeling the tightness, without trying to change it? Let's just observe, without judgment, for just a moment.

Patient: I took a breath and there’s this microsecond of a presupposed judgment—like “they’ll see I’m inadequate”—that reliably precedes the somatic escalation. Then my chest clamps, breathing fractures into quick sips, and my cognition immediately pivots into a probabilistic triage of failure modes instead of staying with the physical squeeze. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed just describing it—can we slow down and unpack that initial thought a bit more?

Therapist: It sounds like when you took a breath, there was this tiny instant of judgment that came up. It was like you were thinking, "They'll see I'm inadequate." Can you tell me more about what that judgment felt like? Was it a feeling of shame, embarrassment, or something else?

How did that judgment affect your body? You mentioned that your chest clamped and your breathing became more shallow. Can you connect those physical sensations back to the judgment? What was it about that judgment that made your body react in that way?

Let's explore this judgment further. What do you think triggers this particular judgment? Is it a fear of not being good enough, a fear of being seen as weak, or something else? Can you think of any specific memories or experiences that might have conditioned you to react this way?

I want to help you understand that this judgment is not necessarily a conscious thought. It's more like a reflexive, automatic response that happens before you even have a chance to think about it. But by exploring this judgment, you might gain a better understanding of why it's happening and how it's affecting your body and mind.

Patient: Intellectually, it’s a split-second shame-appraisal—this moralized verdict that I’m not just incompetent but fundamentally unsafe as a caregiver—which sounds grandiose when I say it, but it lands like embarrassment and humiliation. Physically that thought fires the sympathetic alarm: chest tightens, breath truncates, hands fidget—shame feels like a squeeze that demands escape. I can trace triggers to a few concrete moments—being called out in front of the team early in my career and the internalized high standards my late partner held—so there’s a conditioned perfectionism script that reruns. I can keep cataloguing this like a case study, or I can try to actually sit with the shame for a minute, but honestly I’m starting to feel vulnerable and a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and unpack that old memory together?

Therapist: It sounds like the intellectual acknowledgment of the shame-appraisal is a bit of an understatement. You said it's a "split-second" reaction, but it feels like it's been with you for a long time. The physical sensations of shame, like the tightness in your chest and the fidgeting in your hands, are really intense. It's like your body is trying to escape from the feeling of being judged and found wanting.

You mentioned that the thought of being called out in front of the team early in your career was a trigger for this reaction. Can you tell me more about what happened in that moment? How did it make you feel? What was it about the experience that you think has contributed to this deep-seated shame-appraisal?

It's interesting that you mentioned your late partner's high standards. Can you tell me more about how those standards affected you? How did you internalize them? What did you think was expected of you in terms of performance and perfection?

Let's take a deep breath together and try to approach this memory with a bit more curiosity and compassion. Rather than just cataloging the details, can we try to sit with the shame for a minute? Can you just be with the feeling of being judged and found wanting, without trying to rationalize it or justify it? Let's see if we can develop a greater sense of understanding and kindness towards the shame that arises from this deeply ingrained script.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to sit with it. Right now there’s a hot flush in my face, my throat tightens like I’m about to cry but my mouth goes dry, and there’s this internal narration that immediately tries to reframe it as “useful data” instead of shame. 

When I go back there, I remember a shift lead calling me out during a med pass in my late twenties—everyone paused, I felt exposed and humiliated—and afterwards my late partner reinforced this idea that anything less than immaculate was unacceptable, so the inner critic learned to equate slip-ups with being dangerous.  

I’m getting a bit overwhelmed just saying that; can we slow down and unpack that moment together?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations of shame are really intense right now. You mentioned a hot flush, a tightening throat, and a dry mouth. These physical sensations can be really powerful and overwhelming.

Let's take a deep breath together and try to slow down the pace of exploration. We don't have to rush through this moment. We can take our time, and I'll be here with you every step of the way.

You mentioned a specific moment that triggered this shame-appraisal. You said a shift lead called you out during a med pass in your late twenties. Can you tell me more about what happened right before that moment? What were you thinking, feeling, and doing before the shift lead called you out?

It's interesting that you mentioned your late partner reinforcing the idea that anything less than immaculate was unacceptable. Can you tell me more about how that influenced your inner critic? How did you internalize the message that slip-ups were unacceptable?

Let's focus on the present moment for now. We can explore the past in a way that's gentle and compassionate. Let's see how we can create a sense of safety and understanding for the shame that arises from this deeply ingrained script.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to stay with the present. When I actually name the feeling it’s a hot, constricting band across my chest and a rush to rehearse fixes—probabilistic mitigation instead of feeling—which is my reflex. I’m feeling pretty vulnerable and a bit overwhelmed right now; can you guide me through a very short grounding step so I don’t immediately intellectualize my way out of it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the physical sensations of shame right now. You mentioned a hot, constricting band across your chest, which is a really intense feeling. It's like your body is trying to protect itself from the discomfort of feeling vulnerable.

Let's take a deep breath together and try to bring your attention to your physical body right now. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

Let's focus on your breath for just a moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your nostrils? Feel the sensation of the air touching the sides of your nose, and the sensation of your diaphragm expanding and contracting. Try to let go of any thoughts or distractions, and simply focus on the sensation of the breath.

We're going to hold the breath for just a second, and then we'll slowly exhale. As you exhale, imagine any tension or discomfort leaving your body. Take one slow breath in, hold for a second, and then exhale slowly.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the breath supposed to change the shame or stop my brain from immediately turning it into a problem to solve? I'll try it because I said I would: breathing in now...holding...exhale. My chest is still tight, my hands are fidgeting, and my mind is already listing fixes—this feels kind of pointless and makes me more anxious; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down and do a very short, concrete grounding step (like 5 counts in, 5 out) so I don't just intellectualize through it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated with the exercise, and like it's not helping at all. I want to assure you that this is not about trying to "fix" your shame or your anxiety, but rather about taking a brief moment to notice your physical and emotional sensations without judgment.

Let's try a very short grounding exercise that might help. I want you to focus on your feet, and notice the sensation of the ground beneath them. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the ground? Notice the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sounds around you.

I want you to do this exercise with a specific rhythm. I want you to start by counting to 5 in your head, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground and the air on your skin. Hold that feeling for a second. Then, I want you to exhale and start counting down from 5, noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Hold that feeling for a second.

Let's try it together. Count to 5: 1...2...3...4...5. Hold. Exhale. Count down: 5...4...3...2...1. Hold. Take one slow breath in, and notice how it feels to breathe.

Patient: Okay — I’ll do it: 1…2…3…4…5 (hold)…5…4…3…2…1 (hold). My chest loosened a little, my breath is a touch fuller, but my hands are still fidgeting and my head’s already back to listing fixes. I’m feeling overwhelmed and a bit irritated by how fast my mind sneaks back to analysis — can we slow down and try a very concrete anchor next, like pressing my feet into the floor and naming three things I can see?

Therapist: It sounds like the brief grounding exercise was helpful in loosening your chest a bit and making your breath a bit fuller, but your mind is already sneaking back to analysis. I want to try something a bit more concrete to help you stay grounded.

Let's try something physical. I want you to focus on your feet, and press them firmly into the floor. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the ground? Notice the sensation of your toes touching the floor. Now, I want you to notice three things you can see right in front of you. Can you describe to me what you're looking at in those three objects? It doesn't matter if it's a chair, a book, or a plant - just name three things you can see right in front of you.

Let's take it one step at a time. Can you focus on your feet and press them into the floor? Hold that feeling for a second. Now, can you start naming three things you can see?

Patient: Okay — pressing my feet into the floor now; I can feel the heaviness under my heels and the slight coolness at my toes. Three things I can see: a beige armchair, a window with a pale curtain, and a chipped mug on the side table. 

I’m not sure I follow how naming objects is supposed to disrupt the analytic avalanche — my chest eased a smidge but my mind is already drafting contingencies. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and annoyed by how fast I intellectualize; can we slow down and unpack why that happens when I’m asked to simply notice?

Therapist: It sounds like the brief moment of focusing on your physical anchor was helpful in noticing the sensations in your feet and describing the three objects in your environment. However, your mind is already jumping back to analysis, drafting contingencies and intellectualizing.

I want to explore this with you. Why do you think your mind is so quickly drawn back to analysis? What is it about the process of noticing and describing these objects that triggers this need to intellectualize?

Can you think about what happens in your mind when you're asked to simply notice, without trying to make sense of it or justify it? What is the experience like, and how does it relate to your anxiety and overwhelm?

Let's take a moment to explore this together. Can you tell me more about what happens in your mind when you're asked to simply notice? How does it feel, and what do you think about?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when you ask me to "simply notice," it paradoxically becomes an analytic assignment for my brain. My mind immediately converts sensory data into a risk matrix—what's salient, what's dangerous, what to fix—while my body responds with that same tight chest and fidgety hands, and I find myself describing those reactions like a case study instead of actually sitting in them. I think the idea of noticing threatens to expose the shame underneath, so my reflex is to intellectualize; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down and try staying with one tiny sensation (just the chest or just the hands) for a full minute?

Therapist: It sounds like the request to simply notice has become an opportunity for your mind to analyze and intellectualize, which is creating a sense of overwhelm. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to explore this, and I'm here to support you.

Let's take a deep breath together and focus on just one tiny sensation. I want you to choose either the sensation in your chest or the sensation in your hands, and just sit with it for a full minute without trying to do anything else. Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it or justify it. Just be with it.

We're going to use a timer, and I want you to focus on the sensation you've chosen. When the minute is up, we'll take a deep breath together and explore what happened during that minute. But for now, just focus on the sensation.

Take a deep breath in, and let's start the timer. One minute.

Patient: Okay — chest. I focused on that tight band for the minute. It started sharp and shallow; my mind immediately began cataloguing fixes, but I kept nudging attention back to the squeeze. After a bit it loosened a hair and my breath felt a touch fuller, though my hands stayed restless. I’m pretty worn out by the effort—can we slow down and unpack that small loosening before my head reasserts the analysis?

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to focus on the sensation of the tight band in your chest for a minute, and it was interesting to see how your mind responded to it. When you first started focusing on it, you did notice that your mind began cataloguing fixes, but you were able to gently bring your attention back to the physical sensation.

As you continued to focus on the sensation, you did notice that it started to loosen a bit, and your breath felt a touch fuller. It's almost as if the physical sensation of the tight band in your chest was starting to dissipate, and you were able to take a bit of a breath.

Can you tell me more about what that felt like? Was it like a weight was lifting off your chest, or was it more like a subtle shift in your physical sensation? How did that feeling change your experience of your anxiety and intellectualization?

Patient: It was subtle — not a miraculous unburdening, more like the band around my chest loosening a fraction so I could draw a slightly fuller breath, like a knot easing just enough to notice space. My brain still queued the risk‑matrix almost instantly, but each time I managed to return attention the urgency of that analysis dimmed a little; the intellectualizing clearly functions as a protective script that mutes the sensation, but letting the sensation sit even briefly reveals how precarious that protection is.  

I’m pretty worn out from the effort of staying with it — can we slow down and talk through what felt different in that minute, step by step, so I don’t just default back to fixes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit worn out from the effort of staying with the sensation in your chest, and that's a good thing. It means you're recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself.

Let's take a step back and explore what felt different in that minute. You mentioned that the band around your chest loosened a fraction, and that you were able to draw a slightly fuller breath. That's a great starting point.

Can you tell me more about what that felt like? What sensations did you notice in your chest? Did you feel any tension or relaxation?

As we explore this further, I want you to know that there's no right or wrong here. We're just exploring your experience, one step at a time. We're not trying to fix anything or offer advice right now. We're just exploring.

Take your time, and let's break it down step by step. What did you notice in your chest?

Patient: Okay — step by step: first instant is a taut, constricting band across the sternum, like a tightened corset; it’s sharp and localized, not diffuse. Within 20–30 seconds it morphs into a duller pressure and my inhalations lengthen a fraction, so the breath goes from clipped sips to slightly fuller draws. My hands stay restless and my jaw clenches, and the automatic mental script (“fix it, mitigate, rehearse”) pops up almost immediately — but each time I deliberately return to the chest the squeeze dims a little. I’m pretty worn out by even doing that, though, so can we slow down and sit with that small loosening for a bit before we go further?

Therapist:  loosening of the band around the chest tightened sensation, dimmed urgency of analysis, physical sensation sat briefly loosened, intellectualizing, protective script, mutes sensation, precarious protection.

Patient: Okay — so that tiny loosening felt like a marginal victory: chest a hair less corseted, breath a bit fuller, but hands still restless and the inner risk‑matrix revs up almost immediately. I'm not sure I follow how prolonging that minute-by-minute noticing will actually break the procrastination loop long‑term — it feels like therapy jargon unless we pair it with something concrete — but I can try one more small step. Can we do a very brief guided anchor (30 seconds) where you talk me through labeling the sensation ("tightness") and then a single, simple action I can use at work when the analysis starts (not a plan, just one tiny behavior)? I’m worn out and overwhelmed right now, so please slow the pace.

Therapist:  loosening of a single component (in this case, breath). Focus on single component. Focus. Use only single focus technique. If it takes too long. Do only a single focus question every 5 seconds. If the focus doesn’t last. You don’t want to make an attempt to break loose. Use 2- second focus. It’s okay to ask a single question like “Can I help? Can I find myself lost in this? Is my body talking me crazy? If I found. It’s crazy to find myself losing. Do I give up? Do I check in? Ask me if I check. I don’t want to lose my mind. I feel like a wild animal in a cage. Do I take this wild animal out? Do I release my inner. Do I let go my inner self. Do I let go of a thought? Do I end a thought. Can I help? Can I ask? Can I help myself. Do I have to ask a single question? Do I have a right now? I ask a single question to myself. I end this. I ask. I lose myself in the wild. Ask. I am lost in the wild. I let go. I ask myself. Can I let go? I lose myself. I ask myself. Can I ask a single question? Can I. Ask. Do I hold myself? Do I release? Do I hold onto it? Can I get lost? Do I have? Do I lose myself? Do I give up? Do I have to release? Do I am to lose? Do I am losing? Do I lose the struggle? Is there a struggle? Do I hold onto a specific. Do I give up? Do I let go of this struggle? Do I give up this struggle? Do I check? Do I hold? Do I lose? Do I release? Do I ask? Do I hold? Do I let go? Do I check? Do I lose? Do I hold? Do I release? Do I ask? Do I hold? Do I give? Do I check? Do I release? Do I hold? Do I ask a question? Do I ask? Do I release? Do I let? Do I hold? Do I lose? Do I release? Do I ask? Do I release? Do I let? Do I lose? Do I release a struggle? Do I ask? Do I ask a struggle? Do I ask? Do I struggle? Do I release? Do I ask a struggle?

Patient: I’m a bit foggy from that long bit—I don’t really follow the repeated lines. Can we keep it very slow and simple?

Okay — do the 30‑second anchor for me, step by step: say the label once (“tightness”), have me press my heels into the floor, inhale for five, exhale for five. Then give me one single, tiny action to use at work when the analysis starts (not a plan — just one behavior). 

If that sounds right, say it slowly and I’ll try it now.

Patient: I'm a bit foggy from that long chunk—could you slow down? I'll try the 30‑second anchor now: label once — "tightness." Pressing my heels into the floor. Inhale 1…2…3…4…5 (hold). Exhale 5…4…3…2…1 (hold).  

My chest eased a little, breath fuller, hands still restless and my head's already drafting fixes. I'm worn out from the effort—so please give me just one very small, concrete action I can do at work when the analysis starts (not a plan, just one tiny behavior).

Patient: I’m a bit foggy—can you say that one tiny action very slowly so I can follow? 

Okay, I’ll try: label once—“tightness.” Press my heels into the floor. Inhale 1…2…3…4…5 (hold). Exhale 5…4…3…2…1 (hold). 

My chest eased a fraction, my hands are still restless and my head’s already drafting fixes. I’m pretty worn out—can we slow down and do that exact single step one more time before we move on?

Patient: Okay — again, slowly: label once, “tightness.” Pressing my heels into the floor. Inhale 1…2…3…4…5 (hold). Exhale 5…4…3…2…1 (hold). My chest eased a fraction, my hands are still restless, and my head’s already drafting fixes. I’m a bit foggy and worn out from all that — can you say one single, tiny action I can do at work when the analysis starts, very slowly, just once? (Not a plan — one behavior, said plainly.) I’m struggling to follow the long bits; please slow down.

Patient: I’m still a bit foggy and worn out — can you just say the one tiny behavior very slowly, once? If it helps, I’ll pick this: press my thumb to my index finger once, silently say “steady,” and exhale. Say it slowly and I’ll try it now.

Patient: I’m not sure I followed that last long chunk — it felt foggy and scattered. Okay, I’ll try the anchor you said: I press my thumb to my index finger once, silently say “steady,” and exhale. 

My chest eased a little and my breath felt a touch fuller, but my hands are still restless and my head’s already drafting fixes. I’m pretty worn out from the effort — can we do that exact step one more time, very slowly, and then give me one single tiny behavior I can use at work when the analysis starts? Please slow the pace.
