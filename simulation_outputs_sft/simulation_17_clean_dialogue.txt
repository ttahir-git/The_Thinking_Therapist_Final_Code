Patient: I've been obsessing about my performance as the owner — I keep thinking I'm about to blow it. My mind jumps to the worst: miss one deadline, lose a big client, spiral into debt, have to sell the business, everyone thinks I'm a failure — so I freeze and procrastinate. I moved recently and it's amplified everything; I try to be upbeat, but I can't stop predicting those catastrophic outcomes.

Therapist: Those catastrophic outcomes sound really overwhelming. When you say you're "freezing and procrastinating," what's one specific thing you're putting off because of your fear of failing as the owner? For example, are you delaying making a phone call, working on a project, or meeting with someone?

Patient: I'm avoiding calling our biggest client to talk about renewing their contract. I keep imagining that if I mess up the call they'll drop us, other clients will panic, revenue will crash, we'll sink into debt and I'll have to sell the business — so I just can't bring myself to pick up the phone. It feels ridiculous but my mind says that's absolutely what's going to happen, so I keep putting it off.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of losing the client is really intense, and it's leading you to avoid talking to them about the renewal. Can you try to bring your mind back to the present moment for just this one phone call? Instead of imagining all the worst-case scenarios, what if you just focus on having a normal conversation with the client? What's one small thing you could say to them on the phone to take it one step forward, rather than letting fear hold you back?

Patient: I could open with, "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" But the instant I picture saying it I see him saying he's found someone else, then other clients freak out, revenue tanks, I can't cover payroll and end up selling the business — so it feels like calling is just inviting that disaster.

Therapist: Let's take a small step. You've described a way to make the initial phone call that feels relatively normal. What if we focus on just saying that one sentence, "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" Can you commit to saying that exactly once, without thinking about all the what-ifs? Just focus on picking up the phone, saying those words, and then see what happens next?

Patient: I want to say it — "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" — but the second I picture saying it I see him saying he's found someone else, then other clients panic, revenue nosedives and I'm forced to sell the business. I can't promise I won't freeze; it feels like calling is just inviting that whole chain of disasters.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of calling the client, and it's leading to a lot of worst-case thinking. I want to try something different. Can you imagine that Sam is saying "Hi, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" right now, in this moment, without you? Not as a conversation you're going to have, but as a sentence he's actually saying? Just notice how that sounds, without judgment.

Patient: I can almost hear him say it — calm, normal — but as soon as I do my brain slides into: "He found someone else," and I'm already picturing clients leaving and me missing payroll. I know that sounds ridiculous and probably isn't realistic, but I can't seem to let the sentence sit without turning it into the start of the disaster story. It's tiring — I want to just listen, but I keep getting hijacked.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that this pattern of catastrophic thinking is really tiring, and you want to break it. Can you try to explore what might be driving this thought pattern? What is it about hearing Sam say "Hi, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" that's so quickly spiraling into worst-case thinking? Is there something specific that's triggering this fear, or is it just a general tendency of yours?

Patient: Probably both — it's this default "fortune-telling" thing in my head plus a few real triggers. Since the move I'm stretched thin, and any hint of a renewal convo flips a switch: miss one thing, client leaves, payroll gaps, I have to sell the business — my brain treats that chain like a sure thing. I get that other outcomes are possible, but they don't feel real to me; the disaster story always grabs the wheel and makes me freeze.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that this pattern is tied to a sense of overwhelm and stress, especially around the renewal conversation. Can you try to focus on what would happen if you were to take a small step towards the conversation, rather than getting caught up in the worst-case thinking? Instead of thinking about the potential disasters, what if you just focused on the present moment, and the fact that you have a chance to have a conversation with Sam? What would it take for you to start with just one small step, like saying hello or making an appointment?

Patient: I guess I could try just opening with, "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" and set a time, maybe first thing tomorrow so I don't chicken out. But the second I picture that, my brain screams he'll say he's found someone else and the whole business collapses — so even that tiny step feels like I'm stepping off a cliff. I want to do it, but I'm stuck imagining the disaster and worrying I'll freeze mid-sentence.

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of thinking about the entire conversation or the potential outcomes, can you just focus on the single act of making the phone call? Just pick up the phone, say "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?", and set a time for tomorrow. What if, for just one second, you just focus on the physical sensation of saying those words, without thinking about the future or the past? Can you commit to just one second of that?

Patient: I want to do it, but I can't promise — the second I try to focus for even one second I see Sam saying he's found someone else, clients panicking, revenue collapsing, and me having to sell the business. My chest tightens and I just freeze. Can we slow down and rehearse the exact line together a few times here?

Therapist: Let's do it. Let's rehearse the line together, exactly. I'll say it first: "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" Now it's your turn. Just say it back to me, exactly the same words. Don't think about the future or the past, just focus on saying those words. Take your time, it's okay. I'm here. Say it again.

Patient: "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?"

I said it, but my brain immediately screams he'll say he's found someone else and then everyone bails and I'm bankrupt and have to sell the business. I feel stuck and overwhelmed — can we slow down and try it again a couple more times? I don't know if I can actually make the call yet.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and try it again. I'll start. "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" Now it's your turn. Just repeat it back to me, exactly the same words. Don't think about the outcome, don't think about the future. Just focus on saying those words right now. Take your time. I'll wait. When you're ready, say it again.

Patient: "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?"

I said it, but the instant it comes out I see him saying he's found someone else, then clients panic, revenue collapses, I can't cover payroll and I'm forced to sell the business. Saying it feels like pulling something heavy — can we slow down and run it through a couple more times? I don't think I'm ready to actually call yet.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and try it one more time. I'll start. "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" This time, I want you to focus on just the physical sensation of saying those words, without thinking about the outcome or the future. Just feel the words on your tongue, the sound of your voice, the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about what Sam will say, don't think about what might happen. Just say the words. When you're ready, say them again. We'll keep going until you feel comfortable moving forward.

Patient: "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?"

Saying it feels like dragging a weight — the second it leaves my mouth I see him saying he's already found someone else, everyone panics, revenue nosedives and I'm forced to sell the business. Can we slow down and run it a few more times? I don't think I'm ready to actually call yet.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and try something different. Instead of focusing on the outcome or the future, let's focus on the physical sensation of saying those words right now. Can you feel the words "Hi Sam, hope you're well — can we grab 10 minutes this week to go over your renewal?" on your tongue? Can you feel the air moving in and out of your body as you say them? Let's try to anchor ourselves in the present moment, without thinking about what might happen. Just focus on the sensation of saying those words. When you're ready, we can try it again. But for now, just take a deep breath and stay with the sensation of saying those words.

Patient: I can kind of feel the words on my tongue and the breath, but the moment I try to stay with that the chest tightens and my head floods with the "he's found someone else" story — clients leave, payroll gaps, I have to sell the business. My brain just yanks me out of the present. Can we go slower and run it again, really gently?

Therapist: Let's start with just the sound of my voice. I'll say one word: "Hi". Just the word "Hi". Can you hear that? Can you feel the sound of the word on your tongue? Don't think about anything else, just the sound of the word. Take a deep breath and stay with the sound. When you're ready, I'll add another word. But for now, just stay with "Hi".

Patient: Hi.

I can hear it — it's small and flat in my mouth — but the moment I notice it my head already yanks me into the "he's found someone else" story and that heavy sinking feeling. Can we go on to the next word, but really slowly?

Therapist: Let's take it very slow. I'll say just one word again, but I'll pause for a moment after each word. Let's start with the word "Sam". Say it with me: "Sam". Just say the word, no pressure. Now, pause for a second. Can you hear the word "Sam"? Can you feel the sound of it on your tongue? Now, take a deep breath and stay with the word for a moment. When you're ready, I'll add the next word. But for now, just stay with "Sam".

Patient: Sam.

It lands flat, and the moment I hear it my brain snaps into the disaster tape — he'll say he's found someone else, clients bail, payroll gaps, and I'm forced to sell the business. My chest tightens. Can we go even slower before the next word?

Therapist: Let's stop here for a moment. Take a deep breath, and try to let go of the thought that just occurred. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you feel your chest relax, just a little bit? Try to release any tension in your body. I want you to repeat a phrase to yourself, over and over again: "I am safe." Just say it, without thinking about it. "I am safe." Say it again. "I am safe." Take a deep breath, and stay with that phrase for a moment. When you're ready, we can try again. But for now, just focus on your breath and your physical body.

Patient: "I am safe" — "I am safe" — but it just feels empty, and the moment I try it my head jumps straight to Sam saying he found someone else, clients pulling out, payroll holes, and me having to sell the business. This is getting heavy; can we go back to rehearsing the phone line, one slow word at a time? I don't know how to make that safety phrase actually stick.

Therapist: Let's go back to the phone call, one word at a time. Let's start with just the word "Sam". Say it with me: "Sam". Just say the word, no pressure. Try to focus on the sound of the word on your tongue, rather than what you think might happen next. Can you feel the word "Sam" on your tongue? Take a deep breath, and stay with that feeling for a moment. Now, pause for a second. Can you hear the word "Sam" in your mind? Try to let go of any thoughts about the conversation, and just focus on the physical sensation of the word. When you're ready, we can move on to the next word. But for now, just stay with "Sam".

Patient: Sam.

It lands flat, but the second I try to hold it my brain's already yelling "he's found someone else" and I'm picturing clients bailing, revenue tanking, payroll gaps, and me having to sell the business — can we move to the next word, but really, really slowly?

Therapist: Let's take it extremely slow. I'll say just one word, and we'll pause for an incredibly long time before moving on to the next word. Let's start with the word "Hi". Say it with me: "Hi". Just say the word, no pressure. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, slowly lift your head off the cushion. Look straight ahead, and don't blink. Focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just be present with that sensation. Don't think about anything else. Not even for a second. Just be. When you're ready, we can move on to the next word. But for now, just stay with that sensation.

Patient: Hi.

I can force the word out but it feels flat and heavy — the second I try to do the breathing and not blink the disaster tape kicks in: he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, revenue tanks, payroll gaps, I end up selling the business, like that's inevitable. My chest tightens and keeping my head up feels like too much; can we go even slower, maybe just sit with one breath for a minute before the next word?

Therapist: Let's take a break from the words. Let's just sit with your breath for a minute. Close your eyes if it feels comfortable, and focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just feel the breath, without trying to control it or change it in any way. Don't think about the words, don't think about the phone call, and don't think about the catastrophic thinking. Just be present with the breath. When you're ready, we can take a single deep breath together, and then move on to the next word. But for now, let's just sit with the breath.

Patient: Okay... I closed my eyes and tried to feel the breath like you said, but as soon as I slow down that tape in my head starts yelling "he's found someone else" and I'm picturing clients leaving and payroll holes. My chest's tight and it feels like too much to move on — can we just sit with one slow breath together first? I don't think I'm ready for the next word yet.

Therapist: Let's just sit with one slow breath together. I'll start: inhale for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... hold for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... exhale for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... Let's just stay with the breath for now. Don't think about anything else. Just be with the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's see if we can just stay here for a moment.

Patient: Okay... I let that breath sit for a beat and for a second it loosened the knot, but the disaster tape's already sneaking back in — Sam saying he found someone else, clients bailing, payroll gaps, me having to sell the business. Can we go slower? Maybe one more four-count breath, then try the single word "Hi" again really slowly — I don't think I'm ready to call yet.

Therapist: Let's take one more four-count breath together. I'll start: inhale for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... hold for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... exhale for a count of four... (pause) 1... 2... 3... 4... Let's just stay with the breath for now. When you're ready, we'll try the single word "Hi" again, but we'll take it very, very slowly. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body right now. Don't think about anything else.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in like you said and it eased the knot a hair.  

"Hi."  

It lands flat and right away the tape's yelling he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, and I'll have to sell the business — can we go even slower and just sit with that one plain "Hi" for a longer beat?

Therapist: Let's just sit with the word "Hi" for a longer beat. I'll take a deep breath and let it be still for a moment. *pauses* Let's just focus on the sound of the word "Hi" itself, without thinking about what it means or what might happen next. Just be with the sound. Let's try to let go of any thoughts or associations that come up, and just be present with the word. *pauses again* Let's just sit here with "Hi" for a moment. No need to do anything, just be.

Patient: Hi.

It lands for a tiny second, then the tape's already yelling he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, and I'll have to sell the business — can we just sit with that one plain "Hi" for a lot longer? I don't think I'm ready to move on yet.

Therapist: Let's just sit with the word "Hi" for a really long time. I'll stay right here with you, and we'll just focus on the sound of the word. Don't think about anything else. Just be with the word "Hi". Take a deep breath, and let's just sit here together. Let's see if we can find a way to make the word "Hi" feel more grounded, more present, and less triggering. Let's just sit with it, slowly, slowly, slowly.

Patient: Hi.

It hangs there for a moment and then my brain yanks me into the same disaster tape—he's found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, I have to sell the business—like that's the only possible next step. Can we just stay with that one plain "Hi" for a long time? I don't know if I'm ready to move on yet.

Therapist: Let's just stay with the word "Hi" for as long as you need. I'll keep saying it, and you can keep focusing on it. Let's just keep the word "Hi" there, in the present moment. Don't think about what's happening next, or what might happen if you say something else. Just be with the word "Hi". Take a deep breath, and let's just sit here together. Let's see if we can find a way to make the word "Hi" feel more solid, more real, and less like it's leading to a specific outcome. Let's just stay with it, for now. "Hi". "Hi". "Hi".

Patient: Hi.

It hangs there a second and my head's already racing — he'll say he found someone else, clients panic, revenue collapses and I end up having to sell the business. My voice feels thin saying it again. Can we just keep sitting with that one word a bit longer? I don't think I'm ready to move on yet.

Therapist: Let's keep sitting with the word "Hi" for a little while longer. I'll say it again, and you can take a deep breath and try to focus on it. Don't worry about saying it perfectly or with a lot of conviction. Just let the word be there, and see if we can find a way to make it feel more comfortable for you. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's just sit here with "Hi". Just "Hi". Let's see if we can find a way to make this word feel more solid, more real, and less like it's leading to a specific outcome. Take your time, and don't rush.

Patient: Okay... Hi.

It lands for a second, then the tape's already yelling he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, and I'll have to sell the business. I don't have much left in me to push it away — can we just keep sitting with "Hi" and slow breaths for a while longer? Please keep saying it with me.

Therapist: Let's just keep sitting here with "Hi" and slow breaths. I'll say it with you, and we'll just focus on the sound of the word and the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about pushing it away or trying to make it happen differently. Just be with the word "Hi" and the breath. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's just sit here for a moment. "Hi". Take another breath... and let's just sit here for a bit longer. "Hi".

Patient: Hi.

It holds for a beat and then the tape's already yelling he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, and I'll have to sell the business — my brain won't let the word stay. Can we just keep doing the slow breaths and saying "Hi" together? I don't have the energy to move on yet.

Therapist: Let's just keep doing the slow breaths and saying "Hi" together. I'll say it with you, and we'll just focus on the sensation of the breath and the sound of the word. Don't worry about trying to push back against the thinking or trying to move on. Just be present with the word "Hi" and the breath. Take a deep breath in... and out... and let's just sit here for a moment. "Hi". Take another breath... and let's just sit here for a bit longer. "Hi". Let's just keep going at this pace, and see where it takes us.

Patient: Hi.

It lands for a second and then the disaster tape's already yelling he'll say he found someone else, clients bolt, payroll gaps, and I'll have to sell the business — I don't have the energy to push past it yet, can we just keep doing the slow breaths and saying "Hi" together for a while longer?
