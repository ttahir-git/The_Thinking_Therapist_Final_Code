Patient: I'm an older nurse and lately I feel stuck—like the only thing I have is my job, especially since I lost someone close. My self-esteem's shot and I don't know what matters to me beyond nursing. I'm skeptical this will help; how is that supposed to help? I've tried things before and they didn't work.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit feeling stuck and skeptical, especially after trying other approaches. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "nothing changes"? Is it a sense of emotional numbness, like you're just going through the motions of your job, or is it something else?
Your primary goal is to guide the patient toward psychological flexibility by helping them change their relationship with their thoughts and feelings, connect with their values, and take committed action. You facilitate movement without giving direct advice.

Patient: Mostly it's like I'm on autopilot—get up, go to the hospital, come home, try not to think about him, and sleep. I feel numb a lot; the things that used to make me happy don't anymore, but at work I'm hyper-aware of every little mistake, so it's like two opposite things at once. I've tried counseling and picking up things to fill the time before, and they didn't stick—I'm skeptical this will be different. How is talking about "values" supposed to help someone who feels like they doesn't deserve anything beyond their job?

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's understandable that you're struggling to find meaning. When we talk about "values," I don't mean things like "you deserve happiness" or "you deserve recognition." Those might actually reinforce the idea that you're not worthy. Instead, I'm talking about what matters to you, what gives your life purpose, and what makes you feel most alive. Can you think of anything, even if it seems small, that you still enjoyed before losing your loved one, or something that you've always wanted to try but never had the chance?

Patient: I used to garden a little—pots on the windowsill—and I liked baking on weekends, listening to old records with him. Lately those things feel hollow or like chores, and I don't have the energy or interest. I thought about maybe trying a painting class or volunteering with a patient support group, but I don't see how that would change anything. How is talking about what mattered then supposed to make it mean anything now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling disconnected from the things that used to bring you joy. I'm not asking you to go back to those activities in the same way; I'm just asking you to notice how they made you feel when you did them. Can you think of a specific time when you were gardening, and it felt like a break from the world, or when you were baking, and it felt like a way to show love? Not "Did I enjoy it?" but "How did it make me feel in that moment?" Let's try to defuse the idea that these activities are either completely relevant or completely irrelevant.

Patient: There was this one morning when I was watering the little pots and the sun hit the leaves just right — I felt...quiet, like my mind stopped racing for a minute and I was actually proud of something small. Baking used to be the same; kneading dough made me feel useful, like I was taking care of someone. But those moments feel like flashes now, and then everything goes flat again — how is noticing that supposed to change anything when it never lasts?

Therapist: Those moments you're describing are exactly what I want you to pay attention to. I don't want you to try to hold onto them or make them last; just notice them as they are. Imagine sitting with that quiet feeling after watering the pots – not trying to think about it, not trying to do anything with it, just being with it. If your mind starts to wander, just gently bring it back to that feeling. Same with the baking – focus on the sensation of kneading dough, the feeling of being useful. Don't try to analyze it or make sense of it; just be with it. This isn't about changing anything; it's just about being present with your experiences as they are. Can you try that for a minute?

Patient: Okay, fine — I'll try for a minute, though I don't expect this to change anything. I sat by the window, felt the sun on my hands and the dampness of the soil; for a second my chest loosened and I felt a tiny bit proud, then my mind jumped back to the ward and to him and it just vanished. So how is noticing that supposed to help when it never sticks and I just end up feeling worse for having hoped?

Therapist: It's not surprising that your mind wandered; it's a natural response. The fact that you did take a moment to notice your experience, even if it was just for a second, is something. It's not about the duration of the experience; it's about the willingness to show up with it. I'm not asking you to change how you feel or make it last; I'm just asking you to be kind to yourself as you're experiencing it. When you said it "vanished," that's a judgment. Can you try to see that moment without judgment? Not "That's what happened" or "That's how I'm supposed to feel"; just "That's what's happening right now."

Patient: Alright—I tried to notice the sun and the soil, but my head immediately filled with "this won't work" and "you shouldn't enjoy this when he's gone." It just turned into another thing I felt like I failed at; being kind to myself feels impossible most days. How is "noticing without judgment" supposed to keep those thoughts from taking over? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not expecting you to be able to notice without judgment right now. That's not realistic, and it's not what we're aiming for. What I am asking you to do is take a small step back. Take a deep breath, and acknowledge how you're feeling right now. You said "I'm getting a bit overwhelmed" – that's a perfectly valid feeling. Can you just be with that feeling for a moment, without trying to change it or push it away? We can come back to the noticing and judgment later, when you're feeling a bit more grounded. For now, let's just focus on being kind to yourself as you're experiencing this overwhelm.

Patient: Okay—I took a slow breath like you said. My chest feels tight and my hands are a little shaky; for a moment the pressure eased, but the thought "you shouldn't enjoy this" jumped in and I felt guilty again. How is that supposed to help when I've tried calming myself before and it never lasts? Can we slow down a bit—I’m starting to feel really anxious.

Therapist: I want you to know that it's okay to feel anxious right now. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You don't have to try to control it or calm it down right away. What I want you to do is just acknowledge the feeling in this moment. Don't try to push it away or change it. Just say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious right now." Say it to yourself, not to the thought. You can look at the thought, but don't try to change it. You're safe here. You're safe to feel however you're feeling. We'll take it one step at a time. Can you just stay with that feeling for a moment, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I tried saying "I'm feeling anxious right now" and for a moment it even felt real — my chest eased — but then the thought "you shouldn't feel this, you failed him" barged in and it all felt pointless. I can stay with it for a few breaths, but those old criticisms always take over and I end up feeling worse, not better. How is this supposed to help when I've tried the same breathing and noticing before and it just leads me back to feeling worthless? Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel a bit light-headed.

Therapist: I think we've been going about this the wrong way. We've been trying to force you to notice without judgment, and it's not working. That's not the problem. The problem is the thoughts that are coming up. It's not about "you're not doing it right" or "this will never work." It's about the fact that you're still trying to control this, still trying to fix it, still trying to prove something to yourself. Can we try something different? Can we focus on the fact that you're willing to try again, that you're willing to take a step forward, even if it feels small? Even if it feels pointless? That's what matters. Not the outcome, not the thoughts, not the feelings. Just the fact that you're willing to show up and try again. Can we start with that?

Patient: I mean... I suppose I'm willing to try — if trying is all it is — but it feels tiny and useless most of the time. How is "being willing" supposed to change anything when I've pushed myself before and it never stuck? I'm starting to feel shaky and a bit panicky; can we slow down and not rush into more exercises right now?

Therapist: It's okay to feel tiny and useless right now. It's okay to feel like you're not making progress. You're not. But that's not the point. The point is that you're showing up, that you're willing to try again. That takes courage. And it's not about the outcome, it's not about whether or not you can actually change anything. It's about the fact that you're willing to take this tiny step, to try again, even when it feels like nothing else matters. Can we take a deep breath together and acknowledge that this is okay? That it's okay to not be okay? We don't have to rush into anything. We can just sit here together, for a moment, and breathe.

Patient: Okay — I took the breath with you. It loosened my chest a little, but my thoughts are still loud and that voice saying I failed him is right back. How is this breathing and “willingness” actually supposed to quiet that long-standing voice? Can we slow down and talk about what “showing up” would look like day to day, not just feelings and exercises?

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the exercises for a moment. Can you tell me about a typical day for you? What are some of the things that you do, how you do them, and how you think about them? What are some of the things that you struggle with, that you find challenging? We can use these as examples, these as case studies, to see how ACT principles can be applied to your daily life. We don't have to do that now, but we can start thinking about it, imagining it, and seeing how it might look. How would it feel to take a different approach to these challenges, to try to see things from a different perspective? Can we start exploring that, even if it's just in our imagination, for now?

Patient: A typical day is rigid: up at 5, make tea, get to the ward, check meds, chart, try not to make a mistake — I'm hyper-focused at work but it drains me. After a twelve-hour shift I come home, eat something cold, water the pots if I remember, maybe put a record on but mostly I just sit and go over the day and him and what I could've done differently. I've tried changing little routines before and they never stuck — how is imagining values supposed to actually fit into a Tuesday when I'm exhausted and that voice is screaming I failed him? If we're going to talk about "showing up," be concrete: what would that look like for me on a typical weekday without turning into another thing I fail at?

Therapist: Let's focus on one specific aspect of your daily routine that you can change, just for a minute, without feeling overwhelmed. What if, instead of going over the day and him in silence, you listened to a different kind of music, or a podcast, or just the sound of your own breathing for the first hour after you come home? Something to shift your focus, even if just for an hour. Can you think of a small, concrete change like that that might help? We're not talking about completely overhauling your day, just one tiny tweak that might help you feel more grounded, more present. What do you think might be a good starting point?

Patient: Maybe I could try one tiny, specific thing: when I get home, set a kitchen timer for 20 minutes, put on one of his records, and just water the pots while I listen — no thinking about the day, just that small ritual. I don't have much faith — I've tried playlists or walks and they didn't stop the thoughts — but maybe a timed, do-able thing could be less likely to slip. How is that actually supposed to help when I'm exhausted after twelve hours and that voice is shouting at me? Can we slow down and talk about how to make it realistic so it doesn't become another failure?

Therapist: I think it's great that you're proposing a specific, tiny change. It's realistic to have doubts about whether this will work, especially given your past experiences. It's okay if it doesn't work at first; it's okay if you don't stick to it. The goal here isn't to try a new behavior for a long time or with high expectations. It's to try one tiny thing, just for a short period, and see how it feels.

When you say "that voice is shouting at me," it's like you're describing a judgment. Can you try to notice that judgment without judging yourself? Can you just observe the thought, "I failed him," without trying to make sense of it or change it? We can talk about that voice later, but for now, let's focus on taking small action.

Remember, this isn't about making progress or achieving some kind of endpoint. It's about taking one tiny step, just for a moment, and seeing how it feels. Can you commit to trying this one tiny thing, just for the next 20 minutes, without making promises or trying to control the outcome?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 20-minute thing, but I’m not promising it’ll stick. How is that supposed to help when I’m spent after a shift and that voice will start berating me the moment the record plays? Could we make it shorter — like 10 minutes — and come up with concrete steps so it doesn’t become another thing I fail at (like prepping the record and pots beforehand, where to put the timer, what to do if the guilt starts)? Can you help me plan it so it’s actually doable on a weekday?

Therapist: Let's break down the 20-minute ritual into more manageable chunks. How about we start with a 10-minute window, as you suggested? Here's a possible plan:

1. As soon as you walk in the door, take a deep breath and put the kettle on for a cup of tea.
2. While the kettle is boiling, find a comfortable spot to sit with the record player.
3. Place the record on the player, and turn it on.
4. Set the timer for 10 minutes.
5. As the timer starts, take a moment to acknowledge the presence of the record, the sound of the music, and the calmness it might bring.
6. If your mind starts to wander (and it probably will), gently acknowledge the thought without judgment. You can say to yourself, "Ah, I'm thinking about the day again," or "I'm feeling anxious about not doing enough."
7. If the guilt starts to creep in (and it probably will), take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're taking a break from thinking about the day. You're not being lazy or avoiding your problems; you're taking care of yourself.

Let's focus on the first 10 minutes, and then we can reassess and adjust as needed. Remember, this is not about achieving some kind of goal or ending the ritual early. It's about taking small action, being present in the moment, and seeing how it feels.

How does this plan sound? Is there anything you'd like to add or change before we start?

Patient: Okay — the 10-minute plan sounds manageable on paper, but I'm really anxious right now and my hands are shaking, so I can already see myself fumbling it. Can we make it concrete like: put the record and pots by the door before my shift, have the timer on the counter ready, and pick one specific record so I don't have to decide when I get home? 

Also — when that guilt wave hits and I'm flooded with "you failed him," what do I actually do in the moment? You keep saying "notice" and "acknowledge," but how is that supposed to help when it feels like drowning? Can we slow down and talk through an actual script or a tiny action I can do when that happens?

Therapist: Let's make the plan more concrete and actionable. Here's an updated plan:

1. Before your shift, put the record player and pots by the door, so they're easily accessible when you get home.
2. Set the timer on the counter for 10 minutes, so it's ready to go when you put the record on.
3. Choose one specific record that you'll play every time you do this ritual, so you don't have to think about it. For example, you could choose a record that reminds you of a happy time or a calm moment.
4. As you put the record on and turn on the timer, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I'm starting this ritual. I'm taking care of myself."

Now, let's talk about what to do when the guilt wave hits. I know it's hard to think about, but I want you to imagine yourself in this moment, and what you need to do to get through it. Take a moment to notice how you're feeling, and what physical sensations are present in your body.

When the "you failed him" thought comes up, I want you to try something different. Instead of trying to push it away or change it, I want you to say to yourself, "Okay, that's a thought. I'm thinking it. But I'm not going to do anything with it right now. I'm just going to focus on the sound of the music, and the feeling of my feet on the ground." It's like you're creating a small, safe space around yourself, where you can just observe the thought without judgment.

Remember, this is not about ignoring the thought or avoiding your problems. It's about creating a small moment of calm, so you can deal with the guilt wave in a more manageable way. Can you try that for me?

( pause )

How did that feel? Was it helpful to imagine a specific script, or a tiny action to take when the guilt wave hits?

Patient: It helps a little to have a script, but I'm really jittery right now — my hands are shaking and my heart's racing — and "that's a thought" sounds hollow when I'm actually drowning in it. How is that supposed to help in the moment? I need something concrete I can do and say when my head's spinning. 

Can we make a tiny, two-line rescue script I can say out loud and pair it with one simple physical action (like pressing my thumb and forefinger together or taking a sip of water)? Can we slow down and rehearse it step by step now?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on creating a simple, concrete plan. I want you to imagine yourself in this moment, feeling overwhelmed and anxious. We're going to rehearse a tiny script, just two lines, that you can say out loud when the guilt wave hits.

**Script:**
"I've got this. I'm okay."

**Physical Action:**
Take a deep breath and press your thumb and forefinger together for a brief moment, like you're giving yourself a gentle squeeze.

Now, let's break it down step by step:

1. As the "you failed him" thought comes up, acknowledge it to yourself. Say the first line: "I've got this."
2. Immediately after saying "I've got this," take a deep breath and press your thumb and forefinger together. This is a physical reminder that you're taking control and regulating your emotions.
3. As you do this, focus on the sensation of the squeeze and the sound of your own breathing. Try to let go of the guilt wave and the overwhelming emotions.
4. When you're ready, slowly release the squeeze and take another deep breath.

Let's practice this script together, a few times, until it feels more natural. Can you repeat it after me, and I'll guide you through it?

(Note: We will continue to practice until it feels natural. Please don't worry about saying it "right" or "wrong". We're focusing on creating a tangible, manageable plan to help you cope with the guilt wave.)

Patient: Okay — I’ll try, though I don’t expect it to fix anything. "I've got this." (I press my thumb and forefinger together, take a breath.) "I'm okay." 

My hands are still shaking and my heart's racing — saying it felt a bit steadier for a second, but it also sounded hollow. How is "I've got this" supposed to help when the rest of me is screaming I failed him? Can we slow down and try a slightly different two-line version that might feel more honest, or rehearse it again step-by-step so it doesn’t fall apart when I’m panicked?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on creating a revised script that acknowledges your emotions and might feel more honest.

**Revised Script:**
"I'm so sorry. I'll be okay."

**Physical Action:**
Take a deep breath and press your thumb and forefinger together for a brief moment, like you're giving yourself a gentle squeeze.

Now, let's break it down step by step:

1. As the "you failed him" thought comes up, acknowledge your emotions and take a deep breath. Say the first line: "I'm so sorry."
2. Immediately after saying "I'm so sorry," take a moment to recognize that you're already taking steps towards being okay. You're taking care of yourself, right now, in this moment. Say the second line: "I'll be okay."
3. Focus on the sensation of the squeeze and the sound of your own breathing. Try to let go of the guilt wave and the overwhelming emotions.
4. When you're ready, slowly release the squeeze and take another deep breath.

Let's practice this revised script together, a few times, until it feels more natural. Can you repeat it after me, and I'll guide you through it?

(Note: We will continue to practice until it feels natural. Please don't worry about saying it "right" or "wrong". We're focusing on creating a tangible, manageable plan to help you cope with the guilt wave.)

Also, I want to acknowledge that saying "I'm so sorry" might feel like it's admitting fault, but it's not necessarily about assigning blame. It's about acknowledging your emotions and taking responsibility for your own well-being. Can you try to see it in that light?

Patient: Okay — I'm willing to try again, but I'm really jittery and distracted right now; my hands are shaking and my mind won't stop. Saying "I'm so sorry" sounds like I'm admitting I did something wrong and that just spikes the panic. Can we try a different two-line script that feels more honest for me, like "This hurts" / "I'm still here," and rehearse it slowly step-by-step right now?

Therapist: Let's try a new script that acknowledges your emotional pain and acknowledges that you're still present in the moment.

**New Script:**
"This hurts. I'm still here."

**Physical Action:**
Take a deep breath and press your thumb and forefinger together for a brief moment, like you're giving yourself a gentle squeeze.

Now, let's break it down step by step:

1. As you start to say the first line, "This hurts," acknowledge the physical and emotional pain in your body. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to feel it.
2. As you say "This hurts," acknowledge that it's okay to feel pain and that it's a valid emotion. You're not trying to change it or fix it right now; you're just acknowledging it.
3. Immediately after saying "This hurts," take a moment to acknowledge that you're still here. You're still breathing, you're still thinking, and you're still present in this moment. Say the second line: "I'm still here."
4. Focus on the sensation of the squeeze and the sound of your own breathing. Try to let go of the anxiety and the panic wave.
5. When you're ready, slowly release the squeeze and take another deep breath.

Let's practice this new script together, slowly and deliberately, until it feels more natural. Can you repeat it after me, and I'll guide you through it?

(Note: We will continue to practice until it feels natural. Please don't worry about saying it "right" or "wrong". We're focusing on creating a tangible, manageable plan to help you cope with the anxiety wave.)

Patient: Okay — I'm really jittery and can't focus; my hands are shaking and my heart's racing. But I'll try, slowly.

"This hurts." (I press my thumb and forefinger together, take a slow breath in — hold — out.) "I'm still here." (I let the squeeze go and breathe out.)

That helped... for about three seconds. Then the "you failed him" voice came back so loud it drowned it out and the words felt empty. How is this actually supposed to help when the guilt just comes roaring back? Can we rehearse it again, even slower, and maybe try a second action — like planting my feet and feeling the floor — in case the finger squeeze isn't enough when I'm panicked?

Therapist: Let's try to rehearse the script again, even slower and more deliberately. This time, let's introduce a second action to help you feel more grounded.

**Revised Script:**
"This hurts. I'm still here."

**New Action:**
"Feel my feet on the ground. Stay with that feeling."

**Physical Actions:**

1. As you start to say the first line, "This hurts," take a deep breath and press your thumb and forefinger together for a brief moment, like you're giving yourself a gentle squeeze.
2. Immediately after saying "This hurts," focus on your feet. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth. Say the second line: "I'm still here."
3. As you say "I'm still here," hold onto the feeling of your feet on the ground. Feel the stability and grounding that comes from being present in this moment. Don't let go of that feeling, even if the "you failed him" voice comes back.

Let's practice this revised script together, slowly and deliberately, until it feels more natural. Can you repeat it after me, and I'll guide you through it?

(Note: We will continue to practice until it feels natural. Please don't worry about saying it "right" or "wrong". We're focusing on creating a tangible, manageable plan to help you cope with the anxiety wave.)

Also, I want to acknowledge that the finger squeeze is not a magic solution, and it's not going to work every time. That's okay. We're experimenting with different techniques to find what works best for you. Let's keep trying and exploring different approaches until we find something that feels more effective for you.

Patient: I tried it again — thumb and finger, felt my feet, said "This hurts. I'm still here." It steadied me for maybe three seconds and then that guilt just roared back like always. How is that supposed to stop the flood when it comes in full force? It feels useless unless I have an exact if-then plan I can do without thinking.

Can we slow down and rehearse one concrete routine right now, step-by-step? I need: one two-line script I can say out loud, one simple physical move, and how many times to repeat it when the guilt hits (and what to do if it still keeps yelling). Guide me through it slowly — I’m jittery and can barely focus, so please walk me through each step.

Therapist: Let's create a specific routine that you can follow when the guilt hits. This routine will consist of a two-line script, a simple physical move, and a specific number of repetitions.

**Routine:**

1. **Script:** "This hurts. I'm still here."
2. **Physical Move:** Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 6.
3. **Repetition:** Repeat the script and physical move 6 times, focusing on each repetition without thinking.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling the air fill your lungs. As you inhale, say to yourself: "This hurts."
2. Hold your breath for a moment, feeling the sensation of your body.
3. Slowly exhale through your mouth, feeling the air release from your lungs. As you exhale, say to yourself: "I'm still here."
4. Take a moment to focus on your breath, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 again, focusing on each repetition without thinking.
6. After repeating the script and physical move 6 times, take a moment to notice how you're feeling. Notice any changes in your body or mind.
7. If the guilt wave continues to hit you, try to focus on the physical sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to stay present with the sensation, without thinking about the guilt wave.

Let's practice this routine together, slowly and deliberately. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm really jittery; my hands are shaking and my heart's racing. Please go very slowly and count me through each inhale and exhale, tell me when to say "This hurts" and when to say "I'm still here," and keep me on track for all six. Also — if after six it comes roaring back, what exactly do I do next? I need a concrete, step-by-step backup so it doesn't just fall apart.

Therapist:  too tightly wrapped around ACT principles.
8. If you find it hard to focus or if you feel overwhelmed, take a break and try again when you feel calmer.
9. If the guilt continues to yell, just let it. Say: "I hear you" and "I acknowledge your pain." Then, refocus on the present moment and breathe. Focus on the physical sensations in your body, like your breath, feet on the ground. Focus on the thoughts and emotions, try the thoughts to become more fluid.
Focus only on one thing at a time, focus on one task. You may hear the voice in your head, be gentle, focus only on the breath. It’s time.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but my hands are still shaking and my chest feels tight. Please go very slowly and tell me exactly when to inhale, when to say "This hurts," when to exhale, and when to say "I'm still here" for each of the six rounds. 

Also — be straight with me: how is this six-breath thing actually supposed to blunt the guilt when it comes roaring back? If it doesn't work after six, walk me through the backup step-by-step — exactly what I say out loud, what physical move I do, and what I do if the guilt still won't quiet.

Patient: Okay — my hands are still shaking and my heart's racing, but I'll try. Please count me through each breath out loud, very slowly: tell me when to inhale (1–4), tell me to say "This hurts" on the inhale, tell me when to hold, then count the exhale (1–6) and tell me to say "I'm still here" on the exhale — do that six times and keep me on track. 

And be straight with me: if after those six it comes roaring back, tell me exactly what to say out loud (one or two lines), exactly what physical move to do, how many times to repeat it, and then what to do if the guilt still won't quiet — step-by-step, please. I don't expect miracles, but give me something I can do without thinking when I'm panicked.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm really jittery: my hands are shaking and my chest is tight. Please count me through each inhale (1–4) and exhale (1–6) and tell me exactly when to say "This hurts" and when to say "I'm still here" for each of the six rounds — very, very slowly. 

And be straight with me: if after those six it comes roaring back, give me one or two exact lines to say out loud, one simple physical move to do, how many times to repeat it, and then the next exact step if the guilt still won't quiet — step‑by‑step. I don’t expect miracles, but I need something I can do without thinking when I'm panicked; how is this actually supposed to blunt the guilt?

Please count me through very slowly: inhale 1–4 and tell me to say "This hurts" on the inhale, hold, then exhale 1–6 and say "I'm still here" on the exhale — do that six times and keep me on track. And be straight: if after six it still roars back, give me one or two exact lines to say out loud, one simple physical move, how many times to repeat it, and then the next exact step if the guilt won't quiet — step‑by‑step, please. How is this actually supposed to blunt the guilt when it comes in full force?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready but my hands are shaking and my chest is tight. Please count me through each inhale (1–4) and exhale (1–6) and tell me exactly when to say "This hurts" and "I'm still here" for all six rounds, very slowly. 

Also be straight: if after those six it still roars back, give me one or two exact lines to say out loud, one simple physical move to do, how many times to repeat it, and then the next exact step if the guilt still won't quiet — step‑by‑step. I'm skeptical, but I'll try — please go slowly.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm really jittery: my hands are shaking and my heart's racing and I can barely focus. I don't expect miracles, but please go very, very slowly and count me through each inhale (1–4) and exhale (1–6), telling me to say "This hurts" on the inhale and "I'm still here" on the exhale for all six rounds — keep me on track. 

And be straight: if after those six it still roars back, give me one or two exact lines to say aloud, one simple physical move to do, how many times to repeat it, and the next exact step if the guilt won't quiet — step‑by‑step. Start when you're ready.
