Patient: I've been feeling really stuck since the breakup and losing my job — like I don't know who I am beyond "unemployed." I can't figure out what matters to me anymore; everything feels directionless and small. I don't really see how talking about it will help, but here I am.

Therapist: Taking this step feels like a small act of courage already. It takes a lot of effort to acknowledge the stuckness and admit it can't be easily solved with just talking. Goal: Explore how this sense of directionlessness shows up in your daily life, making it a tangible context for exploring what might help. 

Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you right now? How does this feeling of being directionless affect your interactions with others, your thoughts, and your overall sense of well-being?

Patient: Lately my days blur together — I sleep in, scroll for hours, half-heartedly send a couple of job applications, start a creative idea and then abandon it, and spend the evenings alone with TV or more scrolling. I cancel plans or make excuses because I’m embarrassed to explain I’ve been unemployed, so my interactions feel shallow or forced and I end up feeling lonelier. My head is full of the same loop: I’m not doing enough, I’ve ruined things, I don’t deserve better — it drains any energy for decisions or trying new stuff. I've tried making schedules or forcing hobbies before and it didn’t stick, so… how is talking about my routine supposed to help with any of that?

Therapist: Your days do seem to be spiraling into a sense of emptiness and disconnection. It's like the routine itself is a coping mechanism, but it's not enough. Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance behavior and its impact on your emotional state, even if talking about it feels counterintuitive. 

I'm not asking you to make any changes or try anything new right now. Just observe the thought patterns and emotions that arise when you're stuck in this cycle. Can you describe what happens when you're scrolling through your phone or watching TV? What's the first thought that comes up for you, and how does it make you feel? Is there a specific emotion that lingers throughout the day, even when you're not actively engaging with it?

Patient: At first it feels like a break — mindless scrolling is the easiest thing to do. Then the thought hits: I’m wasting my life, I’ve ruined things, and I get this heavy shame in my chest that just makes me numb and indecisive. That low, stubborn sadness hangs around all day and eats any energy I might have had, and honestly I’m tired of rehearsing it — how is just describing this supposed to help me actually get unstuck?

Therapist: It's like you're trapped in a cycle of shame and self-doubt, and even the brief respite of mindless scrolling can't shake it off. Goal: Introduce a subtle shift in focus, away from the self-criticism and shame, to explore what's driving these emotions and how they're impacting your sense of agency. 

I'm not looking to fix or resolve anything right now. Just listen to your words and let them sink in. Can you tell me more about what it means to "rehearse" these thoughts? Is there a part of you that's trying to convince itself that it's true, or is there a part of you that's just stuck in this pattern? What's the purpose of rehearsing these thoughts, and how does it make you feel when you finally acknowledge them?

Patient: When I say I "rehearse" the thoughts, it's like I run through worst-case scripts so I can say, 'See, I told you so' if something goes wrong. Part of me thinks it's being protective — prepping for rejection — but another part is clearly punishing me, keeping me small so I don't risk getting hurt. Admitting that feels heavy and kind of clarifying at the same time, but... how is that supposed to help actually change anything?

Therapist: It's like you're caught between a desire to protect yourself from potential pain and a need to punish yourself for not being strong enough. Goal: Introduce a small, gentle exploration of what it means to be willing to let go of this need for control, just for a moment. 

I'm not asking you to make any big decisions or commitments right now. Just imagine that you're standing in a field, looking at a small stone that you've been carrying around with you. It's been weighing you down, and it's been a source of comfort, but also of anxiety. What if you just let the stone go? What would it feel like to release it, even if just for a second? What's the worst that could happen?

Patient: If I let the stone go I can almost feel a weird lightness — like a breath I haven't had in months — but right away panic shows up, like, hey, now you're exposed and anything could happen. The worst I can imagine is that I let go and then I'm unprepared when something bad happens, or I feel foolish for trusting myself and it just proves I was right to stay small. I get that the image is supposed to help, but... how is that actually supposed to help me stop rehearsing the worst?

Therapist: It's like the lightness you feel is quickly replaced by a familiar sense of anxiety and self-doubt. Goal: Focus on the small, subtle act of noticing what's happening in this moment, without judgment. 

Can you just be with the thought, "I'm unprepared when something bad happens"? What does it feel like to think that? Is there a physical sensation in your body, a sound, a smell? Just observe it, without trying to change it or react to it. Notice how it arises, and how it might fade away if you simply pay attention to it.

Patient: When I think "I'm unprepared when something bad happens" I feel a tight squeeze in my chest and this heavy knot in my stomach. My breathing gets shallow, my hands tingle, and everything feels louder and a bit foggy — like my brain is on red alert. Sometimes if I actually sit with it a minute it loosens a touch, but it doesn't make the real worries — money, interviews, being judged — any less urgent. How is noticing this supposed to help with the actual stuff? Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to sit with a physical sensation, and it's actually helping to create a bit of space. Goal: Introduce a gentle invitation to pause, not just physically, but also in terms of processing. 

It's okay if you're feeling overwhelmed. That's a normal response to this kind of exploration. Can we just slow down for a moment, without trying to do anything in particular? Take a deep breath, and notice how you're sitting. What's the sensation of your feet touching the ground? What's the sensation of the air on your skin? Just notice the present moment, without trying to think about it too much. No need to do anything; just be here.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying. My feet feel heavy on the floor, the air is cool on my arms, and taking a slow breath actually loosens the tightness in my chest a little. I'm still overwhelmed though — it helps for a moment but the worries about money and interviews pop right back; how does paying attention to this actually change anything?

Therapist: It's like the moment of stillness is fleeting, and the worries come flooding back. Goal: Explore how this pattern of stillness and overwhelm might be related to your willingness to take action. 

Can you think about what happens right after you feel the tightness in your chest and the worries come back? What do you usually do? Do you try to push them away, or do you get stuck in a loop of thinking about them? Notice if there's a sense of resistance or tension in your body when you're getting caught up in these worries. Is there a part of you that wants to do something different, but isn't sure what?

Patient: Usually I try to shove it down — scroll, busy myself with small chores, or nap — anything to avoid feeling that squeeze. Other times I get stuck replaying the worst-case and just freeze, my shoulders tense and my mind goes blank so I can't follow through on anything. There's a part of me that wants to do things differently — write, take a class, call someone — but another voice says it'll be pointless or I'll fail, and that stops me. I've forced changes before and they never stick, so seriously — how is just noticing this supposed to help me actually change?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to avoid the discomfort of uncertainty and self-doubt, and that's leading to patterns of avoidance and immobilization. Goal: Introduce a small act of experimentation, not to change everything at once, but to see if you can make a tiny step towards taking action despite the doubts. 

I want to ask you a simple question: What's one tiny thing you could do right now, just for the next 30 seconds, that might feel slightly uncomfortable or uncertain? It doesn't have to be anything big, just something small. Maybe it's opening a piece of paper to write something, or picking up a pen, or dialing a number. What if, just for that tiny moment, you allowed yourself to feel a little bit of uncertainty, and then you did something anyway?

Patient: Okay… maybe I could pick up a pen and write one sentence — something dumb like “I did one small thing today” — for 30 seconds. I’ll try it, but I’ve done tiny tasks before and they fizzle out, so how is that supposed to fix anything real? Still, I can do it now and see what it feels like.

Therapist: You're willing to try it, despite your past experiences. Goal: Focus on the process, not the outcome. 

Just pick up the pen and write that sentence. Don't think about it too much, just do it. Notice how your hand feels, how the pen feels in your hand, what the paper looks like. Just write the sentence: "I did one small thing today." Take a deep breath and do it. One sentence, one breath, one second.

Patient: I picked up the pen — it felt a little clumsy in my hand and my fingers were tense — and I wrote, "I did one small thing today." For a second it felt like proof I could do something, but the relief was tiny and the voice in my head's already like, "So what? How is that supposed to help with the actual problems?" I'm not sure what to do next without getting overwhelmed; can we move slower and figure out what a next tiny step might actually connect to?

Therapist: You've taken the first small step, and now you're feeling a bit uncertain again. Goal: Explore what's happening in this moment, without trying to push forward or get overwhelmed. 

Let's just be with the sentence you just wrote: "I did one small thing today." What does it mean to you? What's the first thing that comes up when you think about it? Is there a physical sensation, a thought, an emotion? Notice it, without judgment. Take a deep breath, and just observe what's here.

Patient: For a second it felt real — a small warmth in my chest, like something unclenching — but then the voice in my head goes, "Big deal," and the relief just evaporates back into the same knot. It feels like proof that's almost useless because it doesn't turn into anything bigger. How is that supposed to help me actually get momentum with interviews or stop feeling like I ruined everything? Can we slow down and figure out what that one sentence could realistically connect to next?

Therapist: It's like the moment of warmth and connection is fleeting, and the voice of doubt comes back in. Goal: Focus on the question of what this sentence could realistically connect to next, rather than trying to push forward to a bigger goal. 

Let's take a closer look at the sentence: "I did one small thing today." What if, instead of trying to use it as proof or a stepping stone to bigger things, we just consider what it would mean to do one small thing in the next few hours, or the next day? What if that small thing is not about the interview, or about feeling like you've ruined everything, but about something entirely different? What if it's about showing up to a class, or calling a friend, or taking a short walk? What would that small thing be, and what would it take to do it?

Patient: Maybe I could text one friend and ask to meet for coffee or just chat — something tiny and not about jobs. It would take me opening messages, typing a short “hey, you free this week?” and actually hitting send, which feels harder than it should because I already imagine them saying no or it fizzling out. How is that supposed to help with the bigger stuff? I'm nervous about doing it — can we slow down and map out exactly what I'll say so I don't chicken out?

Therapist: You're considering a small social interaction that doesn't involve jobs. Goal: Focus on the process of sending that text, not on how it might lead to a bigger outcome. 

Let's break down what you'll say. What if you just type the simple question: "Hey, you free this week?" What if you don't think about the outcome, and you just focus on putting the words into the message? What if you're not trying to elicit a specific response, but just sending a simple greeting? Notice how that feels. Just the physical act of typing and sending a short message. 

We don't need to worry about how the other person will respond right now. Just the act of sending the message. Can you do that?

Patient: Yeah, I can try to send it. I'll type "Hey, you free this week?" but my brain's already racing through them saying no or ghosting me, and that'll just confirm everything I’m afraid of. How is that supposed to help me get unstuck long-term? Can we slow down and come up with a backup message or plan for if they don't respond so I don't spiral?

Therapist: Your brain is already racing with worst-case scenarios. Goal: Focus on creating a small buffer against those thoughts, rather than trying to anticipate and prevent them. 

Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge those thoughts. It's natural to think about potential negative reactions. But instead of trying to control or prevent them, let's create a small safety net. What if, instead of thinking "They'll say no/ghost me," you think "I'll just wait for a minute" or "I'll try sending it again later"? Can you imagine a small pause or delay between sending the message and worrying about the response? 

We can even come up with a backup message or plan, but let's focus on the smallest, most manageable step first. Can you simply type the original question: "Hey, you free this week?" without thinking about the outcome or worrying about potential responses? Just the physical act of typing.

Patient: Okay—I typed "Hey, you free this week?" but I haven't hit send because my chest's tight and I'm already picturing them ghosting me. How is sending one text supposed to help with the bigger stuckness? Can we slow down and map out a backup plan for if they don't reply so I don't spiral?

Therapist: You've typed the message, but your body's still resisting the action. Goal: Focus on creating a small sense of control and agency, even in the face of uncertainty. 

Let's acknowledge the physical sensations in your body. The tightness in your chest is understandable, given the potential for rejection or disappointment. But instead of getting caught up in those thoughts, let's focus on the small action you can take right now. You've typed the message, but you still haven't sent it. What's one tiny step you can take to make it happen? Can you take one finger and press the send button? Just that small action. 

Now, let's talk about the backup plan. We can certainly come up with strategies for handling a potential lack of response. But let's focus on one thing at a time. Can you take that small step and send the message, even if it's just for a second? Then we can worry about the potential outcomes and come up with a plan to deal with them.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is pressing send supposed to help with the bigger stuckness? My chest is tight and my finger feels stuck over the button; I could force myself to hit send but then I'll just sit there waiting and panic. If we do this, can we map out exactly what I should do if they don't reply — like wait a day, send a short follow-up, or do something to stop myself spiraling? I feel confused and a bit paralyzed, so can we slow down and figure that out first?

Therapist: You're right, pressing send might not directly address the bigger stuckness. Goal: Take a step back and explore how your current physical action (typing, sending) can be a small anchor to help you move forward, even if it's just temporarily. 

It's understandable that you're feeling paralyzed, and we can take a step back from the bigger question of what to do if they don't reply. Can you focus just on the physical action of sending the message? What if you just take one small breath, and then place your finger on the send button, without thinking too much about what will happen next? Just the physical act of preparing to send. 

We can definitely talk about what to do if they don't reply later. But for now, let's just try to get to the point where you're physically sending the message. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just pressing send supposed to help with the bigger mess? My chest is tight and my finger's hovering; I could force myself to hit send, but I need a clear backup plan so I don't spiral if they don't reply (like wait a day, send one short follow-up, and have a distraction ready — a walk or a show). Can we slow down and map that out step by step before I do anything?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to proceed. Goal: Take a step back and explore how to create a clear plan for handling a potential lack of response, rather than trying to tackle the bigger stuckness right now. 

Let's break down the potential steps you could take if they don't reply. Can you start by listing out a few possible actions you could take? What if they don't respond right away? What if they do respond, but it's not what you were hoping for? What if you do end up sending a follow-up message? 

Take your time, and let's go through this step by step. What's the first thing you could do if they don't reply? Could you wait a day, send a short follow-up message, or take a break? What's the smallest, most manageable step you could take to handle the potential silence?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how outlining steps actually fixes anything, but okay — here are a few concrete things I could try so I don't spiral if they don't reply:

- Wait 24 hours before doing anything — try not to check my phone the whole time.  
- If no reply after 24 hours, send one short follow-up like, "Hey, just checking in — no worries if you're busy."  
- If still nothing after 3 days, drop it and do a planned distraction (20–30 minute walk, call another friend, or work on a tiny creative task).  
- If they reply but it's lukewarm or a brush-off, send a brief, neutral response and then do the distraction anyway.  
- If they reply positively, make a simple plan (time/place) and treat it as a small win.

I don't know if that will stop me catastrophizing, but having steps might keep me from spiraling. Can we slow down and pick which one I should actually try first, and how I’ll make myself follow it?

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a solid list of concrete steps to help you handle the potential silence. Goal: Focus on the first step, and explore how to create a plan to actually follow it. 

Let's take the first step: waiting 24 hours before doing anything. What if you commit to not checking your phone for the entire 24 hours? How can you make yourself stick to it? 

Can you think of any specific actions you could take to make this waiting period feel more real? For example, could you turn off notifications, or set your phone to "do not disturb" mode? Could you find a way to occupy yourself during this time, like reading a book, taking a walk, or doing a quiet activity? 

Let's break down the first step into smaller, more manageable parts. How can you make this waiting period feel more concrete, so you can actually take it one step at a time?

Patient: Okay — I'm not sure I follow entirely, but here are a few concrete things I could actually try to make the 24 hours feel real (even if I doubt it'll fix anything):

- Put my phone in another room or a drawer and turn on Do Not Disturb, so it's out of sight.  
- Set a 24-hour timer or alarm labeled "No checking" and plan a small reward for when it ends (a coffee, a short walk).  
- Make a short schedule of distractions for the day: a 20–30 minute walk, 30 minutes of writing, a show episode, or a quick call with another friend — and actually set timers for those.  
- Leave a sticky note on the phone or by my door that says “Wait 24h” and, if I need it, tell one friend to check in with me after the day so I have a little accountability.  
- If I get the urge to check, do five slow breaths and then pick one distraction from the list.

I don’t know if this will stop me spiraling, but I can try one or two of these. Can we slow down and pick which two I should start with so I don’t sabotage it?

Therapist: You've got a solid list of concrete steps to make the 24-hour waiting period feel more real. Goal: Choose one or two small steps that feel achievable, and focus on making them happen. 

Let's take a closer look at the steps you've listed. Which ones resonate with you the most? Which ones feel like they might actually help you stick to the waiting period? 

Take your time, and let's narrow it down to just one or two small steps that you can realistically try. For example, you could try putting your phone in another room or a drawer, and setting a 24-hour timer labeled "No checking". Alternatively, you could try setting a short schedule of distractions for the day, and actually setting timers for those.

Which one or two small steps do you feel like you can commit to trying first? How can you make yourself feel more confident about following through with them?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try two things: put my phone in another room/do not disturb and set a 24‑hour timer labeled “No checking,” and actually schedule two short distractions (a 20–30 minute walk and 30 minutes of writing) with alarms. To make myself follow through I’ll put a sticky note on the drawer, set the timer now, and text one friend to check in after 24 hours so there’s some accountability. I’m still skeptical — how is this supposed to help the bigger stuckness? Can we slow down and map out exactly when I’ll do those distractions so I don’t bail?

Therapist: You're taking a thoughtful and concrete approach to tackling the waiting period. Goal: Focus on breaking down the waiting period into smaller, manageable chunks, and exploring how to maintain momentum. 

Let's take a closer look at your plan. You've got a good foundation established: putting your phone away, setting a timer, and scheduling distractions. Now, let's break down the walking and writing tasks into smaller, actionable steps. 

For the walking task, can you commit to doing at least one 20-minute walk within the next 12 hours? What time can you realistically aim for? For example, can you do a morning walk at 9 am, and another shorter walk in the afternoon at 3 pm? 

For the writing task, can you commit to doing at least 30 minutes of writing within the next 24 hours? What format will you use? Will it be a journal entry, a short story, or something else? Can you set a specific time and date for this task, such as "Write for 30 minutes at 8 pm tomorrow"? 

By breaking down these tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, can you create a sense of momentum and accountability? How can you make sure you're staying on track and following through on these commitments?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how exactly is this supposed to stop me from bailing? I guess what might actually help is making it as hard as possible to back out: put my shoes/notebook by the door now, set calendar events with loud alarms, turn the phone off and text a friend to check in at the walk time so someone's expecting me. Also promise myself a tiny, concrete reward after each task and, if I miss one, do a 5‑minute version right away instead of beating myself up — but honestly, I'm skeptical this won't just end up feeling like another thing I fail at.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that simply setting a plan isn't enough to overcome your self-doubt and tendency to bail. Goal: Introduce a small but significant act of commitment that makes it harder to back out. 

I like the way you're thinking about making it harder to back out. By taking concrete actions like putting your shoes and notebook by the door, setting calendar events with loud alarms, and texting a friend to check in, you're creating a sense of commitment and accountability. 

The addition of a tiny, concrete reward after each task is also a good idea. This will help you associate completing tasks with a sense of accomplishment and motivation. And by promising yourself a 5-minute "punishment" task if you miss one, you're giving yourself a chance to reflect on what went wrong and try to do better next time.

What's the smallest, most trivial reward you can think of that you'll give yourself after completing each task? For example, could it be as simple as taking a sip of water, or putting your feet up for a minute? 

Let's focus on making one small commitment that you can realistically follow through on. What's the one small step you can take right now to get started?

Patient: Okay — one small step I can take right now is to put my walking shoes and my notebook by the door, set a loud calendar alarm for the walk in 12 hours, and text a friend to check in afterward. I'll promise myself a cup of tea as a tiny reward if I actually go. I don't know if this will fix the bigger stuckness — how is moving shoes supposed to change anything? — so can we slow down and talk about what I do if I still bail so I don't spiral?

Therapist: You're taking a concrete action to commit to the walking task. Goal: Explore how to handle the inevitable temptation to bail, and develop a plan to maintain momentum.

Let's acknowledge that putting your shoes and notebook by the door might not magically change your stuckness, but it's a tangible step that can help you get moving. Now, let's talk about what to do if you still decide to bail.

What's the first thing that comes up when you think about not going for the walk? Is it anxiety, fear of failure, or something else? Once you're aware of the thought, what's the next step you take? Do you get caught up in self-doubt, or do you try to do something else to distract yourself?

Consider this: if you don't go for the walk, what's the smallest, most minor thing you can do to acknowledge that you're not going to go? Can you take a deep breath, acknowledge the thought, and then do something else to move forward? For example, could you make yourself a cup of coffee, or do a few stretching exercises?

By acknowledging the temptation to bail and developing a plan to handle it, you're creating a safety net to help you maintain momentum. Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to make progress, no matter how small.

What do you think? Is there something specific that you're afraid of doing if you go for the walk, or something that might make it more appealing? Let's explore those thoughts together.

Patient: Mostly I'm scared the walk will just let all the awful thoughts rush in and I'll spiral — and a dumb part of me worries someone will see me and judge my "failed" life. If I bail, the tiniest thing I can commit to is either a 5‑minute indoor walk or writing one sentence in the notebook and then making tea. I still don't see how that actually fixes the bigger stuckness, but okay — can we slow down and pick which fallback I should commit to right now so I have something concrete?

Therapist: Those are natural fears, especially when it comes to feeling vulnerable or exposed. It's understandable that you'd worry about being judged or judged by others.

I like that you've identified some small fallback options that might help you cope with the anxiety of going for the walk. The 5-minute indoor walk or writing one sentence in the notebook both seem like manageable ways to acknowledge the thought without giving in to it.

Let's take a closer look at each of those options and see which one might be a more concrete starting point for you.

The 5-minute indoor walk could be a way to physically take a step towards the walk, even if you don't feel like going for it. It might help you build momentum and remind yourself that you're capable of taking small actions.

Writing one sentence in the notebook is also a tangible way to acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in it. It might help you process your emotions and gain some clarity before deciding what to do next.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from committing to either of those options? Is it fear of the walk itself, or something else entirely?

Let's focus on making one small commitment that you can realistically follow through on. Which one of those options feels more manageable or appealing to you right now?

Patient: I think I’ll commit to writing one sentence in the notebook — feels safer than forcing myself outside where I’ll worry people are judging me. I’m scared it’ll just open the floodgates or feel pointless, so… how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and pick what I’ll write, then figure out exactly what I do next (and can you stay with me while I do it?)

Therapist: Writing one sentence in the notebook can be a gentle and low-stakes way to acknowledge your thoughts and emotions. I'm glad you're feeling more comfortable with that option.

Now, let's take a closer look at what you're going to write. It might seem simple, but the sentence can actually be a powerful tool for processing your emotions and gaining clarity.

Instead of writing something abstract or generic, why not write something specific and concrete about what's been going on lately? It could be something as simple as: "I've been feeling overwhelmed with work lately" or "I had a difficult conversation with someone yesterday." Try to capture the essence of what's been bothering you in just one sentence.

Once you've written your sentence, we can talk about what to do next. You mentioned you're scared it'll just open the floodgates or feel pointless. Let's explore those fears together. What is it about the sentence that's making you feel that way?

And yes, I'll stay with you throughout this process. I'll offer support, guidance, and just be a listening presence as you work through this.

Are you ready to write your sentence now? I'll be right here with you.

Patient: Okay — I’ll write: “I’m scared and tired of feeling stuck, but I’m trying to do one small thing today.” I’m going to write it now, but stay with me — I already feel weird doing this and I’m thinking, how is that supposed to help beyond ticking a box? After I write it, can we slow down and decide the very next tiny thing I do so I don’t just sit there?

Therapist: Writing that sentence takes a lot of courage. I'm impressed that you're willing to put yourself through this process.

It's completely normal to feel weird or unsure about doing this exercise, especially if you're not used to talking to yourself or acknowledging your emotions in this way. The goal isn't to help you magically overcome your feelings of stuckness, but rather to help you develop a greater awareness of your thoughts and emotions.

By acknowledging your feelings of stuckness and your willingness to do something about it, you're already taking a small step towards creating change. That in itself is something to be proud of.

Now, let's take a deep breath and focus on the next tiny thing you can do. Remember, we're aiming for something super small and manageable. You've already done one small thing by writing that sentence. What's the next tiny thing you can do to move forward?

Can you think of something ridiculously small that you can do right now? Maybe it's taking one deep breath, or getting up from the chair to stretch your legs. Something tiny that gets you moving without feeling overwhelmed.

Let's slow down and explore what that next tiny thing could be. What's the smallest, most manageable action you can take right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is taking one tiny action supposed to help with all this? Okay, maybe the smallest thing I can actually do right now is take one slow, deep breath, stand up, and make that cup of tea I promised myself. Can you stay with me while I do it? I already feel weird about moving and need you to slow down.

Therapist: It's normal to feel unsure about how taking one small action will help with everything. The goal isn't to solve all your problems or feel better immediately. It's simply to acknowledge that you're feeling stuck and take one small step towards acknowledging that feeling.

Now, let's focus on that one small action you've identified: making a cup of tea. I'm here to support you as you do it. I'll walk you through each step, and we'll take it one tiny action at a time.

As you get up from the chair, I want you to take your time. Don't rush. Just move at your own pace. Take one slow step towards the kitchen, and then come back to me. We'll talk about what's next before you do anything else.

As you stand up, notice how your body feels. Are there any physical sensations that might be distracting you? Do you feel any tension in your muscles? Just acknowledge them for now, without trying to do anything about them.

You've promised yourself a cup of tea, and that's something concrete to focus on. Let's make it happen one step at a time. What do you need to do to make that cup of tea right now?

Patient: I need to stand up, walk to the kitchen, fill the kettle, grab a mug and a tea bag — but my chest is tight and I already feel silly about it.
