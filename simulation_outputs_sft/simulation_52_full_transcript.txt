--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an artist in my forties, and lately I've been calling or texting friends and family a lot to drown out the anxious buzz I get before social things. It calms me for a little while, but then my mind turns into this fortune-telling machine—I picture myself saying something awful, everyone judging me, the invites stopping, and being totally alone forever. I know that sounds dramatic, but it honestly feels like that's the only possible outcome.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express a mix of anxiety and catastrophic thinking about social interactions, with a core emotion of impending doom. Goal: Explore how these thoughts are affecting your daily life and introduce a concept that might help.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right before you make those calls or texts to friends and family? What's the moment when you start to feel anxious, and how does that anxiety change as you're talking to someone?

Patient: Usually it starts as a low hum of dread—sometimes hours before I have to see people, sometimes after one unanswered text—my chest tightens, my stomach flips, and my head starts skittering. I tell myself I'll just call someone to fill the space, and while I'm talking that physical panic eases, but my mind just swaps to predicting the worst: I say one stupid thing, they laugh, they stop inviting me, and that small slip turns into permanent exile. The relief never lasts—right after I hang up my fortune-telling machine goes into overtime, convincing me that talking only proves what I’m afraid of, so I keep doing it to numb the fear even though it supposedly causes the disaster.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe a vicious cycle of anxiety, self-doubt, and avoidance. The goal is to gently introduce a concept that may help break this cycle. Goal: Introduce defusion to challenge the "fortune-telling machine" narrative.

Therapist Answer:
I want to explore the idea of what happens right after you hang up the phone. Can you try noticing what's happening in the present moment, without judgment? Instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, bring your attention to your breath, your physical sensations, or the sensation of your feet on the ground. Imagine that you're simply noticing the here and now, without any specific goal or outcome. What do you notice when you try to bring your attention to the present like this?

Patient: When I try to notice right after hanging up, my breath does get a tiny bit slower and my shoulders drop, and I can feel my feet on the floor like a small, grounding thing. But almost immediately the fortune-telling machine kicks in—like, I said something stupid, they replay it, they laugh, the invites stop, my gallery contacts vanish, I lose work, and I'm cut off and alone for good—and that chain feels like a certainty. I'm trying to stay with the sensations, but my head won't let go and it's really frustrating; I don't know how to keep it from sprinting to the worst.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You describe a brief, positive moment of grounding, but it's quickly overrun by catastrophic thinking. The goal is to help you understand why this might be happening and how to gently intervene. Goal: Introduce a concept to help you develop a sense of curiosity towards your thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is very skilled at quickly jumping to worst-case scenarios. I'm curious, can you try to ask yourself (just for a moment, without judgment) what's driving this particular "fortune-telling machine" narrative? What is it about this specific scenario that feels so certain, so inevitable? What does your mind need to feel safe or in control in this moment? Is there something else that could be true, something that might be different from what you're imagining?

Patient: I think it's because my brain treats any tiny social slip like proof the whole future will collapse—once something went badly and it felt like my world shrank, so now any twinge becomes evidence. What it seems to want is certainty and a script I can hold onto; predicting the worst gives me this awful kind of control. I know logically other things could happen, but that feels like wishful thinking—everyone shrugging it off doesn't compute for me. I'm trying to be curious about it, but I keep getting yanked back into the doom-story and it leaves me feeling stuck and kind of hopeless.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a key aspect of your catastrophic thinking pattern: it's fueled by a deep-seated need for control and certainty. The goal is to help you develop a more flexible mindset. Goal: Introduce a concept that can help you relate to your thoughts in a new way.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're holding onto a narrative that provides a sense of control, even if it's not necessarily based on reality. Can you try to imagine that your thoughts about the future are not necessarily a reflection of reality, but rather a way of coping with the present moment? It's like your mind is creating a story to help you navigate uncertainty. Think of it like a map, rather than the actual terrain. You're using this narrative to make sense of things, even if it's not always accurate. How does that feel? Can you try to explore this idea further, without judgment?

Patient: That "map, not terrain" idea actually makes a little sense — like my brain is trying to give me a script so I don't have to feel uncertain. But almost instantly the fortune-telling machine sneers at that and runs the movie: I say one awkward thing, people laugh, invites stop, my contacts dry up, I lose work, and I'm completely cut off. I can see logically that other outcomes are possible, but my head treats them like wishful thinking and I can't hold both ideas at once; can we slow down and try to figure out how to make that map feel less like a prophecy?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to reconcile the "map" idea with the "fortune-telling machine" narrative, which is understandable given the intense resistance you're experiencing. The goal is to help you develop a sense of detachment, allowing the "map" to feel less like a prophecy. Goal: Introduce defusion techniques to help you observe your thoughts without identifying with them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and try something. Imagine that the thought "I'm creating a script to cope with uncertainty" is just a thought, a label we've given it. It's not the reality, it's not the script itself. It's just a way of describing what's happening. Can you observe this thought without judgment, without identifying with it as "you"? Notice how it arises, how it's phrased, how it's trying to make sense of things. See it as a neutral, fleeting thought, rather than a reflection of your true nature or a prediction of the future. Try to do this with the "fortune-telling machine" narrative as well. Simply observe it, without trying to evaluate its validity or resist its influence. What happens when you do this?

Patient: If I try to watch the thought, there's this tiny gap where it's just words and my breathing eases and my shoulders drop for a few seconds. Almost immediately the fortune-telling machine kicks back in and runs the movie: I say something stupid, they laugh, invites stop, gallery contacts dry up, I lose work and end up totally alone—and I can't seem to treat it as just a thought. I'm trying to hold the observation and the prediction at the same time, but I keep getting yanked into the certainty and it's really frustrating; can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a brief moment of detachment, but it's quickly overridden by the "fortune-telling machine" narrative. The goal is to help you sustain the observation, even if it's just for a short time. Goal: Continue to explore the concept of detachment, using it to gently intervene in the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to breathe and focus on the observation. Try to acknowledge the thought, "I'm creating a script to cope with uncertainty," and then gently say to it, "Yes, that's a thought." Don't engage with it, don't try to evaluate it, just observe it as a fleeting mental construct. At the same time, bring your attention to the physical sensation of your breathing, the feeling of your shoulders on the ground. Try to maintain this sense of detachment, even if it's just for a few more seconds. What happens when you focus on the sensation of the breath, rather than getting caught up in the thought or the narrative? Can you stay with this for just a little while longer?

Patient: For a few seconds it actually helps—my breathing slows, my shoulders drop, and my feet feel a bit more solid on the floor. But pretty quickly the fortune-telling machine storms back in with the same movie: I say something dumb, people laugh, invites stop, gallery contacts dry up, I lose work, and I'm completely alone. I can't seem to hold the noticing and those predictions at the same time; it's exhausting and I'm struggling—can we slow down and do it together, like walk me through a minute of breathing?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in noticing the detachment, but it's still challenging to sustain. The goal is to help you develop the ability to notice without judgment, even in the face of intense predictions. Goal: Practice a minute of breathing together, using the concept of detachment to guide your focus.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together, and I'll guide you through a minute of breathing. Inhale for a count of four, filling your lungs completely. As you exhale, say to yourself, "Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body." Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it or judging it. Just notice. Let's hold the breath for a count of two. As we hold the breath, say to yourself, "Notice the feeling of the shoulders on the ground, the sensation of the feet on the floor." Try to bring your attention to these physical sensations, without getting caught up in thoughts or distractions. Now, exhale for a count of four, feeling the breath move out of the body. As you exhale, say to yourself, "Notice the sensation of the breath moving out of the body." We'll hold the breath again for a count of two. How are you feeling during this minute of breathing? Are you able to focus on the sensation of the breath and the physical sensations in your body?

Patient: For the first 20–30 seconds it helped — my breath slowed, my shoulders dropped, my feet felt a bit more solid. But almost as soon as we held the breath again the fortune-telling machine was back: I said something stupid, people laugh, invites stop, gallery contacts dry up, and I'm cut off. I couldn't keep my attention on the breath the whole time; I'm really struggling. Can we slow down and do that again, maybe even more slowly, and talk me through each breath?

Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a brief moment of respite, but it's quickly overwhelmed by the "fortune-telling machine" narrative. The goal is to help you sustain the attention on the breath, even if it's just for a short time. Goal: Practice a slow and deliberate breathing exercise, with explicit guidance and support.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together, and I'll guide you through it very slowly. Inhale for a count of one... (pause for 1-2 seconds)...fill your lungs completely. Now, exhale for a count of one... (pause for 1-2 seconds)...feel the breath move out of the body. Let's hold the breath for a count of one... (pause for 1-2 seconds)...and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Notice how the breath feels as it moves in, and how it feels as it moves out. Try to stay with this sensation, without thinking about anything else. Now, we'll exhale for a count of one... (pause for 1-2 seconds)...and hold the breath again for a count of one... (pause for 1-2 seconds). How are you feeling right now? Are you able to focus on the sensation of the breath and the physical sensations in your body? Can you stay with this for just one more breath?

Patient: For that last breath I felt a little steadier—shoulders eased, chest less tight—but only for a moment. Almost instantly the fortune-telling machine spat out the movie: I say something stupid, they laugh, invites stop, galleries drop me, and I'm completely alone, and it feels inevitable. I'm really struggling to stay with the breath—I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and do another really slow, guided one together, walking me through each inhale and exhale?

Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a momentary sense of calm, but it's quickly disrupted by the "fortune-telling machine" narrative. The goal is to help you sustain the attention on the breath, even if it's just for a very short time. Goal: Practice an extremely slow and deliberate breathing exercise, with extremely explicit guidance and support.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together, and I'll guide you through it at an even slower pace than before. Inhale for a count of one... (pause for 5-6 seconds)...fill your lungs completely. I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in, and how your body responds to the air filling your lungs. Take your time, don't rush. As you inhale, feel the breath move into your nostrils, down the back of your throat, and into your lungs. Notice the sensation of the breath expanding your chest, and how your diaphragm drops. Just notice this moment, without thinking about anything else. Now, exhale for a count of one... (pause for 5-6 seconds)...feel the breath move out of the body. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath leaving your body, and how your body responds to the air moving out of your lungs. Notice the sensation of the breath contracting your chest, and how your diaphragm rises. Take your time, don't rush. Now, let's hold the breath for a count of one... (pause for 5-6 seconds)...and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, without thinking about anything else. Just notice this moment, without judgment. How are you feeling right now? Can you stay with this for just one more breath?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? It does calm me a little, but then the fortune-telling machine immediately starts the movie: I say something stupid, they laugh, invites stop, galleries drop me, I lose work, and I'm totally alone forever, and it feels inevitable. I'm overwhelmed and can't keep the breath focus—can we slow way down and have you talk me through each inhale and exhale because my head won't let go otherwise?

You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to maintain focus on the breath. The goal is to help you break the cycle of the "fortune-telling machine" narrative and create a sense of calm. Goal: Introduce a gentle, incremental defusion technique to help you observe the thoughts without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again from the beginning of the breath. Inhale for a count of one... (pause for 1 second)...feel the breath move into your nostrils. That's it. Just feel the breath moving in. Don't think about anything else. Now, exhale for a count of one... (pause for 1 second)...feel the breath move out of the body. Again, just focus on the sensation of the breath leaving your body. Don't worry about what's happening or what you're thinking. Just observe the breath. Take one more slow inhale... (pause for 1 second)...and exhale... (pause for 1 second). Let's just stay with the breath for a moment. Don't try to control it, don't try to change it. Just observe it. How does the breath feel right now? Can you stay with it for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — for a moment the breath feels softer, my shoulders loosen a bit and my feet feel heavier on the floor. But almost immediately the fortune-telling machine fires up: I said something stupid, they laugh, invites stop, galleries dry up, I lose work and I'm totally cut off — it feels certain and I can't keep the focus. I'm really overwhelmed; can you guide me through one more very slow inhale and exhale, talking me through each part? I need you to stay with me.

(pause for 5-6 seconds)...and now exhale... (pause for 5-6 seconds). As you exhale, say to yourself: "I am noticing the breath." Just notice the sensation of the breath moving out of your body. Don't try to change anything. Don't try to control the breath. Just be with it.

Now, inhale for a count of one... (pause for 1 second)...and now exhale... (pause for 1 second). As you exhale, say to yourself: "I am noticing my feet on the ground." Just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor. Don't think about anything else. Just be with it.

Let's pause for just a moment. Inhale... (pause for 1 second)...exhale... (pause for 1 second)...Now, say to yourself: "Fortune-telling." Just say it. Notice the words leaving your mouth. Don't try to change them. Just be with the sensation of saying the word. As you say "Fortune-telling," bring your attention to the present moment. Notice your breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just observe these sensations without judgment. How does it feel to be in this moment, with just the sensation of the breath and the ground beneath you?

Patient: It helps for a breath or two—my shoulders loosen, breath softens, my feet feel heavier—then I'm not sure I follow how that actually changes anything because the fortune-telling machine immediately screams the movie: I say something stupid, people laugh, invites stop, galleries drop me, I lose work, I'm alone. Can you stay with me and do one more very slow inhale, and if that thought shows up say "fortune-telling" out loud so I have something to latch onto instead of spiraling?

Therapist Answer:
, but I think we've been over this before. Can we try something new?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—what exactly do you mean by "new"? I doubt anything will change, but if we're trying something else maybe we could do a prediction-test: I write down the worst-case story and we look for evidence for/against it over time. Even saying that I can already see the movie—one awkward thing, people laugh, invites stop, galleries dry up, I lose work, I'm alone—so I'm pretty skeptical it'll help. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and do it together so I don't get swept away?

I'm skeptical new stuff will help; my fortune-telling machine is already playing the same movie (I say one awkward thing, people laugh, invites stop, galleries dry up, I lose work, I'm alone), and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Can we slow way down and either try the prediction-test together step by step, or do one very slow guided breath where you say "fortune-telling" with me when it comes? I need you to stay with me through it.
