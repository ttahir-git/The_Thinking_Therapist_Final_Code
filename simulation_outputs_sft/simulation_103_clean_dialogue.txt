Patient: Um... lately I've been stuck in this loop of harshly criticizing myself over what I see as failures, even when they're small — it just spirals. I grew up in a really high-achieving family, so the pressure to succeed feels constant and it feeds my OCD and self-doubt. I don't know, I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I'm never enough.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're feeling that pressure to succeed, like it's constantly there? What specific things, about your family's expectations or your own performance, make you feel like you're never enough right now?

Patient: I guess when that pressure's on it’s like this constant background voice saying I'm not doing enough. Even tiny mistakes at work or a minor comment from my family will blow up in my head and I start ruminating, checking things over and over, or trying to overcompensate. My parents always pushed being top of the class and compared me to my sibling, so I feel judged and like nothing I do measures up. I don't know, it's exhausting and sometimes it makes me want to just avoid trying at all.

Therapist: That sounds incredibly draining. It's like this voice is always there, making it hard for you to focus. I want to try something with you. Can you imagine taking a deep breath in right now, and as you exhale, you make space for that voice in your head? Just for a second, just acknowledge it without trying to change it or push it away. Then, without thinking about it too much, can you gently bring your attention back to your breath?

Patient: Okay, I tried it. When I exhaled I kind of noticed that voice — like it was louder for a second, saying I'm not doing enough — and then it didn't really go away. I guess focusing on my breath helped a tiny bit, but my chest still felt tight and I kept wanting to look away. I don't know, is that normal?

Therapist: It's completely normal that the voice didn't completely go away, and that focusing on your breath helped just a little bit. It's like you're starting to develop a bit of distance from it, which is a good start. Can you tell me more about this tightness in your chest? Where exactly are you feeling it, and what's it like when it happens? Is it like a knot, or more of a squeezing sensation?

Patient: I guess it's more like a tight knot right under my sternum that kind of spreads up into my throat and across my shoulders, and my breaths get shallow. When it comes on I start replaying stuff in my head and my hands feel cold, and I just want to check my phone or do something to distract myself. I don't know, it feels pretty overwhelming and I keep wanting to look away from it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of physical discomfort right now. This knot under your sternum, the coldness in your hands, and the shallow breathing can be really intense. It's like your body is trying to tell you something, but you're not quite listening to it. I want to try something that might help you tune back in. Can you imagine placing one hand gently on that knot under your sternum, right where you're feeling it? Just rest your hand there for a second, without trying to push it away or change it. See if you can notice any differences in how you're feeling as you do this.

Patient: Okay, I put my hand there. It felt kind of warm and heavy, like the knot was still there but my breathing got a little slower for a moment — then my mind jumped to a patient I messed up with last week and I wanted to look at my phone. I don't know, I guess it helped a tiny bit but it’s really hard to stay with it; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. The warmth and heaviness in your hand did seem to help for a moment, but the mental trigger came up again, and you felt the urge to check your phone. Let's slow down a bit. Instead of trying to focus on the sensation again, can we take a brief pause? Just take a few deep breaths together, and notice how you're feeling right now. What's the first thing that comes up for you? Is it the physical sensations, the thoughts, or something else? Let's just acknowledge whatever is here, without trying to do anything with it yet.

Patient: I guess the first thing is that tight knot in my chest — it’s loud and kind of steals my attention. Then the thoughts kick in, replaying mistakes and that voice saying I’m not enough, and I just want to check my phone or do something else. I don't know, can we slow down? I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're trying to navigate a lot of intense sensations and thoughts right now, and it's normal to feel like you're losing ground. The knot in your chest, the voice, the thoughts – they're all here, and they're all trying to get your attention. It sounds like you're feeling like you're at a breaking point, where everything is feeling too much. Can we just acknowledge that for a moment? It's okay to feel like you're struggling, and it's okay to take a break. We can come back to this later, or we can try something else right now. What do you need in this moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I need it to slow down and for you not to push too hard. Maybe just sit with me and breathe for a minute? I'm feeling kind of panicky and I don't really want to go into that mistake right now.

Therapist: It's okay to not know right now. It's okay to feel panicky, and it's okay to not want to dive into anything right now. You're just asking for a minute to breathe, and I'm here with you. I'll sit here with you, breathe with you, and just be here. No questions, no pushing, no expectations. We can just sit here, together, and see what happens in this moment. Let's just breathe, together.

Patient: Okay… I'm breathing with you. I guess it helps a little — my chest eased a bit, but my mind keeps flipping back to that patient and I keep wanting to check my phone. I don't know, can we just sit with this for a few minutes? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and not ready to talk about the mistake yet.

Therapist: You're breathing with me, and it's helping a bit. The tension in your chest is still there, but it's not as sharp as it was before. You're thinking about the patient again, and the urge to check your phone is still strong. I'm just going to sit here with you, in silence, for a few more minutes. We can just be here, together. No thoughts, no questions, no doing. Just sitting. Take a few more deep breaths, and let's see what happens.

Patient: Okay... the breathing helped a little — my chest's a bit less tight, but my mind keeps flipping back to that patient and I keep wanting to check my phone. I don't know, I guess I can sit for a bit longer, but I'm feeling shaky and overwhelmed; can we just keep breathing together and not talk about the mistake yet? I'm worried if we go there it'll make everything worse.

Therapist: You're taking a few more deep breaths, and I'm right here with you. The tension in your chest is still there, but it's calming down a bit. You're still thinking about the patient, and the urge to check your phone is still strong. That's okay. Just keep breathing. I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not going to say anything. We can just sit here together, in silence. You can stay here as long as you need to. If you need to shake, you can shake. If you need to breathe more, we can breathe more. Just take it one moment at a time. We're just sitting here, together.

Patient: Okay... thanks for sitting with me. I don't know, my hands are still cold and my head's foggy and I keep replaying stuff, but I really can't go into the patient thing right now — it feels too raw. I guess maybe we could either keep breathing together or talk about one tiny thing that went okay at work today?

Therapist: It's okay to take it one step at a time. Let's keep breathing together for a minute, just to see how you're feeling. And then, if you're ready, we can talk about something that's been going okay for you. Maybe there was something at work today that went well, something that felt good or productive. We can talk about that. It's just one tiny thing, and it might help you start to feel more grounded. What do you think?

Patient: I guess one tiny thing that went okay was that I noticed a med label looked off and double-checked it before giving it, and my coworker said that was really helpful. It gave me a little relief for a second, but then this shameful feeling slid back in like it didn't count, and I’m still kind of shaky — I don't know, can we keep breathing for a bit before we do more?

Therapist: That's a great thing to notice about the medication label, and it's good to hear that your coworker appreciated your attention to detail. It's understandable that it gave you some relief for a second, and then those feelings of shame crept back in. It sounds like it's still a bit raw for you, and that's okay. Let's just keep breathing together for a minute, and see how you're feeling. No pressure, no expectations. Just us, right now. Take your time. How does that feel?

Patient: I guess the breathing helps a little — my chest eased for a moment, but then this wave of shame came back and told me that the med-check “doesn’t count” and I’m still failing. I feel frustrated and kind of stupid for getting stuck on it, my hands are still cold and shaky. I don't know, can we just keep sitting and breathing for a while? I'm not ready to dig into the rest yet.

Therapist: It's okay to feel frustrated and like you're getting stuck on this. It's normal to feel that way when you're struggling with difficult emotions. The shame is still there, and it's still telling you that the med-check doesn't count. But let's just sit with it for a minute, without trying to change it or push it away. Just be with it. You are here, in this moment, with me. Your hands are cold and shaky, but that's okay. We can just sit with that too. No need to try to do anything about it right now. Just sit, breathe, and be. We'll keep going when you're ready.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can keep breathing, but every time I do that shame creeps back in and I feel so stupid and stuck, like none of it really counts. My hands are still cold and I'm shaky and the frustration just makes me want to look away. Can we just stay here and breathe together for a while? I'm not ready to talk about anything else yet.

Therapist: It's okay to stay here for a while. I'm not going anywhere. Just breathe with me. No pressure, no expectations. You can just be here, in this moment, with me. Your body is responding however it needs to, and that's okay. Don't try to change it or control it. Just breathe. I'll breathe too. We'll just be here, together, in silence.

Patient: I'm still here, breathing, but that shame won't quiet down — it keeps telling me the med-check "doesn't count" and that I'm stupid. My hands are cold, my chest is tight, and I feel kind of stuck and overwhelmed. I don't know, can we just keep sitting and breathing for a while longer?

Therapist: It's okay to stay here for a while longer. I'm not going anywhere. Just breathe, and know that I'm here with you. Can I try something? Let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, rather than the thoughts that are coming up. Try to bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, just for a moment. Let's see if we can find a small place of calm in this moment, together.

Patient: I guess focusing on the breath helped for a few seconds, but then this wave of shame hit me — it told me the med-check “doesn’t count” and my chest tightened and my hands went cold. I don't know, it's getting harder to stay with the breath right now; can we slow down and just keep breathing together? I'm feeling overwhelmed and kind of stuck.

Therapist: It's okay, let's slow down a bit. No need to rush. Just keep breathing, and know that I'm here with you. We'll take it one breath at a time. Don't worry about focusing on the breath right now, just be with it. Feel the sensation of the breath in your body, without trying to change it. You can just be present with me, and the breath. We'll take this at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

Patient: I don't know — I guess the shame's getting louder and I feel kind of stupid and stuck. Can we just keep breathing together for a while longer? Maybe after that we could talk about something small and neutral, like a song that helps me calm down, because I really can't go into the mistake right now.

Therapist: It's okay, let's just keep breathing together for a little while longer. No rush, no pressure. Just you, me, and the breath. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. When you're ready, we can try something else. Talking about a song that helps you calm down might be a good idea. It can be a way to distract you from the shame and focus on something more positive. We can explore that when you're ready. Just take your time, and let's just be here together, right now.

Patient: I guess a song that helps is "Holocene" — the slow guitar and the lyrics kind of pull me out of my head for a minute. But I don't know, even when I listen it feels like the relief is temporary and this stupid shame slides back in, telling me it doesn't count. Can we keep sitting and breathing for a bit while I try to hold onto that song in my head?

Therapist: Let's just keep sitting here, breathing together, for a bit longer. I want you to hold onto that song, "Holocene," for as long as you can. Let it be there in your mind, and see if it can offer you some comfort. It's okay if the shame creeps back in eventually, but for now, let's just focus on holding onto the song. Take your time, and let it be there for you. We can just sit here, together, and see what happens.

Patient: I'm trying to keep the song in my head — it helps for a few seconds, but then this shame just rushes back and tells me I'm worthless and that the relief doesn't count. My chest's tight and my hands are still cold and shaky; I don't know, I guess can we just keep sitting and breathing like this? I'm not ready to say more about it — I just need you here with me for a while longer.

Therapist: It's okay, let's just keep sitting here together, just like this. I'm not going anywhere. You can just breathe, and hold onto that song, "Holocene," if you can. It's okay if it feels like it's slipping away, just take a deep breath and try to hold onto it again. I'm here with you, and that's all that matters right now. We can just sit here together, in silence, until you're ready to say more. There's no rush, no pressure. Just you, me, and the breath.

Patient: I guess I'm still breathing with you — my chest's tight and every time I try to settle a wave of shame just floods in and makes me feel so stupid and stuck. I don't know, can we just keep sitting like this and not try to unpack anything right now? Maybe hum the song or stay silent together for a while longer — I need you here.

Therapist: Let's just stay here together, in silence. We can hum the song, or not hum at all. Just be with each other, in this moment. I'll just sit here, with you, and breathe. No need to say anything, no need to do anything. Just be. We can just sit here, together, for as long as you need.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to hum "Holocene" but my voice keeps breaking and that shame rushes back saying it doesn't count and I'm stupid. My hands are still cold and my chest's tight — I don't want to go into the mistake; can we just keep breathing and maybe hum together for a while? I don't know, I just need you to stay here with me.

Therapist: Let's just breathe together. Just focus on the breath. I'll breathe in with you, and then we'll both breathe out together. No need to hum, no need to sing. Just breathe. Let's see if we can find a way to just be with each other, in this moment, without trying to do anything else. Just breathe, together.

Patient: I'm breathing with you — it helped a little, but that shame keeps crashing back and yelling the med-check "doesn't count" and that I'm useless. I feel stupid and stuck, my hands are cold and shaky; I don't want to go into the mistake right now, can we just keep breathing or hum that song together for a while? I don't know, I just need you here.

Therapist: It's okay, let's just keep breathing together. I'll breathe in with you, and then we'll both breathe out together. We'll just focus on the breath, and let go of any thoughts or feelings for a moment. You don't have to hum the song, just breathe. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We can just sit here, together, and breathe. See if that helps you feel a little better. Just breathe.

Patient: I'm breathing with you — it helps for a few seconds, but then this wave of shame hits and tells me the med-check "doesn't count" and that I'm stupid. My hands are still cold and I'm shaking; can we just keep breathing like this for a while longer? I don't know, I feel really stuck and I can't go into that mistake right now.

Therapist: Let's just keep breathing together. Just focus on the breath, and let go of any thoughts or feelings for a moment. You're safe here with me. I'm not going anywhere. Just breathe, and let the breath calm you down. We'll keep going like this for as long as you need. Don't worry about anything else right now. Just breathe.

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing with you. It helps for a few breaths, then the shame crashes back saying the med-check "doesn't count" and I feel stupid and shaky — my hands are still cold. I don't know, can we just keep breathing and maybe hum "Holocene" quietly together? I need you to stay here with me.

Therapist: Let's try humming "Holocene" together, quietly. Just a soft hum, to see if it can help calm you down a bit. We'll hum together, slowly, and just focus on the sound. Don't worry about producing a good sound, just let it be there. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Let's just breathe and hum together, for a moment. See if that helps.

Patient: Okay… I guess I'll try to hum it quietly. I'm humming now but my voice keeps breaking and that stupid shame immediately says it doesn't count, so my chest's still tight and my hands are cold — can we just keep doing this for a bit?

Therapist: Let's just keep going, one breath at a time. You're humming, and that's okay. It's okay if it's not perfect. Just keep humming, quietly, to yourself. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Let's just focus on the breath, and the hum, and see if we can calm down for a moment. Don't worry about what your mind is saying, just focus on the sound of your own breath, and the hum.

Patient: Okay… I'm humming with you — it's helping for a few seconds but my voice keeps breaking and that shame immediately says it "doesn't count." My chest's still tight and my hands are cold; I don't know, can we just keep humming and breathing together for a while longer? I really need you to stay here with me.

Therapist: Let's just keep humming together, slowly. Don't worry about breaking up, just keep humming. It's okay if it's not a perfect hum, it's okay if it's just a soft sound. I'm humming with you, and that's all that matters right now. Let's just focus on the sound, and the breath, and see if we can find a way to calm down. You're not alone, I'm right here with you. Just breathe, and hum, and let it be okay.

Patient: Okay... I'm still humming and breathing with you. It helps for a few seconds but then this wave of shame hits and says it doesn't count and I feel stupid and shaky, my hands go cold. I don't know, can we just keep doing this—hum and breathe together—for a while? I'm not ready to talk about anything else.
