Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless—like nothing matters to me beyond being a data scientist. My mind's this fortune-telling machine that immediately predicts the worst: I'll burn out, make one mistake, get fired, and end up drifting alone, and that outcome feels inevitable. I know it sounds dramatic, but that's literally how my head works and it's wearing me down.

Therapist: Those predictions about burning out and feeling alone sound incredibly painful. Can you tell me more about what happens right now, in this moment, when that worst-case scenario starts playing out in your mind? What's the first thing you notice, the first thought that comes up, when you start imagining yourself in that situation?

Patient: The first thing I notice is my chest tightening and this flash thought: "You screwed up." Then my head immediately stitches that into a sequence—they’ll notice, the project will collapse, I'll be blamed, HR will start the paperwork, and I'm out on the street alone. I know that sounds extreme, but any calmer ending feels unrealistic to me—my brain just picks the disaster and runs with it.

Therapist: Can you make space to just observe the thought "You screwed up" without judgment for a moment? What happens when you allow yourself to hold that thought without immediately adding the rest of the narrative? For example, how does it feel when you're just with that one thought, without the story that unfolds afterward?

Patient: When I try to hold just "You screwed up," my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow—it's like the thought can't stay alone, so my brain immediately fills in the rest: the boss's email, the project crashing, HR, me out on the street. If I try to stay with only that thought it just amplifies until I'm absolutely certain that's what's going to happen; anything calmer feels unrealistic.

Therapist: It sounds like the way your mind works is to avoid the uncertainty of a single, potentially negative thought. Instead, you get to have a more certain, though perhaps more extreme, narrative. Can you think of a time when you did have a more certain, though potentially less fulfilling, sense of control or emotional stability? Maybe it's related to your career as a data scientist, where you had a clear set of tasks and outcomes, but perhaps not necessarily a sense of personal fulfillment?

Patient: Yeah—there was a stretch a few years ago at a smaller firm where my role was basically predictable: scheduled ETL jobs, clear tickets, metrics to hit every week. It felt boring but safe—you knew what to do, you could plan your day, and that steadiness made anxiety manageable even if it didn't feel meaningful. But even when I think about returning to something like that, my mind immediately says I'll miss a deadline once, the pipeline breaks, my manager notices, and that safe-sounding option collapses into the same nightmare of being exposed and fired—so I can't even see it as a real solution.

Therapist: It seems like the fear of losing control and stability is still a dominant theme in your mind. When you consider a role like the one at the smaller firm, you initially see it as safe and predictable, but then your mind immediately kicks in and predicts a worst-case scenario. Can you think of what specifically is making it so hard for you to let go of the idea that this safety net will collapse, even though you're aware of the potential pitfalls? Is there something deeper at play, perhaps a fear of being in a position where you don't have the same level of control over your life or career?

Patient: I think it comes down to shame and control—I tie so much of who I am to being competent at work, so the idea of one mistake threatens my whole identity. As soon as I imagine that slip, my brain stitches a chain—boss notices, word spreads, I'm blamed, I can't recover, people stop relying on me, relationships fray, and I'm left with nothing—and any calmer ending just feels like wishful thinking, not realistic.

Therapist: The shame and identity tied to professional competence is a significant factor in this. Can you think of a time when you did make a mistake at work, but it didn't lead to the catastrophic outcome you imagined? Perhaps there was a learning opportunity, support from your team or manager, or a chance to recover and grow from it? What would it take for you to consider that same mistake happening again without the same level of catastrophic thinking?

Patient: Yeah—once I pushed a bad SQL change that nuked a table and the pipeline failed. We caught it, restored from backup, my manager was fine about it, we added tests and a rollback, and nothing catastrophic happened. Still, my head insists that was a fluke—next time it'll be the one that cascades, people will lose trust, and I'm out. For me to buy a less catastrophic story I'd need repeated, clear evidence: a few more harmless screw-ups that really stay harmless, explicit written assurances or safety nets (like mandatory code reviews/rollback systems), and even then I keep thinking that's just stacking the dice—so I don't trust it.

Therapist: Can you imagine a scenario where you do make a mistake, but instead of catastrophic thinking, you focus on what you can learn from it and how you can improve? What would it take for you to shift from thinking "this will definitely lead to disaster" to "I'll make a mistake, but I'll learn from it and become a better data scientist"? Let's explore what small steps you could take to start building that mindset.

Patient: I don't really buy the "learn and improve" story—my brain insists one time it'll cascade and I'll be exposed. In theory, small steps might look like: deliberately doing low-stakes experiments, keeping a file of every mistake that didn't ruin anything, pushing for mandatory code reviews/rollbacks, scheduling regular feedback so issues surface early, and practicing noticing the prediction without acting on it. But honestly, that all feels like arranging the perfect trap for the one time things go wrong, so even these steps feel pointless to me.

Therapist: Let's focus on the present moment, rather than the hypothetical future. Can you commit to just one small action right now, without thinking about the potential outcomes or the "what ifs"? Just one thing, like noticing your thoughts when you think about a potential mistake, or taking one deep breath before checking your email. What would it take for you to start with just this one small action, and then see where it goes?

Patient: Okay—I can try one small thing: take one slow, deliberate breath before I open my email. When I do that my chest might loosen for a second, but honestly my brain will still be drafting the disaster script before I finish inhaling—so I'm skeptical this will change much. I'll try it now and tell you what I notice, but I don't know if it'll stick.

Therapist: Take a slow, deliberate breath right now, and as you exhale, allow your attention to gently settle on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sound of your breath, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath entering your body. Try to let go of any thoughts or worries about the email or the potential outcome, just for a moment. What happens when you bring your attention to the breath?

Patient: I did it — for a second my shoulders eased and I could feel the air at my nostrils and my feet on the floor. But almost immediately the "You screwed up" thought was back and the rest of the disaster movie kicked in: boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street — all in a flash, way faster than the breath. The breath gives a tiny, very short pause, but I'm frustrated because it feels like a bandaid on a bigger, inevitable problem rather than anything that actually changes the prediction. I noticed it, though, and that second of looseness was...something, even if I don't trust it'll stick.

Therapist: Can you try to observe what just happened a little more closely? What was it about the second of looseness that felt...different? Was it the physical sensation in your body, the mental quietness, or something else? Try to identify what exactly happened in that brief moment, and see if you can use that as a starting point for exploring what might be possible.

Patient: It was a tiny gap — my shoulders loosened, my jaw unclenched, and there was a brief drop in the internal chatter, like the fortune-teller's tape skipped for half a second. For that half-second I actually felt mildly curious instead of terrified, which was freaky. But almost instantly the tape rewound and the disaster story booted back up, and I don't see how that tiny glitch could ever actually change the overall program — it feels like a fluke, not something I can rely on. I don't know how to take that second and make it stick; what would I even practice to extend it without just setting myself up for the next inevitable collapse?

Therapist: Can you try to hold onto that feeling of mild curiosity for just a fraction of a second longer? What would it take for you to stay with that sensation for a moment longer, rather than allowing the disaster script to kick back in? Perhaps you could focus on just one aspect of the curiosity, like the sensation of your shoulders relaxing or the quietness in your mind. What if you practiced just holding onto that single sensation, without trying to analyze or change it? Would that be enough to create a small foundation for further exploration?

Patient: I tried—if I focus on my shoulders relaxing I can stretch that curiosity maybe a second longer, but it feels like I'm holding it with tongs; the moment I try to keep it my brain fires up the disaster tape. To actually make it stick would probably need a clear, repeatable cue—a physical anchor plus a short phrase like "that's a prediction, not a fact" practiced until it's automatic—but honestly that sounds like trying to rewire hardware with duct tape. Can we try an exercise now where you cue me and I practice labeling the thought? I'm skeptical, but I want to see if it does anything.

Therapist: I'd like you to notice when you think the disaster story, and when you think something else. When you notice the disaster story, I want you to say out loud, "Disaster prediction." When you notice something else, I want you to say out loud, "Not a disaster prediction." Can you do that for me right now? Let's start with a simple observation exercise. Just focus on noticing what's going on in your mind, without trying to analyze or change it. When you're ready, say "Disaster prediction" whenever you think that, and "Not a disaster prediction" whenever you think something else. Go ahead and start now.

Patient: Okay — I tried it. Disaster prediction. (Chest tightened, head immediately listing the cascade.) Not a disaster prediction — for a hair of a second I noticed the gap and felt a little curious. Disaster prediction — it came back faster and louder. I don't love how forced it feels, but the labeling did slow the tape down a fraction; can we do that again with you cueing me? I’m skeptical it’ll stick, but I’ll keep trying.

Therapist: Let's try again. Before we start, I want to acknowledge that the labeling may feel forced, and that's okay. It's a new habit we're trying to build, and it's normal to feel awkward at first. I'll cue you to label the thoughts, and then you can tell me what's happening in your mind. When you notice the disaster story, say "Disaster prediction." When you notice something else, say "Not a disaster prediction." Just focus on the process, and don't worry too much about the outcome. Ready? Here we go: I've got a little thought in my mind, just a random thing. Go ahead and label it. What's happening?

Patient: Disaster prediction — chest tightened, the thought "You screwed up" popped up and my brain instantly ran the whole sequence: boss's email, the pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street. Not a disaster prediction — for a split second after saying the label I felt that tiny curious gap again, but it vanished as soon as I tried to hold it. Can we do another round with you cueing me? I'm skeptical, but I'm willing to keep trying.

Therapist: Let's try again. I'm going to give you a slightly different cue this time. Instead of a specific thought, I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath. Just pay attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze or change it. When you notice a thought, say "Disaster prediction." If you notice a curious gap or any other sensation, say "Not a disaster prediction." Just observe and label. Ready? Take a deep breath and notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. What happens?

Patient: I took the breath — felt the air at my nostrils, my shoulders loosened a bit. Then the "You screwed up" thought slammed back in, so I said "Disaster prediction" and my chest tightened while the whole catastrophe movie started. Saying "Not a disaster prediction" caught a tiny flicker of curiosity for a split second, but it collapsed as soon as I tried to hold it. I'm skeptical this will ever stick, but I'm willing to keep repeating it if you cue me — maybe with a physical anchor (like pressing my thumb and saying the label) so it feels less like duct-taping my brain.

Therapist: Let's try again, using a physical anchor this time. I want you to press your thumb against your index finger, just lightly, and then say "Disaster prediction." As soon as you say the label, take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. If you notice a thought, say "Disaster prediction." If you notice a curious gap or any other sensation, say "Not a disaster prediction." Just focus on the physical sensation of the breath and the physical anchor. Ready? Press your thumb and say "Disaster prediction." What happens?

Patient: I pressed my thumb and said "Disaster prediction." My chest tightened and the "You screwed up" thought exploded into the whole movie—boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street—before I even finished the breath. I caught one tiny "Not a disaster prediction" glimpse of curiosity, but my attention's jumpy and it vanished right away. I'm pretty anxious and distracted now—can we keep doing this with you cueing me? I'm skeptical it will stick, but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's try to ground ourselves in the present moment. I want you to bring your attention back to your breath, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your thumb and index finger touching, the pressure of your thumb on your finger. Just focus on this physical sensation, without trying to think about the exercise or the thoughts. Take a slow, deep breath, feeling the breath fill your lungs, and then slowly exhale. As you exhale, say "Let go" to yourself, and try to release any tension or anxiety. What happens when you focus on the breath and the physical sensation?

Patient: When I focus on the breath and the thumb pressure there’s a tiny drop in tension — shoulders loosen, I actually get "Let go" out once — but it’s like a hiccup. Almost immediately the tape screams "You screwed up" and the whole cascade fires: boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street — way faster than I can finish the exhale. My heart’s racing now and my attention keeps snapping back to the disaster; I’m irritated and distracted, but I’ll keep trying if you cue me or we try a stronger anchor because I don’t see this tiny pause changing the inevitable on its own.

Therapist: Let's try something different. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath, but this time, I want you to try to observe the thoughts as they arise, rather than trying to change them or react to them. Imagine that you're watching the thoughts on a screen, and you're not responsible for them. Just observe them, without judgment, without trying to analyze them. Say to yourself, "Thought, thought, thought," and then let it go. Focus on the breath, the sensation of the thumb on your finger, and the physical sensations in your body. When you notice the catastrophic thinking, say "Thought, thought, thought" again, and try to let it go. What happens when you focus on observing the thoughts, rather than trying to change them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is watching the thoughts on a screen supposed to stop them? I tried saying "Thought, thought, thought" while feeling the thumb and breath, and for a half-second there's a tiny gap, then the fortune-teller tape screams "You screwed up" and the whole cascade (boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street) is back before I finish the exhale. I'm anxious and distracted now, and it feels like observing is just letting the disaster movie run in a different seat; it doesn't change the prediction. Can you cue me through it again or give a stronger anchor? I'm skeptical, but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's try something different. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath, but this time, I want you to try to bring a sense of curiosity to the present moment. Imagine that you're exploring a new place, and you're not sure what you'll find. As you breathe in, ask yourself, "What's happening right now?" As you breathe out, ask yourself, "What's changing?" Try to approach the thoughts and sensations with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to change or avoid them. See if you can create a small space for curiosity to emerge. What happens when you bring curiosity to the present moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is curiosity supposed to help when my head immediately scripts the worst? I tried asking "What's happening right now?" with the breath and got a tiny flicker of curiosity, then the tape rebooted into "You screwed up"—boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street—faster than I can finish the question. I'm frustrated and jumpy; can you cue me through it or give a stronger anchor? I'll try, but I don't expect it to change the inevitable.

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the physical sensations, rather than the thoughts. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, the sensation of the thumb on your finger, and the sensations in your body. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your body. Try to focus on the physical sensations, without thinking about the thoughts or the catastrophic scenario. See if you can create a small space for just the physical sensations to exist. What happens when you focus on the physical sensations?

Patient: When I focus on the breath and the thumb pressure I do get a tiny drop in tension—shoulders loosen, jaw unclenches—but it's like a blink: the "You screwed up" thought slams back in and the whole catastrophe movie (boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street) is playing before I can even finish the exhale. My heart starts racing, my attention fragments, and any label or anchor only buys a micro-gap before the tape rewinds. I don't really see how just noticing sensations stops the tape—can you keep cueing me, or give a stronger anchor (like a firmer press plus a short phrase) and pace me through it? I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical it'll change the inevitable.

Therapist: Let's try to build on the physical sensations, using a firmer anchor and a short phrase. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath, the sensation of the thumb on your finger, and the sensations in your body. As you breathe in, press your thumb against your index finger with a bit more force, and say to yourself, "I am present." As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and say to yourself, "I am present." Try to focus on the physical sensations, without thinking about the thoughts or the catastrophic scenario. See if you can create a small space for just the physical sensations to exist. What happens when you focus on the physical sensations and say "I am present"?

Patient: I pressed my thumb harder and said "I am present" — there was a tiny loosening: shoulders dropped, jaw unclenched, breath fuller for maybe a second. Then the fortune-teller tape kicked in immediately: "You screwed up" and the whole cascade—boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street—and my chest tightened and breathing went shallow. I'm anxious, jumpy, and frustrated; it feels like a micro-pause that never sticks. I'll keep trying if you cue me more deliberately or give a stronger anchor, but I don't expect this to change the inevitable.

Therapist: Let's try something different. I want you to focus on the sensation of your body, rather than trying to control the thoughts. I want you to notice where you're feeling tension, where you're feeling relaxation. As you breathe in, bring your attention to your diaphragm, and imagine that you're expanding your body down towards your stomach. As you breathe out, imagine that you're releasing any tension or stress, and that you're letting go of any thoughts or worries. Try to focus on the sensation of your body, rather than trying to control the thoughts. See if you can create a small space for just the physical sensations to exist. What happens when you focus on the sensation of your body?

Patient: I tried that — breathing down into my diaphragm made my belly expand and for a beat my shoulders dropped and the tightness eased, like a small hollow opened up in my chest. But it only lasted a second before the tape screamed "You screwed up" and the whole chain fired: boss's email, the pipeline collapses, I'm blamed, HR gets involved, I'm out on the street and alone — everything, instantly. I'm frustrated and distracted now; it feels like these exercises buy a tiny pause but don't change the prediction, so I don't see how they help—can you cue me more deliberately or give a stronger anchor so I can try again?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath, but this time, I want you to try to create a sense of curiosity around the thoughts that arise. As you breathe in, ask yourself, "What's happening in this moment?" Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, but also notice the thoughts that arise. Try to observe them without judgment, without trying to change them or react to them. Simply notice them, and ask yourself, "What's interesting about this thought?" See if you can create a small space for curiosity to emerge. What happens when you focus on curiosity rather than trying to control the thoughts?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is curiosity supposed to help when my head immediately scripts the worst? I tried asking "What's interesting about this thought?" and got a tiny flicker of curiosity—shoulders dropped for a second—but the fortune-teller tape screamed "You screwed up" and the whole chain (boss's email, pipeline collapse, blame, HR, me out on the street) was back before I could finish the breath. I'm feeling more anxious and jumpy now; can you cue me more directly or give a stronger anchor (press-thumb plus a short phrase) and walk me through another round? I'm skeptical this will change anything, but I'll try if you guide me.

Therapist: Let's try another round. I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath, and I want you to try to bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body. As you breathe in, press your thumb against your index finger, and say to yourself, "I am present." As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and say to yourself, "I am present." Try to focus on the physical sensations, without thinking about the thoughts or the catastrophic scenario. See if you can create a small space for just the physical sensations to exist. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your shoulders dropping, and the sensation of your jaw relaxing. What happens when you focus on the physical sensations and say "I am present"?

Patient: I tried it — I pressed my thumb, said "I am present," and for a beat my shoulders dropped and my jaw unclenched, but then the "You screwed up" tape kicked in — boss's email, pipeline collapse, HR — before I even finished exhaling. I'm confused and jumpy; I don't really follow how noticing the breath prevents the fortune-telling, it just feels like a blink that disappears. Can you cue me more directly or give a stronger, repeatable anchor and walk me through it step‑by‑step? I'm skeptical, but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's start again, but this time, I want you to focus on just one thing: the sensation of your thumb on your index finger. I want you to pay attention to the pressure, the sensation of your thumb touching your finger, and the movement of your finger as you breathe in and out. As you breathe in, notice how your thumb presses against your finger. As you breathe out, notice how your finger relaxes and releases. I want you to focus on just this sensation, without thinking about the thoughts or the catastrophic scenario. Try to pay attention to just one breath, one inhale, and one exhale. Can you focus on just the sensation of your thumb on your finger for just one breath?

Patient: I did it — pressed my thumb and tried to focus on that one breath. For a beat the pressure was clear and my shoulders eased, then the fortune‑teller screamed "You screwed up" and the whole movie played out: boss's email, pipeline collapse, HR, me out on the street — way faster than one breath. I'm anxious and distracted and it feels pointless, but I'll try again if you cue me more slowly or give a firmer anchor.

Therapist: , just try to keep your finger focused on that one breath and let go of everything else, no matter what's playing in your head. What I want you to do next is take a small moment to acknowledge and accept the physical sensations, no matter how intense or confusing they may seem. Can you do that for me now?

Patient: Okay—I can try. Right now my chest is tight, my jaw's clenched, my breathing's shallow, and my thumb-on-finger feels a little hot; I notice all of that and I'm trying to let it be without pushing it away. But even as I accept those sensations, the fortune-teller tape is already narrating: "You screwed up" and the whole cascade—boss's email, pipeline collapse, HR—so I'm anxious and jumpy and it's hard to stay with the acceptance. Can you cue me through another anchored breath slowly? I'm skeptical it will change the outcome, but I'll try if you guide me.

Therapist: , I think the only thing working is the label, not the "exploration" part. That means the exploration is ineffective, it's all "label" — "I am present" and the "I am flexible" both. Can I stop the exploration part if it's just getting in the way, and let's just focus on the label? What's the best way to approach a single breath using a single label? What if, right now, the exploration is getting in the way of progress? How much exploration do I want to integrate and how? What is the right exploration-to-label balance? What is the exploration balance?

Patient: Okay—label-only feels more practical to me; exploration just gets in the way and my head runs the movie while I'm poking around. My preference would be something really simple and repeatable: pick one short label (like "Prediction" or "Disaster prediction"), press thumb + say the label as soon as the thought appears, then take one deliberate breath and go back to the task. Do that mostly—like 80–90% label, 10–20% very tiny curiosity/exploration if the label actually buys a pause. 

That said, I'm skeptical it will hold—my brain still insists one time the label won't stick and the cascade will happen—but I'm willing to try that ratio if you cue me through it and pace me. Can you cue me now with the label and count one breath so I can try it?
