Patient: I've been stuck lately worrying nonstop about my performance at this new accounting job — I replay emails and tasks in my head and keep thinking I missed something important. That worry makes me procrastinate because I won't start until I feel totally sure, which never happens. I doubt this will change much, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right before you start working on a task? What's the first thing that goes through your mind when you sit down at your desk?

Patient: The first thought is usually, "Did I miss something? Did I mess up that last report?" That immediately makes my chest tight and I start checking emails, reopening spreadsheets, and looking for any sign I screwed up — basically anything but starting the actual task. I tell myself to just do the first small step, but I can't unless I'm totally sure, so I end up doing 'prep' forever and procrastinating. I've tried checklists and timers before and they didn't help — how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you've tried some strategies before, but they haven't stuck. I'm not asking you to try another one right now. Instead, I'd like to explore what might happen if, instead of checking every email and spreadsheet, you could simply acknowledge that thought and then let it go for just a minute. Just say to yourself, "Okay, I've got that thought. It's there for a second, and then it's gone." Can you do that for me?

Patient: Fine — I'll try it. Right now the thought is "I missed something" and I can feel my chest tighten; okay, it's there for a second and then it's gone... but honestly I don't feel any different. How is that supposed to help when the worry just comes back and I end up checking everything again?

Therapist: It seems like acknowledging the thought and letting it go for a second wasn't as helpful as you'd hoped. Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the thought itself, what if we explored what would happen if you did start working on the task right now, despite feeling a little uncertain about whether you've missed something? What's the worst that could happen if you just start, even if you do end up finding something you missed? Can you imagine taking that first step, even though it's a little scary?

Patient: I can imagine doing it, but the first thing that pops up is the worst-case — I missed an error that gets me blamed or even fired — and my chest tightens so much I can't focus. If I try to start, I end up opening the file and then checking email or past reports a dozen times instead. How is picturing that actually supposed to help me begin? Fine, I could try opening the spreadsheet and doing five minutes, but I already feel like we'll end up back at the same loop.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to start, but the fear of making a mistake is holding you back. I'm not asking you to ignore that fear entirely, but let's try to focus on what you can control right now. Instead of checking email or past reports, can you just focus on the one task in front of you? Can you commit to working on it for just five minutes, without checking anything else? No checking email, no past reports. Just the task at hand. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the five minutes, but I’m not optimistic because I always end up checking something. Can you stay with me through it and tell me what to do if I start reaching for email? Also, how is this supposed to actually break the loop when the worry just comes back?

Therapist: I'll stay with you through the five minutes, and I'll help you manage the urge to check email. When you feel the impulse to reach for your email, I want you to pause for a second. Take a deep breath in, and out. Say to yourself, "Email, I can handle this later." Then, gently place your hand on the mouse, and say, "I'm going to keep my hand here on the task." Keep your hand on the mouse, and focus on the task in front of you. If your mind starts to wander, acknowledge the thought ("Oh, I just had a thought about email..."), and then gently bring it back to the task. We'll take it one step at a time, and we'll work through this together.

Patient: Okay, I'm doing it. Taking a deep breath now — "Email, I can handle this later." Hand's on the mouse. My chest is still tight and my fingers keep twitching toward the keyboard. 

The urge's already strong — if I reach for email, do I physically put my hand back and say something different, or just notice it and keep going? I don't get how keeping my hand there actually stops the worry, but… can you stay with me and talk me through the next 30 seconds?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the urge to check email again, and your hand is twitching. Instead of physically putting your hand back on the mouse, I want you to simply notice the sensation. Say to yourself, "I notice my hand twitching, I notice my fingers moving toward the keyboard." Take a deep breath in, and out. Don't do anything about it yet. Just observe. Then, gently bring your attention back to the task in front of you. Focus on the task, and try to let go of the urge to check email for just another 10 seconds. We can take it from there. How are you feeling?

Patient: I'm still really anxious — chest's tight and my fingers keep twitching, though I can notice it like you said. I don't feel any calmer; how is noticing this supposed to help me actually start the task instead of checking email? Can you keep guiding me for another 10 seconds — tell me to breathe with you or count down so I don't give in?

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this for another 10 seconds. Take a deep breath in with me... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... exhale with me... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... Now, I want you to look at the task in front of you. Just look at it. Not at your email, not at your computer, just at the task. I want you to notice the words, the numbers, the layout. Just observe. And when you're ready, I want you to take that first step. Just a tiny step. Type a single character. Anything. Just one character.

Patient: Okay... I typed "a". My chest's still tight and my fingers keep wanting to reach for email — I don't feel any different. How is typing one character supposed to help when the worry just comes back? Can you stay with me and tell me the next tiny step so I don't give in?

Therapist: It sounds like you've typed "a", which is a great start. Now, I want you to take it one character at a time. Instead of typing a whole sentence, I want you to type just one word. Just one word. It can be "the", "and", "of", it doesn't matter. Just one word. Let's start with something simple. Type the word "the". Just type it. Don't worry about what comes next, just focus on typing "the". Take your time, I'm right here with you.

Patient: I typed "the", but I'm not sure I follow — how is typing words supposed to stop the worry? My chest's still tight and my fingers keep twitching toward email. Can you stay with me and tell me the next tiny step, because I've tried these little tricks before and they usually don't work.

Therapist: I think we need to take a break from the typing exercise for a moment. I want you to look around your workspace. Notice the chair, the desk, the computer. Just notice it. Don't think about email, don't think about the task, just notice the physical space around you. Take a deep breath in, and out. I want you to take a moment to relax, to let go of the tension in your body. We can come back to the typing exercise later, or we can try something different. What do you think? Can you take a moment to just be with your body right now?

Patient: I looked around and tried to notice my breath and the chair, but my chest's still tight and I feel stuck — I'm not sure I follow how noticing the chair helps. I've done grounding and breathing exercises before and they usually don't change the worry, so I'm skeptical this will be different. Can you stay with me and lead a very specific, step-by-step body check because I can't seem to do it on my own?

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through a simple body check. Please follow my instructions carefully. I want you to start by noticing the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Yes, just your feet. Look at them, feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Now, bring your attention to your toes. Wiggle them slightly, notice the movement. Don't think about anything else, just the movement of your toes. Next, I want you to notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Feel the temperature, the texture. It might be a bit cool, or a bit warm. Just notice the sensation. Now, slowly bring your attention to your hands. Look at them, feel the weight of your fingers. Wiggle them slightly, notice the movement. Finally, I want you to notice the sensation of your mouth. Feel the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth, the movement of your jaw. Just notice the sensation. Take a deep breath in, and out. Can you focus on these physical sensations right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — focusing on my feet and wiggling my toes feels kind of random. I did the toes and the fingers like you said, but my chest is still tight and my mind's already back on "I missed something." How is noticing my toes supposed to stop that, and can you keep guiding me step-by-step because I can't seem to do this on my own?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. I want you to focus on a simple, physical sensation. Bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just feel the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. Try to focus on this sensation without thinking about anything else. Don't think about your task, don't think about email, just the sensation of the breath. As you focus on the breath, I want you to notice when your mind starts to wander. When you catch yourself thinking about something else, gently bring your attention back to the breath. That's it. Just focus on the breath, and notice when your mind wanders. Can you try this for a few seconds?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on my breath supposed to stop the worry? But okay, I'll try for a few seconds. My breaths are shallow and my chest's still tight and my mind's already jumping to "did I miss something?" Can you count the breaths with me or tell me exactly what to do next, step‑by‑step, because I can't seem to keep my attention on my own.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this exercise, step by step. Please follow my instructions carefully. Right now, I want you to bring your attention back to your breath. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of your breath. Don't think about anything else. Don't worry about your task, don't worry about email. Just focus on the breath.

Take a deep breath in... (pause for 2 seconds)...and exhale... (pause for 2 seconds)

Now, I want you to notice the sensation of your breath as you inhale. How does it feel? Does it feel cool, warm, light, heavy? Just notice the sensation.

Take another deep breath in... (pause for 2 seconds)...and exhale... (pause for 2 seconds)

As you exhale, notice the sensation of your breath leaving your body. How does it feel? Does it feel like it's leaving your body slowly or quickly? Just notice the sensation.

Can you focus on the sensation of your breath right now? Can you notice it for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I'll try one more breath. My inhale's shallow and…I'm not sure I follow, because a sudden wave of shame just popped up and now my chest's even tighter and I feel frustrated with myself. How is focusing on breath supposed to help when that shame keeps grabbing my attention? Can you give me a very specific next step — like exactly how long to inhale/exhale or a physical cue to use — and stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through this exercise, and I want you to focus on the sensation of your body. Please follow my instructions carefully.

I want you to place the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth, and then release it very slightly. Just notice the sensation of the tip of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Hold it for a second... (pause for 1 second)...and then release it. Just notice the sensation as you release.

Now, I want you to inhale slowly through your nose... (pause for 4 seconds)...and exhale slowly through your mouth... (pause for 4 seconds). Just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Notice how your tongue feels as you inhale and exhale.

Take another breath in... (pause for 4 seconds)...and exhale... (pause for 4 seconds). As you inhale, notice the sensation of the tip of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. As you exhale, notice how your tongue feels as you release.

Can you focus on the sensation of your breath and your tongue right now? Can you notice it for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I put my tongue behind my teeth and did the slow inhale/exhale like you said, but that one breath just made the shame spike and my chest tightened more. I'm not sure I follow how that helps with the constant worry about missing errors — how is that supposed to stop me from reaching for email? Give me a specific next step I can do right now (exact counts, what to do if my fingers twitch) and stay with me while I try it, because I can't seem to do this on my own.
