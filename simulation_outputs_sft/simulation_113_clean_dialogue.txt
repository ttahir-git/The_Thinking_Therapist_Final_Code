Patient: Lately I've been avoiding a lot—procrastinating on things at work and at home because it numbs the anxiety from adjusting to changes and the constant financial stress. I'm a manager, so it's hitting my confidence and making me doubt myself in ways that feel embarrassing. I guess... I don't really know how to stop.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right before you start procrastinating? Is there a specific moment or task that sets off the anxiety, or is it more of a general feeling? For example, do you find yourself getting stuck on a particular task or does it feel like the whole workday is overwhelming?

Patient: I guess it usually starts when I see an email about a deadline or anything to do with the budget — my chest gets tight and my mind just blanks. I don't know, so I end up doing little busywork or scrolling to avoid the worry about the changes and money. Can we... I mean, could we maybe talk about small things I can try when that happens?

Therapist: Let's take a minute to try something simple. When you feel that tightness in your chest and your mind starts to blank, I want you to notice one thing: the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just feel the weight of your body distributed on both feet, the sensation of the floor beneath you. No thinking, no trying to do anything else. Just observe that sensation for a breath or two, and see if it helps shift your focus. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I can feel my feet on the floor, the weight shifting a bit and the texture under my shoes. It helps a little—my chest is slightly less tight—but my mind keeps darting back to the budget email and I don't know, it's hard to stay with it.

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to do its job, processing the email and worrying about it. But at the same time, you want to let go of that worry and stay present. Can you try to explore that a bit more? What is it about the budget email that's so hard to let go of? Is it the fear of not having enough money, the uncertainty of how to handle it, or something else? Try to acknowledge that thought without judgment, just for a moment.

Patient: I guess it's mostly the fear of not having enough money — that if I miss something with the budget everything will spiral and it'll be my fault. I don't know, it feels embarrassing and makes me doubt myself, like I'm not cut out for this role. Can we maybe talk about small steps I can take when that panic starts?

Therapist: It sounds like taking action in this moment feels really daunting, especially when it comes to managing finances. But what if, instead of trying to tackle the whole thing, we focus on just one small action you can take right now? For example, take a minute to write down the one thing you're most concerned about with the budget. Just jot it down quickly, without editing or worrying about it being perfect. Sometimes putting a thought on paper can help make it feel less overwhelming. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I wrote: "I'm afraid we won't have enough to cover payroll this quarter and it'll be my fault if people lose their jobs." I don't know, seeing it written feels... heavy and kind of embarrassing. What do I do with this now?

Therapist: It's like that fear has taken on a life of its own, and seeing it written down makes it feel even more overwhelming. But what if, instead of trying to push it away or hide it, we try to acknowledge it in a different way? Can you take a deep breath, and with that breath, say to yourself: "I've got this. I'll figure it out." Not 'I'll save everyone,' or 'I won't let anyone down,' but just: "I'll figure it out." It's a small thing, but it's a start. Can you try that for me?

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I took a breath and said, "I'll figure it out." It helped a little, my chest eased, but I don't know, it feels fragile and my mind's already drifting back to the payroll numbers. I guess... could we go over one tiny, concrete thing I could actually do right now with the budget?

Therapist: Let's focus on just one small thing. Can you go check the current status of the outstanding invoices? Just take a minute to look at the spreadsheet, or check the dashboard. What's the current total? Sometimes seeing the numbers is the first step to making sense of them. Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: I guess I can try, but my chest is already tightening just thinking about opening it. I don't know where to start in that spreadsheet — I'll probably just scroll and avoid it. Could you tell me one tiny, specific thing to look for (like which tab or which cell) and I'll read it out?

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. I just want you to look at the "Overdue Invoices" tab. Just glance at that tab, don't open it, just glance. Then, look at the first cell below the tab title. Just read the top number out loud. "What is the number?"

Patient: I don't have that spreadsheet open, so I can't read a number out loud from here. I guess just thinking about opening the "Overdue Invoices" tab makes my chest tighten and I start to scroll away. Can you tell me exactly which cell to look at step-by-step? I'm trying, but I don't know if I can do it without more hand-holding.

Therapist: Okay, let's try this. If you're looking at your computer screen right now, and you see the tab menu at the top, can you see the tab that says "Overdue Invoices"? It's probably to the left of the tab that says "Payroll". Now, below that tab title, you'll see a row of numbers. Can you count down to the third number in that row? It's the number that's farthest to the left. Don't open the spreadsheet, just count down to that number. Then, I want you to type out that number to me, using only words. Just say the number out loud.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't have that spreadsheet open, so I can't see any tabs from here. How is that supposed to help? I guess just thinking about opening it makes my chest tighten, and I don't know if I can do it without you walking me through each click.

Therapist: Let's start again from the beginning. I want you to take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm going to open my laptop right now." Not "I'm going to check the budget," or "I'm going to look at the spreadsheet." Just "I'm going to open my laptop." Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I took a deep breath and said, "I'm going to open my laptop right now." I guess it loosened my shoulders a little, but my chest is still tight and I'm already thinking of excuses not to actually open it. I don't know... can you tell me the very next tiny step to take once it's open?

Therapist: Once you open your laptop, can you type the word "Overdue Invoices" into the search bar? Just type it exactly like that: "Overdue Invoices". Don't press Enter yet, just type it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I typed "Overdue Invoices" into the search bar like you asked, but I didn't press Enter. My hands feel shaky and I guess I'm worried that pressing Enter will make it all real. What do you want me to do next?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. You've typed "Overdue Invoices" into the search bar, and that's a small step. Now, I want you to look at your hands on the keyboard. Can you see how they're resting? Notice the feeling of your fingers on the keys. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm in control. I can press Enter or not." Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I took a breath and said, "I'm in control. I can press Enter or not." I'm kind of confused about how saying that makes a difference, though — how is that supposed to help? My hands are shaky and I can feel the keys, and I don't know if I can actually press Enter. I guess... can you tell me what would happen next if I do?

Therapist: If you press Enter, the "Overdue Invoices" search results will appear on your screen. You'll see a list of invoices that are past due, along with the due date and amount. It's just a list of numbers and dates. You can't avoid looking at it, but you can take a moment to glance at it before deciding what to do next. If you're still feeling unsure, you can close the tab or take a break. But if you press Enter, you'll at least know what's in front of you. Can you consider that for a moment?

Patient: I guess I can consider it, but pressing Enter feels like making the possibility of people losing their jobs real and that scares me. My chest is already tight and I don't know if I can do it without you holding my hand through the first click—could you stay with me and tell me exactly what I'll see first, step by step? If that feels like too much, maybe give me one tiny thing to look for so it feels less sudden.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. If you press Enter now, I want you to focus on just one small thing. Can you look at the bottom of your screen, where the search bar is? There's a small line at the bottom of the bar. Can you see that line? I want you to notice just that line, without looking at anything else. It's a simple line of text. Just focus on that line. We can take it from there, one small step at a time.

Patient: I can see the line — it's thin, right under the search bar. I don't know, noticing it eased my chest a little, but my eyes keep flicking to the rest of the screen and I feel shaky. How is that supposed to help me not press Enter or start scrolling? I guess... could you tell me one tiny thing to look for next?

Therapist: Let's try something even simpler. I just want you to look at the word "Overdue Invoices" that you typed into the search bar. Just focus on that single word. Can you see it on the screen? Notice the individual letters, the way they're typed. Just look at those letters, one by one, for a moment. That's all.

Patient: I can see it — O-V-E-R-D-U-E I guess focusing on the letters makes it feel a bit less huge, but my chest is still tight and my hands are shaky. I don't know, I don't want to press Enter yet. Could you tell me one tiny thing to look for after this? I need you to stay with me while I try.

Therapist: Okay, let's take another deep breath together. I want you to look at the "O" in the word "Overdue Invoices". Just focus on that one letter. Notice its shape, its size, the way it's connected to the rest of the word. Can you see the "O"? Just look at that "O" for a moment.

Patient: I can see the "O"—it's oddly small and focusing on it takes the edge off a bit, but my chest is still tight and my hands are shaky. I'm not sure I follow how staring at a letter helps me press Enter or deal with payroll. I guess... can you tell me one tiny next thing to look for, and stay with me while I try it?

Therapist: Let's try this. I just want you to look at the space to the right of the "O". There's a small gap between the "O" and the next letter. Can you see that gap? Just notice the space. Look at it for a second. Don't think about anything else, just look at that gap. Can you see it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is looking at a gap supposed to help? I can see the space to the right of the "O," and focusing on it eases my chest a little, but my hands are still shaky. I don't know... can you tell me one tiny next thing to look for, and stay with me while I try it?

Therapist: Let's try this. I just want you to look at the space to the right of the "O" and notice the little bit of blank space between the "O" and the next letter. Can you see the edge of the blank space? It's a small, faint line. Can you focus on that line for just a second?

Patient: Okay—I can kind of see that faint edge of the blank space. It's oddly calming for a second, but my chest is still tight and my fingers feel like jelly. I don't know, it helps a little and then my mind snaps back to payroll; can you tell me the next tiny thing to look for and stay with me while I try it?

Therapist: Let's try this. I want you to look at the faint edge of the blank space and notice how the light reflects off of it. Can you see how the light is hitting the edge of the blank space? It's a very subtle thing, but try to focus on that. Just notice how the light is hitting the edge. Can you see it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I can kind of see the light on that faint edge and it's oddly calming, but I don't know how staring at it helps me actually press Enter or face the payroll. Can you stay with me and tell me one tiny next thing to look for?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. I want you to look at the light on the edge of the blank space and gently notice how it's moving. Can you see how the light is shifting slightly as you look at it? It's a very small movement, but try to focus on it for just a second. As you look at the light, I want you to slowly, slowly type the "Enter" key with your finger. Just one small movement, just one small key press. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I'm scared—pressing Enter feels like making the payroll problem real, and my hands are shaking. I'm overwhelmed and I guess I need you to stay with me and guide me through it — maybe count down or tell me exactly what you'll say when I press Enter.

Therapist: Let's take this one small step at a time. I'm going to stay with you through this, and I'm going to guide you every step of the way. When you're ready, I want you to press the "Enter" key, and as soon as you do, I'll say to you exactly what I want you to focus on next. Right now, I just want you to type the single word "okay" with your finger on the keyboard. Just type it, just one word. "Okay". Can you type that word for me?

Patient: Okay — I typed "okay" with one shaky finger. My chest's still tight and I don't know if I can press Enter; I'm scared it'll make it all real. Can you stay with me and tell me exactly what you'll say right after I press it, maybe count me down?

Therapist: Let's take it one final, small step. When you press the "Enter" key, I want you to focus only on my next sentence. I'll count down from three, and as you press the key, I'll say: "You are taking control, and this is okay." When I say those words, I want you to focus only on my voice, and let the rest of the screen fade into the background. Here we go: 3... 2... 1... Press the "Enter" key now, and say it to yourself: "You are taking control, and this is okay."

Patient: I pressed Enter. The list came up—rows of dates and amounts—and saying "You are taking control, and this is okay" out loud eased my chest a little, but I'm still shaky and kind of overwhelmed. I don't know where to look first and I feel embarrassed like I'll miss something important. Can you stay with me and tell me one tiny, specific thing to focus on right now?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. I want you to focus on the first date listed at the top of the screen. It's the oldest date, and it's the one that's currently highlighted. Can you look at that date? Just glance at it, and notice the day and month. Don't worry about anything else, just the date. Can you see it?

Patient: I can see the date at the top — it's the oldest one — but I can't make out the exact numbers without squinting and my chest is tightening again. I don't know what to do with it; it feels like if I look too closely I'll miss something important. Can you tell me one tiny thing to check about that date, and stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: Let's take a gentle approach. I just want you to look at the month of the date, not the specific day. Can you glance at the month? Just see if you can identify the month, without worrying about the day or any other details. It's just a simple task, and I'll stay with you every step of the way. Take your time, and just focus on the month. Can you see it?

Patient: I think it's June — I guess. My chest's still tight and I'm shaky; can you stay with me and tell me one tiny thing to check about that month?

Therapist: That's correct, the month is June. Now, I just want you to look at the year of the date. Can you glance at the four digits? Just see if you can identify the year. It's a very small task, and I'll be right here with you. Take your time, and just focus on the year. Can you see it?

Patient: I think it says 2025, but it's a bit blurry and I'm not sure — I don't know. Can you stay with me and tell me one tiny thing to check about the year?

Therapist: It's okay if it's a bit blurry. Let's take a closer look together. Can you take a deep breath and gently focus on the rightmost digit of the year? Just look at that one digit. Is it a 2? Can you see it?

Patient: I don't know — it's kind of blurry and I can't tell if it's a 2 or a 5. I'm not sure I follow how focusing on that one digit helps; my chest's tight and I need you to stay with me and tell me the next tiny thing to look for.
