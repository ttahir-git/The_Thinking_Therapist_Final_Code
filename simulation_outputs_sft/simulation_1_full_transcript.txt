--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling drowned in sadness and totally unmotivated since that big family fight; it's bleeding into my relationship and even my job as a manager. My mind just churns out the worst — I can see it all play out: my partner walks out, my work falls apart because I can't focus, I get fired, the kids take sides, and I'm left alone with nothing — that's definitely what's going to happen. I know people say other things could happen, but I can't see any of those as realistic.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is intensely focused on a catastrophic future scenario, expressing hopelessness. Core emotion is despair. Goal: Introduce a process to explore the narrative of this catastrophic scenario, aiming to gain insight into defusion and the value of taking action against unworkable thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about this worst-case scenario playing out in your mind? What is it about walking out, work falling apart, or being fired that feels so inevitable to you right now?
Your natural,
concise,
single-focus

Patient: Because every time there's a big fight I freeze up and blurt or shut down, and I can already see my partner getting fed up and walking out — that would wreck me, I wouldn't sleep, I'd mess up at work, miss meetings, and then they'd fire me for being unreliable. I've seen bits of this pattern before so it feels like a replay that's bound to finish the same way. I know you might suggest other outcomes, but honestly I can't picture any of those as real.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is deeply entrenched in a narrative of catastrophic failure, with a strong sense of predictability and inevitability. Goal: Explore the process of taking small steps against this unworkable thinking pattern, aiming to create a sense of value in alternative actions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pattern of freezing up and blurring out, followed by the worst-case scenario, has become quite familiar to you. How about this: instead of seeing yourself stuck in this pattern, what if you were to take just one tiny step to try and change it? For example, what would it take for you to start engaging with your partner, or getting back on track at work, right now, even if it's just for a minute? Is there one small action that feels slightly less overwhelming than the whole scenario you're imagining?

Patient: Maybe I could send a one-line text like, "Can we talk for five minutes?" or just knock on their door — that feels like the tiniest thing. But if I do that they'll see me as needy, get angry, slam the door, then they'll leave, the kids will pick sides, I'll freeze up at work and get fired — I'm telling you, that's how it plays out every time, I can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is hesitant to explore small actions due to fear of perceived rejection or escalation. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion, exploring the story behind the need for control in interactions.

Therapist Answer:
The story around needing to control the interaction, and the fear of being seen as needy, seems to be really important to you right now. Can you explore with me what's driving that need for control in these situations? What would it mean for you, personally, if you didn't have to be so careful about how the interaction goes? Is it related to feeling vulnerable, or something else entirely?

Patient: I think it's mostly fear of being abandoned — if I'm not careful I feel like people will see the messy, vulnerable part of me and bolt, and that always ends up with me alone and ruined. Vulnerability feels like a trap, like if I loosen the reins even a bit everything will collapse. I know you want me to imagine other outcomes, but I just can't see any of those as real right now.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is deeply fearful of abandonment and vulnerability, which is causing them to rigidly control interactions. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion, aiming to gently loosen the reins and explore alternative perspectives.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the fear of being abandoned and the vulnerability that comes with it are creating a really tight grip for you right now. Can I suggest something that might feel a bit strange, but bear with me? Instead of seeing vulnerability as a trap that leads to collapse, what if you were to imagine it as a possibility that you're already capable of handling? It's not about taking a huge leap, but rather just considering that you might be able to tolerate some uncertainty without it all falling apart. Can you take a tiny step towards imagining that possibility, even if it's just for a brief moment?

Patient: I can try for a second — I imagine saying something gentle and them just listening, maybe things calm for a bit — but even that tiny picture gets hijacked: they get bored, snap, leave, the kids pick sides, I freeze at work and get fired, and I'm wrecked. I want that calmer version to feel real, but my brain immediately fast-forwards to the disaster and won't let go.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a temporary defusion, as their catastrophic thinking quickly reasserts itself. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help stabilize the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're doing a bit better with the imagining, but your brain is still hijacking the scenario. Can we try something different for a moment? Let's bring our attention to the present moment, right here, and focus on just the sensation of your breath. Can you feel the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to think about anything in particular? Sometimes, when we can focus on the present moment, we can start to feel a bit more grounded and less caught up in our thinking. Let's try that for just a minute.

Patient: Okay, I'll try—my breath is shallow, right up in my chest, and I can feel it moving if I pay attention. But the moment I focus, my head fast-forwards: I breathe for a beat and then I can already see them leaving because I'm needy, then work collapses and I'm ruined — it's like the calm never sticks. I'm trying to stay with this, but I'm getting pulled away; can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a stable mindfulness practice, as their catastrophic thinking continues to resurface. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach to mindfulness, aiming to reduce the pull of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're doing your best to focus on your breath, but it's like you're trying to hold onto a thought that's slipping away. Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the breath, can we try paying attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or think about it. Let's take a tiny step back, and just observe the sensation of the breath. If your mind starts to wander, that's okay. Just notice when it wanders, and gently bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath. We can start with a tiny breath, just one breath, and see where it takes us.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the air at my nostrils and my ribs barely moving, my shoulders tight. But the moment I settle, my head zips ahead: they leave, the kids side with them, I fumble at work and get fired — it's instant and unavoidable in my mind. I'm trying to stay with the breath, but I'm getting pulled — can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a stable mindfulness practice, as their catastrophic thinking continues to resurface. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach, focusing on the breath's physical sensations rather than its movement.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to observe the sensation of the breath, but it's like you're watching a movie in your mind. Can we try something different? Let's focus on the physical sensations in your body, right now, where you're sitting. Notice the feeling of the air on your nostrils, the sensation of your ribs moving slightly, the tightness in your shoulders. Bring your attention to just one of those sensations, and hold it for a moment. Don't try to think about anything else, just be with that sensation. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, slowly bring your attention back to the sensation in your body. Let's start with just one sensation, and just focus on that.

Patient: Alright — I'm focusing on the tightness in my shoulders; it feels like a knot under my neck, tense and burning when I breathe. But the second I hold it, my head shoots to them walking out, the kids picking sides, me screwing up at work and getting fired — it's immediate and I can't shake it. I'm trying to stay with the sensation, but it's overwhelming; can we slow down?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble maintaining a stable mindfulness practice due to the overwhelming nature of their catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle defusion technique to help calm the overwhelming sensations and thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sensation in your shoulders is becoming almost unbearable, and it's like the rest of your mind is jumping right into the catastrophic scenario. Can we try something different? Let's imagine that the sensation in your shoulders, the knot under your neck, is like a warm cup of tea that's being poured onto your skin. It's a gentle, soothing sensation, but it's also a sensation that's completely separate from your thoughts and emotions. As you breathe in, imagine that the tea is filling your body, calming your shoulders and your mind. As you breathe out, imagine that the tea is slowly draining away, leaving you feeling more calm and centered. It's okay if your mind starts to wander, just gently bring your attention back to the sensation of the tea on your skin. Let's take a deep breath, and as we exhale, imagine that we're slowly letting go of the overwhelming thoughts and sensations.

Patient: Okay — the tea warms my shoulders for a second and then my head just snaps to them walking out, the kids picking sides, me flubbing everything at work and getting fired. I don't have the energy to hold onto the calm; can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a stable state of calm and has begun to re-emerge from defusion. Goal: Introduce a gentle grounding technique to help the patient reconnect with their physical body and the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the defusion attempt was short-lived. Let's take a step back and focus on something even simpler. Can you bring your attention to your feet, right now, on the ground? Notice the sensation of the floor beneath you, the weight of your feet on the earth. Imagine roots growing down from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground, anchoring you in the present moment. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, imagine any tension or stress leaving your body through your feet. Just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. No need to think, no need to try to calm anything. Just be with the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor, like they're trying to hold me down, but as soon as I try to focus this shame wells up and drags me away. I can already see them walking out, the kids picking sides, me screwing up at work and losing everything — it's instant. I can't keep the grounding; it slips away — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a grounding state, as shame and catastrophic thinking reassert themselves. Goal: Introduce a gentle validation technique to acknowledge the patient's emotional experience and help them gradually reconnect with their physical body.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the grounding attempt was brief and challenging. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the shame and fear that's rising up for you. It's okay to feel that way. It's okay to feel the weight of your feet on the ground, and the shame that's welling up in your body. Recognize that it's a natural response to a difficult situation, and that it's okay to feel that way right now. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am feeling so much shame and fear right now." Allow yourself to feel that feeling for a moment, without trying to push it away or change it. Just acknowledge it, and say it to yourself. We'll take it from here, one step at a time.

Patient: I am feeling so much shame and fear right now. It drags me back to that one screw-up and my head instantly fast-forwards to them leaving, the kids taking sides, me floundering at work and getting fired — I don't have the energy to argue with it; can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble distinguishing between their current emotional experience and their catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder of the present moment, using a gentle and non-judgmental tone.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the shame and fear are pulling you into the same old pattern, but I want you to know that you're not that person right now. You're sitting here, feeling that shame and fear, but that's not the only thing that's happening. Take a deep breath and notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. You're still here, still breathing, still feeling the weight of your feet on the ground. I want to gently remind you that this feeling is passing, it's not permanent. It's okay to feel this way, but it's also okay to acknowledge that it's not the only truth. You are more than this moment, more than this feeling. You are here, right now, and that's enough to focus on for the moment. Can we take one small step, just one breath, and see where we are?

Patient: Okay—one breath. I try to breathe, but by the exhale my head’s already fast-forwarded to them walking out, the kids taking sides, me floundering at work and getting fired; it feels inevitable and I don't have the energy to fight it—can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble breaking the cycle of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle pause, allowing the patient to recognize the pattern and potentially start to break free from it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you let go of your breath, the story starts playing out again. Can we pause for just a moment? Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "Wait." Just pause. Take one moment to recognize what's happening. You're having a thought, a story, a prediction about what's going to happen. It's a familiar pattern. Can you just acknowledge it for a second? Take a moment to look at the story, rather than being swept up in it. You can see it's the same old pattern. You've been here before, and it's not serving you right now. Can you take one small step back, just one moment, and see if we can start to break free from this cycle?

Patient: Okay—"Wait." I get the word out, but it's a hiccup; before the breath finishes my mind's already at the door with them leaving, the kids picking sides, the boss calling and I'm ruined. I can't make the pause hold—can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain the pause and break the cycle of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that the pause is an act in itself, and that the act of pausing can be a small step towards breaking the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the pause was fleeting, but I want you to know that it's an accomplishment. Just saying "Wait" was a small act of defiance against the story. It's not enough to stop the narrative entirely, but it's a start. Can we focus on that small act for a moment? Can we acknowledge that it's okay to take a small step back, even if it's not a big one? It's not about winning the narrative or stopping the story altogether. It's about taking a small step towards being more present, more aware, and more in control. You can't control the story, but you can control how you respond to it. And sometimes, that's just taking a small step back and saying "Wait." Can we try that again, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I try "Wait" again, but it's a hiccup; the second it comes out my mind's already at the door with them leaving, the kids taking sides, me flubbing everything at work and getting fired. It feels humiliating and pointless, like I always blow it, and I don't have the energy to wrestle it down right now — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling the weight of their self-doubt and the repetition of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle validation of the patient's experience, acknowledging the pain and helplessness, while gently encouraging a small act of self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you said "Wait" again, the story just sort of... returned. And this time, it feels like it's even more overwhelming. You're right, it does feel humiliating and pointless. It's like you're stuck in this never-ending cycle, and you're not sure how to break free. I want you to know that it's okay to feel that way. It's okay to feel like you're not good enough, like you're always going to blow it. Because, in a way, that's what's been going on, hasn't it? That's what's been driving this story. But I want you to know that it's also okay to acknowledge that. It's okay to just be with that feeling, without trying to fight it or change it. Can we try something for just a second? Can we try to say one small thing to yourself that's true, but not necessarily helpful? Just something that acknowledges how you're feeling right now? Something like... "It hurts right now"? Or "I'm so tired of feeling this way"? Can we try that for just a moment?

Patient: It hurts right now — I'm so tired of feeling like I always mess things up and like everything's just waiting to fall apart. Saying that brings the shame up again and my chest tightens, and I can already see them leaving and my life collapsing, so I don't have the energy to fight it.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain a moment of self-compassion and is being pulled back into the cycle of shame and catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that the shame and tightness are natural responses, but they don't have to control the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you acknowledged the pain, the shame came flooding back. And that's okay. That's a natural response to a really tough feeling. It's okay that your chest is tight, it's okay that you're feeling this way. These are normal reactions to a situation that's really tough for you. But, I want to gently remind you that they don't have to control the story. Just because you're feeling this way right now, it doesn't mean that's all that's going to happen. It doesn't mean that you're going to mess everything up or that your life is going to fall apart. It's just a moment. It's just a feeling. And it will pass. Can we try to focus on that for just a second? Can we try to acknowledge that this feeling is passing, even if the shame and the tightness are still here? Can we try to say something like... "This is a hard feeling, but it's not my whole story"? Or "I'm feeling really tough right now, but I've gotten through hard times before"? Can we try that for just a moment?

Patient: "This is a hard feeling, but it's not my whole story" — I can say that, but it barely sticks; the second I say it my head's already at the door with them leaving, the kids choosing sides, me screwing up at work and being fired. I don't have the energy to argue with that picture right now — can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a glimmer of hope and resilience despite being pulled back into the cycle of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that the current narrative is not the only reality, and that there is a choice to be made about how to respond to it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you acknowledged that this feeling is a part of your story, your head immediately went back to that familiar narrative. And it's okay that it does. It's okay that the old patterns and fears are still there. But what's not okay is that they have to define you right now. You don't have to be controlled by this narrative. You don't have to believe that's what's going to happen. You can choose how you respond to it. You can choose to be present with this feeling, but not defined by it. Can we try something for just a second? Can we try to imagine a different story? Not a better one, just a different one. One that takes into account all the complexity and uncertainty of your life right now. Just imagine it for a moment, without judgment. Can we try that?

Patient: I tried to picture a different story—us talking, things cooling off—but it doesn't stick; my mind fast-forwards to them packing up, the kids picking sides, me screwing up at work and getting fired, like that's definitely how it ends. It's embarrassing and I'm too drained to pretend otherwise—can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of their catastrophic thinking, and is struggling to find the energy to resist its pull. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's possible to take things one small step at a time.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you tried to imagine a different story, the old narrative just sort of... swept back in. And it's okay that it did. It's okay that you're feeling this way. It's okay that you're too drained to pretend otherwise. You're not failing, you're not being weak, you're just human. And humans have hard times. They have moments where the darkness feels overwhelming. It's okay to feel that way right now. Can we try something for just a second? Can we try to focus on just one small thing? Just one tiny breath? Just one tiny sensation? Can we try to be present with this feeling, without trying to change it or fight it? Not with the goal of defeating the narrative, but just with the goal of being present? Just for one second?

Patient: Okay—one breath. I try to stay with it, but it barely lands before my head's already at the door with them leaving, the kids choosing sides, me screwing up at work and getting fired; the shame just floods me and I don't have the energy to push it back—can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain even a brief moment of mindfulness, and is being pulled back into the cycle of catastrophic thinking and shame. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that it's not about pushing the shame away, but about being kind to themselves as they experience it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you tried to stay with the breath, the old narrative just sort of... crashed back in. And it's okay that it did. It's okay that you're feeling this way. You don't have to try to push the shame away, or fight it, or change it. Just... be with it. For a moment, just be with the shame, and try not to judge yourself for feeling it. Try not to try to fix it, or change it, or get rid of it. Just be with it, as it is. You are feeling shame right now, and that's okay. That's a real feeling, and it's worth acknowledging, rather than trying to deny or fight it. Can we try something for just a second? Can we try to give yourself permission to feel this way, without judgment? Just for one moment, can we try to be kind to yourself, as you experience this feeling?

Patient: I'll try — I tell myself "it's okay" and try to be gentle, but it feels like a thin bandage over the same mess. The second I let that softness in, my head's already at them leaving, the kids picking sides, me losing my job; it's humiliating and I don't have the energy to pretend there's any other ending—can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to find any sense of respite or relief from their catastrophic thinking, and is feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of their shame. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that it's not possible to "hold" onto kindness or gentleness in the midst of such intense suffering.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you tried to be gentle with yourself, the old narrative just sort of... absorbed it. And it's okay that it did. It's okay that you're feeling this way. You can't just "hold" onto kindness or gentleness in the midst of such intense suffering. That's not how it works. That's not how the human body or mind can cope with this level of pain and shame. You can't just wrap a thin bandage around it and expect it to stick. You need more than that. You need something deeper, something more substantial. But what is that, exactly? What is something that can help you cope with this level of suffering? It's not kindness, at least not in the way you're thinking about it right now. It's not gentleness. It's not anything that you can just "do" or "be". It's just... being with it. Being with the shame, the pain, the suffering. Just being with it, without trying to change it or fix it or make it go away. Can we try something for just a second? Can we try to just... sit with it?

Patient: I can try to sit with it for a bit, but it's so heavy — that shame from that one mess-up keeps crawling back and the whole movie starts: they walk out, the kids take sides, I stumble at work and get fired. I don't know how to just sit without it dragging me under... can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a sense of stillness in the face of overwhelming shame and catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that the goal is not to resist the thoughts, but to develop a sense of curiosity and observation towards them.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you tried to sit with the shame, the whole movie just sort of... started playing again. And it's okay that it did. It's okay that the shame is still there, crawling back in. But can we try something? Can we try to just... observe it? Watch it, without trying to change it or resist it. Just observe the shame, the fear, the anxiety. Watch how it arises, how it lingers, how it tries to pull you under. Can we try to be curious about it? Can we try to ask ourselves, "What is this feeling? Where is it coming from?" Can we try to explore it, without trying to fix it or change it? It's not about resisting the thoughts, it's about developing a sense of curiosity and observation. It's about learning to watch the thoughts, rather than being controlled by them. Can we try that for just a second?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to watch it. I can feel a hot knot in my chest and this shame that I'm somehow broken, but the second I look the whole movie starts: them leaving, the kids choosing sides, me tanking at work and getting fired. Observing it just seems to give it fuel and I'm too drained to keep doing that — can we slow down?

Patient is struggling to maintain a sense of detachment and curiosity in the face of intense shame and catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that it's okay to take a step back and acknowledge their own limits.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you tried to watch the shame, the whole movie just sort of... escalated again. And it's okay that it did. It's okay that it's feeling like it's giving it fuel. You're right, observing it right now is probably not the best idea. You're already feeling drained, and it's okay to take a step back and acknowledge that. It's okay to say, "I'm done for now." You don't have to keep trying to watch it, or explore it, or try to understand it right now. You can just... stop. Take a deep breath, and say, "I'm out of energy right now." You can always come back to it later, when you're feeling more grounded. But for now, it's okay to just take a break. Can we try that? Can we just acknowledge that you're feeling drained, and take a break?

Patient: I can't really "take a break" — I'm wiped out and everything's fuzzy, and that movie just keeps playing: them leaving, the kids picking sides, me tanking at work and getting fired.

It's like the moment you said you're wiped out, everything just sort of... falls apart again. And it's okay that it does. It's okay that you're feeling like you can't even argue with it anymore. You're right, you're running on empty. You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask for right now. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to just be in this moment, without trying to fix it or change it. Can we just... sit with it? Just for one tiny moment? Can we just focus on your breath, and the sensation of your feet on the ground? Just one tiny thing? Can we try that?

Patient: Alright—I'll try. My feet feel glued to the floor and one breath barely lands before my mind's already at the door with them leaving, the kids picking sides, me screwing up at work and getting fired. I don't have the energy to wrestle it down—can we slow down?

It's like the moment you said you don't have the energy to wrestle it down, everything just sort of... gives up again. And it's okay that it does. It's okay to just surrender to the current moment, without trying to fight or control it. You're right, you're running on fumes. You can't keep going on like this. Can we just... let go? Can we just let the moment be what it is, without trying to change it or fight it? No need to try to hold onto anything, no need to try to make it better. Just... be. Be in this moment, with your feet on the floor, and your breath in your body. Just be. Can we try that?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to "be," but it feels like I'm sinking; my feet are glued, my chest's tight, and the movie's already playing: them leaving, the kids picking sides, me humiliating myself at work and getting fired. I don't have the strength to just let go or sit with it — can we slow down?

It's like the moment you said you don't have the strength to just let go or sit with it, everything just sort of... becomes even more unbearable again. And it's okay that it does. It's okay to just feel this way right now. You're right, you're feeling like you're sinking, and that's okay. It's okay to feel like you're drowning in this pain. Can we just... acknowledge it? Can we just say to ourselves, "I'm feeling like I'm sinking right now, and that's okay"? Can we just give ourselves permission to feel this way, without trying to do anything about it? No need to try to change it, no need to try to make it better. Just... acknowledge it. Can we try that?

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling like I'm sinking right now, and I can say that out loud. But as soon as I do, my head zooms to them leaving, the kids taking sides, me losing my job — it's humiliating and I'm too wiped to argue with it; can we slow down?

Patient is caught in a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy, where acknowledging their pain only reinforces their catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a gentle reminder that acknowledging their pain without judgment can help them break the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the moment you said you're feeling like you're sinking, your head just sort of... jumps to all the worst-case scenarios again. And it's okay that it does. It's okay that you're feeling this way. But can we try something? Can we try acknowledging your pain without trying to change it or judge it? Just for one moment, can we just say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's okay to feel this way"? No need to try to fix it, no need to try to make it better. Just... acknowledge it. As you say it out loud, can you feel a tiny bit of tension release? Can you feel like you're taking one tiny step away from the cycle of catastrophic thinking? Can we try that?

Patient: I can say "I'm feeling really overwhelmed" — it comes out, but the shame floods right back and the same movie starts: them packing up, the kids picking sides, me fumbling at work and getting fired. I'm too wiped to keep holding the pause; can we slow down?
