Patient: I'm an accountant in my late twenties dealing with burnout since my kid left home, and lately I've been getting paralyzing anxiety about social situations. If I go to a get-together I just know I'll start panicking, say something embarrassing, everyone will think I'm a mess, they'll stop inviting me, and I'll end up totally isolated and my life will just spiral. I can't stop replaying that chain of events, so I keep avoiding gatherings—even with family who actually want to help.

Therapist: You're describing a really vivid and distressing scenario, and it's understandable that you'd want to avoid it. Can you tell me more about what's so specific about these social gatherings that triggers this intense anxiety? Is it the thought of interacting with specific people, or something else entirely?

Your task is to simulate an ACT therapist. Given the explanation, the goal of the answer should be to ask an open-ended question to explore the patient's thoughts and feelings about social anxiety, focusing on gaining insight into their avoidance of social gatherings. The answer should be concise and focused, aiming to achieve the early goal of exploration.

Patient: When you picture that worst‑case chain playing out at a gathering, what thoughts, sensations, and urges come up in your body in that moment — and what, if anything, do you notice you might be giving up or missing out on by avoiding those events?

Therapist: That's really powerful to notice the physical sensations like a knot in your stomach and the urge to escape. Can you explore what happens just before you start thinking about that worst-case scenario? What's happening in your body or your thoughts right before the anxiety starts to build, and how do you think that might change if you were able to observe those moments without judgment, like a witness?

Patient: It usually starts the second I imagine getting an invite—my heart jumps, my mouth goes dry, and my head floods with scenes of me saying something stupid, everyone staring, laughing, and then being uninvited forever. If I try to just notice it, the images yank me in and the urge to run is almost a physical panic; I can't seem to hold them at arm's length. I want that witnessing thing to help, but honestly it feels impossible—those scenarios feel like they're already happening, so observing them seems pointless.

Therapist: It sounds like the images are really vivid, and it's like your mind is already in the scenario before you even start imagining it. I want to gently suggest something that might help you feel more connected to your body and less stuck in these thoughts. Can you try taking one tiny breath, just one, and as you do, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Don't try to change it or think about it; just notice it as it is. Sometimes, when we can anchor ourselves in the present moment, even just slightly, it can help us feel more grounded and less swept up in these thoughts.

Patient: Okay, I tried that one tiny breath—felt it for a second like a faint anchor. But almost immediately my chest tightened, my heart raced, and the images of me saying something stupid and everyone laughing just flooded back like a loop that's already playing. I want that to help, but it feels useless—if I go, I can already see the whole downward spiral and breathing doesn't change that.

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny breath did give you a momentary anchor, and that's great. Can you try something else? Let's bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body right now, where you're sitting, and the sensations in your feet on the ground. Imagine you're sitting there, and you're noticing the weight of your feet touching the earth. As you breathe out, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body through your feet, into the ground. It's not about changing your thoughts or emotions; it's just about paying attention to where you are in this moment.

Patient: I tried the feet thing—at first I noticed the weight and a tiny calm, but then my chest tightened and the images slammed right back in: heart racing, mouth dry, this urge to bolt. I keep thinking it's pointless because I can already see the whole spiral—I'll say something stupid, everyone will laugh, they'll stop inviting me, and I'll end up alone—so I avoid, but I'm really tired of avoiding and honestly I'm not sure what to do next.

Therapist: I can see that you're really exhausted with avoiding, and that's a great starting point. It's like you're acknowledging that avoidance isn't working, and that's a big step. Can we try something different? Instead of trying to change your thoughts or feelings directly, let's explore what might be driving your desire to avoid social situations in the first place. What is it about being around others that makes you feel like you're going to say something stupid or that everyone will laugh? Is it a sense of shame, fear of judgment, or something else? Sometimes, understanding the underlying motivations behind our avoidance can help us find a more effective way to move forward.

Patient: I think it's mostly shame and this intense fear of being judged—like if I fumble a joke or sound awkward, that proves I'm worthless. Ever since my kid left, I feel exposed, like that role was my anchor, so if people see me as pathetic they'll pull away and I'll be totally alone—I can already see them cutting me out. Maybe some folks would be understanding, but honestly that feels unrealistic; my mind just jumps to the disaster every time.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the shame and fear that's driving your avoidance. It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden, and it's understandable that you're worried about being judged. Can I ask you something? What do you think would happen if you weren't afraid of being judged? What would you say to yourself if you could talk to you right now, without judgment? Sometimes, when we can challenge our own judgments and criticisms, we can start to feel more grounded and less anxious. It's not about ignoring the pain or shame, but about exploring ways to work with it in a more compassionate way.

Patient: If I weren't afraid, I'd want to tell myself to relax and that one awkward moment doesn't define me — but the second I try that my brain spits out the rest: I fumble, they laugh, people stop inviting me, and I end up alone. I know that sounds brutal, but I can't make myself believe any kinder line; it just feels like lying to how things will play out. I'm tired of going around in circles and I don't see how to get past that loop.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, and that's okay. Sometimes, we need to acknowledge that we're not making progress, and that's not failing. It's actually a sign that we're on the right track. I want to suggest something that might help. Imagine, for a moment, that you're not trying to change everything right now. Imagine that you're just taking one small step forward, just one tiny step. It could be as simple as taking a deep breath, or saying a single word, like "yes." Just one small step. Can you try to imagine what that would feel like?

Patient: If I picture taking one tiny step—like saying "yes" to a coffee—I get a tiny flicker of maybe, then my chest tightens and my mouth goes dry. But right after that I can already see the rest: I trip over my words, they laugh, invitations stop, and I'm totally cut off; imagining the step just makes the disaster feel closer and inevitable. I want it to help, but honestly it just feels like I'm walking into the thing I'm most afraid of, and that's really frustrating.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're walking right into the fire, and that's really frustrating. Can I ask you to try something different? Instead of imagining the step itself, let's try to imagine what it would be like if the worst-case scenario didn't happen. Can you think of one tiny detail that might be slightly different if you tripped over your words? Maybe it's the way someone's expression changes for a second, or the sound of their laughter is slightly different. Just one tiny detail. Let's try to focus on that for a moment, and see if we can start to shift our perspective just a little bit.

Patient: When that worst‑case scenario plays on repeat, what do you think it’s really saying about what you fear losing or who you’ll be seen as—and how does that connect to what actually matters to you in those relationships? If you stayed in the room feeling anxious, what’s one small, meaningful thing you might try to do anyway?

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that the worst-case scenario is really just a story you're telling yourself about who you are and how you'll be perceived. Can we explore what's actually important to you in these relationships? What are some things that matter to you, even if they're not directly related to avoiding embarrassment or rejection? For example, is it feeling seen and heard by others, or being able to share your thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment? If you stayed in the room feeling anxious, what's one small thing that you might try to do anyway, even if it's just a tiny gesture of kindness or connection to someone else? Maybe it's as simple as asking someone how their day is going, or offering to get them a cup of coffee. Just one small thing. Can we try to imagine what that might feel like?

Patient: What matters to me is feeling seen and useful—being someone people can relax with, not someone they silently judge. If I stayed and tried one small thing, like asking someone how their day's been or offering to grab coffee, I can already see the awkward pause, the forced smile, then the laugh, and the invitations just stop coming. I know that sounds extreme, but I'm tired of avoiding and honestly I don't know how to stop my brain from making it feel inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of desperation, like you're running out of ways to avoid the anxiety. But I want to gently challenge that idea. Can you try to see if there's a way to reframe this story, just for a moment? Instead of imagining the worst-case scenario, what if you could imagine a small moment of connection, of being seen and heard by someone else? What if, instead of feeling like you're going to say something stupid and get laughed at, you could feel like you're being understood, like you're being given a chance to be yourself? It's not about avoiding the anxiety entirely, but about finding a way to approach it that feels more grounded, more compassionate. Can we try to imagine what that might feel like, even if it's just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I can picture that tiny moment—someone actually pausing and listening, and there's a warm flicker—but then my brain screams that it's fake: they'll be smiling politely now and later they'll be whispering about how weird I was, the invites will stop, and I'll end up alone again. My chest tightens just thinking about it and I'm so tired of this loop; can we slow down? I don't know how to make those predictions feel any less real.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're feeling like you're stuck in a loop, and I'm here to support you. Can I offer something? Sometimes, when we're feeling this overwhelmed, it can be helpful to try a small experiment. Let's pause for just one breath together. I want you to take one deep breath in, and one slow breath out. As you breathe out, I want you to let go of the need to think about the future, just for this one moment. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you try that with me?

(Note: The therapist is asking the patient to pause and focus on their breath, without asking them to think about their thoughts or predictions. This is an attempt to help the patient break the cycle of catastrophic thinking and observe their thoughts without judgment.)

Patient: Okay—I did that deep breath with you, and for a beat there was this tiny calm, like a crack in the noise. But almost instantly my chest tightened and the worst‑case movie crashed back in: I trip over my words, they laugh, invitations stop, and I'm completely shut out. I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now—can we slow down? I don't know how to make those images stop feeling like they're already real.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's okay to feel that way. It's like you're trying to catch your breath, but the anxiety is pulling you back in. Can I try something different? Instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, let's try to observe it as it arises, without judgment. Let's say it like this: "Oh, the worst-case scenario is playing out again." Just acknowledge it, without trying to change it or react to it. Just observe it, like a thought or a feeling. Can you try that with me? Let's focus on the present moment, and just be with what's happening, without judgment.

(Note: The therapist is trying to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and observation, without judgment, about their thoughts and feelings. The goal is to help the patient stay with the present moment, rather than getting caught up in their catastrophic thinking.)

Patient: Okay—I tried saying, "Oh, the worst‑case scenario is playing out again," and for a brief second it felt like I stepped back. Then my brain screams that it's not just a thought, it's already happening—my chest tightens, my hands tingle, my mouth goes dry and I want to bolt. It still feels like prophecy— they'll laugh, the invites stop, I'm cut off—so saying the phrase feels pointless; can we slow down? I don't know how to make this feel like "just a thought."

Therapist: I can see that saying the phrase "Oh, the worst-case scenario is playing out again" felt like a tiny breakthrough, but then it got caught up in the same cycle again. That's okay. It's like your brain is trying to protect itself from feeling vulnerable, but it's not working. Let's try to explore this further. What happens when you say the phrase, but instead of reacting to it, you just observe it? Just look at it, like a thought or a feeling. What do you notice? Is there any difference between when you're thinking "Oh no, I'm going to trip over my words" versus when you're thinking "Oh, the worst-case scenario is playing out again"? Can we start to explore that difference?

Patient: I tried that—saying it gave me a tiny sliver of distance, like I could see the thought as a pattern instead of being swallowed by it, but my body didn't back off: chest tightens, hands tingle, mouth goes dry and I want to run. The only real difference is that for half a beat I'm watching a movie instead of being in it, then my brain yanks the screen down and insists it's already real—people laugh, invites stop, I'm cut off. Labeling it doesn't make it feel like "just a thought," it still feels like prophecy. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and I don't know what to do with that pull to bolt.

Therapist: It sounds like labeling the thought, even with a small delay, still triggered the same physical response. It's like your body is primed to react to the thought, and it's hard to turn that off. Can we try something else? Instead of focusing on the thought itself, let's explore the sensation of your body right now. Where do you feel the tension in your chest? Where do you feel the tingle in your hands? Can you bring your attention to those sensations, just for a moment? Notice how they feel, without trying to change them or react to them. Just observe.

(Note: The therapist is trying to help the patient focus on their physical sensations, rather than getting caught up in their thoughts. The goal is to help the patient stay calm and focused, without getting overwhelmed by their catastrophic thinking.)

Patient: It's a hard tightness right behind my sternum, like a knot that makes my breath shallow, and my hands go tingly and a little numb at the tips. When I notice that, this rush of shame and frustration comes up — I feel stupid and like I've already messed up — and immediately my mind spits out the whole ending: they'll laugh, invitations stop, I'm cut off. I'm getting overwhelmed saying this out loud; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to do something for me. I want you to let go of the need to finish what you're saying right now. Just stop talking, for a second. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to let go of the sensation of being overwhelmed. Just notice it for a second, and then gently bring your attention back to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about talking anymore. Just be with the physical sensation of your body right now.

(Note: The therapist is asking the patient to pause and focus on their physical sensations, rather than getting caught up in their thoughts. The goal is to help the patient stay calm and focused, without feeling overwhelmed.)

Patient: I tried to stop and breathe like you said—there was a tiny loosening, then this hot shame and frustration rushed up, like some old screw‑up is shadowing everything, and my chest slammed shut again. My hands tingle, my breath gets shallow, and the movie of them laughing and cutting me off starts on repeat. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know how to just stay with the breath when that shame is so loud.

Therapist: I can see that you're really struggling to stay with the breath, and that's okay. Let's take a step back and try something different. Instead of focusing on the breath, let's try to find a tiny anchor in your body that you can touch. Can you feel your feet on the ground? Can you feel the sensation of your seat on the chair? It doesn't matter if it's just a tiny thing, but try to bring your attention to it. Just notice it for a second, and then gently bring your attention back to the sensation of your body. We can try this for a few breaths, and see if we can find something that feels more solid.

(Note: The therapist is asking the patient to find a tangible anchor in their body, rather than focusing on the breath. This is an attempt to help the patient feel more grounded and less overwhelmed by their shame and frustration.)

Patient: I tried to feel my feet and the chair—there was a tiny grounding for a second, then this hot shame and frustration surged like somebody flipped a switch, and the tightness in my chest came back full force. My hands went numb and the same movie kicked in: I trip over words, they laugh, the invites stop, and I'm shut out — it feels inevitable. I'm getting really overwhelmed by that pull to bolt; can we slow down? I don't know how to keep that anchor when the shame hijacks everything.

Therapist: I can see that the anchor isn't holding for you right now. That's okay. Let's try something else. Instead of focusing on the anchor, let's try to observe the shame and frustration as they arise. Can you watch them without judgment, without trying to push them away or change them? Just observe them as physical sensations in your body, as thoughts in your mind. Try to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it. Let's focus on the breath, just for a moment.

(Note: The therapist is asking the patient to observe their shame and frustration as they arise, without judgment or resistance. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of acceptance and curiosity about their internal experience, rather than trying to control or change it.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is watching it supposed to help when those images feel like prophecy? The second I try to observe the shame my chest tightens, my hands tingle, and my mind screams the ending: they'll laugh, invitations stop, I'm cut off. I'm really overwhelmed by that pull to bolt—can we slow down? I don't know how to just watch it without it becoming real.

Therapist: I think I may have said something that confused you. Let me try to clarify. When you say "those images feel like prophecy," I hear you saying that when you start to observe the shame and frustration, it's like it's coming true again in your mind. But what if, instead of it feeling like prophecy, you could see it as just a thought? A thought that arises in your mind, but doesn't have to define what's happening in your body or your life right now? Can you try to see it like that for just a moment? Instead of thinking "they'll laugh, invitations stop, I'm cut off," try thinking "this is just a thought. This is just what I'm thinking right now." See if that can help you feel a bit more grounded, a bit more in control.

(Note: The therapist is trying to help the patient see that the shame and frustration are just thoughts, rather than reality. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of detachment and acceptance, which can lead to a greater sense of control and well-being.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is telling myself "this is just a thought" supposed to help when the second I try it my chest tightens and that whole "they laugh, invites stop, I'm cut off" movie starts playing? Saying it's "just a thought" feels like lying to something that already feels real; the shame spikes and I can't catch my breath. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down and maybe deal with that shame and the panic first?

Therapist: I think we need to slow down here. I can see that telling yourself "this is just a thought" isn't helping right now. It's not calming you down; it's actually making things worse. Let's take a step back. Can you tell me more about what's happening right now, physically and emotionally? What does it feel like when the shame spikes and the panic sets in? Let's focus on just that right now, without trying to do anything else. Just describe it to me, and we can go from there.

(Note: The therapist is acknowledging the patient's distress and taking a more gentle approach. The goal is to help the patient feel more grounded and calm, without trying to do anything else. The therapist is focusing on the patient's physical and emotional sensations, rather than trying to teach them a specific technique.)

Patient: It's a hot, heavy pressure right behind my sternum that makes my breaths short and shallow, and my hands go tingly and a little numb at the tips. Emotionally there's this sharp shame—like I'm exposed and already screwed up—and a rolling frustration at myself that makes everything feel worse. The shame drags the movie back in immediately: they're laughing, the invites stop, I'm cut off, and I get this urgent need to flee. I don't really know how to just stay with it without panicking—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the physical sensations in your body right now. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? Just notice it as it is. As we breathe, I want you to know that you're safe, and you're exactly where you need to be. There's no need to try to do anything or change anything right now. Just be with your body and your breath. Let's focus on just that for a moment.

(Note: The therapist is focusing on helping the patient regulate their physical sensations and feel grounded, rather than trying to explore the underlying thoughts and emotions. The goal is to create a safe space for the patient to feel more comfortable and regulated before moving forward.)

Patient: I tried breathing with you—there was a tiny loosening, then this hot shame and that old failure feeling slammed back in and hijacked me; my chest shut, my hands tingled, and the movie of them laughing and cutting me off started on repeat. I'm confused—how is focusing on breath supposed to prove I'm safe when my mind already shows it's going to be true? I'm really overwhelmed right now; can we slow down and maybe try to work with the shame and that panic first?

Therapist: I can see that focusing on breath isn't helping right now. It's not surprising that your mind is still predicting a negative outcome, but that doesn't mean we should stop trying to manage your physical sensations. Can we try something else? Instead of focusing on breath, can you try to notice what's happening in your body right now, without judgment? Just notice the sensations in your chest, your hands, your breath. See if you can bring your attention to the present moment, without trying to change anything or predict the future. We can work with the shame and panic together, one small step at a time.

(Note: The therapist is acknowledging the patient's confusion and frustration, and gently guiding them back to the present moment. The goal is to help the patient become more aware of their physical sensations, without judgment, and to bring their attention to the present moment, rather than getting caught up in their thoughts and predictions.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing going to help when my brain insists it's already real? My chest's tight, breaths are shallow, my hands tingle, and this hot shame and frustration hits me like I'm already the person who messed up, and then the whole movie starts: they'll laugh, invites stop, I'm cut off. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down and actually work on that shame and panic first?

Therapist: I think we need to take a different approach here. I'm not asking you to just notice your body, I'm asking you to really feel what's happening right now. Can you try to connect with the sensation of shame and panic in your body? Can you feel the weight of it, the pressure on your chest, the tightness in your hands? Don't try to think about it, don't try to rationalize it. Just feel it. And then, without thinking about it, without trying to change it, just let it be. Let the shame and panic be, without judgment. Just be with it, for a moment.

(Note: The therapist is taking a more direct approach, focusing on helping the patient connect with the shame and panic in their body, without judgment. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of acceptance and presence in the moment, rather than trying to change their thoughts or emotions.)

Patient: I tried to really feel it—when I focus on the shame it just swells and that old failure feeling flashes up, and then the movie starts: they'll laugh, invitations stop, I'm cut off. I'm not sure I follow how just sitting with that is supposed to help—feels like I'm volunteering to live the thing I dread. Can we slow down? I need to deal with the panic and that shame spike first.

Therapist: I can see that sitting with the shame and panic is feeling overwhelming, and that's okay. I'm not asking you to do anything that feels like you're putting yourself in harm's way. However, I am asking you to try something that might feel like a tiny step forward. Can you try to acknowledge the panic and shame in your body, without trying to push them away or change them? Just notice them as they are, right now. See if you can bring some curiosity to the sensation of fear and shame, rather than trying to avoid it. I'm not asking you to do anything drastic, just to try to be with it, for a moment.

(Note: The therapist is acknowledging the patient's frustration and concern for their safety, while also encouraging them to continue exploring their emotions. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of acceptance and presence in the moment, rather than trying to avoid or change their emotions.)

Patient: Okay, I'll try. When I try to be curious the shame just floods—hot pressure behind my sternum, tingling hands, and that old failure feeling shoots up—and before I can look at it my brain plays the whole ending: they laugh, invites stop, I'm cut off. It feels impossible to be curious because the shame feels like proof, and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and work on calming the panic first?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on calming down for a moment. Can you try to notice how your body feels right now, without trying to think about it or change it? Just bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about your thoughts or emotions right now, just focus on the physical sensation of your breath. As we breathe, I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take a step back. We can work through this together, but first, let's just focus on calming down for a moment.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to breathe with you, but when I do there’s a tiny loosening and then this hot shame from that old screw‑up just slams back in; my chest clamps, my hands tingle, and the movie starts: I fumble, they laugh, invitations stop. I’m really overwhelmed—can we slow down and actually sit with the panic and that shame first? I don’t know how to just breathe it away when it already feels like it’s happening.

Therapist:  to moments, as they often change quickly in therapy. 

(Note: The therapist is asking the patient to focus on calming down physically, using the breath as a anchor. The therapist is not asking the patient to deal with their emotions directly yet. Instead, the focus is to create space and establish trust. This helps create an initial sense of safety. The therapist is aiming to reach an early goal, as a foundation, before introducing new themes, skills, and the work.)

Patient: I'm trying to breathe with you, but after a tiny loosening a hot shame from some past failure just slams back in and my chest clamps, my hands tingle, and the movie starts again. I don't see how breathing proves I'm safe when my mind already shows the ending—I trip, they laugh, invitations stop, I'm cut off. I'm really overwhelmed right now—can we slow down and actually sit with that shame and panic first? I don't know how to keep breathing when the movie feels so real.
