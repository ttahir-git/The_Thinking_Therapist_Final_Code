Patient: Um, lately I keep procrastinating a lot to avoid dealing with this grief I've been carrying — it’s worse now that I’m supposed to start a really demanding program. I put things off, feel guilty, then numb out instead of actually facing it. I don't know, I guess talking about it already feels... kind of uncomfortable.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a mix of guilt and avoidance related to grief, with an underlying discomfort about talking about it. The goal is to explore this discomfort and create space for addressing the grief.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what feels uncomfortable when you talk about this grief? Is it the emotional pain itself, or something else?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's more than just the pain — it's the fear that if I actually let myself feel it I'll fall apart and won't be able to handle the program. Procrastinating feels safer because it keeps me functional enough to get by, even if that's hollow. And honestly, there's this guilt or shame about admitting it, like I'm being weak or selfish, so talking about it gets… too close.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're revealing a complex mix of fear, guilt, shame, and avoidance related to confronting your grief. The goal is to gently address these emotions and encourage a willingness to explore the discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight of responsibility on your shoulders, and the fear of falling apart is a really powerful force for you. How would it be if, for just a moment, you let go of that fear and allowed yourself to feel the discomfort of not knowing how you'll handle things? Would that be a small enough step to make you more willing to try to explore this further?

Patient: I don't know, I guess maybe — but it’s really scary. If I let it in even for a minute I’m afraid I’ll fall apart and then I won’t be able to get through the program. I could maybe try something small, like sitting with it for a minute, but I’m skeptical it’ll help and I’m already feeling overwhelmed.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing skepticism about trying to explore the discomfort, given your fear of falling apart. The goal is to help you identify a small, more manageable step that could increase your willingness to experiment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on that small step: just sitting with the discomfort for a minute. Can you imagine doing that right now, right here? Just sitting quietly and allowing yourself to feel whatever arises without trying to change it or push it away? Would that be a more manageable place to start?

Patient: I don't know, I guess maybe I could try for a minute, but it's really scary — I keep thinking if I let it in I'll fall apart. I'm already feeling kind of overwhelmed; could we make it structured, like a 30-second timer and you check in after? That feels more manageable.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're identifying a desire for structure and a specific time frame to make the experience less overwhelming. The goal is to acknowledge this need while also introducing an ACT technique.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 30-second timer. When the timer starts, I'd like you to take a deep breath in, and then when it goes off, I'll check in with you. You'll just sit quietly and allow yourself to feel whatever arises without trying to change it or push it away. When you're ready, we can start the timer. Are you willing to give it a try?

Patient: Okay... I don't know, I guess I can try. Start the 30 seconds when you're ready — I'll take a deep breath and try to sit with whatever comes up, but I'm already nervous about it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're about to engage with the ACT exercise, and you've expressed some nervousness. The goal is to check in with you after the timer goes off to assess how the experience was and to see where you'd like to go next.

Therapist Answer:
Ready? Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, just start sitting quietly with whatever comes up. I'll start the timer now... Go.

Patient: Okay... I tried to sit with it. My chest got tight and I felt kind of shaky, and images of them just flickered through my head — then I had this urge to reach for my phone and do something distracting. For a few seconds it felt like there was actual sadness there, but then the shame kicked in and I started thinking this was pointless. I don't know, I guess it felt... messy and not obviously helpful. Can we try another short one but with something grounding, like a breath count or me naming what I’m feeling as it comes?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've described the exercise, including the physical sensations and thoughts that arose. You've also identified a desire to try something different, focusing on grounding techniques. The goal is to adapt the exercise to better support you.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the exercise was more intense than you expected, and the feelings were overwhelming. Let's try something different. I'd like you to focus on your breath, and I'll guide you through a process called " labeling". As you notice each sensation or thought, try to identify exactly what it is. Just say it to yourself, without judgment. For example, "I'm feeling tightness in my chest," or "I'm thinking 'I should be doing something else'." Let's start with a 5-1-1 exercise. I'll count down from 5, and then you'll describe your breath and any sensations or thoughts that arise. Are you willing to try?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try. I'm skeptical and kinda nervous about it — start when you're ready and I'll try to describe my breath and whatever comes up, but it might be messy.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing skepticism and nervousness about trying a new exercise, which is understandable given your past experiences. The goal is to acknowledge your concerns and gently encourage you to give it a try.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with the 5-1-1 exercise. I'll count down from 5, and when I get to 1, I'd like you to take a deep breath in and start describing your breath, noticing its texture, temperature, or any other sensory details. Then, as you exhale, start speaking out loud, saying what sensations or thoughts arise in this moment. It's okay if it feels messy or uncomfortable – that's the goal. When you're ready, I'll start the count. Go ahead and take a deep breath in... 5...

Patient: 4... my breath's shallow and kind of cool at the nostrils, and my chest feels tight. I notice the thought "I should be doing something else" and a wave of sadness — I don't know, I guess I also feel guilty for even sitting here.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions that are arising, which is a great start. The goal is to continue exploring these experiences without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like we're getting a good sense of what's happening in this moment. Let's try to label these sensations and thoughts more specifically. You mentioned your breath is shallow and cool, and that's a great detail. Now, when you said "I should be doing something else", you could say that too, just as it is. For example, "I'm thinking 'I should be doing something else'." And when it comes to the sadness, you could say that too, just as you feel it. You even mentioned feeling guilty, which is a great insight. Just say it out loud: "I'm feeling guilty for even sitting here." Let's keep going with the 5-1-1 exercise. 3...

Patient: 2... 1... I'm breathing, it's shallow and cool at my nostrils. I'm feeling tightness in my chest, sadness, and guilty—I'm thinking "I should be doing something else" and "I'm being weak," and I already have this urge to grab my phone. I don't know, I guess it feels messy and kind of overwhelming.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've completed the 5-1-1 exercise, and it's clear that the physical sensations and thoughts are intense. The goal now is to acknowledge the overwhelm and find a way to move forward.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if it feels messy and overwhelming. That's a big part of this process. You've identified a lot of complex emotions and thoughts, and it's not always easy to know where to start. I want to check in with you about how you're feeling right now. Can you tell me what's most pressing for you? What's the one thing that you're thinking, feeling, or sensing that you'd like to explore further? Don't worry too much about the specifics right now – just let's identify something that's been on your mind or in your body. Then, we can see where we go from there.

Patient: I don't know, I guess what's most pressing is the guilt — like I'm being weak for using procrastination to avoid the grief. I'm scared that if I actually deal with it I'll fall apart and then I won't be able to handle starting the program.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the guilt as a pressing concern, and it's linked to a fear of falling apart and being unable to handle the program. The goal is to gently explore this fear and explore alternative ways of thinking about it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the guilt is tied to a fear of not being strong enough to handle the grief. That's a really tough one to confront. Can I ask you something? What would it mean to you if you were to allow yourself to fall apart right now, in this moment, and then somehow still find a way to show up for the program? Is that even possible, or is that a catastrophic thought for you?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it feels catastrophic. If I let myself fall apart I picture missing deadlines, losing my spot in the program, and everyone deciding I'm not cut out for this — then I'd be stuck and probably worse off than now. Maybe, in theory, I could pick myself up later if there was a concrete plan or someone to help, but I'm really skeptical and kind of ashamed to even say that. I don't know, can we talk about what a very small safety plan would even look like?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a catastrophic thinking pattern, and also acknowledging shame and skepticism. The goal is to gently explore small safety plans without relying on shame or negative self-talk.

Therapist Answer:
I think it's great that you're willing to explore the idea of a small safety plan. Before we dive into that, I want to acknowledge the shame you're feeling right now. It's understandable that you might feel that way, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable about your emotions. Can I reassure you that this is not about being a "crisis" or a "weak" person? This is about exploring ways to make small, manageable steps in the face of uncertainty. Your safety and well-being are what matter most. Now, let's talk about that small safety plan. What would it mean to you to have a tiny, concrete idea of how to take care of yourself, even if it's just for a minute or two? Is there something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, noticing your surroundings, or doing a quick physical activity that could help you feel more grounded?

Patient: I don't know, I guess a tiny safety plan that might feel doable is: set a 3-minute timer for slow breaths (in for 4, out for 4), then do a 5-minute walk or stretch, and write one very small, concrete task on a sticky note (like "email program coordinator") so I don't feel like everything's collapsing. I'm skeptical it’ll fix anything long-term, but I could try that and see if it makes the urges to numb less intense — and honestly, I'm already feeling kind of overwhelmed just saying this.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a tiny safety plan that might help you feel more grounded and manageable. The goal is to acknowledge the skepticism and overwhelm while encouraging you to take small steps towards building confidence.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely understandable that you're skeptical about the effectiveness of this plan, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed by the thought of taking action. However, I want to encourage you to take this tiny step, just this once. The goal is not to fix everything long-term, but to try something small that might help you feel more in control of your urges. Remember, this is about experimenting and finding what works for you, not about achieving perfection. By taking this small step, you're already showing up for yourself and acknowledging that you want to feel better. Let's commit to trying this tiny safety plan for the next few sessions, and see how it goes. We can always adjust or explore other options if needed. For now, let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Shall we start with the 3-minute timer for slow breaths?

Patient: I don't know, I guess... okay, let's try the 3-minute timer, but I'm really nervous about it. Can you check in at the 1- and 2-minute marks? I get this strong urge to bail, so having you check in would make it feel a bit safer.

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've expressed a strong need for reassurance and support, which is completely understandable. The goal is to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your emotions and build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try the 3-minute timer. I'm here to support you, and I'll definitely check in with you at the 1- and 2-minute marks. That might help you feel more grounded and in control. Let's get started. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, I'll count down from 3. When you're ready to start, just say "start." Remember, this is just a tiny step, and we can always adjust or stop if you need to. Take care of yourself, and let's do this. 3...

Patient: Start. Okay... (deep breath). My breaths feel shallow and a bit heavy, my chest is tight, and I'm thinking "this won't help" — I don't know, I guess I'm already a bit zoned out. Can you check in at the 1-minute mark?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're already experiencing some discomfort and self-doubt, which is completely normal. The goal is to gently bring you back to the present moment and help you establish a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay that you're zoning out a bit – that's actually a good sign. Sometimes, we just need to acknowledge our thoughts and feelings before we can start to shift. Take another deep breath in, and when you're ready, I'll count down from 1. When you're ready to start focusing on your breath again, just say "continue." Remember, I'm here to support you. Your breaths might feel shallow and heavy right now, but that's okay. Just bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. One...

Patient: Continue. My breaths are still shallow and cool at the nostrils and my chest feels tight. I'm thinking "this won't help" and keep wanting to bail and check my phone — I don't know, I guess I'm trying to stay with it but it's taking a lot of effort and feels really thin.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain focus and motivation, which is understandable given the resistance you're feeling. The goal is to gently acknowledge the effort and encourage you to persevere, even if it feels thin.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that this tiny step is taking a lot of effort from you, and that's okay. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like this – like the exercise is thin and unhelpful. Can you try to lean into that feeling for just a moment? Say it with me: "I'm feeling like this is thin and unhelpful right now." Sometimes, by acknowledging and accepting our emotions, we can start to create a small opening for something new to emerge. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. I'm here with you, and we can take this one breath at a time. You've made it to the 2-minute mark. I'll check in again at the end of the 2 minutes. Just take another deep breath in and continue...

Patient: I'm feeling like this is thin and unhelpful right now. My breaths are shallow, my chest is tight, and my mind keeps darting — I keep wanting to check my phone. I don't know, I guess I'm barely holding on and it's taking a lot of effort. Can we do something concrete now, like a quick grounding (name five things I can see) or slow the pace?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to maintain focus. The goal is to provide a concrete and gentle intervention to help you regain some control and composure.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to take concrete steps. Let's try a grounding exercise to help you shift your focus away from your thoughts and emotions. I'll guide you through it. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say "five." Can you name five things you can see right now in your immediate environment? It can be something as simple as a chair, a book, a picture on the wall – anything that comes to mind. Just focus on the visual details, and try to let go of your thoughts for a moment.

Patient: Five: a chipped mug, a wilting plant, my laptop with a sticker on the corner, a sticky note that says "email program coordinator," and a lamp. I keep glancing at my phone and my hands feel jittery — I don't know, I guess I'm still anxious and it's hard to focus.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're successfully focusing on your five chosen objects, but anxiety and distraction are still present. The goal is to use the grounding exercise as a temporary reprieve and then explore ways to address the underlying anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you were able to name five things you can see. Can you take a moment to notice each of those objects, really focus on them? Imagine the texture of the chipped mug, the wilted plant's leaves, the sticker on your laptop, the sticky note, and the lamp's shape. Just observe them, without judgment. Now, I want to gently ask you to bring your attention to your hands. Can you notice the sensation of your fingers, the feeling of your palms, the way your hands are holding the air? Just focus on the physical sensations in your hands for a moment. We can try to slow the pace of your breath together, too. I'll guide you through a slow, deep breathing exercise. Just breathe in for a count of 4, and then out for a count of 4. Ready? Inhale...

Patient: Okay... inhale — 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale — 1, 2, 3, 4. My breath's still kinda shallow, chest tight, and my hands feel jittery; my mind keeps jerking to my phone and thinking "this won't help." I don't know, I guess the grounding helped a bit but I'm still anxious and scattered — can we just do the sticky-note thing now? Like, I'll write "email program coordinator" and then we check in after that, because breathing feels thin and I don't trust myself to sit with it longer.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The grounding exercise provided some temporary relief, but the underlying anxiety and distraction are still present. The goal is to acknowledge the request for a concrete action and adapt to the situation.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad the grounding helped a bit, even if it's not enough right now. Let's try the sticky-note approach as you suggested. Take a moment to write the phrase "email program coordinator" on the sticky note, and then let's take a brief check-in. We'll see how you're feeling and then proceed from there. As you write the phrase, I want you to take a deep breath in and out, and try to focus on the physical sensation of the pen moving across the paper. Just observe the movement, the sound of the pen, and the sensation of the words on the page. When you're ready, we'll check in.

Patient: Okay, I wrote "email program coordinator" on the sticky note. My hand was kind of shaky writing it, my chest is tight, and I keep glancing at my phone — I guess it made things feel a little less huge but I'm still really anxious and skeptical. I don't know, maybe the next tiny step could be drafting one sentence I might actually send, or a 3-minute timer to write it, but I'm nervous about actually hitting send.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The sticky-note exercise provided a brief moment of calm, but the underlying anxiety and skepticism are still present. The goal is to acknowledge the request for a concrete action and adapt to the situation.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you were able to write the phrase on the sticky note. It sounds like it brought you a small sense of relief, but you're still feeling anxious and skeptical. Let's try to break down the task of sending the email into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of drafting the entire email, let's start with just one sentence. Just one sentence. Can you think of one sentence that you might send to the program coordinator? It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be one sentence. Take your time, and we can work with it from there. We can even add a timer if you'd like, like a 3-minute timer to write the sentence. What do you think?

Patient: I don't know, I guess a 3-minute timer to write one sentence feels doable. I'm really anxious — my hands are jittery and I keep wanting to check my phone or bail — so can you check in at the halfway mark? Also, I don't want to promise to send it today; drafting only would feel safer.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've agreed to a 3-minute timer for writing a single sentence, with a check-in at the halfway mark to help you stay on track. You're expressing high anxiety, with physical symptoms like jittery hands, and a strong desire to avoid the email altogether. The goal is to provide reassurance and support while still allowing you to take small, incremental steps towards sending the email.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start the 3-minute timer. You'll write one sentence, and I'll check in with you after 1.5 minutes. We'll go from there. Remember, we're just drafting one sentence. You're not committing to sending the email yet. You're taking small steps to build confidence. When you're ready, take a deep breath, and start writing. I'll be here when you need me. 3...

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Maybe: "Hello, I'm writing to confirm my spot in the program and ask about any upcoming deadlines or materials I should prepare." I don't know, I guess that's messy — my hands are shaky and I keep glancing at my phone; please check in at the 1.5-minute mark.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a significant step by writing a sentence, which is a great accomplishment given your anxiety and physical symptoms. The goal is to acknowledge your efforts and check in with you before the timer expires.

Therapist Answer:
That's a good start! Your sentence is clear, and it's a great foundation for drafting the rest of the email. I can see that you're still feeling some anxiety, and it's understandable. Let's check in again. You've got another 30 seconds to go before the timer expires. How are you feeling right now? Take a deep breath, and let me know if you're ready to continue or if you need a moment to collect yourself.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'm still shaky and kind of spaced out — my hands won't stop jittering. I can try to finish tweaking that one sentence but only as a draft; I'm not ready to send anything. Can you check back in like 30 seconds when I try to polish it?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a desire to complete the draft but not to send it yet, which is a good starting point. The goal is to provide reassurance and support while still acknowledging your limitations and reluctance to proceed.

Therapist Answer:
It's completely normal to feel shaky and spaced out right now. Take your time, and let's focus on polishing that one sentence. You've already made good progress, and I'm here to support you. Go ahead and tweak it as you see fit. When you're ready, I'll check in with you again in about 30 seconds. Try to get it just right, and then we can move forward from there. Just take a deep breath and focus on that sentence for now.

Patient: Okay... I tweaked it to: "Hello — I'm writing to confirm my spot in the program and to ask about any upcoming deadlines or materials I should prepare." I don't know, I guess it still feels awkward and my hands are shaking. Can you check back in 30 seconds while I try to breathe and decide if I want to keep it as a draft?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made some subtle tweaks to the sentence, and it's starting to feel a bit more polished. The goal is to provide a gentle check-in and see how you're feeling before making a decision about whether to proceed with the draft.

Therapist Answer:
You've made some nice adjustments to the sentence. It's looking a bit more natural and clear. I can see that you're still feeling some physical tension, but you seem to be taking a moment to breathe and collect yourself. Take your time. Go ahead and decide whether you want to keep this as a draft or move on. If you need to, you can always start over from scratch. Just take a deep breath and see what feels right for now.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'll keep it as a draft for now. My hands are still shaky and I'm pretty anxious — feels like I might bail if I try to push it. Can we make a tiny next-step plan? Maybe: 1) set a 10‑minute block tomorrow to re-read/tweak; 2) if I'm still too anxious after that, don't send but copy the sentence into a "send later" note and do three slow breaths; 3) check in with you or a friend before deciding to hit send. I'm skeptical, but I can try that. Can you help me write that as a short, doable plan?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've expressed a desire to move forward, but with a clear acknowledgment of your anxiety and reluctance to proceed. The goal is to create a gentle, manageable plan that allows you to take small steps towards sending the email.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a great plan. Here's a possible way to write it down:

"Tomorrow, I'll set aside a 10-minute block to re-read and tweak the draft. If I'm still feeling too anxious after that, I'll do the following:

* Copy the sentence into a'send later' note
* Take three slow, deep breaths
* Check in with you or a friend before deciding whether to hit send"

This plan is specific, manageable, and allows you to take small steps towards sending the email. It also acknowledges your anxiety and provides a clear exit strategy if you're still feeling overwhelmed. By writing it down, you're committing to taking action and can see yourself making progress. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know, I guess that sounds... doable? I'm skeptical it'll actually make me hit send, but having the tiny steps makes it feel less like everything's collapsing. I'm kind of wiped and overwhelmed right now — can we slow the pace and have you check in tomorrow at a specific time so I actually follow through?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing a sense of relief that the plan feels doable, but also acknowledging that skepticism. The goal is to provide a gentle nudge and create a sense of accountability.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow the pace and create a clear plan for the next steps. I'm glad you're feeling a bit more grounded after our conversation today. To help you stay on track, I'd like to propose the following:

"Tomorrow, I'll check in with you at 2 PM sharp. We'll go through the plan together, and you'll commit to taking the first step. Let's make a promise to each other to make good on that commitment. Sound good?"

This approach creates a clear expectation and sets a specific time for checking in. It also acknowledges that you need time to recover and process, and allows you to start small. By checking in at the same time every day, we can create a sense of rhythm and help you build momentum towards your goal. What do you think?

Patient: I don't know, I guess 2 PM could work — having you check in actually makes me more likely to do the 10‑minute block, even if I'm skeptical. I'm pretty wiped and anxious, so can we keep the check‑in super short (like 5–10 minutes) and just confirm whether I opened/tweaked the draft or at least copied it into "send later"? If I can't make it I'll try to message, but I probably won't promise anything — could you set a reminder for me?
