Patient: I'm in my late twenties, an accountant, and lately I've been dealing with PTSD after some job instability—social situations have become really overwhelming. I keep avoiding gatherings with friends because the anxiety gets so intense, though my colleagues have been somewhat supportive at work. Honestly, I've tried therapy before and I'm skeptical—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: You've had some negative experiences with therapy before, and that's totally fair. But what I want to explore with you is how your avoidance of social situations is affecting your life. It sounds like the anxiety is becoming quite intense, to the point where you're avoiding important connections with friends. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in these situations, and how you feel afterwards?

(Note: The goal is to explore the avoidance behavior and workability of current anxiety, without immediately challenging the skeptical attitude. By asking open-ended questions and showing genuine interest, the therapist can start to build trust and create a safe space for the patient to explore their feelings.)

Patient: When I'm at gatherings my heart speeds up, my hands go tingly, and a memory of the job stuff pops into my head so I feel like everyone's silently judging me. I clam up, avoid eye contact, and usually either leave early or make an excuse to skip them entirely. Afterwards I'm exhausted and guilty, like I missed out and let people down, which just makes the next invite feel worse. I've talked about this before though—I'm skeptical: how is talking about it supposed to actually help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're not just avoiding these situations because they're uncomfortable, but also because you feel like you're failing in some way. You mention that the guilt and exhaustion afterwards make the next invite feel worse. I want to explore that sense of self-criticism a bit further. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to "let people down"? Is that something you've always believed about yourself, or is it something that's developed over time?

(Note: The goal is to gently explore the role of shame and self-compassion in the patient's avoidance behavior, rather than immediately addressing the avoidance itself. By focusing on the emotional experience, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater sense of understanding and empathy, which can lead to greater willingness to explore their emotions and behaviors.)

Patient: When I say I "let people down" I mean I see myself as the one who should be reliable and fun, but I bail or freeze and then feel like everyone thinks I'm flaky or weak. It wasn't always like this — it got a lot worse after the job stuff; losing that stability made me feel like I can't keep anything together, so now every small social slip feels huge. Afterwards I just ruminate and shame myself, which makes the next invite feel impossible. But honestly, I keep wondering — how is talking about that supposed to actually help?

Therapist: I think it's really helpful that you're willing to explore this further, even if it feels like a rehashing of old stuff. I want to introduce something that might sound a bit strange, but bear with me. When you say things like "I let people down," what if I told you that those thoughts are actually just thoughts? They're not necessarily reflections of reality. They're just thoughts that are happening right now, in this moment. Can you try to observe those thoughts, without trying to act on them or identify with them?
(Note: The goal is to introduce the concept of defusion, which can help the patient begin to see their thoughts as mere thoughts, rather than reflections of reality. By asking the patient to observe their thoughts without judgment, the therapist can help them develop a greater sense of detachment, which can lead to greater psychological flexibility.)

Patient: I get the idea — I've heard "thoughts are just thoughts" before, but when I'm at a gathering the thought "they think I'm a mess" hits like a punch. I can try to notice it now: "I'm flaky" — yeah, I can name it, but naming it doesn't stop my heart racing or the urge to bolt. How is noticing supposed to actually stop the panic? I'm willing to try, but I'm worried this will just be more talking that doesn't change anything.

Therapist: It makes sense that you're feeling a bit skeptical about how this might help. The truth is, defusion isn't a magic fix that's going to make all your problems disappear. But what it can do is help you develop a greater sense of awareness and acceptance of your thoughts and physical sensations. One way to start doing that is to try something called "awareness of the present moment." Can you tell me exactly what's happening in your body right now, as we sit here talking? Where are you feeling the physical sensations, like the racing of your heart or the tension in your muscles?
(Note: The goal is to help the patient develop greater awareness of their bodily experiences, and to introduce a small, low-stakes exercise to help them cultivate greater acceptance and acceptance. By asking the patient to focus on their physical sensations, the therapist can help them develop a greater sense of presence and awareness, which can lead to greater psychological flexibility.)

Patient: My chest feels tight and my heart's racing, my hands go tingly, my throat closes up and my shoulders hike up like I'm bracing for impact—my breathing gets really shallow. Naming that stuff makes me feel a tiny bit less frantic, but it doesn't take away the urge to bolt or the heat of shame. How is sitting with these sensations supposed to actually reduce the panic? I'm already kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I can see that you're still feeling a lot of tension right now. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, and it's great that you're recognizing how you're feeling. Let's take a deep breath together, and see if we can find a way to slow down a bit. Instead of trying to talk about everything at once, let's just focus on one thing. Can you tell me more about what's happening in your body right now, without trying to name or label it? Just notice the sensations, and see if you can describe them in simple terms.
(Note: The goal is to acknowledge the patient's frustration and overwhelm, while also encouraging them to continue exploring their experiences in a small and manageable way. By focusing on the physical sensations, and using a more gentle and slow-paced approach, the therapist can help the patient build greater trust and confidence in the exercise.)

Patient: Okay—there’s a fluttering in my chest, like something’s beating too hard and fast, my hands feel tingly and a bit numb, and my breath is shallow like I’m not getting full air. My shoulders are tight and hunched, and my vision sort of narrows, like everything’s moving away. I don’t know exactly how saying that out loud helps, but focusing on it makes me a little less frantic—can we stay here for a minute? I’m worried if we rush I'll just clam up.

Therapist: You're doing a great job of noticing what's happening in your body. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of tension, but also a sense of relief that comes from focusing on your physical sensations. I want to support you in staying here for a minute, rather than rushing to get to the next thing. Can you tell me more about what it's like to be with these sensations, without trying to change them or move on? Just notice the sensations, the feeling of your breath, the sound of your own voice... Can you just be with this for a little while longer?
(Note: The goal is to maintain a gentle and supportive pace, while also encouraging the patient to continue exploring their experiences in a way that feels meaningful to them. By focusing on the patient's verbal cues, the therapist can ensure that the patient feels comfortable and supported throughout the exercise.)

Patient: Okay... I'm trying. The flutter in my chest is still there but maybe a bit softer, and my breaths feel a little deeper when I actually pay attention. Being with it makes me notice how much I tense up, but I keep getting stuck on the thought "they think I'm a mess" — how is sitting with this actually going to help me not run? Can we keep going slowly? I'm worried it'll just make me dwell.

Therapist: It's great that you're noticing the changes in your physical sensations. The flutter in your chest is softer now, and your breaths are deeper when you're aware of them. That's progress. Now, I want to talk to you about the thought that's been sticking with you. You mentioned it's "they think I'm a mess." Can you tell me more about what that thought feels like for you right now? What happens when you think that thought? Does it make you feel anxious, or is there something else going on?
(Note: The goal is to gently introduce the concept of defusion, while also acknowledging the patient's concerns and willingness to move slowly. By asking the patient to explore their thought more deeply, the therapist can help the patient begin to see their thought as just a thought, rather than a reflection of reality.)

Patient: It hits like a rush — heat in my chest, my voice goes thin, I tense up and everything narrows to one goal: get out. Afterwards I stew and shame myself, which just makes the next invite worse. But seriously, how is talking about this supposed to stop me from bolting when it happens? Can we try something practical I can do in the moment?

Therapist: I can see why you'd want a more practical solution right now. It's understandable that you're feeling anxious about bolting in the moment. Let's try to find a way to make the insights from our conversation more concrete for you. One thing that might be helpful is to develop a personal mantra or phrase that you can use when you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious. Something simple like "I am okay" or "I can take this step" might be enough to give you a sense of calm and confidence. Let's experiment with that for a moment. Can you repeat the phrase to yourself, just for a second?
(Note: The goal is to find a way to make the insights from the exercise more tangible and helpful for the patient. By introducing a personal mantra or phrase, the therapist can help the patient develop a tool that they can use in the moment to manage their anxiety and bolting.)

Patient: Okay... "I am okay" — I can say that. It kind of sounds empty though; my chest's still racing, my hands are shaking, and my mind keeps jumping around. How is repeating that supposed to stop the urge to bolt? Can we try something quick and practical I can actually use in the moment at a party?

Therapist: I can see that repeating the mantra isn't enough to calm you down right now. Let's try something else. In the moment when you start to feel like bolting, what's the first physical sensation you notice? Is it a tightening in your shoulders, a racing heart, or something else? Let's focus on just that one sensation for a second. Can you notice it, without trying to do anything about it yet?
(Note: The goal is to introduce a simple and effective strategy that the patient can use to manage their anxiety and bolting in real-life situations. By focusing on a single physical sensation, the therapist can help the patient develop greater awareness and acceptance of their bodily experiences, which can lead to greater psychological flexibility.)

Patient: Usually it's my throat that tightens first — like I can't swallow — then a hot rush in my chest and my breathing gets shallow. When that hits my vision narrows and I just lock on exit routes. How is just noticing that supposed to stop me from running? If there's a real 20–30 second thing I can do in that moment, say it straight — I'm jittery and need something concrete.

Therapist: Here's what I want you to do in that moment: as soon as you feel your throat start to tighten, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it, just notice it. Do this for just a second or two. Then, when you're ready, slowly look around the room and notice what's there. Just observe it, without thinking about it. Can you do that for me?
(Note: The goal is to introduce a simple and effective technique that the patient can use to manage their anxiety and bolting in real-life situations. By focusing on deep breathing and observation, the therapist can help the patient develop greater awareness and acceptance of their bodily experiences, which can lead to greater psychological flexibility. This technique is designed to be quick, easy to remember, and actionable in the moment.)

Patient: Okay… I'll try. (Breathes in through my nose, out through my mouth.) That actually eases the tightness a little — my chest softens and my shoulders drop a bit — but when I look around I notice the lamp, the couch, someone laughing and my brain instantly says “they're judging.” It helps a tiny bit but I'm still jittery and distracted; can we make this even simpler — like a one-line thing I can use fast that actually grounds me in the moment?

Therapist: Here's a one-line thing you can say to yourself when you start to feel jittery: "This is my body, not my mind." Just say it to yourself, without thinking about it, and focus on the physical sensation of the words on your tongue.
(Note: The goal is to introduce a simple, one-line technique that the patient can use quickly to manage their anxiety and bolting. By focusing on the physical sensation of the words, the therapist can help the patient develop a greater sense of bodily awareness and reduce the influence of their mind.)

Patient: I said it out loud—“This is my body, not my mind”—and for a second my breathing calmed, but then this stupid flash of that thing I screwed up stole in and I felt that hot shame so fast I couldn't focus. How is that supposed to stop me from sprinting for the exit when that hits? I'm jittery and annoyed—can we make it something that actually breaks that loop in the moment?

Therapist: I want to try something different. When you start to feel that flash of shame or the urge to sprint for the exit, I want you to do something completely opposite. Instead of trying to push the feeling away or focus on it, I want you to make a small, deliberate movement towards the person next to you. It can be a nod, a smile, a slight lean forward. Just a tiny, physical acknowledgement of their presence. Can you do that for me?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a new technique that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and physical sensations that lead to bolting. By making a deliberate, opposite movement, the therapist is trying to help the patient shift their focus away from the shame and anxiety and towards the present moment, and the people around them.)

Patient: I can try, but it feels weird and forced. When that shame flash hits I freeze up—I'll manage a tiny nod or half-smile, but my heart's still racing and my hands are shaking, so it doesn't really break the loop. How is that supposed to stop the panic? If we're going to do this, give me one exact, in-the-moment move that actually reduces the surge—say it straight and simple.

Therapist: Touch your thumb to your index finger. Just touch them together, without thinking about it, and hold for a second. Do this when you start to feel that shame flash or the urge to sprint for the exit.

(Note: The goal is to introduce a simple, concrete action that can interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and physical sensations. By making a brief, tactile contact between the thumb and index finger, the therapist is trying to help the patient ground themselves in the present moment and reduce the surge of anxiety.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—touch my thumb to my index finger? Okay, I'm doing it now, it's tiny and kind of dumb-feeling. For a second my hand steadied, then that stupid flash of that thing I screwed up came in and I felt hot shame and shaky all over. How is that actually supposed to stop me from sprinting for the exit when that hits?

Therapist: I want you to look at me right now. Just look at my face. See my eyes, my mouth, my expression. Just look at me.

Patient: I'm trying, but my eyes keep darting away—when I try to hold your gaze that stupid flash of that thing I screwed up rushes back and I feel hot shame, my chest freezes and I want to bolt. How is staring at your face actually supposed to help with that rush? Can we do something smaller—like I keep the thumb-to-index touch and you tell me one thing to look for on your face so it feels less like a test?

Therapist: Let's keep the thumb-to-index touch. I want you to focus on the tiny wrinkles around my eyes, just above my nose. Can you find those wrinkles and look at them for a second?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a specific, concrete cue that the patient can focus on, which is less overwhelming and more manageable. By focusing on the wrinkles, the therapist is trying to help the patient develop a greater sense of awareness and calm.)

Patient: I'm trying—thumb to index, looking for the tiny wrinkles—but my eyes keep flicking away and that stupid flash of the thing I screwed up rushes back, my chest tightens and I feel hot shame. I'm not sure I follow how staring at wrinkles is supposed to stop that rush; it just feels a little dumb and kind of makes me more aware of how shaky I am. It steadies my hand a hair, but I'm still jittery—give me one simple line or cue I can say to myself while I do this that actually breaks the loop.

Therapist: Say to yourself: "Let it pass." Repeat it quietly, slowly, and genuinely while you look at my face and keep the thumb-to-index touch.

Patient: Okay—thumb to finger, looking at the wrinkles... "Let it pass." For a beat my hand steadied and my breath loosened, but then that stupid flash of that thing I screwed up slammed back and the shame burned so fast my chest clenched and I almost bolted. I don't get how that one line actually breaks the loop when the shame hits that hard—I'm confused and annoyed, can we try something that actually stops the surge instead of just… hoping it fades?

Therapist: Let's try something new. For the next few seconds, I want you to focus on your breath. Just feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Try to notice the sensation of each breath, the rise and fall of your chest, the feeling of the air on your skin. Don't try to control it, just observe it. Can you do that for me?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a new technique that is more direct and tangible, one that focuses on the physical sensation of the breath. By focusing on the breath, the therapist is trying to help the patient shift their attention away from the shame and anxiety, and onto a more calming and grounding sensation.)

Patient: Okay — I'll try. (Breathes.) My breaths are shallow but when I focus they get a bit deeper and my shoulders drop a hair, so that helps for like two seconds — then this hot shame thing rushes back and everything tightens. I don't get how just watching my breath is supposed to stop me from sprinting; give me one exact, 20–30 second move or phrase I can do in the moment that actually breaks the surge.

Therapist: For the next 20 seconds, I want you to slowly and deliberately exhale through your nose, and as you do, say to yourself: "Ground, one breath, ground." Just focus on the sensation of the air leaving your body, and the words. Don't think about anything else. Just do this: breathe in, hold, breathe out, "Ground, one breath, ground."

Patient: Alright—I did it: slow exhale through my nose, saying "Ground, one breath, ground." For a few seconds my chest eased and my shoulders dropped, but then that stupid flash of the thing I screwed up slammed back and the shame heated up so fast I almost bolted. I don't get how this is supposed to stop it when that happens—what's one, concrete thing I do right then at a party that actually keeps me there, not just for five seconds?

Therapist: When that flash of shame hits and you feel the urge to bolt, I want you to do one simple thing: take a small step towards the host or the person who invited you to the party. Just take one tiny step, towards them. It can be as small as moving your foot, or as small as taking a tiny step forward. Just take that step, and look at them for a second. That's it.

Patient: Okay... I'm not sure I follow—take a tiny step toward the host? How is that supposed to help when my chest's already pounding and that thing I screwed up slams back so fast I can barely think? If the host is across the room or I'm already edging for the door, moving forward feels impossible and like it'd just draw attention. Can we slow down and make this exactly concrete—how big is the step, and what do I say or do while I take it if I feel exposed?

Therapist: Let's break it down. I want you to take a tiny step towards the host, but here's the key: you're not going to move towards them right away. You're going to take one tiny step towards the wall or the edge of the room, just to create some distance between yourself and the door. Don't move towards the host yet. Just take that tiny step. As you do, I want you to say to yourself: "One small step, I can do this." Just say those words, slowly and quietly, as you take that tiny step. Don't think about anything else. Just focus on the sensation of your foot moving, and the words. Can you do that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—move toward the wall, not the host? Okay, I'm doing it: tiny shuffle of my foot and quietly saying "One small step, I can do this." For a second my breath eased and my hand steadied, but then that stupid flash of the thing I screwed up hit and the shame spiked so fast I almost bolted. How is that supposed to stop me when the surge comes on like that? If I'm already edging for the door or the room's packed, what exactly do I do—make the step bigger, pretend I tripped, or what?

Therapist: I want you to focus on your breath, and I want you to use a different phrase. When you feel that flash of shame and your body starts to tense up, I want you to say to yourself: "Breathe, I am here." Just say those words, slowly and quietly, as you take a deep breath in. Don't think about anything else. Just focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the words. If you're already edging for the door, don't try to move towards the host or the center of the room. Just take a small step back, if you need to, and find a new spot to stand. Just take one tiny step away from the door, and then look around you, slowly. Can you do that?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a new phrase and focus on the breath, while also providing a more concrete and immediate action to manage physical tension. The therapist is encouraging the patient to take small steps back if necessary, to create some distance between themselves and the source of their anxiety.)

Patient: Okay—I can try, but I'm already jittery and my mind's all over the place. I take a breath and whisper "Breathe, I am here" and it helps for a beat, then that flash of the thing I screwed up slams back and I want to bolt. How is stepping back or saying that actually supposed to stop me in the three seconds when my chest tightens and I'm at the door? I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and give me one exact, 3‑second thing to do, step by step?

Therapist: I want you to take one specific action, just one thing, that you can do for exactly 3 seconds. When you feel that flash of shame and your body starts to tense up, I want you to look down at your feet. Just look at the ground in front of you. Take one deep breath in, and then hold it for a second. And then, just for a second, look at the toes of your left shoe. Just the toes. That's it. Just those 3 seconds. Can you do that?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a very specific and concrete action that can help the patient stay present and focused for just a brief moment. By focusing on the toes of the left shoe, the therapist is trying to help the patient ground themselves in the present moment and reduce the intensity of their anxiety.)

Patient: Okay... I'm doing it: looking down, deep breath in, hold—now at the toes of my left shoe. For a second my chest eased, my hands steadied a bit, but then that stupid flash of that thing I screwed up slammed back and the shame just hit so fast I almost bolted. How is staring at my shoe for three seconds actually supposed to stop that surge? Tell me one exact micro-move — word-for-word and step-by-step — that I can do in that instant, because I'm jittery and need something concrete.

Therapist: When your chest starts to tighten and you feel the shame hit, I want you to do exactly this: as you're looking down at the toes of your left shoe, slowly, slowly say to yourself: "Okay". Just one word. "Okay". That's it. Say it as softly as you can, without thinking about it, just focus on the sensation of the word moving out of your mouth. Can you do that?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a very small, specific action that the patient can do in that instant to help them feel more grounded and centered. By saying "Okay" out loud, the therapist is trying to help the patient create a tiny moment of self-awareness and calm, which can help to interrupt the surge of shame and anxiety.)

Patient: Alright—I tried it: looked down, took a breath, and whispered "Okay." For a beat it loosened, then that flash of failure hit and the shame slammed back so fast my chest clenched and I nearly bolted. I'm frustrated and distracted—how is whispering that one word actually going to keep me there, and give me one exact, step‑by‑step micro‑move I can do in that instant that actually works?

Therapist: I want you to do this: As you're whispering "Okay", I want you to slightly tilt your head to the left. Just a tiny bit. So that the whisper "Okay" is coming out of your mouth from the left side of your face. Can you do that?

(Note: The goal is to introduce a very small, specific action that the patient can do in that instant to help them feel more grounded and centered. By tilting their head slightly, the therapist is trying to help the patient create a tiny moment of self-awareness and relaxation, which can help to interrupt the surge of shame and anxiety.)

Patient: Okay… I tried it—tilted my head left while whispering "Okay" and for a beat my throat eased, but then that stupid flash of that thing I screwed up slammed back and the shame hit so hard I almost bolted. How is a tiny head tilt supposed to stop that surge when it hits like a freight train? I'm frustrated and really distracted—give me one exact, step‑by‑step micro‑move I can do in the middle of a party that actually keeps me there.

Therapist: I want you to do exactly this: As you're standing in the middle of the party, I want you to look up at the ceiling. Not at anyone, not at the decorations, just at the ceiling. Just look at it for a second, without thinking about it, just observe it. Don't try to do anything with it, just observe it. That's it. Look up at the ceiling.

(Note: The goal is to introduce a very small, specific action that the patient can do in the middle of a party that can help them feel more grounded and centered. By looking up at the ceiling, the therapist is trying to help the patient create a tiny moment of self-awareness and calm, which can help to interrupt the surge of shame and anxiety.)

Patient: Okay... I'm looking up at the ceiling like you said. For a second it felt kind of neutral, then that flash of the thing I screwed up barged back in and my chest locked up and the shame hit so hard my vision narrowed — I'm jittery, my voice is thin, and I'm not sure I can keep doing these little tricks that only help for two seconds. How is staring at the ceiling supposed to stop that freight-train of panic when it comes like that? Tell me one exact, step‑by‑step micro-move I can do right in that three‑second window at a party that actually keeps me from sprinting.
