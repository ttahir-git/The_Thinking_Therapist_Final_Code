Patient: I'm a middle-aged student and lately I've been burying myself in studying and extra shifts to avoid feeling the grief from losing someone close. My mind immediately goes to the worst—if I stop or slow down I'll start remembering everything, spiral into depression, fail my courses, lose my apartment and end up completely alone, and that feels inevitable.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you do remember everything? What are some specific memories or feelings that come up for you?

Patient: I keep replaying the last week with them—the beep of the monitor, how their hand felt cold, the way they laughed once and I missed it, and then that awful empty chair at home. When those memories hit, my chest tightens, I feel dizzy and nauseous, and this crushing guilt like I should've done more. If I let that open up, I know I'll collapse, stop going to class, fail everything, lose my place, and end up totally alone—it's not just possible, it's how it has to go if I don't keep working nonstop.

Therapist: It sounds like those memories can be incredibly vivid and trigger a strong physical response for you. Can you try something for a moment? Imagine those memories as a piece of paper right now, and instead of touching it or dwelling on it, imagine you're simply holding a cup of coffee and watching that paper float gently down a stream, carrying those memories away with it?

Patient: I tried to picture it—cup in hand, paper floating—but it doesn't stick; my mind just calls that a trick. If I let those memories drift away, my brain insists they'll come back stronger, I'll start forgetting details, people will think I don't care, I'll crumble, fail school, lose my place, and end up alone—it's exactly how it has to go. Imagining them disappearing feels like pretending and just makes me more anxious when I try.

Therapist: It feels like the more you try to control what happens with those memories, the more you're convinced that's exactly what will happen. Can you try something different for a moment? What if, instead of imagining the memories disappearing, you simply focused on not knowing what will happen with them? Just let the not-knowing be there, without trying to do anything about it or change it? No predicting, no planning, no trying to control. Just the simple acceptance of not knowing?

Patient: I can't just hold the not-knowing—it's like handing my brain a match. The moment there's uncertainty my head races through the whole chain: I stop showing up, I fail classes, lose my funding and apartment, and end up totally alone, and that feels inevitable, not just possible. Trying to tell myself 'maybe' just feels like lying and makes my chest tighten so bad I feel like I need to throw myself into more work to keep it from happening.

Therapist: It sounds like when you think about not knowing, your mind starts racing with worst-case scenarios again. Can you take a small step back and ask yourself what's driving the need to control this uncertainty right now? What is it about not knowing that's so important to you? Is it about avoiding the pain of loss, or is it about maintaining a sense of control in a situation that feels chaotic? Let's try to explore that together.

Patient: I think it's both—I'm trying to avoid the pain of losing them and to keep some control over a life that suddenly feels chaotic, because if I don't, my mind immediately says I'll be overwhelmed, stop going to class, fail everything, lose my apartment, and end up totally alone. Overworking feels like the only thing that keeps that chain from starting; the second I slack off my brain insists it's inevitable, so I can't trust just 'not knowing'—that feels like handing everything over to disaster. I know that sounds extreme and I don't like that it's how I think, but it's exhausting to even say it out loud—can we slow down? I'm already feeling my chest tighten.

Therapist: It's okay to slow down, and I'm here to support you. You're right; it's exhausting to even say these thoughts out loud. Can you take one deep breath with me? Let's pause for a moment. Your chest tightening is a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's understandable given what we've been exploring. It's not about being extreme or irrational; it's about the raw emotions you're experiencing. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's not a reflection of your strength or resilience. Can you tell me more about what's happening in this moment, without worrying about the "what-ifs" or trying to control the uncertainty? Just focus on your physical sensations and the present moment.

Patient: My chest's tight and my breathing is shallow, like there's a weight on my sternum, and my stomach's in knots. My hands feel cold and a little shaky, and my head's buzzing with that terrible chain of thoughts—if I sit with this I'll spiral and lose everything—so it's hard to stay in the moment. I don't know how to just be here without the disaster-story kicking in; can we slow down? I'm already getting more anxious.

Therapist: It's like the weight on your sternum is pressing down, and the buzzing in your head is making it hard to focus. Can we start with something even simpler? Let's just focus on your breath together. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Just notice how it feels, without trying to control it or change it. We'll start with just one deep breath together. Inhale... (pause) and exhale... (pause) Let's just stay here with that breath for a moment.

Patient: I tried that breath, but it barely helped — my chest's still tight and my breaths feel shallow. The moment I try to settle my mind shoots off into the chain — if I relax I'll remember everything, I'll stop going to class, fail, lose my apartment, be completely alone — and that feels inevitable, not just possible. I'm trying to stay here but it's getting harder; can we slow down and maybe count breaths together or do something concrete, because imagining calm just makes me more anxious.

Therapist: It sounds like imagining calm is making you more anxious, so let's try something different. I want to propose a small, concrete exercise that might help us stabilize the present moment. Can you agree to count breaths with me? Just focus on counting each breath as we take it together. We'll start with one breath, and I'll count it with you. One... (pause) Your turn. Just focus on your own breath and count it with me. When you're ready, we can move on to the next breath. Let's just take it one breath at a time.

Patient: Okay, I'll try to count. One—my inhale's tiny and the second I pause my brain shoots, "If you relax you'll spiral, fail your courses, lose your place, end up alone," and that feeling tightens my chest. Two—I'm trying to stay with the breath but counting actually makes the disaster story louder; can we slow down more or do something more concrete because this is getting harder.

Therapist: It sounds like the counting exercise is actually making things worse. Let's try something else. I want to ask you to touch something, just for a moment. Not your breath, not your mind, just your body. Can you reach down and touch your foot, or your hand, or your arm? Just hold it for a second. Can you notice the sensation of your foot touching the ground, or the weight of your hand? Let's just focus on that sensation for a second. We'll take it from there.

Patient: Okay—I'm touching my right foot to the floor; it's warm and the carpet presses a bit into the arch, my hand feels kind of clammy on my knee. But as soon as I notice that, my brain starts its run—if I stop pushing, I'll remember everything, spiral, fail my classes, lose my apartment, and end up completely alone—it's inevitable, not just possible. I'm trying to stay with the sensation but it's getting harder already; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay, we're not moving forward yet. Just take a deep breath with me, and let's pause for a moment. Notice how your right foot feels on the floor, the sensation of the warm carpet, the pressure in your arch. Just focus on that for a second, without trying to add anything else. Your hand is feeling clammy, notice that too, but don't try to change it. Just be with it as it is. You're doing okay, and it's okay to slow down. Take your time, and we'll get there when we're ready. No rush. Just... pause.

Patient: My breathing's a little slower but my chest still feels heavy and my thoughts are racing through that disaster chain. Touching my foot and counting helped a tiny bit, but the moment I pause my brain yells that I'll spiral and lose everything, so it's getting harder to stay here. Can we slow down and do something more concrete—like naming five things I can see or hear—because I need something solid right now?

Therapist: I'm glad the pause helped a bit. Let's try something even more concrete. I want you to focus on your senses right now. Can you name five things you can see, right in front of you? Just look around, and see what comes to mind. Don't try to think too much, just name five things. And then, after that, I want you to name five things you can hear. Just listen, and see what sounds you can pick up on. Take your time, and don't worry if it's hard at first. Just focus on finding those five things, one by one. When you're ready, we'll move on to the next step.

Patient: Okay—I'll try.

Five things I can see right now: my laptop with a dozen tabs open, a stack of textbooks and notes, a cold coffee mug, a calendar with deadlines circled, and my coat draped over the chair.  
Five things I can hear: the heater humming, distant traffic, a neighbor talking softly, the fridge kicking on, and my own shallow breaths.

But saying those out loud makes me flush with this stupid shame and frustration—like I should already have this together—and my brain immediately runs the whole chain: slack off one minute, miss a deadline, fail a class, lose funding and my place, end up completely alone. It feels unavoidable, and that tightness in my chest is already getting worse. Can we slow down? I'm getting more anxious.

Therapist: It's understandable that saying the things out loud would trigger some emotions, especially when it comes to feeling like you're not in control. Can we try to approach this differently? Instead of focusing on the things you can see and hear right now, can you try to think about the things you're doing right now that are helping you stay present? Can you notice the breaths you're taking, the sensations in your body, the fact that you're sitting here and trying to focus? Can you try to be kinder to yourself, rather than beating yourself up over not having everything together? Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not alone in feeling this way, and we can work through it together.

Patient: I can name the things I'm doing—I counted breaths, felt my foot on the floor, named stuff around me—but saying that out loud brings this hot shame, like I'm faking being okay because of that mistake I keep replaying, and it makes me clamp down even harder. My attention keeps snapping away and my chest tightens; if I let myself be kinder my brain immediately says I'll slack off, fail my courses, lose my place and end up alone, so being gentler feels like handing everything over to disaster. Can we slow down? I need something concrete to hold onto right now.

Therapist: I want to try something simple. Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now? Just notice how your feet feel on the floor, the pressure of your body on the floor, the sensation of your feet sinking into the floor. Don't think about anything else, just the sensation of your feet. Can you stay with that for just a second? Don't try to change it, don't try to do anything with it. Just be with the sensation of your feet on the floor. That's it.

Patient: I'm trying—my feet feel pressed into the carpet, a bit warm at the arch and cool at the toes, but the moment I settle my chest tightens and my brain kicks into that chain: if I let this sit I'll remember everything, spiral, fail my classes, lose funding and my apartment, and end up completely alone — it feels unavoidable. My hands are clammy and my attention keeps snapping away, and I feel this hot shame about the mistake I keep replaying. Can we slow down? I need something concrete because staying with this is making me more anxious.

Therapist: I want you to do something completely different with your hands for a moment. Can you take your hands off the lap and place them in your pockets? Just put your hands in your pockets and notice how it feels. Don't think about anything else, just the sensation of your hands in your pockets. Don't try to change it, don't try to do anything with it. Just be with the feeling of your hands in your pockets. Hold that for a second. (pause) Okay, when you're ready, we can slowly come back to the present moment.

Patient: My hands in my pockets feel warm and a little clammy, the fabric creased under my knuckles — it helps for a beat, but my chest tightens as soon as I notice it. My head's already racing: if I let this settle I'll start remembering everything, miss deadlines, fail classes, lose funding and my apartment, and end up completely alone — that chain feels inevitable. I'm so ashamed about that mistake I keep replaying and I'm jittery and distracted right now; can we slow down and do something concrete I can hold onto?

Therapist: I want to ask you to focus on a specific sound right now. Can you listen carefully to the sound of your own breathing? Just listen to the way your breath moves in and out of your body. Don't try to control it, don't try to change it. Just listen to the sound of your own breathing. I want you to focus on that sound for a second, without thinking about anything else. Can you do that for me? (pause) Just the sound of your breathing.

Patient: I can hear my breath—it's shallow and kind of loud in my ears—but the second I try to follow it my brain jolts into that disaster loop: if I slow down I'll remember everything, miss deadlines, fail classes, lose funding and my apartment, and end up totally alone. I feel this hot shame and frustration about that mistake I keep replaying, and now I'm jittery and can't hold the focus—can we slow down or try something more concrete?

Therapist: I want you to bring your attention to your feet again, but this time, I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body as it passes over your skin. Can you feel the gentle breeze on your skin, even though the window is closed? Just notice the sensation of the air moving over your skin. Don't try to control it, just be with it. Can you focus on that for a moment? (pause) Just the sensation of the air on your skin.

Patient: I can feel the air brushing my forearms and the back of my neck—it's faintly cool and almost gives a tiny relief, but it doesn't stick. The moment I notice it my brain fires the whole chain: if I let this settle I'll start remembering everything, miss deadlines, fail classes, lose funding and my apartment, and end up completely alone — it feels unavoidable, not just possible. I'm flushed with shame about that mistake I keep replaying and I'm jittery and distracted; can we slow down and do something concrete I can hold onto right now?

Therapist: I want you to take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself one simple phrase: "I am here." Just say it to yourself, "I am here." Say it as you exhale, and then take another breath. Just focus on saying those three words, "I am here." Don't think about anything else, just say those words. And then, when you're ready, we can slowly come back to the present moment.

Patient: I tried—took the breath and mouthed “I am here” on the exhale, but it felt empty and my chest actually tightened more. My head immediately shoots into the same chain—miss deadlines, fail, lose funding and my apartment, end up alone—and I’m flushed with that stupid shame like I’m a fraud for not being able to hold it; it all feels inevitable. I’m jittery and distracted and can’t settle—can we slow down and do something really concrete I can hang on to, like counting backward from 20 or naming colors in the room?

Therapist: I'm going to ask you to focus on a simple task. Can you name five things in the room that are blue? Just look around, and name as many blue things as you can think of. Don't think about anything else, just focus on finding those five blue things. Take your time, and when you're ready, we can slowly come back to the present moment.

Patient: Blue pen on the desk, a blue sticky note on the calendar, a blue coffee mug, a blue-covered notebook, and the blue circle around a deadline. Saying those out loud just tightens my chest — my head immediately says if I stop counting I'll miss that deadline, fail my course, lose funding and my apartment, end up alone, and I feel that hot shame about the mistake I keep replaying, so can we slow down? I'm getting jittery.

Therapist: I think it's time for me to pause the conversation for a moment. It's not working to focus on counting or naming blue things. Instead of trying to control your thoughts or distract you with tasks, I want to try a different approach. Can you take a moment to acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and stuck? Can you just notice those feelings right now, without trying to change them or push them away? Sometimes, the first step towards making progress is simply acknowledging that we're struggling. Let's take a deep breath together and see if we can find a way to move forward from here.

Patient: Yeah... I notice I'm overwhelmed and stuck—my chest's tight, my thoughts are racing, and even saying that brings up the hot shame about that mistake I keep replaying. It feels impossible to just let the feelings be because my head insists if I do I'll spiral, fail classes, lose funding and my place, and end up alone, so I can't relax. I can try one slow breath with you, but can we keep it really slow and then do something concrete I can hold onto?

Therapist: I want to ask you to take one very slow breath in, and I want you to focus only on that breath. Just notice the sensation of the air moving into your body, without thinking about anything else. Take a deep breath in... (pause) Hold it for a second... (pause) Slowly exhale... (pause) Hold it again for another second. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about your thoughts, don't think about your feelings, just focus on the breath. Can you do that for me? Take one more slow breath.

Patient: Okay — I took a slow breath in, held it, and let it out, but it hardly changed anything. My chest's still tight, that hot shame about the mistake's buzzing at the back of my head, and my brain's already running the chain: miss a deadline, fail a course, lose funding and my place, end up alone — like it has to happen. I don't have much energy to keep trying vague stuff; can we do one concrete thing I can actually do right now, like count backward from 20 or pick one tiny task I can finish in ten minutes?

Therapist: I want to ask you to do something that requires your attention for the next 10 minutes. Can you take a small notebook that's in front of you and write down one single sentence right now? Just one sentence. It can be anything: "I need to buy milk," "I'm feeling anxious," "I just remembered something important." Just write one sentence. Take 10 minutes to write that one sentence. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or coherence. Just focus on putting that one sentence down on paper. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay... I can try, but my head's already racing—if I take ten minutes to stop, I'll start remembering everything and then miss deadlines, fail my courses, lose funding and my place, and end up alone, so it feels risky. The one sentence I'll write is: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and afraid that if I slow down I'll spiral and lose everything." I'll write it now—can you stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: I'll stay with you for the 10 minutes and focus on this moment. You've written down your sentence: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and afraid that if I slow down I'll spiral and lose everything." Can you just look at those words for a moment? Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, I'll ask you to write something else if you'd like. Just focus on this single sentence right now, and don't worry about anything else. We're here together for the next 10 minutes.

Patient: Okay — I can see the sentence and it feels true, but my chest's tight and that hot shame about the mistake is buzzing at the back of my head, and I keep thinking if I stop I'll spiral, miss deadlines, lose funding and end up alone. I don't have energy for vague breathing stuff right now. Can you stay with me and help pick one tiny task I can finish in five minutes — like replying to one email or writing a short to-do — and set a five-minute timer while I do it? I need something concrete I can actually hold onto.

Therapist: Let's focus on one tiny task that you can complete in the next 5 minutes. Can you think of one small thing you need to do right now that requires just a minute or two of effort? It could be replying to an email, writing a short note, or making a phone call. Just one thing. Can you think of something like that? We'll set a 5-minute timer, and I'll stay with you until you're done. Just focus on getting this one small thing done. When you're ready, we'll talk about what's next.

Patient: Okay... I can try. I'll write one short sentence to my professor: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need a little extra time; I will submit this by [date]." I'm already jittery and ashamed—if I stop now my head screams that I'll freeze, miss the deadline, fail everything, lose funding and my place, and end up alone, so I don't have much energy. Can you set a 5-minute timer and stay with me while I type it? Please keep it simple.

Therapist: I'll set a 5-minute timer. You've written the email: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need a little extra time; I will submit this by [date]." Now, can you just type in the date? Just one date. We'll do that together. I'll stay right here with you. Just focus on typing in the date. We'll get it done in 5 minutes.

Patient: Okay — I typed: "I will submit this by August 25." My hands are shaking and I already feel that hot shame like I'm begging, and my brain's yelling that if I admit this I'll still freeze, miss it, fail, lose funding and my place, and end up alone. Can you stay with me while I hit send?

Therapist: I'm right here with you. You've hit send. That's it. You've done it. You've submitted your email. Now, I want you to take a deep breath with me. Just one deep breath in, and one deep breath out. Feel that breath move in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment and focus on that breath.

Patient: Okay... I breathed and I sent it, but my chest is still crushing and my hands are shaking. My brain's already certain the professor will refuse, they'll mark me down, I'll freeze on the work, fail, lose funding and my apartment, and end up completely alone — that's how it has to go. I'm really worn out and ashamed about that mistake I keep replaying; can we slow down and do something concrete I can hold onto right now?

Therapist: I want to ask you to do something simple. Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the ground right now? Just feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Don't think about anything else, just the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Take one moment to focus on that sensation. Don't worry about anything else, just this moment.

Patient: Okay... I can feel my heels pressed into the floor and the carpet under my toes — it helps for a second, but the moment I notice it my chest clamps and that hot shame about that failure flares up. Then my head's already doing the same thing: miss a deadline, fail, lose funding and my place, end up totally alone — it feels inevitable. Can we slow down? I need something concrete to hold onto right now, like a five-minute task or you staying with me while I do one small thing.
