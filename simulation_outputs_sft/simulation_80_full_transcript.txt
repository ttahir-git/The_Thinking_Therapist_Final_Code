--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling overwhelmed by this heavy sadness and zero motivation, and it's been spilling into my relationship because I keep shutting down and pulling away. My mind immediately goes to the worst: she'll get fed up and leave, I'll mess up at work from being distracted and get fired, and then I'll end up utterly alone and ruined—it's like I can see that whole collapse happening. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop feeling like that's definitely how it ends.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is overwhelmed by intense sadness, lacking motivation, and withdrawing from their relationship due to catastrophic thinking ("worst-case scenario"). Their primary emotional tone is despair. Goal: Explore the underlying themes of avoidance and hopelessness.

Therapist Answer:
These catastrophic thoughts are really weighing on you right now. Can you tell me more about what's behind this sense of complete collapse? It feels like the end of the world. Instead of trying to change the thought, I want to understand what's driving it. What is it about those worst-case scenarios that feels so real to you, and what's the story you're telling yourself about how your life might end up?

Patient: I guess what makes those worst-case scenarios feel real is this memory of things snowballing before—one small slip and suddenly everything's gone wrong, like dominoes that I swear I can already see toppling. The story I'm telling myself is that if I pull away now because I'm overwhelmed, she'll get tired of carrying me, leave, and that will prove I'm unlovable and it's only a matter of time before the loneliness ruins my work and everything else. I keep replaying that chain because it feels inevitable; I can't picture it stopping halfway, and when you suggest other outcomes it just sounds like wishful thinking that won't hold up. I'm tired of being stuck on that script, but I can't get my brain to accept any other ending.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's catastrophic thinking is deeply rooted in a pattern of perceived failures (past "slip" and subsequent "domino effect") and fear of rejection ("unlovable"). Their hopelessness stems from a sense of inevitability ("can't picture it stopping halfway"). Goal: Explore how this story is connected to underlying avoidance behaviors and explore the possibility of a more nuanced relationship with their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like that memory of the past is a powerful trigger for these worst-case scenarios. You're right that it feels inevitable, but what if we were to challenge that narrative just a little bit? What if, instead of being a script that you're stuck on, these thoughts could be more like a story that you're telling yourself? Can you think of a time when this narrative started to feel true, and how your life actually played out in the moment? What's the difference between what happened then and what's happening now?

Patient: Yeah — it goes back to a time I flubbed a big presentation a couple years ago: I froze, missed key points, my boss was blunt, I pulled back, my partner got frustrated, and in my head that was the start of a chain that would end with me fired and alone. In reality it was less catastrophic — I apologized, kept the job, and my partner stayed after we talked — but I keep replaying it like proof that once one thing slips, everything will topple, so I can't trust that it won't happen again. I know that's probably not logical, but the sense that the dominoes are already lined up feels more real to me than the times they stopped, so when you offer other outcomes it just sounds like wishful thinking.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's catastrophic thinking is deeply rooted in a past failure (public presentation) and a perceived pattern of consequences ("domino effect"). Their sense of hopelessness stems from a fear of being unable to control the outcome of similar events. Goal: Explore the relationship between this past failure and the patient's current pattern of avoidance and explore the possibility of defusing this catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It's like this past failure has become a kind of anchor for your fears, making it hard to imagine a different outcome. You're right that replaying it like this can feel more real than the times it didn't happen. Can we try something different? Instead of focusing on what happened after the presentation, what if we explored what happened right in the moment? How did you feel when you froze, and what did your body do? What were some small things you could have done differently to regain control? Sometimes, by focusing on the small, immediate moments rather than the larger narrative, we can start to break free from the sense of inevitability. Would you be willing to explore that with me?

Patient: In the moment my chest tightened, my throat felt raw, my hands shook, and my brain just locked up like someone flipped a switch. I remember trying to force words out and only tripping over them, and afterward I kept replaying it as proof I'm unraveling. I can see the small fixes — take a breath, ask for a second, glance at notes, say "let me rephrase" — but as soon as I imagine doing any of those things I also see the worst: everyone thinking I'm incompetent, my boss marking it down, the team losing faith, and that leading straight to reassignment or getting fired. So when you suggest slowing down, it honestly sounds wishful — that pause in my head is just the first domino that proves I'm doomed.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's physical response to stress (chest tightening, raw throat, shaking hands) is closely tied to catastrophic thinking (feeling like they're "unraveling"). They're aware of small fixes that could help them regain control, but their imagination of implementing these solutions is accompanied by even more severe consequences ("everyone thinking I'm incompetent"). Goal: Introduce a different perspective on defusion, using the metaphors of paused time and shifting perspectives to help the patient see their thoughts as malleable rather than immutable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a pause here, not just from your thinking, but from your entire experience. Imagine time slowing down just for a second, just enough to notice what's happening in your body. Feel the breath moving in and out of your chest, the sensation of your feet on the ground, the way the air hits your skin. It's okay to just be in this moment, without judgment. As you do this, I want you to imagine yourself as a observer, watching your thoughts as they pass through your mind. See them as clouds moving across the sky, each one distinct and fleeting. Don't try to grasp them, don't try to change them. Just observe. What happens when you do this? Does the sense of doom start to lift, just a little bit?

Patient: I tried that — for a second my breathing slowed and the tightness eased, like the noise in my head turned down a notch. But almost immediately a thought barges in — "she'll leave, you'll mess up at work, you'll end up alone" — and the clouds I was watching just morph into a hurricane, so the calm feels fragile and kind of useless.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient had a brief respite from their catastrophic thinking, but it was quickly interrupted by a new, more intense thought. They're aware of the fragility of this respite and the futility of trying to hold onto it. Goal: Introduce a more nuanced understanding of defusion, acknowledging that it's a process that's not always linear or sustainable.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware that the calm was short-lived, and that's okay. It's not uncommon for the storms to come back, even if we've had moments of peace. Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the storms themselves, what if we looked at the way they're showing up? What's driving these thoughts, these images of disaster? Is it something in the external world, or is it something within you? Can we explore what might be underlying these thoughts, what's making them so intense? Sometimes, by looking at the fuel that's driving the storm, we can start to understand why it's so hard to quiet it down. Would you be willing to explore that with me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, though I'm already skeptical — that domino story is loud in my head. I think what's fueling it is this core belief that one slip proves I'm unlovable, mixed with perfectionism at work and the shame from that presentation, and being isolated now means there's no one to contradict those stories. My mind grabs any small mistake and inflates it into total ruin. Even saying it out loud makes me see the whole collapse again, so I don't know how just looking at the fuel is going to stop it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to let go of their catastrophic thinking, even when exploring the underlying causes. They're aware of the perfectionism and shame driving their thoughts, but the dominant narrative is too powerful. Goal: Introduce a more grounded approach, acknowledging the patient's struggles with their thoughts and exploring ways to create small, temporary reprieves.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're doing a great job of recognizing the underlying causes of your thoughts. Now, I want to try something a bit different. Instead of trying to change the thoughts themselves, let's focus on creating a small, temporary reprieve from the domino story. Can you think of a tiny, almost imperceptible thing you could do right now to create a tiny bit of space between you and the thoughts? It could be taking a deep breath, shifting your weight slightly, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. The goal isn't to change your thoughts, but to create a tiny bit of distance that might help you feel less overwhelmed. Would you be willing to try that with me?

Patient: Okay, I'll try a tiny thing — I'm taking a slow deep breath now and feeling my feet on the floor. For a second the tightness loosens and my head quiets a notch, but then the usual shot pops in: she'll notice me zoning out, think I'm checked out, get fed up, and that little pause will just become the proof I was right about being unlovable. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed saying that out loud — can we slow down? I don't know how to make that tiny space feel like it won't just feed into the next disaster story.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain the tiny reprieve from catastrophic thinking, and the usual narrative is already reasserting itself. They're feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of sustaining this tiny space, and the fear of it being seen as a sign of disconnection or weakness. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach, acknowledging the patient's fear of failure and the need for a more sustainable pause.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're stuck in a cycle that's hard to break. I want to slow things down even further, just for a moment. Can we take a tiny pause before we try to create another tiny space? Let's just sit with what's happening right now, without trying to change anything or create any new space. Just notice the breath moving in and out of your body, the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the thoughts that are coming up. Let's just be with that, without judgment or trying to do anything with it. Can we do that for just a moment?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to just sit with it. My breath is a little slower and my feet feel planted, and for a couple of seconds the tightness eases — then the thought hits: she'll notice me zoning, think I'm checked out, leave, I'll mess up at work from being distracted, lose everything, and I'm back to that inevitable collapse, so I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain the brief moment of calm, and the catastrophic thinking is already reasserting itself. They're feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of losing control and the thought of their partner leaving. Goal: Introduce a non-judgmental and accepting presence, acknowledging the patient's pain and the cyclical nature of their thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to be stuck in this cycle. You're not failing, you're just being. You're not weak, you're just human. Can you allow yourself to feel this pain without judgment? Without trying to push it away or change it? Can you just be with the thought, "She'll leave, I'll mess up at work," without trying to analyze it or react to it? Just be with it. Notice how it feels in your body, notice how it sounds in your mind. Can you stay with it for just a moment longer?

Patient: I'll try to stay with it. When I hold that thought my chest tightens, my stomach drops, my hands go cold, and my brain immediately plays the movie — her walking out, people at work whispering, me getting called into HR — like I can see the ending. It's getting claustrophobic and I'm starting to panic a bit, so can we slow down? I don't know how to keep sitting with this without my mind racing to the finale.


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming overwhelmed by the physical sensations and the catastrophic thinking, and their attempt to sit with the thought is becoming too much to handle. They're feeling claustrophobic and panicking. Goal: Introduce a gentle and gradual approach to help the patient manage their physical sensations and emotions, while still acknowledging the cyclical nature of their thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel like you're losing control. It's okay to panic. Can we take a tiny step back? Just for a moment, let's focus on your breath. Not the thought, not the panic, just the breath. Feel the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your chest rising and falling. Can you just focus on that one sensation, just for a second? Don't try to control it, don't try to change it, just notice it. We'll take it from there.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just watching my breath supposed to stop the flood of "she'll leave, I'll get fired" scenarios? I can feel the air in my chest and my feet on the floor, but it's like that just becomes the quiet before the movie starts and the worst-case plays out. I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't see how that helps.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the therapist's previous suggestion, which they perceive as not addressing the underlying issues. They're becoming even more agitated by the thought of the catastrophic scenarios, and their emotional regulation is struggling. Goal: Introduce a more direct and empathetic approach, acknowledging the patient's frustration and validating their emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
I apologize if my previous suggestion felt insensitive or not helpful. It's clear that you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated right now. I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel that way when we're in the midst of these intense thoughts and emotions. It's not about "slowing down" or "controlling" anything; it's about being here with you in this moment, without judgment. Can you tell me more about what's feeling so frustrating right now? What is it about these thoughts that's making you feel like you're losing control?

Patient: I guess what's so frustrating is that these thoughts don't feel like thoughts — they feel like proof, and the second I try to slow down a flash of that old shame hits and the doom-movie gets louder. My body reacts first — chest tight, panicked — and before I can think rationally I'm already seeing the whole collapse, so it feels like I'm not in control at all. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling completely out of control, as if their thoughts and emotions are happening before they can even process them. They're experiencing intense shame, a sense of being proven wrong, and the feeling of catastrophic failure is overwhelming. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and stabilizing presence, acknowledging the patient's complete loss of control and focusing on creating a temporary sense of safety.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that you're not in control right now, and that's okay. It's okay to feel like you're losing your grip on reality. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you allow me to take care of you for just a moment? I'm going to speak slowly and gently, and I want you to focus on my voice. Don't try to think, don't try to process anything. Just listen to my words, and let me help you feel safe for a second. You're safe now. Can you just be with that feeling of safety for a moment?

Patient: I can hear you, and for a split second it actually does feel a little safer — my shoulders loosened — but I don't know how to trust that. The moment I let my guard down I can already see it flipping: she'll notice the calm, think I'm checked out, leave, and that calm will just become proof I was right. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep this from turning into the same disaster movie.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to trust the feeling of safety, even for a brief moment. They're worried that letting their guard down will lead to a repeat of the same catastrophic outcome. Goal: Introduce a concept that might help the patient understand that the goal is not to avoid the disaster movie, but to learn to respond to it differently.

Therapist Answer:
I want to talk to you about something that might help. It's not about avoiding the disaster movie, because that's not possible. It's about what you do when you're in the middle of it. Can you think about a time when you were in a situation that felt really scary or overwhelming? You probably had a way of coping with it, even if it wasn't perfect. Maybe you took a few deep breaths, maybe you reminded yourself of something that helped you feel more grounded. That's what we're going to work on here. We're going to practice responding to these thoughts and feelings in a way that's not about avoiding the disaster, but about learning to navigate it. Can you try to think of one thing you might do in a situation like this, just one small thing?

Patient: Okay — one tiny thing I might actually try is stepping outside for a five-minute walk to move my body and break the loop. But the moment I picture it I also see her noticing me leave, thinking I'm checked out, and that little break just turns into the next scene in the collapse — the shame from that past slip spikes and I'm already bracing for the worst. I'm feeling overwhelmed saying this out loud — can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling to trust the feeling of safety, and their attempt to introduce a small coping mechanism (taking a short walk) is met with catastrophic thinking and a sense of shame. They're feeling overwhelmed and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and accepting approach, acknowledging the patient's desperation and frustration.

Therapist Answer:
I'm so sorry you're feeling like this. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to be stuck in this cycle. You're not failing, you're just... stuck. And it's not because you're weak or flawed. It's because this is hard. It's hard to break out of this cycle of catastrophic thinking and shame. And it's even harder when you try to do something to break it, like taking a short walk, and it just feels like more of the same. Can you take a deep breath with me? Just for a second? Let's just be here with the feeling of overwhelm, without trying to change it. Can you just be with me, and with yourself, for just one second?

Patient: I can try to breathe with you — I'm taking a slow breath and my shoulders loosen a bit — but I'm not sure I follow how this helps. The breath just seems to pull up that hot shame from that one mess-up and then my brain fires the whole movie: her leaving, HR, everything collapsing. I know you want me to sit with it, but it feels like holding a match to gasoline and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand how breathing with the therapist is helping, and instead, the breath is triggering the same shame and catastrophic thinking. They're feeling overwhelmed and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a different approach that focuses on the physical sensation of overwhelm, rather than trying to calm the thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're getting overwhelmed again. It's like you're getting hit with the same shame and fear that you're trying to avoid. I want you to focus on your body right now. Can you feel the sensation of your feet on the ground? The sensation of the chair beneath you? The sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Just notice those sensations. Don't try to think about anything else. Don't try to calm down or distract yourself. Just be with those physical sensations. Can you find a part of your body that feels even slightly different from the rest? Maybe a finger, a toe, a spot on your shoulder? Just focus on that one spot for a second.

Patient: My right hand — the base of my thumb — feels a little warmer and the tightness loosens for a second, so that helps briefly. But almost instantly that old shame spikes and the movie kicks back in — her noticing, me being seen as checked out, everything collapsing — and I'm back to panicking. I don't really get how focusing on my thumb fixes this, I'm feeling claustrophobic and overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is experiencing a brief moment of relief with the physical sensation of warmth on their thumb, but it's quickly followed by the return of catastrophic thinking and shame. They're feeling overwhelmed and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a more grounded approach that acknowledges the patient's feelings of claustrophobia and overwhelm, while also exploring ways to increase their sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling really trapped right now. The shame is feeling like a tight noose around your neck, and the thoughts are swirling around you like a storm. It's like you're stuck in a small, dark room with no way out. Can I ask you something? What would it take for you to feel like you were taking small, slow steps towards escaping that room? Not big steps, just small ones. Would it be okay to take a tiny step forward right now, even if it feels scary? Just a tiny step. You can do that for me. Can you focus on taking that tiny step, even if it's just in your imagination?

Patient: I can picture taking a tiny step—like standing up and saying, "I need five minutes"—but the moment I imagine it I also see her taking it as me checking out, storming out, coworkers whispering, HR calling me in, and me ending up alone and fired. I'm trying to do it, but just picturing that makes me shaky and claustrophobic, so can we slow down? I don't know how to take even a small step without the whole collapse playing out.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to take even a small step towards taking control of their situation, and the catastrophic thinking is overwhelming them. They're feeling claustrophobic, shaky, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and gradual approach that acknowledges the patient's feelings of overwhelm and desperation, while also exploring ways to build their confidence and sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
I'm so sorry you're feeling like this. It's like the whole room is closing in on you, and you're trapped. Can we just take a deep breath together? Let's focus on our breath for just one second. I want you to imagine that you're holding onto your breath right now, and it's getting a little harder to breathe. That's okay. Just feel that sensation. Now, I want you to imagine that you're letting go of that breath, and it's slowly starting to come back. Can you feel that? Just that one small sensation. We'll stay with that for a second. When you're ready, we can try something else. No pressure. Just take your time.

Patient: Okay — I did that slow out-breath and for a second the pressure eased, my shoulders relaxed a bit, my chest didn't feel like it was locked. But right after that the same image barges back in — her noticing the calm, thinking I'm checked out, walking away, HR calling me in — and I get shaky and panicky all over again. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and kind of stuck — can we slow down? I don't know how to stay in the breathe-with-me moment without my brain flipping to the finale.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain the small moment of relief with the slow out-breath, and the catastrophic thinking is quickly returning. They're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a more fundamental and gentle approach that acknowledges the patient's inability to sustain the current moment, and encourages a return to the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel stuck. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're not failing, you're just... human. Can I ask you something? What happens when you're sitting with your breath, and you start to feel a thought or a sensation, but it's not quite there? It's not quite a full thought, or a full feeling? Can you just notice that feeling, without trying to change it or push it away? Just observe it. Let it be what it is. We'll stay with that, together, for just a moment. No thinking, no analyzing, no trying to change anything. Just being with what is, right now.

Patient: I can feel that half-feeling — a tiny knot in my chest, like the movie is booting up but not full screen yet — and before I can just notice it it explodes into the whole finale: her leaving, me getting fired, ending up alone. I'm not sure I follow how staying with that pre-feeling helps, because the act of noticing just seems to light the fuse and make the collapse inevitable. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand how staying with the pre-feeling can be helpful, as it seems to trigger the catastrophic thinking. They're feeling overwhelmed and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a fundamental shift in understanding, acknowledging that the patient's experience is not about avoiding or changing thoughts, but about developing a different relationship with their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something different. Let's take a step back. What if, instead of trying to control or change your thoughts, we focus on how you're experiencing them? Not the thoughts themselves, but the physical sensations that arise when you think about them? The feeling of tension in your body, the sense of discomfort in your chest? Can you just notice those sensations right now, without trying to change them or push them away? Don't try to analyze them, don't try to understand them intellectually. Just notice. Can you stay with that for just a second?

Patient: I can feel it — a tightness in my chest, a knot under my sternum, my right thumb warming like it did before. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing that stops the movie — the instant I pay attention the whole collapse starts playing, like observing it makes it real. I'm getting overwhelmed again, can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand how noticing their physical sensations can be helpful, as it seems to trigger the catastrophic thinking. They're feeling overwhelmed and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a more nuanced approach, acknowledging that the patient's experience is complex and multifaceted, and that simple suggestions may not be enough.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if you're not sure how this is helping. It's okay if it feels like it's not working. Can I ask you something? What is it about this moment that feels so overwhelming? Is it the thought, the sensation, the feeling of being stuck? Can we try to explore that together, without trying to change anything right now? Just observe it, notice it, explore it. We'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: It's all three — the thought, the body, and the stuckness feed each other: one tiny flash of "she'll leave" tightens my chest and then the movie starts playing and I can't stop it. My chest clamps, my hands go cold, that warm spot at the base of my thumb pulses, and the shame from that past screw-up just floods back like proof the ending is inevitable. When we try to "explore" it I feel like I'm poking a hornet's nest and it just makes the finale louder — her walking out, HR calling, me alone and ruined — so I'm skeptical this helps. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now — can we slow down and take one tiny, concrete step instead of staying in the big-picture collapse?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to understand how exploring their experience can be helpful, as it seems to trigger the catastrophic thinking. They're feeling skeptical and overwhelmed, and the therapist's suggestions are not providing the relief they need. Goal: Introduce a more concrete and tangible approach, focusing on a small, specific action that can help the patient feel more grounded and in control.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something very different. Let's focus on just one tiny thing, right now. Can you take one small breath in, and as you exhale, can you place one hand gently on your knee? That's it. Just one hand on your knee. Not trying to change anything, not trying to think about anything. Just the physical sensation of placing your hand on your knee. Can you stay with that for just a second?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my knee and I can feel the warmth and the weight for a second, and it actually calms the rush a notch. But right after that the movie starts up again — her seeing me, thinking I'm checked out, walking away, HR calling, everything collapsing — so even that tiny touch feels like the opening scene. I'm getting shaky and overwhelmed; can we slow down? I don't know how to keep a small step from flipping into the whole finale.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to sustain even a small moment of calm, and the catastrophic thinking is quickly returning. They're feeling overwhelmed, shaky, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a gentle and gradual approach to help the patient develop a sense of control over their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back even further. Can you keep your hand on your knee, but now let's focus on your breath instead of trying to control anything else? Just breathe in and out, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Don't try to change anything, don't try to think about anything. Just be with the breath. Can you stay with that for just one second longer?

Patient: Okay — I keep my hand on my knee and breathe in, and for a second it actually steadies me, my chest loosens a bit, but then the usual movie kicks in: she'll see me calm, decide I'm checked out, walk out, HR calls, I get reassigned or fired, and I'm left utterly alone. I'm getting really claustrophobic and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with the breath without it turning into the whole collapse.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain even a brief moment of calm, and the catastrophic thinking is quickly overwhelming them. They're feeling claustrophobic, overwhelmed, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a fundamental shift in the therapeutic relationship, acknowledging the patient's experience as valid and the therapist's role as a supportive presence.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I can see that you're really struggling. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to feel claustrophobic. I'm not trying to fix anything right now; I'm just here with you. Can you look at me for a second? Just see my face, not my words, not my body. Just me. I'm here with you. You're safe. We're in this together, right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to look at you my chest tightens and this old shame flashes up, and it just confuses me instead of calming me. Seeing your face doesn't stop the disaster-movie; I still get flooded with images of her leaving and everything at work collapsing, and it makes me panicky. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down and just stay here for a minute?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to make sense of the therapist's words, and instead, the catastrophic thinking is intensifying. They're feeling overwhelmed, panicked, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a gentle and gentle acknowledgment of the patient's experience, acknowledging that the therapist's words may not be helping and that the therapeutic relationship needs to be re-established.

Therapist Answer:
I'm sorry if I said anything that didn't feel right. I'm here with you, and I can see that I didn't quite get it. The images you're seeing, the shame and the panic, that's not just a movie to you, is it? That's your real life. I'm not trying to fix it right now, I'm just trying to be here with you. Can I ask you one more thing? How am I doing? Am I being helpful, or am I making things worse?

Patient: You're trying, and sometimes your calm voice actually loosens my shoulders for a second, but mostly I feel confused and like you're not really getting how raw the shame is — then the doom-movie spikes: she'll leave, I'll lose my job. I don't know if you're helping or making it worse; I'm torn — a small part of me feels a little safer, but the bigger part feels more exposed when you push breathing or tiny steps that my brain instantly turns into proof of the finale. Can we slow down and stick to one tiny, concrete step I can actually try right now without it flipping into the whole collapse?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling torn and confused, unsure if the therapist is helping or making things worse. They're experiencing a mix of emotions, including shame, panic, and a desire to be safe. Goal: Introduce a simple and concrete step that the patient can take right now, without adding complexity or pressure.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something very simple. I want you to take one tiny breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say "I'm here" to yourself. Just those two words: "I'm here". Say them to yourself, looking in the mirror, looking down at your feet, or looking up at the ceiling. Just say "I'm here". Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: Okay — I'm taking a slow breath and saying to myself, "I'm here." For a second it loosens my shoulders, but then the shame from that presentation spikes and I can already see it turning into proof: she'll decide I'm checked out, she'll leave, people at work will whisper, HR will call, and I'm fired and alone — I can picture every awful step. I'm feeling really claustrophobic and overwhelmed right now — can we slow down? I don't know how saying that doesn't just feed the finale.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain even a brief moment of calm, and the catastrophic thinking is quickly overwhelming them. They're feeling claustrophobic, overwhelmed, and desperate to slow down. Goal: Introduce a fundamental shift in the therapeutic relationship, acknowledging the patient's experience as valid and the therapist's role as a supportive presence.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I can see that you're really struggling. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to feel claustrophobic. Let's just pause for a moment. Can I ask you one thing? Would you rather talk about what just happened with the "I'm here" exercise, or would you rather just stop talking for a minute and focus on your breath?

Patient: I think I'd rather just stop talking and focus on my breath for a minute — but I'm skeptical it'll help because the doom-movie always barges back the second I try to calm down. I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, so can we slow down and just sit with the breathing for a bit?
