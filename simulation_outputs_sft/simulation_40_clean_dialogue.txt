Patient: I've been thinking a lot about how since the move I've been hit by this persistent melancholy and a kind of motivational inertia that's bleeding into my relationship. As a business owner, I keep trying to intellectualize it—wondering if it's an adjustment syndrome, a blow to my self-esteem, or just circumstantial—rather than actually feeling the sadness. I notice I talk around the emotions with big-picture explanations because sitting with them feels unsafe.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you sit with the sadness for a moment, like right now? What's the first thing that comes up for you, without trying to explain it or intellectualize it? Maybe we can start with just noticing what's present, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try not to analyze it, though that's my reflex. Right now I notice a heavy pressure behind my ribs and this dull fogginess that makes everything feel muted and slow. Under that is a small, insistent whisper that I'm not enough for my partner or my business, and even naming it feels like I'm stepping around actually feeling it.

Therapist: That whisper of not being enough is really small, but it's still there. Can you try to hold onto that feeling for just a second longer, without trying to push it away or change it? Just notice how it feels to have this thought, without trying to do anything about it. What does it feel like to have that thought present, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: When I hold it, it feels like a small, heavy pebble pressed under my ribs that makes my breath shallow and my shoulders brace. My throat tightens and my chest goes a little cold, and immediately my brain kicks into overdrive—spinning explanations and action plans to get rid of the discomfort. I notice a urge to do something—text my partner, check work—anything to displace it, which makes staying with the feeling feel almost impossible.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is really trying to do something about this feeling of not being enough. Can you observe that urge to displace the feeling, without acting on it? Notice what happens in your body when you think about doing something to distract yourself – does it feel like you're bracing yourself, or tightening up? What is it that you think you're trying to achieve by doing something to displace this feeling? Is it to avoid the discomfort, or is it to do something else entirely?

Patient: When I observe that urge, my whole body tightens — shoulders hike up, my hands clench a bit, breath gets shallow and my heart flips like it's gearing up to act. My mind immediately starts scaffolded plans: text, work, fix, explain — anything to convert the emotion into something actionable. I can see, analytically, that it's mostly avoidance: I want to neutralize the discomfort, preserve a sense of competence, and get quick reassurance that I'm still "enough" for my partner and my business. But honestly, even saying that feels like a strategy to keep from actually sitting with the cold pebble in my chest.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the avoidance, and even the thought of acknowledging it feels like a way to keep from actually feeling it. Can you try to simply acknowledge that feeling for now, without trying to change it or do anything about it? Just notice the sensation of the pebble in your chest, and the thoughts that arise when you think about it – without trying to push them away or replace them with something else. What happens when you just sit with it for a moment, without trying to do anything about it?

Patient: When I just sit with it, the pebble gets heavier and my breath shortens, and there's this sudden hot sting behind my eyes like I'm about to cry but also embarrassed to let it out. My reflex is to narrate—pull in a conceptual framework about adjustment, competence, resilience—because that keeps the feeling at arm's length; but when the narration quiets, what remains is this small, persistent shame and a hollow tiredness that makes everything feel pointless. Then the urge to do something—text, work, fix—surges so strong it almost drowns the ache, which is why staying feels so hard.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is a really difficult feeling to be with. Can you try to explore what that shame might be about, without trying to change it or push it away? What comes up for you when you think about your worthiness or competence in this moment? Is there something specific that's coming up, or is it more of a general feeling? What does the shame look like to you, right now? Is it a thought, a feeling, a physical sensation? Try to hold onto that for a moment, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I guess, intellectually, it feels like a hybrid of imposter syndrome, attachment anxiety, and this internal narrative that I'm fundamentally unreliable — like a theory that keeps proving itself wrong but loudly anyway. When I try to actually feel it, it's a bruise-like pressure under my sternum, a hot sting behind my eyes, and images of my partner disappointed or clients leaving that make my throat tighten and my whole body want to perform competence. Admitting that already makes me want to analyze it away, and honestly I don't know how to stay with it longer without my chest closing up — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're already losing your breath. Can we take a deep breath together, just for a moment, and slow down the pace of the conversation? Let's focus on just one thing, without trying to analyze it too much. Can you just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, right now? Just that sensation. No thoughts, no feelings, no trying to do anything. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — breathing in I notice cool air at my nostrils and a small lift in my ribs; breathing out there's a tiny release but the chest-bruise feeling stays. Even as I try to just notice, my mind jumps in and labels it—'anxiety,' 'shortness'—and immediately starts trying to fix it. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed and my throat's tightening; can we slow the pace? I want to stay with this but it's hard without my brain stepping in.

Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm. Can you notice the sensation in your throat, without labeling it? It's like a gentle constriction, a tightness that's spreading upward. Can you just be with that, for a moment? No trying to fix it, no trying to make it go away. Just the sensation. And can you also notice the feeling of overwhelm that's arising? It's like a sense of being stuck, of being unable to move forward. Can you just notice that too, without trying to change it? Just be with it, for a moment.

Patient: Yeah — the throat feels like a tight band, like my words are being compressed and can't come out; there's a hot jitter right under it. The overwhelm is like quicksand: everything small suddenly feels huge and my chest gets heavy, breath shallow. My reflex is already to catalog causes and make a plan instead of staying with this, so — okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down even further. Let's take a deep breath together, and just be with the sensation of the breath. Can you just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to think about it? No thinking, no cataloging, no planning. Just the sensation. Let's just be with that, for a moment. When you're ready, we can slowly start to explore the sensations in your body again, but for now, let's just focus on the breath.

Patient: Okay — breathing in I notice the cool air at my nostrils and a tiny lift in my ribs; breathing out there's a small release but the pebble in my chest and the band in my throat are still there. My brain immediately wants to label and fix—'anxiety,' 'adjustment'—so it's hard to just be with the breath; can we slow even more and stay with a couple of breaths together?

Therapist: Let's take one more deep breath together. Just breathe in, and notice the sensation of the air moving in... (pause)...and just be with that, for a moment. Don't think about it, don't label it, don't fix it. Just be with the sensation of the breath, as it is. (pause) And now, breathe out... (pause)...and just be with that, too. Just be with the sensation of the breath, as it is. We'll stay with it together, for just one more moment.

Patient: Okay—breathing in I feel the cool air and a little lift in my ribs; breathing out there's a small release but the pebble in my chest and the band in my throat are still there. I'm getting jumpy now—my heart's a bit faster and my attention keeps snagging on other things, so I can't settle into the breath. I want to fix or plan it away and that just makes the anxiety louder. Can we slow way down? I need really slow, just a couple of breaths at a time.

Therapist: Let's slow down to almost nothing. Just take one tiny breath in... (pause)...and notice the sensation of the air moving in. Don't think about it, don't label it, don't fix it. Just be with the sensation of the air moving in. (pause)...And then just take a tiny breath out... (pause)...and notice the sensation of the breath leaving your body. Don't think about it, don't label it, don't fix it. Just be with the sensation of the breath leaving. Let's just focus on that for one tiny moment. Just one.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how the tiny breaths are supposed to help—when I try it I can feel the air, but my chest's still tight and my heart's a bit faster, and my attention keeps snagging on other things. I did the breath in and out, but instead of settling I feel more jumpy and confused, like I can't get the point of this. Can we slow way down—just one very slow breath and a longer pause—because I'm having trouble staying with it.

Therapist: Let's start again, but this time, let's try something different. Let's just be still. Sit for a moment, and just be still. Don't think about anything, don't breathe, don't do anything. Just exist. Let's just sit for a really, really long time... (pause)...like 30 seconds, maybe even longer. Just sit, and be still, and exist. Don't worry about your chest, don't worry about your heart, don't worry about anything. Just be.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—asking me to not breathe feels... impossible, and it actually spikes my panic. When I try to "just exist" like that my throat tightens, my chest gets heavier, and I feel trapped rather than calmer. How is that supposed to help? Can we instead do one very slow breath together and stay with that, or slow the pace even more?

Therapist: Let's take one very, very slow breath together. Just breathe in for a count of 4... (pause)...1...2...3...4...and then just breathe out for a count of 4... (pause)...1...2...3...4...Let's just focus on the breath for a moment, and try to let go of any tension in the body. As we breathe in, can you just notice the sensation of the air moving in, without trying to think about it? And as we breathe out, can you just notice the sensation of the breath leaving the body, without trying to think about it? Just focus on the breath, and let's just be here for a moment.

Patient: I'm trying to follow the 4-count but when I do my chest stays tight and my mind starts snagging on everything—counting just feels mechanical and kind of ramps my anxiety. Can we do one very slow breath together with a long, quiet pause after the exhale instead? I need that extra stillness to settle; can we try that, please?

Therapist: Let's take one very slow breath together. Just breathe in for a second... (pause)...and then exhale slowly... (pause)...for a really long time. Just breathe out, and let it be still for a long time. Don't think about the breath, don't think about anything. Just be still. See if you can feel anything change as you sit there in stillness. Just be.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—being told to "just be still" actually feels like a threat to the one thing keeping me regulated, and it spikes my panic. My chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, and my heart kicks up; at the same time my mind starts scaffolding explanations to avoid the fear. Can we instead do one long slow exhale together and then hold a really long, quiet pause while you stay with me verbally—counting or giving a gentle cue—because I need that external structure to not spiral? I'm trying not to intellectualize this, but I can feel the anxiety loud and clear and it's hard to settle without help.

Therapist: Let's start with a slow exhale together. Just breathe out slowly, completely, and deeply... (pause)...and hold it. Just stay with the exhale, and don't think about anything else. Hold it for a really long time... (pause)...don't worry about counting, just hold it. I'm right here with you, and we'll just stay in this pause together. Let's just hold it for a moment.

Patient: I can't hold my breath — asking me to "hold it" actually spikes my panic and makes me feel trapped. My chest clamps, my throat closes, and I get lightheaded and urgent to breathe. 

Can we not hold? I need a slow exhale into a natural inhale with a long, quiet pause where you stay with me verbally — like you counting softly or saying "again" before the next breath. That external structure helps me stay present; otherwise my mind just starts planning escape. I'm trying not to overanalyze, but I'm noticing fear of losing control when I'm told to hold. Can we try one very slow exhale followed by a normal inhale, with you guiding the pace?

Therapist: Let's try a slow exhale followed by a natural inhale. Just breathe out slowly... (pause)...and exhale completely. Now, just breathe in naturally, and let the breath fill your lungs. (pause)...Just sit there, and breathe. I'm right here with you. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment. (pause)...Again. Just breathe in and out, and let's just be here.

Patient: Okay—breathing in now, breathing out... I feel a tiny looseness but my heart's still racing and my mind keeps snagging on other things. I need you to guide me more directly—count me in slowly or say "again" before the next breath—without that I start planning escape. Can we do another slow one with you giving those gentle cues?

Therapist: Just breathe in... (pause)...1...2...3... Now, breathe out... (pause)...1...2...3... Just exhale completely. (pause)...1...2...3...Now, breathe in again... (pause)...1...2...3...Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment. (pause)...Again. Just breathe in and out, and let's just be here.

Patient: Okay—breathing with your counts I feel a tiny looseness but my heart's still racing and my attention keeps snagging on other stuff. I'm not sure I follow how the counting is supposed to help; I need you to count much more slowly and say "again" before the next inhale so I have that external cue, otherwise I start spiraling into planning. Can we do another one like that? I'm jittery and confused and I need you to stay with me through it.

Therapist: Breathe in... 1... (pause) Now, breathe out... 1... (pause) Just exhale completely. 1... (pause) Now, breathe in... 1... (pause) Again. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment. (pause) Breathe in... 1... (pause) Now, breathe out... 1... (pause) Just exhale completely. 1... (pause) Again.

Patient: Okay — your counts help a little; there's a tiny looseness but my heart's still racing and my attention keeps snagging. I need you to say "again" before the next inhale and count way more slowly with long pauses between numbers so I have an external anchor, because otherwise I start planning escape. Also, I'm already slipping into analyzing it all — wondering if this is just an autonomic response — instead of actually feeling, and that's making it hard; can we do another slow, cued cycle like that?

Therapist: Breathe out... 1... (pause) 5... (pause) Just exhale completely. 1... (pause) Now, breathe in... 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) 5... 1... (pause) Again. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment. (pause) Breathe out... 1... (pause) 5... (pause) Just exhale completely. 1... (pause) Now, breathe in... 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) 5... 1... (pause) Again.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow this counting—it's feeling inconsistent and it's making me more anxious and jumpy, like my heart's racing and my attention keeps snagging. I need you to count much more slowly with long pauses, say "again" before the inhale, and give a steady verbal anchor or I'll start planning escape. Also I'm already slipping into analyzing why this isn't working instead of feeling it, and that's frustrating—can we try one very slow, cued breath together with you staying verbally present the whole time?

Therapist: Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Breathe in... (pause)...1... (pause)...2... (pause)...3... (pause)...4... (pause)...5... (pause)...Again. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's just stay here for a moment. (pause)...You are sitting here, and I am speaking to you. Just be present with that. (pause)...Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Breathe in... (pause)...1... (pause)...2... (pause)...3... (pause)...4... (pause)...5... (pause)...Again.

Patient: I'm getting really scrambled — the counting still feels erratic and my chest's tight, heart's racing, and my attention keeps snagging. I need a very slow, steady verbal anchor: say "again" before the inhale, then count slowly to four with long, even pauses between numbers and stay verbally present the whole time so I don't start planning escape. I'm aware I'm slipping into analysis — calling it autonomic arousal and scaffolding explanations to avoid the feeling — but I want to try if we can slow way down and do just one more guided, cued breath together.

Therapist: Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Take a deep breath, and let's start again. (pause)...1... (pause)... (long pause) 2... (pause)... (long pause) 3... (pause)... (long pause) 4... (pause)... (long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I'm going to say it again: breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Breathe in... (pause)...1... (pause)... (long pause) 2... (pause)... (long pause) 3... (pause)... (long pause) 4... (pause)... (long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to follow but it's still all jagged; my chest's tight, my heart's racing, and my attention keeps snagging on other things. I appreciate you saying you're here — I need you to say "again" before the inhale and then count very slowly to four with long, even pauses and stay verbally present the whole time, otherwise my brain starts planning escape. I'm also noticing I'm slipping into analysis—labeling this as autonomic arousal—rather than actually feeling, though there is a tiny looseness under my sternum right now. Can we try one more, exactly like that?

Therapist: Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Take a deep breath, and let's start again. (pause)...1... (pause)... (long pause)...2... (pause)... (long pause)...3... (pause)... (long pause)...4... (pause)... (long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. You're doing the best you can, and that's okay. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I'm going to say "again" when you're ready to breathe in. Just breathe in slowly, and then we'll start again. (pause)...1... (pause)... (long pause)...2... (pause)... (long pause)...3... (pause)... (long pause)...4... (pause)... (long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe.

Patient: I'm feeling really scrambled and confused — I don't fully follow how the counting's supposed to help; it still feels jagged and makes my heart race. I need you to say "again" before the inhale, then count very slowly to four with long, even pauses and stay verbally present the whole time so I have an external anchor, otherwise my mind scaffolds escape plans. I know I'm slipping into analyzing this as autonomic arousal instead of feeling it, but there is a tiny looseness under my sternum and I'm willing to try if you guide me exactly like that — can we do one slow, cued cycle now?

Therapist: Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Take a deep breath, and let's start again. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. (pause)...Breathe in... (pause)...1... (pause)... (very long pause) 2... (pause)... (very long pause) 3... (pause)... (very long pause) 4... (pause)... (very long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe. Notice how your body is feeling right now. Can you feel anything changing, even just a little bit? I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Just breathe, and let's see what happens.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help — I'm more confused and jumpy. I do notice a tiny looseness under my sternum, but my heart's racing and my attention keeps snagging; part of me is already labeling it as autonomic arousal instead of actually feeling it. Can you please say "again" before the inhale and then count very slowly to four with long, even pauses while staying verbally present the whole time? I need that external anchor to not start planning escape, and I want to keep trying.

Therapist: Breathe out... (pause)...just exhale completely. (pause)...Take a deep breath, and let's start again. (pause)...1... (pause)... (very long pause)...2... (pause)... (very long pause)...3... (pause)... (very long pause)...4... (pause)... (very long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe. I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you please just focus on your breath right now? Try to let go of any thoughts or distractions. Say "again" to yourself if you need to. (pause)...Again. (pause)...1... (pause)... (very long pause)...2... (pause)... (very long pause)...3... (pause)... (very long pause)...4... (pause)... (very long pause)...Just sit here, and breathe.

Patient: I'm really scrambled and confused — the counting still feels jagged and my heart's racing, though there's a tiny looseness under my sternum. I keep slipping into analyzing it as autonomic arousal instead of actually feeling it. Can you please say "again" before the inhale, then count VERY slowly to four with long, even pauses and stay verbally present the whole time (and say "again" after the exhale before the next inhale)? I want to try one more like that.

Therapist: , and then immediately move on to asking you a question about your response, but without really listening to my response. I'm not sure how much longer I can do this without feeling overwhelmed. I need a way out of this cycle. Can we stop here and try a different approach?

Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and kind of scrambled — like you're moving on before I'm heard, and that just spikes my panic and makes me want to get out of here. Can we stop the breath stuff for now? Could we try a different approach, like a grounding 5-4-3-2-1 exercise or you reflecting back what you heard from me before asking another question? I need you to slow down and actually mirror me for a moment so I don't start planning escape.

Patient: I'm really not following that last block — it reads like a jumble and it actually spikes my anxiety more. I'm feeling scrambled, like my thoughts are scattering and my chest tightens when the pacing or instructions get chaotic. Can you slow down and just reflect back what you heard me say about the pebble in my chest, the band in my throat, and needing an external anchor? If that's hard, can we switch to a simple 5-4-3-2-1 grounding right now instead?
