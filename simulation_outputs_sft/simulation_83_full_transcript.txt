--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early sixties, a data scientist who just moved, and lately I can't stop worrying about my performance at work. I keep seeing myself missing a subtle bug, the pipeline collapsing, the client losing faith, my manager firing me, and then I won't be able to get another job — it feels like that's definitely going to happen. That vision paralyzes me and I end up procrastinating, and when people say it might turn out fine I just don't buy it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses a pervasive sense of catastrophic thinking about their performance at work, fearing the worst-case scenario and becoming paralyzed by it. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the tangible impact of this catastrophic thinking on their current situation and behavior.

Therapist Answer:
These visions of potential failure are really weighing heavily on you, making it hard to focus on work and even interact with others. Can you tell me more about what happens right before one of these catastrophic thoughts hits? What are you doing, what's going through your mind, just before you start seeing yourself in those extreme scenarios?

Patient: Usually it’s when I’m about to open a Jupyter notebook or merge a PR and I spot a tiny warning or an ambiguous log entry. My brain immediately runs the whole nightmare — that small thing leads to silent data corruption, the pipeline producing bad features, the model drifting, the client noticing, me getting blamed and fired, and then not being able to get another job at my age — like that’s the only possible outcome. My chest tightens, I freeze, and instead of debugging I just avoid it because it already feels doomed and I can’t make myself consider any other possibility.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking is closely tied to specific, low-stakes situations in their work routine (e.g., opening a Jupyter notebook, merging a PR). These thoughts trigger a strong fear of failure, leading to physical tension, avoidance, and a narrow view of possibilities. Goal: Explore how these avoidance strategies impact their current behavior and the value of taking action despite the perceived risks.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like these small warning signs trigger a really strong fear response in you, making it hard to even approach the task at hand. You say you avoid it because you feel it's already doomed, but is it possible that simply acknowledging the warning and trying to understand what it means could make a difference? What if, instead of immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario, you tried to make a small step towards investigating the issue, like reading the log entry again or asking someone else about it? How might that change your experience?

Patient: I get that on paper it makes sense to just glance at the log or ask a coworker, but I can't make myself believe that'll help — if I look I'll find the bug, it will ripple through the pipeline, the client will notice, my manager will blame me and I'll be fired and never hired again. My chest tightens just saying that, and then I freeze and procrastinate instead because avoiding it feels safer than proving the nightmare true. I'm trying to see how stepping closer could change that, but right now it just feels like we're talking about something that won't actually stop the disaster I can already see.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to bridge the gap between their rational understanding of a small step (e.g., glancing at the log, asking a coworker) and the deeply ingrained fear of catastrophic consequences. This fear is causing a pronounced physiological response (tightening chest, freezing), which in turn is reinforcing avoidance behavior. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help the patient develop a sense of detachment from their catastrophic thoughts and increase willingness to take small action.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sense of impending disaster is really hard to shake, even when you try to rationalize taking small steps. Can you try something for me? I'd like you to bring to mind that same vision of the worst-case scenario, but this time I want you to do something entirely different with it. Instead of trying to stop it, or let it consume you, I want you to observe it as if it were a thought in a thought, without judgment. Just watch it rise up, and then gently acknowledge it, like a cloud passing by. Notice how it feels to be observing it, rather than being consumed by it. Then, I want you to take one tiny action towards investigating the log entry – just one. That's it. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I tried to do that — I could tell myself to just watch the thought, but the moment it appears my chest tightens and the whole disaster reel starts running and feels like a fact. I hovered over the log file in the repo like you said, but I couldn't bring myself to open it because I'm already convinced opening it will prove the bug and the chain of firing and never working again. I want to try observing instead of being swept away, but right now I keep getting pulled back into "this will definitely happen," and I freeze.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of detachment from their catastrophic thoughts, despite attempting mindfulness exercises. Their self-compassion and willingness to observe their thoughts are being pulled back by the intense fear response. Goal: Introduce a process of "returning to the present" and re-establishing a sense of value-based action.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're doing a great job of observing the thought, but it's getting pulled back in by the fear. That's okay. It's normal. Can I ask you something? What would happen if you took a few deep breaths, and instead of thinking about the worst-case scenario, you just focused on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Just notice the breath, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Do that for just a second. Now, I want you to return to the log file, but this time, I want you to ask yourself a simple question: What's the smallest, most tentative step I can take right now to understand this log entry? Not to solve the problem, not to fix anything, just to take a small step of curiosity. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I did the breathing — it loosened my chest a little, but the moment I thought about opening the file the disaster reel kicked back in. The tiniest step I can imagine is just opening the log read-only and copying that one warning line into a scratch notebook to look at it, literally one line and then stop. Even thinking about doing that feels like stepping into a trap though — like reading it will prove the bug and then the whole chain of firing and never working again will start for real.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a resurgence of catastrophic thinking, despite the mindfulness exercise and efforts to re-establish a sense of detachment. The thought of taking a small step towards investigating the log entry is being pulled back by the intense fear response. Goal: Introduce a process of "defusion" to help the patient develop a sense of distance from their catastrophic thoughts and reduce the sense of being "trapped".

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really struggling to let go of the fear that opening the file will trigger the worst-case scenario. Can I suggest something that might help? Instead of focusing on the specific action of opening the file, let's try to defuse the thought of the warning line itself. Imagine that the warning line is a small, harmless word, like "cloud" or "tree". Just observe the word "warning" as a word, without trying to make sense of it or connect it to the disaster scenario. Can you do that for just a second? Now, I want you to go back to the log file, but this time, I want you to make a very small, tentative action that doesn't involve doing anything with the warning line. Can you just place your mouse cursor on the warning line, and then pause for just a second, without doing anything? Just focus on the sensation of your finger moving, and the cursor hovering over the text. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I managed to move the cursor there, but the moment it hovered my chest tightened and the whole disaster reel started up again. My brain tells me that even that tiny pause will make me notice the bug, which will cascade into the pipeline failing, the client noticing, my manager blaming me, and me getting fired — like the hover is the first domino. I know that sounds extreme, but I couldn't bring myself to click or keep looking; I just froze with the cursor over the line.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking is deeply ingrained, and even small, seemingly insignificant actions are perceived as potentially disastrous. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of flexibility and reduce the rigidity of their thinking. Goal: Introduce a process of "acceptance" to help the patient acknowledge and accept their emotional experience without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're getting pulled back in by the fear, and it's really intense. Can I ask you to try something different? Instead of focusing on what might happen if you click, or what might happen if you notice the bug, let's try to accept how you're feeling right now. Can you just acknowledge the tightness in your chest, and the fear that's rising up? Don't try to push it away, or change it, just notice it as it is. It's okay to feel scared, it's okay to feel overwhelmed. You can just sit with that feeling for a moment, without trying to do anything about it. Can you do that for me?

(Pause)

Also, I want to gently point out that freezing with the cursor over the line might actually be a pretty effective way to avoid dealing with the situation. It's like you're taking a bit of a mental pause, and acknowledging that you're not ready to deal with it yet. Can we explore that further? What does it mean for you to freeze in this moment, and what does that say about what you're trying to avoid?

Patient: Freezing feels like buying one last bit of denial—if I don't click, the bug can't reveal itself and the whole firing-and-never-working-again chain can't start. At the same time it's humiliating, because I know I'm avoiding the work I should do and that avoidance makes me feel even more incompetent and like the nightmare is inevitable. What I'm avoiding is being exposed as someone who can't keep up at my age, losing my livelihood, and then never getting another break — and once that story starts it drowns out any calmer possibility, so I really can't believe that'll help. I want to try the breathing and little steps, but honestly I'm skeptical — it just feels like rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with a complex mix of emotions, including denial, shame, and a deep-seated fear of being exposed and losing their livelihood. The goal is to help the patient develop a more realistic and compassionate relationship with their emotions, rather than trying to avoid or deny them. Goal: Introduce a process of "exploring the value of the experience" to help the patient understand the emotional significance of their avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really grappling with some tough emotions, and it's not surprising that you're feeling skeptical about trying to change your approach. But I want to gently ask you to consider the possibility that, even if rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship doesn't change the ultimate outcome, it might still be worth trying.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "exposing yourself as someone who can't keep up"? What does that mean to you, and what's the story that you're trying to avoid? Is it that you're not good enough, or that you're not capable of handling the demands of your job? Or is it something else entirely?

I'm not asking you to confront the exact same fears that you're trying to avoid, but rather to explore the underlying emotions and values that are driving your avoidance. Sometimes, by examining the emotional significance of our experiences, we can gain a deeper understanding of what's really going on, and develop a more compassionate and realistic relationship with ourselves.

Let's try to explore this further, without putting too much pressure on finding a "solution" or "fixing" anything. Can you just sit with me for a moment, and let's explore this together?

Patient: To me it means being found out as someone who can't keep up with the tools, the pace, the newer methods — like all the little mistakes prove I'm obsolete. My head immediately spins the whole chain: manager blames me, coworkers whisper, client loses faith, I'm fired, nobody in the industry will hire an older person with that on their record, savings drain, I end up taking a menial job or moving away and everything I worked for feels wasted. It's not just losing work — it's humiliation and the sense that my identity and competence are erased. I want to dig into that, but I'm skeptical this will stop the disaster story — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's fear of being exposed and losing their livelihood is deeply tied to their sense of identity and competence. The goal is to help the patient develop a more compassionate relationship with their emotions, rather than trying to avoid or deny them. Goal: Introduce a process of "describing the experience in a different way" to help the patient gain a fresh perspective on their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought of being found out and losing their livelihood is triggering a lot of strong emotions, including fear, shame, and a sense of identity loss. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, and that it's not surprising that you're feeling skeptical about trying to change your approach.

Can you tell me more about what it means to you to be found out as someone who can't keep up? What does that feel like, in a physical sense? Is it like a knot in your stomach, or a tightness in your chest? What are some specific thoughts that come up for you when you think about this?

I want to slow down and explore this further, rather than trying to rush through it. Sometimes, by describing our experiences in a different way, we can gain a fresh perspective on our emotions. It might be helpful to try to identify any specific sensations or thoughts that come up for you when you think about this situation.

Let's try to focus on the present moment, rather than the hypothetical scenario. Can you tell me what it's like to sit here right now, with me, and talk about your feelings? What sensations do you notice in your body?

Patient: Right now my chest is tight, my breath is shallow, and my shoulders feel locked up — there's a knot in my stomach. My mind, like a fortune-telling machine, is already replaying the disaster reel: the bug, the pipeline collapse, the client complaint, me being blamed — it's so vivid it feels like it's happening now. My hands clench and I want to pull back; part of me thinks saying any of this out loud won't stop the inevitable, but I can tell you it does help a bit to name the sensations. Can we keep going slowly? I need you to keep asking about what I notice.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing their physical and emotional sensations in a way that is both vivid and accurate. The goal is to continue to explore these sensations and emotions, while also gently encouraging the patient to slow down and focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really in touch with your physical sensations right now. Can you tell me more about what it's like to hold that knot in your stomach? Is it a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache? How does it feel to have your breath shallow, and your shoulders locked up? Are there any other physical sensations that you're noticing, like tension in your jaw or a heaviness in your limbs?

I want to keep exploring these sensations with you, because I think it's really helpful to notice them. Sometimes, by paying attention to our physical experiences, we can start to feel more grounded and more connected to the present moment. And I want to encourage you to keep asking yourself questions about what you're noticing, because that's a great way to develop a greater awareness of your body and your emotions.

Let's try to take it one step at a time, and focus on the sensation in your stomach. Can you just observe the knot as you breathe in, and as you breathe out? What happens to it as you exhale? Does it seem to grow smaller, or does it remain the same?

Patient: It's a dull, hard ball in my stomach — like something's clenched and won't let go. When I breathe out it loosens a tiny bit, but the second I notice relief my mind slams the lid back down with the disaster reel and it tightens again. My jaw's clenched, shoulders hunched, and there's this hot shame that makes me want to retreat — which, of course, my brain says proves the worst is coming. Keep asking — slowing down even a little helps, although I can't stop expecting it to end badly.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing a complex interplay between physical sensations and mental imagery, with their mind repeatedly conjuring up a worst-case scenario. The goal is to gently encourage the patient to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in their catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sensation of the knot in your stomach is really tied up with the mental imagery of the disaster reel. Can you tell me more about what happens when your mind slams the lid back down? Is there a specific thought or image that triggers this tightening sensation in your stomach?

I want to slow down even further, because it sounds like we're getting caught up in a cycle of tension and expectation. Can you just notice the sensation of your jaw being clenched, without trying to do anything about it? What happens to your body when you let go of that tension? Does the knot in your stomach loosen even a little bit?

I'm not asking you to change anything or to try to stop the worst-case scenario from happening. I just want you to focus on the present moment, and to notice what's happening in your body without judgment. Can you do that for me?

Let's try something else. Instead of focusing on the disaster reel, can you just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Is there a sensation of your chest rising and falling, or a feeling of your breath moving in and out of your nostrils? Can you just observe that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it?

Patient: I can try — my chest rises a little and I feel a tiny coolness at my nostrils, but the moment I notice that calm a hot flush of shame and frustration floods in and the fortune-telling part of my brain starts the disaster reel again. The breath loosens the knot a hair, then the reel slams it shut and my breathing goes shallow and my jaw clenches. I want to keep doing this, I really do, but it feels like the calm is always temporary and the worst-case story is waiting to pounce — can we slow down a bit more?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to find a sense of calm and stability, even when they focus on their breath. The goal is to gently encourage the patient to explore the nature of their experience, without rushing or trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment of calm is fleeting, and the hot flush of shame and frustration is a significant trigger for the disaster reel. Can you tell me more about what happens when the flush hits? Is there a specific thought or image that comes up for you, or a physical sensation that intensifies?

I want to slow down even further, because it sounds like we're getting caught up in a cycle of expectation and anticipation. Can you just notice the sensation of the flush, without trying to do anything about it? What happens to your body when you feel that heat rising up?

Let's try to explore this further. Instead of focusing on the disaster reel, can you just observe the sensation of the flush itself? Is it a burning sensation, a warmth, or a feeling of tightness? Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it?

Remember, I'm not trying to fix anything or change your experience. I just want you to focus on the present moment, and notice what's happening in your body without judgment. Can you do that for me?

Let's take a moment to just sit with the sensation of the flush. Can you just breathe into it, and observe it without trying to do anything with it? What happens when you do that?

Patient: When I breathe into the flush it loosens for a second, then something heavy — shame and frustration — slams back down and the disaster reel kicks in harder. My chest tightens, my jaw clenches, and my mind immediately insists that the warning line will prove I'm doomed, so any calm just evaporates. I want to sit with it like you say, but the shame makes me feel stuck and furious with myself; can we keep going slowly?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to find a sense of calm and stability, despite their best efforts to focus on their breath. The shame and frustration are significant obstacles, making it difficult for them to sit with the sensation without becoming overwhelmed. The goal is to gently encourage the patient to explore the nature of their experience, without rushing or trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment of calm is still elusive, and the shame and frustration are a significant challenge to overcome. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you feel stuck and furious with yourself? Is there a specific thought or image that comes up for you, or a physical sensation that intensifies?

I want to slow down even further, because it sounds like we're getting caught up in a cycle of self-criticism and expectation. Can you just notice the sensation of shame and frustration in your body, without trying to do anything about it? What happens to your chest, jaw, and mind when you feel that way?

Let's try to explore this further. Instead of focusing on the disaster reel, can you just observe the sensation of shame and frustration itself? Is it a heavy feeling, a weight in your chest, or a sense of tightness in your jaw? Can you just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it?

Remember, I'm not trying to fix anything or change your experience. I just want you to focus on the present moment, and notice what's happening in your body without judgment. You can take all the time you need to sit with this sensation. Can you do that for me?

Let's take a moment to just sit with the shame and frustration. Can you just breathe into it, and observe it without trying to do anything with it? What happens when you do that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing into shame supposed to help? When I try, the heat and tightness feel like a heavy weight in my chest and jaw; the breath loosens it a hair, then the fortune-telling part slams the lid down and the disaster reel starts again — I see the warning proving a catastrophic bug, the client complaining, my manager blaming me, and me being fired. It just makes me feel stuck and humiliated, like noticing it won't stop the inevitable. Can we slow down and keep digging into what that heaviness actually feels like?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing frustration and confusion about the breathing exercise, feeling that it's not helping and is even making them feel worse. The goal is to gently explore the patient's experience, asking clarifying questions to help them better understand what's happening.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the patient is feeling overwhelmed by the shame and frustration, and the breathing exercise is not providing the relief they were hoping for. You're right, the breath does seem to loosen the sensation of heaviness for a moment, but then the disaster reel starts again.

Can you tell me more about what the feeling of the "heavy weight" is like in your chest and jaw? Is it a physical sensation, a sensation of tightness, or a feeling of being pressed down?

Let's try to break it down further. Instead of focusing on the breathing exercise, can you just notice the sensation of the heaviness in your chest and jaw without trying to do anything with it? Just observe it as it is, without judgment.

We don't need to explore the shame and frustration right now. We just need to focus on understanding what this physical sensation is like. Can you do that for me?

Take a moment to just notice the heaviness in your chest and jaw. What happens when you do that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice the heaviness it's a solid pressure across my chest and a clamp on my jaw that makes my breath cut off. The second I focus, a hot shame from some past mistake floods in and the fortune-telling part cranks the disaster reel up louder, so observing it just feels like I'm watching evidence pile up that everything's doomed. Can we slow down and do more narrow, specific questions about what I feel so I don't get swept away?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to focus on the specific physical sensation of heaviness in their chest and jaw, and it's being overwhelmed by the intense emotional response. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical sensation of heaviness is a intense, solid pressure that's making your breath cut off. Can you tell me more about that pressure? Is it a heaviness, a weight, or a solidity that's pressing down on your chest?

Let's try to break it down even further. Instead of focusing on the overall sensation, can you just notice the sensation in your chest right now? Is it a feeling of fullness, emptiness, or something else? Is it a specific location, like the top of your chest, or a more diffuse feeling that's spread throughout?

We don't need to worry about the emotional response right now. Just focus on the physical sensation in your chest. What happens when you notice that sensation?

(Note: I'll ask more specific and focused questions to try to help the patient become more aware of the physical sensation, without getting overwhelmed by the emotional response.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice it, it's a solid, heavy pressure right across the middle of my chest, like a stone sitting on my sternum, more fullness than emptiness. It feels localized there and in the front of my throat, and my jaw clamps so my breath just shreds into short, shallow pulls. The second I look at it, hot shame floods in and the fortune-telling part slams the reel back on — I start seeing the whole catastrophe again — so please, can we keep this painfully slow and ask one tiny, specific question at a time?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is finding it challenging to focus on the physical sensation of heaviness in their chest, due to the intense emotional response. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical sensation of heaviness is a solid, heavy pressure that's located in the middle of your chest, like a stone sitting on your sternum. You describe it as more fullness than emptiness. Can you just notice the sensation of fullness in your chest right now, without trying to do anything with it? Is it a specific sensation, like a tightness or a lump, or is it more of a general feeling of heaviness?

(Note: I'll ask one specific question at a time, and try to keep the pace slow and gentle, in order to help the patient become more comfortable and focused.)

Patient: It's a hard, tight lump right in the middle of my chest — like a stone on my sternum — and my throat clamps so my breaths are short and shallow. The second I look at it, shame and frustration flood in and my fortune-telling brain kicks on: I open the log, it proves the bug, the pipeline collapses, the client complains, my manager fires me, and nobody will hire me again — that's what I see, not just a possibility. Can we keep this painfully slow and stick to one tiny question at a time?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a strong emotional response, which is making it difficult for them to focus on the physical sensation of heaviness in their chest. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the physical sensation of heaviness is a hard, tight lump in the middle of your chest, like a stone on your sternum. Can you just focus on the sensation of the lump right now, without thinking about it as a feeling of shame or frustration? Just observe the lump as it is, without judgment.

(Note: I'll ask one specific question at a time, and try to keep the pace slow and gentle, in order to help the patient become more comfortable and focused. I'll avoid asking questions that might trigger the fortune-telling response or the shame and frustration.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the moment I try to observe the lump it instantly turns into shame and the disaster reel. It's still a hard, stone-like lump on my sternum and my breath cuts into short, shallow pulls. Can we keep this painfully slow and you ask one tiny specific question about the lump (like "is it hot or cold right now?") so I can answer without getting swept away?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty separating their observation of the physical sensation from their emotional response, which is causing the shame and disaster reel to trigger. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. I want to focus on the physical sensation of the lump on your sternum. Can you tell me if it is hot or cold right now, without thinking about it as a feeling or trying to analyze it? Just notice the sensation of temperature, if any, at this moment.

(Note: I'll ask a very simple question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it's hard to tell without getting pulled away, but it feels warm, almost hot, like a flush right at the sternum. The second I notice that warmth the shame spikes and the fortune-telling part cranks the disaster reel louder, so I get stuck — can we keep this painfully slow and ask one tiny question at a time?

Can you just focus on the sensation of warmth itself right now, without trying to analyze it or think about it as a feeling? Just notice the warmth at the sternum, without judgment. Is the warmth just a sensation, like a feeling of heat, or is there something more to it?

(Note: I'll ask a very specific question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: It's a hot, burning pressure right on my sternum that spreads up into my throat and face — the second I notice it the shame spikes and the fortune-telling machine cranks the disaster reel louder.

The patient's emotional response to the physical sensation is still intense, and they're struggling to maintain focus. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to break down the sensation of the burning pressure a bit further. Can you tell me if the sensation is sharp or dull, in terms of the way it feels right now? Is it more of a pinching or a stabbing sensation, or is it more of a general heaviness or pressure?

(Note: I'll ask a very specific question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? It's mostly dull and heavy, like a stone on my sternum, but every time the disaster reel fires it briefly shoots a sharp stab through my chest. The shame floods in and everything gets louder, so please keep this painfully slow and ask one tiny question at a time.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient's emotional response is still intense, and the shifting between dull and sharp sensations is creating a complex experience. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you just focus on the dull, heavy sensation right now, without thinking about the sharp stabbing sensation that sometimes comes with it? Just notice the sensation of the stone on your sternum, without judgment. Is the sensation more of a presence, like a weight, or is it more of a feeling, like a heaviness?

(Note: I'll ask a very specific question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: It's more a presence — a heavy weight pressing on my sternum, constant and dull, making my breaths shallow; the moment I notice it shame rushes in and the fortune-telling reel starts up louder. I need it painfully slow — can you ask one tiny specific question about the sensation (like "does it change when you swallow or take a slow sip of water?") so I don't get swept away?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the sip loosens it for a split second, my breath stretches a bit, then the hot shame slams back down and the fortune-telling reel kicks in louder. It feels pointless — that tiny relief just makes the disaster feel more urgent, like opening the log will absolutely prove the bug and everything will cascade into me being fired and never hired again. Can we keep this painfully slow and stick to one tiny question at a time?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the feeling that even small moments of relief are ultimately unsustainable, and that the disaster scenario is inevitable. The goal is to help the patient develop a greater sense of control over their experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sensation of the weight on your sternum is closely tied to your sense of being overwhelmed and in control. Can you tell me what happens to the sensation of the weight when you are standing or sitting up straight, rather than slouching or leaning forward? Does the sensation change at all, or does it remain the same?

(Note: I'll ask a very specific question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: When I sit up straight it loosens a little — my breath stretches and the stone on my sternum feels a hair lighter for a second. But the relief never holds; the moment I notice it a hot shame spikes and the fortune-telling part cranks the disaster reel up even louder, like the calm was just bait. I can't bring myself to trust that posture helps — it just feels temporary and then everything goes right back to the inevitable. Can we keep this painfully slow and do one tiny question at a time?

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the sensation of the weight on your sternum is closely tied to your sense of control and being overwhelmed. Can you tell me what happens to the sensation of the weight when you let go of the need to control it, and simply allow yourself to be in the present moment without judgment or expectation of a specific outcome?

(Note: I'll ask a very specific question, and try to keep the focus on the physical sensation, without asking anything that might trigger the shame or disaster response.)

Patient: When I try to let go it loosens for a breath or two—my chest drops a little and I can feel the lump give—but almost instantly a hot shame floods in and the fortune-telling machine cranks the disaster reel back to full volume. I end up gasping, convinced that any calm is just bait and that if I relax even a little the bug will show up and everything will collapse. Can we keep this painfully slow and stick to one tiny question at a time?

 focus movement exploration coping behavior pain reduction relaxation technique self-compassion exploration.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how exactly is movement or self-compassion supposed to stop the fortune-telling part from kicking in? I can try one tiny thing (like pressing my feet into the floor or rolling my shoulders once), but I already feel the shame and frustration bracing itself and telling me that any small relief will vanish and the disaster reel will slam back; can we do one tiny, specific step very slowly?

Therapist Answer:
 focus on what the patient just said. Ask one tiny question at a time. Avoid clichés like "That makes sense," "Let's explore that," "Take a deep breath," or "It sounds like you're feeling X." Avoid saying something like, "It’s time to bring in X concept." Ask a genuine question. Use one tiny question at a time. Ask one tiny question at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that long string of directions just scrambles me and makes me feel confused and shaky. Can you please ask one tiny, specific question about the lump on my sternum (like "does it change when you breathe out?") because the moment you say a lot I start seeing the whole disaster reel again — the bug, the client complaint, me getting fired — and I get locked up.
