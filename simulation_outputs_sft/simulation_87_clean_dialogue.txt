Patient: I’ve been stuck in this loop where every tiny screw-up at work—like burning a dish or missing a shift—turns into proof I’m useless, and because of my history with messy relationships I tell myself it’ll wreck any chance of steady work or a decent partner. My head immediately jumps to the worst: I’ll never get another steady job, I’ll end up living out of my car, alone, and back with someone who treats me like dirt, and everyone will see me as a failure. I know it sounds extreme, but I can’t stop hearing those outcomes like they’re facts.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right after you start thinking about these potential outcomes? How do you go from these thoughts to your behavior at work or in your relationships? For example, what do you do when you think, "I'm going to burn another dish, and I'm useless," or "I'll never find a partner, and I'll end up alone"?

Patient: As soon as that thought pops up—“I’m gonna burn this, I’m useless”—my body tenses and I either go hyper-focused, triple-checking everything and working way past exhaustion, or I shut down and avoid the shift altogether because I figure messing up is inevitable. With people I either over-apologize and cling, or I push them away preemptively so I don’t have to be surprised when they leave. Then the fortune-telling voice just narrates the rest: my overworking or pulling away will prove I’m a failure, I’ll lose the job, end up alone or back with someone who treats me like garbage, and if someone suggests any other outcome I basically dismiss it as wishful thinking.

Therapist: It sounds like you've noticed that when you start thinking about these potential failures, you either freeze or shut down in some way. What if, for just a moment, you were to acknowledge that thought without acting on it or reacting to it? You could simply say to yourself, "That's the thought that just came up," and then pause for a second. Can you try that for me right now, without worrying about what happens next, just for that single moment of pause?

Patient: I tried it — I said to myself, "That's the thought that just came up," and for like a half-second it was quieter, but then the fortune-telling voice came back louder: "If you don’t fix this you’ll get fired, lose your place, and be back with someone who uses you." I couldn't keep the pause; my chest tightened and I either start triple-checking every dish or convincing myself to skip the next shift. It honestly feels useless — labeling it doesn't change that the whole disaster story feels like it's already happening.

Therapist: It sounds like the fortune-telling voice has a strong hold on you right now. Can you try something different? Instead of just labeling the thought, what if you were to imagine yourself standing outside of this story, watching it unfold? Imagine you're standing in a different room, looking through a window at this whole disaster scenario. What would you see? What would you do if you were in control of this scene? Take a moment to explore this image, even if it feels silly or uncomfortable.

Patient: When I look through that window I see it all play out in vivid detail: the sauce smokes, the alarm blares, the head chef yells, I'm being walked out with my things, and my ex is on the curb smirking while everyone else whispers. If I were "in control" in that scene I'd frantically try to fix it—rush back in, apologize, scrub every pan—but I know it won't work; they'll just file me as unreliable, I'd lose the job, and that’ll shove me right back into the same awful cycle. I don't buy the softer outcomes — they feel like wishful thinking, not real.

Therapist: Let's take a step back further. What if you weren't even watching yourself in that scene? What if you were simply observing it, like you're watching a movie or a TV show? Imagine the characters, the setting, the entire story, but you're not invested in the outcome. You're just watching it unfold, without any emotional attachment or reaction. Can you try that for a moment? Notice how it feels to not be invested in the outcome? Notice how your body feels when you're not reacting to the story?

Patient: I tried watching it like a movie and for a split second my shoulders loosened and it felt almost okay, but then the fortune-telling voice just took over and started narrating the worst beats like it owned the script. Even as an observer I catch myself rewinding to the parts where everything falls apart—I can't hold the detachment; the softer endings just feel like fake edits. It leaves me stuck and a bit annoyed, like whatever I'm trying isn't actually changing the story.

Therapist: Can you bring your attention back to the present moment, without trying to watch the story or change it? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you. Don't try to focus on anything in particular, just notice whatever arises without judgment. Allow yourself to settle into the present moment, without trying to make it work or change it. Take a deep breath and just be with whatever is here, right now.

Patient: I tried that — I noticed my feet on the floor and the air on my skin, and my breath actually got a bit deeper, like for a second my shoulders unclenched. But the fortune-telling voice immediately said, "Relax and you'll drop a pan, they'll blame you, you'll get fired," and my chest locked up and I felt like I had to either micromanage everything or bail. This helps for a beat, but it feels useless because the disaster script always wins — I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that the fortune-telling voice is still showing up, and it's understandable that it feels overwhelming. Can you take a deep breath and notice how you're feeling right now? Notice the sensation of your chest, your shoulders, your entire body. Just acknowledge the emotions, without trying to do anything with them. We can come back to exploring these thoughts and feelings in a moment. For now, just be with whatever arises, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: I took a slow breath — my chest's tight, shoulders hunched, stomach like a knot, and for a second it felt a little looser. Then the fortune-teller voice snarled, "If you relax you'll drop a pan and get fired," and the tightness came right back; I'm pissed because these things help for like a beat and then the whole disaster story just swallows it. I'm stuck and overwhelmed — can we keep sitting with that? I don't know how to make it stop.

Therapist: It's okay to feel stuck and overwhelmed. It's okay to feel angry. You're feeling those things right now, and it's okay. Can I offer you a simple statement? You are sitting with these overwhelming emotions, and it's okay. You are not failing, and you are not dropping anything. Just sitting with these emotions, right now, in this moment. You are accepted, exactly as you are. Take a deep breath, and just be with that feeling.

Patient: I tried it — I breathed in, and for like two seconds my chest actually loosened and my shoulders dropped, which felt... surprising. Then the fortune-teller jumped in: "Relax and they’ll catch you messing up, you’ll get fired, lose your place, end up with someone who uses you," and the tightness slammed back. I want to believe you, but I keep thinking that acceptance is just a setup for the next disaster, so I get pissed and feel kind of stuck — can we keep sitting with that?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're skeptical, and that's okay. It's natural to wonder if acceptance is just a way to avoid the problems that seem to always come up. But can I ask you something? When you think about acceptance, what do you think it's supposed to be? Is it about avoiding the future, or is it about something else? Can we explore that together? It's not about predicting what's going to happen, or trying to control the future. It's about being present with what's happening right now. Can we try to focus on that, just for a moment?

Patient: When I hear "acceptance" it feels like it's supposed to mean not fighting the moment — like letting the pan be dropped without spiraling. But honestly I hear it as a setup: if I "accept" now the fortune-teller screams that it just means I’ll get fired or end up back with someone awful. Maybe acceptance could be noticing the thought and not acting on it, but I can't hold that long enough — the disaster voice hijacks me, so can we slow down and actually practice what that looks like when it starts?

Therapist: Let's take a pause for a moment. I want to ask you to do something, but I want to make it very clear that it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay if it doesn't feel perfect. Can you take a deep breath and notice what's happening in your body right now? Can you notice any sensations, any thoughts, any emotions? Don't try to change anything, just notice.

Now, I want you to bring to mind a specific scenario that's been coming up for you, something like "I drop the pan" or "I mess up at work." Can you imagine it vividly, without judgment? Don't try to think about what's going to happen next, just focus on this moment.

Once you've got the scenario in mind, I want you to pause for a moment, and then I want you to notice the thoughts that come up. Can you see the thoughts that are appearing, like the fortune-telling voice? Can you notice how you're reacting to them? Just notice, don't try to do anything. We'll slow down the pace, and we'll practice this together, okay?

Patient: Okay — I take a breath and my chest's tight, my hands feel a little shaky, stomach's in knots and my shoulders are up. I picture the "drop the pan" moment: sauce pops, smoke, the alarm, the head chef yelling, everyone turning — it's vivid like a replay. The thoughts rush in: "You're getting fired, you'll lose your place, you'll end up back with someone who uses you," and then I either freeze and micromanage everything or I want to run away. I'm kind of jittery and distracted right now and I can't hold the pause — can we slow down and actually sit with what happens when those thoughts hit?

Therapist: It's okay that you're feeling jittery and distracted. That's completely normal. Can I ask you to do something for just a second? I want you to bring your attention back to those thoughts. Can you just notice the words, without judging them? Can you see the phrase "You're getting fired" on a mental screen? Can you notice the phrase "You'll lose your place"? Just notice them, without trying to do anything with them. Don't try to change the thoughts, don't try to replace them, just observe them. You can even say to yourself, "Ah, the thought of getting fired." Just observe the thought, without judgment. We'll stay with this for just a second, okay?

Patient: I can sort of see the phrases—“You’re getting fired,” “You’ll lose your place”—but the second I name them my chest tightens, my hands go shaky, and the fortune-teller voice just launches into the whole apocalypse chain like it’s fact. I try to observe, but they immediately become action—either micromanaging everything or wanting to run—and I can’t keep it neutral; can we slow down and sit with that a bit more?

Therapist: It's like your body is already responding to the thoughts before you even have a chance to observe them. That's okay. Can I ask you to try something again? Instead of naming the thoughts, let's just see what happens when you notice them. Can you bring your attention to the phrases "You're getting fired" and "You'll lose your place"? Just notice them, without naming them. See how your body reacts. Notice your chest, your hands, your whole body. What happens right away?

Now, instead of trying to stay neutral, let's explore what happens when you try to act on these thoughts. When you think "You're getting fired," what do you think you might do? What physical sensations do you notice in your body? When you think "You'll lose your place," what do you think you might do? What physical sensations do you notice in your body? Let's explore this cycle together, okay?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing supposed to stop the whole thing? My chest clamps up, my hands go shaky, my head spins and I get tunnel vision, like I can't even hear you properly. The moment the thought "you're getting fired" shows up the fortune-teller goes full script: I either lock down and micromanage every plate until I'm shaking from exhaustion, or I decide to skip the shift because it's inevitable, and both routes feel like they lead straight to losing everything. I can't hold a neutral pause; the body decides before my brain does. Can we slow down and actually walk through one of those moments step by step?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to just notice, I'm asking you to take a small step with me. Let's try to explore one of these moments together, step by step. Let's start with the moment when you think "You're getting fired". Can you bring your attention to that thought for just a second? I want you to notice it, not just think it, but really notice it. See what it looks like in your mind, what emotions it brings up. Noticing it is not the same as naming it, but just noticing.

Now, I want you to notice what's happening in your body right now, as you think that thought. Notice your chest, your hands, your whole body. What's happening right now? Is your chest tightening? Are your hands shaking? Are you feeling any other sensations? I want you to notice it right now, without trying to change it or push it away. Just notice it, and then we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm more anxious and distracted and it all blurs. The second "you're getting fired" shows up my chest clamps, hands shake, my vision tunnels and the fortune-teller starts narrating the whole apocalypse: I either obsessively triple-check every plate until I'm shaking or I decide to skip the shift because it's already doomed. I can't hold a neutral pause — can we actually slow down and walk through one of those kitchen moments step-by-step, like what would I do right after the thought first appears?

Therapist: Let's try to explore one of these kitchen moments, just one step at a time. I want you to focus on what happens right after the thought "You're getting fired" first appears. What's the very first thing you notice, without trying to think about it or push it away? Is it a physical sensation, like a knot in your stomach? Or is it a thought, like a phrase in your head? Just notice what's happening right now, without trying to do anything with it.

Let's take a very deep breath together, and I want you to notice what's happening right now, just for a second. As we breathe in, I want you to ask yourself, "What's the first thing I notice when I think 'You're getting fired'?" Just focus on that one question, and what comes up in response. We'll take it from there.

Patient: Okay — I took a breath. The first thing I notice is this sharp clamp in my chest and a quick image of the head chef pointing me out and me stuffing my stuff in a bag. My hands start shaking and my vision tunnels so I can't really think past that flash. I'm not sure I follow how breathing changes that — can we actually walk through, step‑by‑step, what I do in that one second when the thought hits?

Therapist: Let's break it down into smaller steps. As soon as you notice the sharp clamp in your chest and the image of the head chef pointing you out, what's the very first physical thing you do? Is you taking a breath out, tensing up, or doing something else? Just focus on the physical sensation right now.

Take your time, I want you to respond to the question as honestly as possible. As soon as you've done the first physical thing, we'll move on to the next question. Remember, we're not trying to change anything, we're just exploring what happens right now.

For example, you might say "I take a deep breath out" or "My shoulders tense up". Just report back on the physical sensation without trying to think about it or push it away. Ready to start?

Patient: My shoulders clamp up first and I let out a sharp, shallow exhale — my hands go shaky and my vision narrows so I can't think straight. It's automatic, like my body hits a panic switch and then I either start micromanaging everything or want to run. I'm pretty jittery and distracted right now — can we slow down and actually walk through the next micro-step after that?

Therapist: Let's focus on the "micromanaging everything" option. As soon as your shoulders clamped up and you let out that sharp exhale, what's the first specific thing you start doing? Is it checking and rechecking every dish, task list, or procedure? Or is it mentally rehearsing the sequence of events, the possible worst-case scenarios, or the "what-ifs"? Just notice what you're doing, right now, without judgment.

Take a moment to report back on this specific behavior. What's the first thing you're doing, without trying to think about it or push it away? Use a very concrete and specific phrase, like "I'm checking the sauce temperature" or "I'm mentally rehearsing the fire sequence". I want to hear exactly what you're doing, right now.

Patient: "I'm checking the sauce temperature." My shoulders clamp, I let out a sharp exhale, hands trembling, and I loop—check, taste, wipe, recheck the ticket—because the fortune-teller's already yelling, "miss this and you're fired, lose your place, end up back with someone who uses you." I'm not sure I follow how this helps; I'm too jittery and distracted to hold still.

Therapist: Let's take a brief pause here. As you're checking the sauce temperature, I want you to notice something for just a second. Notice the sensation of your hands, the feeling of the spoon, the sound of the sizzling sauce. Just notice these physical sensations, without trying to think about the task or the outcome.

Now, I want to ask you a very simple question. As you're checking the sauce temperature, what's the one thing that needs to happen in this moment for everything to be okay? What's the one single thing that would make everything fall into place? Can you think of just one thing, no matter how small it seems?

Patient: I guess the one thing is "don't burn the sauce" — keep the temp right and finish the ticket. But even if I do that, the fortune-teller's already yelling that they'll still find a reason to fire me, I'll lose my place, and end up back with someone who uses me, so I don't see how that one thing actually makes everything okay. My hands are shaking and I'm scattered — I'm not sure I follow how picking one thing stops the avalanche; can we slow down and walk through that?

Therapist: Let's break it down step by step. You said the one thing that needs to happen in this moment is "don't burn the sauce." Can you think about why that's important? What's the purpose of keeping the sauce temperature right? Is it because it affects the flavor, or the quality of the dish? Let's explore that thought for a moment.

Take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your hands as you stir the sauce. What's the feeling of the spoon moving through the liquid? What's the sound of the sizzling sauce? Just notice these physical sensations without trying to think about the task or the outcome.

Now, I want you to ask yourself a question. What would happen if you were to successfully complete this task, "don't burn the sauce"? What would that mean for the rest of the dish, the rest of the service? How might that impact the outcome, the fortune-teller's predictions? Let's explore that thought together.

Patient: If I don't burn the sauce, the immediate thing is simple: the dish stays good, the ticket closes, maybe the line keeps moving and one disaster is avoided. My hands are still shaky thinking about it, but realistically that's all that one moment does — it fixes one plate.

But the fortune-teller in my head immediately jumps in: that just postpones the mess — someone will call out a late ticket, the expo will snap, the head chef will pick on me for something else, they'll find a reason to label me unreliable, and then I'm fired, lose my place, and be back with someone who uses me. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't make myself believe that not burning the sauce actually changes the trajectory; it just feels like a temporary patch on a collapsing roof. Can we actually slow down and walk through how that next step turns into a firing, because I keep getting stuck on that leap.

Therapist: Let's break down the sequence of events. You said that if you don't burn the sauce, the immediate thing is that the dish stays good, the ticket closes, and maybe the line keeps moving. You're right that this is a small step, but it's a step nonetheless.

Now, let's explore how this small step might lead to a larger consequence. You mentioned that the fortune-teller in your head immediately jumps in and says that this just postpones the mess. Can you think about what that means? What specific actions or events might occur that would lead to a larger consequence?

Take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your hands as you stir the sauce. What's the feeling of the spoon moving through the liquid? What's the sound of the sizzling sauce? Just notice these physical sensations without trying to think about the task or the outcome.

Now, I want you to ask yourself a question. What specific actions or events might occur that would lead to a larger consequence? For example, what if someone calls out a late ticket, or the expo gets disrupted? How might that impact the situation? Let's explore those possibilities together.

Also, I want to gently point out that the way you're thinking about this might be a bit overly catastrophic. You mentioned that it just feels like a temporary patch on a collapsing roof. Can you think of a different way to think about this situation? What if this small step is actually a small win, and it could lead to a larger positive outcome? Let's explore that possibility together.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it all gets fuzzy when you ask me to reframe. Even if I don't burn the sauce, the next thing is someone yells about a late ticket, expo throws plates, the head chef pins it on me, I get written up, they cut my shifts, I miss rent, lose my place, and I'm forced back into my ex's orbit while everyone thinks I'm unreliable. Saying "small win" feels like lipstick on a car crash — I can't buy that it changes the trajectory; the fortune-teller already scripts the dominoes. My hands are shaking just picturing it — can we slow down and actually go through one of those middle steps (like the write-up or shift cuts) in detail?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and look at the sequence of events that you mentioned earlier. You said that if you don't burn the sauce, the next thing is that someone yells about a late ticket, the expo throws plates, and the head chef pins it on you. Can you think about what that experience would be like for you, right now?

Take a deep breath and imagine yourself in that moment. What would you see, hear, and feel? Would you be thinking about anything specific, or would it just be a jumbled mix of emotions and sensations?

Now, I want you to think about what might happen right after that. You mentioned getting written up, having your shifts cut, and missing rent. Can you think about what that would mean for you, in practical terms? How would it affect your daily life, your relationships, and your overall well-being?

Let's explore this one step at a time. We'll start with the experience of getting written up. What would that be like for you, right now? Would you be thinking about anything specific, or would it just be a jumbled mix of emotions and sensations?

As you imagine this experience, I want you to pay attention to your physical sensations, as well as your thoughts and emotions. Just notice what's happening, without trying to think about it or push it away.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is picturing this supposed to help? But okay, when I imagine getting written up it's immediate: they call me into the office, the head chef's face blurs, my chest clamps, my throat feels tight, my hands go shaky and I taste metal. I feel hot and mortified, like everyone in the kitchen is watching me shrink; the thought that follows is instant and loud — "See? I told you so, you're done" — and then my brain fast-forwards: warning, shift cuts, missed rent, back with my ex. I'm jittery and kind of scattered right now; can we slow down and walk through exactly what they say in that write-up and what I actually do or say in response?

Therapist: Let's break down the experience of getting written up into smaller, more manageable parts. We'll start with the initial interaction between you and the head chef.

When you imagine getting written up, you said that the head chef's face blurs, your chest clamps, your throat feels tight, and your hands go shaky. You also mentioned tasting metal. These physical sensations are likely a natural response to the perceived criticism or reprimand. Can you take a moment to focus on one of these sensations, for example, your chest clamping? What does it feel like, physically, in this moment?

As you explore this sensation, I want you to ask yourself: What is the physical sensation of the chest clamping? Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else? How does it feel in relation to your breath? Is your breathing affected? Is there any other physical sensation that arises in this moment?

Let's explore this sensation together, one step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on this supposed to help? The chest thing feels like a tight band across my sternum, sharp and heavy, and it makes my breaths short and shallow; my throat clamps, my hands tremble, I taste metal, and I get a hot flush and a little dizzy. The instant I notice it the fortune-teller's already screaming "they'll fire you, you'll lose everything," and my vision narrows so I can't think straight. I'm jittery and distracted—can we slow down and actually role-play what I'd say or do when they read me the write-up?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play exercise to help you practice responding to the write-up. I'll read you the write-up, and you can respond as if you were actually sitting in the head chef's office. Remember, your goal is to explore your thoughts and emotions in this moment.

Here's the write-up: "You've failed us again, Chef. You're consistently slacking on your shifts, and you're clearly not committed to the kitchen. This behavior is unacceptable, and I need you to shape up, pronto. Failure to comply will result in termination. You're lucky I'm not tossing you out the door right now."

Now, let's get started. You're sitting in the head chef's office, and I've just handed you the write-up. What do you say, do, or think right now?

Patient: I stammer out, "I'm sorry, I'll fix it—I'll come in early, double‑check tickets, I won't let it happen again," my voice thin and my hands shaking, but my head's already racing: they're going to watch me, snag the next mistake, write me up again, cut shifts, I miss rent, end up on the street and back with my ex while everyone nods like I deserved it. Promising to "shape up" feels hollow — the fortune-teller's already narrated the firing and the fallout, so I can't believe any of it. I'm jittery and kind of scattered right now — can we slow down and actually rehearse what I could say or do in that moment, step‑by‑step?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — all that "reframing" talk just makes my head spin and I get more confused. Every time you say "reframe" the fortune-teller just screams that it's fake and they'll fire me anyway, so I can't buy it. I'm jittery and distracted; can we actually do the role-play you mentioned and rehearse exact, simple things I could say in the head chef's office, step‑by‑step? Can we slow down?

Patient: I'm not following that wall of "reframe" stuff — it just makes my head spin and my chest clamps tighter and the fortune-teller starts screaming about being fired and homeless. I'm jittery and distracted; I need the role‑play, step‑by‑step. Can you play the head chef and say one short line like, "This is unacceptable — shape up or you're out," and I'll practice a simple, exact response? Can we slow down?

Patient: Yeah—do it. Say exactly, "This is unacceptable — shape up or you're out," and I'll try to answer. Fair warning: the fortune-teller voice will probably kick in and I'll either stammer an apology or freeze and promise to fix everything, so can we slow down and go phrase‑by‑phrase after you say it? I'm jittery and kind of scattered right now.

Patient: I stammer out, "I'm sorry—I'll fix it, I'll come in early, I'll double‑check tickets," my voice thin and my hands shaking, but I can already hear the fortune-teller yelling they'll watch me for the next slip and use it to write me up, cut my shifts, and kick me out. I'm not sure I follow how any of that changes—everything feels like it's already been decided—and I'm jittery and distracted; can we actually slow down and rehearse one short line at a time, phrase‑by‑phrase?
