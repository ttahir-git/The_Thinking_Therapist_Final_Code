Patient: Yeah, so... I've been feeling pretty low lately — just this heavy sadness and no real motivation to do much since I've been feeling so isolated. It's starting to mess with my relationship 'cause I shut down and then feel guilty about it. I don't know, I guess I just don't like talking about it, but it keeps getting worse.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you do shut down and then feel guilty about it? What kind of interactions are you avoiding, and how long does it go on for before you feel like you can talk about it again?

Patient: Usually I just clam up — stop answering texts, keep quiet at dinner, tell my wife I’m fine when I’m not. I avoid any talk about feelings or plans, and at work I keep to myself, doing small jobs so folks don’t bother me. It can go a few days, sometimes a week or more before the guilt hits and I try to be nicer, but I still don’t open up. I don’t know, I guess talking about it just makes me feel worse, so I try to change the subject.

Therapist: Those avoidance strategies you mentioned sound like they're really taking a toll on your relationships and your own emotional state. Can you tell me more about what happens when you do try to change the subject or avoid talking about things? What does that feel like for you in the moment, and how does it affect your interactions with others?

Patient: When I try to change the subject or avoid it, it feels like a little weight lifts for a minute — no probing, no having to explain stuff. But then the guilt sets in and I get distant; my wife gets frustrated, the guys at work think I'm being a jerk, and I just end up more alone. I don't know, I guess in the moment I feel stuck and kind of numb, like I don't have the words or the energy to say what's really going on.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed, but in doing so, you're actually pushing others away. Can you imagine what would happen if you were able to express even a small part of what's really going on for you? What do you think might happen if you were able to just acknowledge that feeling of numbness, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I don't know... maybe if I said even a little — like "I'm tired" or "I'm not myself" — my wife might relax a bit or stop worrying so much. I guess I'm scared it'll just make things worse or she'll feel burdened, so I shut down instead.

Therapist: It's understandable that you're worried about how your wife might react. But what if, instead of being burdened, she felt like you were finally giving her permission to understand what's going on for you? What if that, in itself, brought some relief to both of you? Can you imagine how it might feel to just say, "I'm not myself right now," without expecting anything in return, just to acknowledge that feeling of being stuck?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might be a small relief, like taking off a heavy coat, but I'm scared it'll make her sad or see me as weak. I'm trying to picture saying it, but I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down and talk about how I'd even start?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. How about we just focus on getting you to say the words "I'm not myself right now" out loud, without expecting anything else to happen? Just the words. You can say them in front of me, and we can take it from there. No pressure, no expectations. Just a small step to get us started. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can say it. I'm not myself right now. That felt... weird and a bit scary — can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and bring our attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Just focus on the breath for a moment, feel the sensation of the air entering and leaving the nostrils. When you're ready, we can come back to the words, but for now, just allow yourself to be with the breath.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. I'm breathing, but it feels tight — my mind keeps drifting to the loss and to stuff at work. I don't know, it's getting kind of heavy — can we slow down? Maybe tell me how this is supposed to help when I just shut down.

Therapist: It's like trying to watch the clouds moving by while you're driving - your mind is constantly thinking about something else, and it's hard to focus on the road. Let's try something. When you notice your mind drifting to the loss or thoughts at work, I want you to say to yourself, "This is just thinking." Just say it like a mantra, "This is just thinking." Don't try to engage with it, just acknowledge it as a thought. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. "This is just thinking." Saying it out loud sort of helps for a second, but the loss and the stuff at work keep pulling me back — I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a look at your hands. Just notice the shape of your fingers, the feeling of the skin on your palm. Imagine that you are gently stroking your hand, or maybe even gently petting a cat. Just focus on the sensation of your hand, without thinking about anything else. Can you do that for a second? Notice how your hand feels, just sitting there.

Patient: Okay... I'm looking at my hands. They're rough, callused, knuckles all knocked up from years on the job, veins standing out — kind of stiff. It's weird, but it does take my mind off things for a second. I don't know, I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to take your time. Your body is telling you something, and it's not just your hands. Can you bring your attention to your whole body? Just notice how it's feeling, without trying to change it or think about anything else. Are there any areas that feel particularly tight or heavy? It's just a gentle inquiry, no need to react or respond. Just notice.

Patient: Yeah... my chest feels tight and my shoulders are heavy, like I'm carrying a load; my neck and lower back are aching too. My stomach's all knotted and sometimes my hands feel numb or tingly. I don't know, I guess just noticing that is making me kind of flooded—can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's like your whole body is responding to this feeling of overwhelm. It's like it's saying, "Yes, this is how I'm feeling right now." And it's okay with that. It's okay to just acknowledge it, without trying to change it or push it away. Can you just allow yourself to be with this feeling of overwhelm, right here, right now? Notice how it's affecting your body, your breath, your thoughts. Just be with it, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: I don't know... I try to sit with it, but it just gets bigger — chest tight, like I'm sinking. I guess I'm scared it'll spill over and make everything worse, so I want to look away. Can we slow down? Tell me something simple I can do when it hits, because talking about it like this kind of makes me flinch.

Therapist: I want you to try something. When you feel the overwhelm, I want you to bring your attention to your breath, just for a second. Take one deep breath in through your nose, and then one slow breath out through your mouth. That's it. Just focus on the breath. When you're ready, we can talk again. For now, just focus on the breath.

Patient: Okay... I did the breath. It loosened the tightness for a moment, but the knot's still there. I don't know, I guess I could use something real simple I can do at work when it hits—like a short grounding line or a 30‑second action. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on something concrete for a moment. Here's a simple grounding line you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed: "I am in this moment, with my feet on the ground." Just say that to yourself, and focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Take 30 seconds to breathe, and just be with that sensation. When you're ready, we can talk again. You can also do something with your hands, like tracing a shape on a piece of paper or fidgeting with a pen. Just something small, but concrete, to help you focus.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that line — "I am in this moment, with my feet on the ground." Saying it once or twice might help when I'm on a ladder or standing by the truck and don't want anyone to notice. It does calm me a bit, but I'm still getting kind of overwhelmed—can we slow down? Maybe give me one more quick, really quiet thing I can do at work when it hits.

Therapist: Let's focus on something really small. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try to subtly tilt your head to the right, just a little bit. It's a tiny movement, but it can help you focus and calm down. Just a small, gentle tilt of the head, and then breathe. It's not something that needs to be noticeable to anyone else, just something for you. You can do it when you're working, standing by the truck, or on a ladder. It's a small way to help you feel more grounded and calm.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the head tilt. It feels weird and my neck's pretty sore some days, plus I've got a hard hat on at work so that might not always work. Maybe something I can do with my hands or feet that won't show — like pressing my thumb against my palm or tapping my shoe a couple times? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try one of the hand movements. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try pressing your thumb against your palm, just gently. It's a subtle movement, but it can help you focus and calm down. Just press your thumb against your palm for a second or two, and then let go. See if that helps you feel a bit more grounded. You can do it whenever you need to, and no one will notice.

Patient: I pressed my thumb against my palm like you said — huh, it actually takes the edge off a little, like it grounds me for a second. But then I get this flush of shame and frustration, like some old screw‑up I can’t shake, and my chest tightens again. I don't know, I guess I'm finding it hard to stay with this; can we slow down and maybe pick one more quiet thing I can do at the site?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. When you feel that flush of shame and frustration, I want you to try something. Say to yourself, "This is not new, and it's not worth getting stuck on." Just say it gently, and focus on the feeling of the words on your tongue. Remember that this is a feeling you've had before, and it will pass. You've gotten through hard days before, and you can do it again. Just be kind to yourself, and take it one breath at a time.

Patient: I tried saying it — "This is not new..." — but it sounded flat and then that shame just flooded back, like that old screw‑up won't let go. I don't know, I guess being kind to myself feels impossible and just makes me mad at myself instead. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more quiet, real thing I can do with my hands at the site when that shame hits.

Therapist: Let's try something with your hands. When you feel that shame flooding back, I want you to try making a fist. Just a small fist, just enough to feel the tension in your hand. Then, slowly release it, and let your hand drop. Just focus on that movement, and let the rest go. It's okay if it feels silly, just focus on the sensation of your hand. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's hard to think, but it's possible to feel something. Can you just try that for me?

Patient: I made a fist like you said — felt the tension in my knuckles, then let it go, and for a second it loosened up. But then that shame just slams back in and I get mad at myself, like I'm back at that same place. I don't know, I guess it helps for a second but doesn't stick. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more quiet thing I can do at the site when that shame hits, something that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something that's simple and non-verbal. When you feel that shame flooding back, I want you to bring your attention to your breath again. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to think about anything else. Don't try to change it, just observe it. See if you can find a spot where the breath feels more calm, more relaxed. Just stay with that spot, and let the rest go. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's just about being present with the breath. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried focusing on my breath — it helps for a few seconds, then that flush of shame hits and I get tight and mad at myself. I don't know, I guess the breathing's okay but it doesn't stop me from spiraling. Can we slow down? Give me one more really quiet, discreet thing I can do at the site when that shame comes up.

Therapist: Let's try something very subtle. When you feel that flush of shame coming up, I want you to subtly shift your weight onto the balls of your feet. Just a tiny shift, just enough to feel the sensation of your feet on the ground. Then, just stay there for a moment, and see what happens. Don't try to do anything with it, just notice how it feels. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's just about being present with our physical body. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried shifting my weight like you said — it steadied me for a second and my legs felt firmer. But then that shame and frustration rush back, my chest tightens, like I keep tripping over the same thing. I don't know, I guess it helps a bit but doesn't stop the spiral. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more really quiet, discreet thing I can do on the site that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something even more subtle. When you feel that rush of shame coming up, I want you to take one tiny, slow blink. Just one blink, just slow down, and let your eyes close for a second. Don't try to think about anything, just focus on the sensation of your eyelids moving. See if that helps you feel a bit more grounded. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried the slow blink — for a beat it was like a little pause and that tightness eased. Then that shame just rushes back and I get mad at myself, like I'm stuck at that same damn screw‑up. I don't know, I guess it helps for a second, but can we slow down? Maybe give me one more tiny, really discreet thing I can do at the site that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something extremely subtle. When you feel that rush of shame coming up, I want you to subtly purse your lips just slightly. Just a tiny, tiny movement, just enough to feel the sensation of your lips tightening. Then, just let go. Don't try to do anything with it, just notice how it feels. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's just about being present with a tiny physical sensation. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried pursing my lips like you said — for a second it was a tiny pause and the tightness eased, but then that shame just rushes back and I get mad at myself, like I'm stuck back at that same damn screw‑up. I don't know, I guess it helps for a beat but it doesn't hold. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more really quiet, discreet thing I can do on the site that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something almost imperceptible. When you feel that rush of shame coming up, I want you to just think, "One breath." Just think that one word, just once. Don't think about anything else, just focus on the word "One breath". Don't say it out loud, just think it. See if that can be enough to distract you from the shame for just a second. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried it — just thought "one breath" once. It gave me a tiny break, but then that shame slammed back and I get mad at myself, my chest goes tight. I don't know, I guess it just keeps circling back; can we slow down? Maybe give me one more tiny thing I can do at the site that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something gentle. When you feel that rush of shame coming up, I want you to gently place your hand on the arm of the chair or the railing in front of you. Just place your hand on it, don't think about anything else, just focus on the sensation of your hand on the chair. See if that can be enough to calm you down for just a second. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I put my hand on the railing like you said — it calmed me for a beat, but then that shame comes roaring back and I get mad at myself like I’m back at that same damn screw‑up. I don't know, I guess it helps for a second but it doesn't stick. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more really quiet thing I can do on the site that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: I think we've taken some good steps together today, but I also sense that we're hitting a bit of a wall. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and stuck. Can we try something different for a moment?

Instead of trying to focus on managing your shame or self-criticism right now, can we just focus on being present with your physical sensations? Can you try to notice the sensations in your body without judgment, just as they are?

Take a deep breath and bring your attention to your body. Notice where you feel sensations, what they feel like, and how they're changing. See if you can just observe them without trying to do anything with them.

No thinking, no trying, just observing. Just be with your body as it is, in this moment. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I took that deep breath and tried to notice stuff — my chest's tight, shoulders heavy, my hands feel rough and numb at the tips, stomach all knotted, legs kind of stiff. I try to just observe it, but then this wave of shame and frustration comes in and squashes the noticing, like I can't hold it. I don't know, I guess I'm having a hard time staying with it — can we slow down? Maybe give me one tiny, quiet anchor I can use when that shame hits that won't feel stupid at the site.

Therapist: Let's try something extremely simple. When you feel that wave of shame coming up, I want you to notice just one thing: the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet, the pressure of your feet on the ground. Don't think about anything else, just focus on this sensation. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried — felt my feet in my boots, weight on both heels, and for a second it steadied me. Then that shame just rushes back, my chest tightens and I can't hold the noticing. I don't know, I guess it helps for a beat but I get overwhelmed — can we slow down? Maybe give me one more really quiet thing I can do on site when I'm wearing gloves and a hard hat that won't feel stupid.

Therapist: Let's try something very subtle. When you're wearing your gloves and hard hat, I want you to subtly wiggle your fingers. Just wiggle them slightly, just enough to feel the movement in your hands. Don't think about anything else, just focus on this small movement. See if that can help calm you down for just a second. Can you try that for me?

Patient: I wiggled my fingers in the gloves like you said — felt the movement through the leather and it steadied me for a second. Then that shame and frustration just floods back, like I'm stuck at that same damn screw‑up, chest goes tight and I get mad at myself. I don't know, I guess it helps for a beat but it won't hold. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe give me one more tiny, really discreet thing I can do on the site that won't feel stupid?
