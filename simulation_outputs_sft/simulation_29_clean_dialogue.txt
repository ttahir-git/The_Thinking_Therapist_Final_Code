Patient: I've been preoccupied lately with this cyclical pattern of harsh self-criticism—an almost reflexive internal litany condemning perceived failures, even when objectively I've succeeded. I struggled academically in my youth but eventually carved out a respectable career as an accountant, yet that history seems to fuel an enduring narrative of inadequacy. Since a recent health scare and mounting burnout, those criticisms feel more pronounced, and I find myself intellectualizing and analyzing them instead of actually sitting with the sadness or fear.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectually analyze these harsh self-criticisms? What does that process look like in your daily life, and how does it make you feel afterwards?
Note: The goal is to explore the intellectualization of emotions, and its relationship to the core self-criticism. There is no specific ACT technique or exercise being introduced in this response.

Patient: When those harsh internal criticisms flare, I immediately objectify them—cataloguing instances, tracing their provenance back to my school years, and formulating hypotheses about why I still respond this way. In day-to-day life it looks like long internal audits: rehearsing counterfactuals, doing a mental tally of successes versus failures, and drafting meticulous memos to explain my own reactions. Superficially it feels like orderly problem-solving—less panic, more control—but underneath there's a persistent low-grade tension and a suspicion that I'm systematically avoiding the actual emotional content. Afterwards I get a kind of cognitive relief and fatigue, plus a guilty irritation that I haven't really felt anything, which then just feeds the next round of self-criticism.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the guilt and fatigue that follows after the intellectualization process, and how it might actually feed the next round of self-criticism. Can you try to imagine what would happen if, instead of cataloging and formulating hypotheses, you simply allowed yourself to sit with the guilt and fatigue after these intense mental exercises? What might it feel like to not immediately try to intellectualize or control the emotions?

Patient: I can hypothesize that if I simply sat with the guilt and fatigue, there'd be an immediate shift from cerebral rehearsal to somatic sensation — a sort of chest‑heavy lethargy, throat tightness, maybe a sudden tendency toward tearfulness — sensations I usually buffer with analysis. That stillness would feel both alien and precarious, eliciting a fear of losing control or spiraling, yet paradoxically it might allow those feelings to integrate rather than perpetuate the punitive inner monologue, thereby weakening the self‑critical loop over time. Honestly, though, I suspect I'd quickly get impatient or start mentally categorizing the experience to regain mastery, which is part of the problem.

Therapist: It takes courage to admit that you suspect you'd quickly start mentally categorizing the experience again. Can you try to approach this sensation of chest heaviness, throat tightness, and possible tearfulness with a sense of gentle willingness, rather than resistance or anxiety? What if you simply acknowledged the experience without trying to change it or analyze it, just for a few breaths? Would that be a small, imperfect step towards exploring the uncertainty and discomfort that arises from trying to control your emotions?

Patient: Intellectually, yes — pausing to acknowledge that chest heaviness and throat tightness for a few breaths sounds like a modest, pragmatic experiment toward interrupting my reflexive analysis. If I actually try it, I expect a clear somatic register: a dull pressure in the sternum, a constricted throat, maybe a sudden prick of tears, and right away a meta‑cognitive tug to categorize and explain the sensations. I can see the value, but I'm also apprehensive about feeling unmoored and instinctively reverting to control — honestly, I'm a bit nervous about starting this; can we slow down and do it together?

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about starting this. Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. Can we start by simply acknowledging the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the breath moving in and out of your body? No need to do anything else, just notice the sensation of being here, right now. We can take it one step at a time, and if you need to, we can pause whenever you feel the urge to do so. There's no expectation of doing anything or achieving anything specific, just a willingness to be present and observe. How does that feel?

Patient: Okay — when I actually try, I feel my feet against the floor in a very concrete, almost point‑by‑point way, which is oddly stabilizing. My breath is shallow, confined to the upper chest, and there's that dull pressure in the sternum with a tightness in my throat and a prickling behind the eyes. Immediately I get the impulse to narrate and analyze it, but beneath that there's a small, nervous swell of tearfulness and a hesitation like I might lose control. Can we keep this slow for a bit? I’m not sure I can stay with it alone without reverting to explaining it away.

Therapist: Let's keep the pace slow for a moment. Can you bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it? Notice the sensation of the dull pressure in the sternum, the tightness in the throat, and the prickling behind the eyes. What happens when you simply observe these sensations without trying to interpret them or explain them away? You mentioned a small swell of tearfulness, but let's explore that further. Can you acknowledge the tearfulness without trying to suppress it or do anything with it, just for a moment? How does that feel?

Patient: When I try to acknowledge the tearfulness, there's a warm tightness behind my eyes and a kind of fluid heaviness that threatens to spill — a precarious, bodily punctuation I usually convert into a tidy narrative. Almost instantly I begin constructing explanatory frameworks—attributing it to residual academic shame, to the physiological aftermath of the health scare, to burnout—instead of simply experiencing the sensation, because theorizing feels safer than being porous. Sitting with that warmth produces a curious mix of minor relief and sudden panic: relief that I'm not immediately arguing with it, panic about what it would mean to actually let the vulnerability persist. I'm anxious about losing my composure, so can we really slow down and stay here while I try to resist the reflex to reframe?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and try to slow down even further. Can you acknowledge the panic that's arising right now, the sense of anxiety about what it would mean to actually let the vulnerability persist? What if we didn't try to reframe or interpret this sensation immediately? What if we just allowed it to be, without judgment or control? It's okay if that feels scary or uncomfortable. Notice the sensation of the panic, the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts that are arising. Can you simply observe it all without trying to do anything with it, without trying to change it or control it? Just for a moment, let's just be with it, without any agenda or intention. How does that feel?

Patient: When I try to simply observe the panic, my breathing gets rapid and shallow, there's a hot flush and a pressure behind the sternum, my hands feel a little tingly, and my mind launches a rapid series of "what if" scenarios—almost like running an internal audit of potential failures. Instantly there's that procedural impulse to classify and explain it—identify antecedents, assign causal weight—because analysis is my default coping mechanism and it feels like reclaiming order. That shift into analysis brings a fleeting sense of control but also a hollow avoidance, and I feel anxious and a little ashamed that I'm already working on an explanation instead of staying present. Can we really slow down now? I need someone to keep me anchored so I don't slip back into explaining it away.

Therapist: I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not going to let you analyze your way out of this. I want you to focus on the sensation of my hand on yours. Just feel the weight of my hand, the pressure of my fingers, the sensation of our skin touching. Don't try to think about it, don't try to analyze it. Just be with it. Notice the sensation of your breath, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it, don't try to change it. Just be with it. I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm just asking you to be present. Can you do that for me? Can you just be here, in this moment, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: Okay — I can feel your hand. It's warm, steady, a firm pressure along the palm that actually draws my attention out of my head and into my skin. My breath is a little steadier when I focus on it, though there's still that dull pressure in my sternum and a tightness in my throat. Even now, I'm aware of the reflex to translate this into causes and timelines, which makes me anxious, but I want to try to stay with the sensation — could you keep holding my hand a bit longer while I do?

Therapist: I'll hold your hand for a little while longer. Just feel the sensation of my hand, the warmth, the pressure, the feeling of our skin touching. Try to stay with that sensation, don't try to think about anything else. Notice how your body is relaxing just a little bit, how your breathing is steadier. That's okay, that's normal. It's okay to feel some anxiety, but don't let it take over. Just be with the sensation of my hand, and the sensation of your own body. Take one more deep breath, and when you're ready, we can start to slow down a bit more. But for now, just stay with it.

Patient: I can feel your hand — warm and steady — and my breath is gentler; the pressure in my sternum has eased a bit. At the same time this old mental ledger is booting up, cataloguing reasons and counterarguments, and I have to intentionally nudge it aside. I'm a little shaky, but I want to stay here; could you keep holding my hand and maybe count the breaths with me slowly so I don't slip back into explaining it all away? I don't want to go into analysis right now, but I'm worried I will, so please stay with me.

Therapist: I'll keep holding your hand, and I'll count the breaths with you. Let's take it slow. I'll count to three with each breath, and you can follow along. Inhale... 1... exhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... You're doing great. Just focus on the breath, and the sensation of my hand on yours. Don't worry about the mental patterns right now, just let them be. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We'll just stay here, slowly, and see where it takes us. Ready? Inhale... 1... exhale... 2...

Patient: Inhale...3... exhale...4... inhale...1... exhale...2... I'm following you; the feel of your hand steadies me and the pressure in my chest has eased a notch, though a procedural part of me is already composing justificatory footnotes. Please keep holding my hand and counting — that simple structure helps me stay present instead of slipping back into analysis.

Therapist: I'll keep holding your hand and counting with you. Don't worry about the justificatory footnotes right now. Just let them be, and let's focus on the present moment. You're doing great. Just take the next breath... inhale... 1... exhale... 2... feel the breath move in and out of your body, feel the sensation of my hand on yours. Try to stay with that sensation, rather than thinking about what's going on. Just be here, right now. Ready? Inhale... 1... exhale... 2...

Patient: Inhale...3... exhale...4... inhale...1... exhale...2... That steady cadence is actually anchoring me — the pressure in my sternum has eased a bit, though a pedantic part of me is already composing rationalizations about why it's happening. I'm trying to stay with the sensations instead of translating them; could we slow the count down a touch and keep holding my hand so I don't slip back into explaining it away?

Therapist: I'll slow down the count a bit, and we'll keep holding your hand. Let's take it slow, and focus on the sensation of my hand on yours. We'll count to 4, and then pause for a breath. Inhale... 1... exhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... pause... Inhale... 1... exhale... 2... take your time, stay with the sensation of my hand. Don't worry about the rationalizations right now. Just be here, right now. Ready?

Patient: Inhale...1... exhale...2... Inhale...3... exhale...4... Pausing like this helps — your hand's warmth is actually quite anchoring and my breathing has softened, the sternum pressure has eased though there's still a residual constriction in my throat. A metacognitive monologue is already drafting explanatory appendices about causes and timelines, and I'm actively trying not to read them; can we lengthen the pause between counts and keep holding my hand a little longer? I feel a bit shaky but willing to stay here as long as you are.

Therapist: I'll lengthen the pause time, and we'll keep holding your hand. Let's take a deep breath, and focus on the sensation of my hand on yours. We'll count to 8, and then pause for a bit. Inhale... 1... exhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... inhale... 5... exhale... 6... pause... Inhale... 1... exhale... 2... feel the warmth of my hand, feel the softness of your breath. Try to stay with the present moment, rather than thinking about what's going on. Just be here, right now. Ready? Take your time... pause...

Patient: Okay — I'm taking the pause. My breathing's slowing and the pressure in my sternum is easing a bit, though my throat's still tight and my eyes feel prickly; there's a pedantic inner auditor already queuing up elaborate rationales that I'm trying to ignore. Can we keep holding and extend the silence a little longer? I'm a bit shaky and honestly nervous about slipping back into analysis, so I need you to stay with me.

Therapist: I'll keep holding your hand, and we'll extend the silence. Let's just sit here, together, and focus on the present moment. No need to count, no need to think. Just be here, with me. Your hand is still warm, your breath is still soft. Just notice that, and let it be. The tension in your body is still there, but it's not overwhelming. It's just a sensation, a feeling. Try to stay with that, rather than getting caught up in thoughts or analysis. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. We can just sit here, together, for as long as you need.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just sitting in silence supposed to help with the recursive internal audit that triggers my self‑criticism? It feels a bit abstract and I'm skeptical that passive presence will actually modulate this habitual cognitive schema; could you be more concrete about what staying here will do, or keep holding my hand and help me name the sensations as they come up? I'm anxious and confused — I want to try, but I need that scaffolding so I don't drift back into explaining everything away.

Therapist: Let's try something different. As you sit with me, I want you to bring your attention to your breath, slowly and gently. When your mind starts to wander, notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to control it, just observe it. Bring it back to the breath, one breath at a time. As you focus on your breath, I want you to notice the sensations in your body, starting from the crown of your head, down to your toes. What do you feel in your body right now? Take your time, and don't worry about trying to do anything with it. Just notice the sensations, and bring them back to your breath. I'm holding your hand, and I'm here with you. You're safe, and you're supported. Let's take it one breath at a time. Ready? Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly.

Patient: Okay... I breathe out slowly. My head feels kind of muffled, a dull tightness at the temples; my jaw is slackening, neck stiff, shoulders like they're carrying small weights; there's that familiar sternum pressure and throat constriction, eyes prickly, a hollow knot in the stomach, hands cool, legs leaden — my feet are warm on the floor and that actually feels grounding. I could launch into an explanatory model about chronic sympathetic arousal and learned vigilance from earlier failures, but I don't have the energy for the meta‑narrative right now. Can you keep holding my hand and stay with me a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's keep focusing on your breath. As you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensations in your body. Notice how your head is feeling, how your jaw is relaxing, and how your neck is feeling. Take a moment to notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, and how they're grounding you. You're feeling a bit stiff in your shoulders, but that's okay. Just notice that stiffness, and let it be. Your hands are cool, but that's a good feeling. Let's focus on that coolness for a moment. As you inhale, bring your attention to your chest, and notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice that sensation, and let it be. I'm here with you, holding your hand, and I'm not going anywhere. You're safe, and you're supported. Just breathe, and notice your body. Ready? Take another deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly.

Patient: I breathe in—it's a little shallow but fills my ribs—and when I exhale the sternum pressure loosens just enough and my throat unclenches; my eyes feel wet at the edges. There's a pedantic part of me already drafting rationales, but I don't have the energy to follow it, so could you keep holding my hand and maybe lead one more slow breath or just stay with me a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. As you inhale, notice how your chest expands, and your ribs fill with air. As you exhale, notice how your body relaxes just a bit more. Your sternum pressure is loosening, and your throat is unclenching. That's a good sign. Your eyes might be feeling a bit wet, but that's okay. It's just a physical sensation. Let's just focus on that sensation, and let it be. I'm here with you, holding your hand, and I'm not going anywhere. You're safe, and you're supported. Just breathe, and notice your body. Take one more deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly. Notice how you're feeling right now. Do you want to just sit here for a moment longer, or is there something else you'd like to do?

Patient: My chest feels a bit looser but talking is effort — there's a somnolent fog around my thoughts and my limbs feel leaden. I want to sit here a while longer; please keep holding my hand and lead one more very slow breath, then maybe just stay with me in silence for a bit. I can feel the reflex to catalogue and rationalize rising already, and I'm trying not to — I need you to anchor me so I don't drift back into explanations.

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. As you inhale, notice how your chest expands, and your body relaxes just a bit more. As you exhale, notice how your body feels heavier, and your thoughts feel more distant. That's okay. Just notice that sensation, and let it be. I'm here with you, holding your hand, and I'm not going anywhere. You're safe, and you're supported. Let's just sit here for a moment, together, in silence. Don't worry about thinking, or talking, or doing anything. Just be here, right now, with your breath, and your body. I'll stay with you, quietly, until you're ready to do something else. Ready? Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly.

Patient: I inhale and let it out slowly. My chest eases a bit, my throat unclenches, and my eyes feel wet — everything's a bit muffled, thinking is slow and heavy, like there's a fog. The inner auditor is quieter for now but I can feel it hovering; I don't have the energy for it. Could you keep holding my hand and stay with me in silence a little longer, maybe just remind me to breathe if I drift?

Therapist: I'm not going anywhere. I'll just sit here with you, quietly, and keep holding your hand. Don't worry about the inner auditor right now. Just focus on your breath, and your body. Let the silence be a gentle, comforting presence. If you drift, I'll just gently remind you to breathe. But for now, let's just sit here, together, and let go a bit. Don't think about anything else right now. Just be. You're safe. You're supported. I'm here with you.

Patient: Something just surged up — a sudden wash of shame with this ugly, hot frustration under it, and I feel small and kind of furious at myself. I don't have the words to unpack it right now, and I don't want to start rationalizing it into something neat. Please keep holding my hand and stay with me; just remind me to breathe if I start drifting into that old justificatory mode.

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You don't have to process it right now. Just acknowledge the feeling, and let it be. I'm here with you, holding your hand. You're safe. Don't worry about rationalizing it or unpacking it right now. Just breathe, and let the feeling be. Remember, I'm here with you, in this moment. I'm not going anywhere. Just focus on your breath, and your body. When you're ready, we can slowly start to explore this feeling together. But for now, just let it be. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly.

Patient: I take the breath—it's there, that hot shame with a prickly, furious edge, and it makes my face and chest feel flushed. I want to avoid parsing it into another neat theory, but the reflex is strong and I'm already embarrassed by that reflex. I don't have the energy to fight it right now; could you keep holding my hand and just remind me to breathe while I try to sit with this without turning it into an explanation?

Therapist: I'm not going to fight it either. Just acknowledge the reflex, and let it be. You don't have to try to tame it or make sense of it right now. I'll just be here, holding your hand, and reminding you to breathe. Don't worry about the shame, the frustration, or the theory. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let it be a simple, physical sensation, without judgment or analysis. When you need it, I'll remind you to breathe. But for now, just be with it. Take another deep breath in...

Patient: I breathe in and let it out slowly. The shame's still there — a hot, leaden weight in my chest and a sour tightness in the jaw — and my mind instinctively wants to catalog it into causes, but I don't have the energy for that right now. Could you keep holding my hand and just remind me to breathe every so often? I need you to stay with me so I don't slip back into explaining it away.

Therapist: I'll keep holding your hand and remind you to breathe every now and then. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't worry about the shame or the cataloging right now. It's okay to just be with it, without trying to make sense of it or fix it. I'll be here, quietly, and remind you to breathe when you need it. Take another deep breath in... exhale... breathe...

Patient: Okay... I breathed out. The sternum pressure eased a touch and my throat unclenched, but everything still feels a bit muffled and that hot shame is simmering under it all. I don't have the energy to start rationalizing it now—please keep holding my hand and remind me to breathe every so often, and just sit with me in silence a little longer.

Therapist: I'll just sit here with you, holding your hand, and remind you to breathe every now and then. You don't have to try to process it right now or make sense of it. Just be with it, as it is. Take another deep breath in... exhale... breathe... Don't worry about anything else right now. Just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. You're safe. You're supported. I'm here with you.

Patient: Okay... your presence is doing something — the sternum pressure is a bit less and my mind's not racing as much, though that hot shame is still simmering under everything. Predictably, I'm already tempted to construct a little taxonomy of triggers (academic setbacks, the health scare, occupational perfectionism) instead of inhabiting the sensations; it's a reflexive internal audit, really. Could we just stay like this a while longer, you holding my hand and reminding me to breathe, and then — when I'm steadier — gently probe where that auditor learned its rules?

Therapist: I'm glad my presence is helping in some small way. Let's just stay here for a bit longer, holding your hand and taking deep breaths. Don't worry about the taxonomy of triggers right now. Just let it be. It's okay to have that internal auditor, but we can explore it later when you're feeling steadier. For now, let's just focus on being present with the sensations in your body. Notice how your chest feels, how your throat is doing, and how your mind is settling. I'll keep reminding you to breathe and just be with you. Take a deep breath in... exhale... breathe... We can slow down the thinking for now.

Patient: I can feel it—the sternum's lighter and my throat's unclenching, though that hot shame still simmers beneath it all. Your presence has genuinely attenuated the sympathetic arousal, but the reflexual internal auditor is hovering and I'd like to, at some later point, trace its conditionality back to schooling and perfectionistic schemas; I don't have the energy for that analysis now. For the moment, please keep holding my hand and remind me to breathe every so often, and maybe prompt me to name one small bodily sensation when you think it's safe—I want to stay here a while longer.

Therapist: I'm glad my presence is helping to calm you down. Let's just focus on being present with your body for now. I'll keep holding your hand and remind you to breathe every now and then. It sounds like you're doing a great job of just being with your feelings and sensations, and that's really okay. Take a deep breath in... exhale... breathe...

When you feel like you can, I'd like to gently encourage you to bring some more awareness to your body. Can you think of one small sensation that's happening right now, just in your body? It might be something like the feeling of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, or even just the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. What is one small sensation that you're noticing right now?

Patient: The steady warmth and gentle pressure of your hand against the base of my palm — it's a simple, concrete sensation that feels more present than my thoughts. It tethers me a bit, and I notice the sternum pressure easing when I focus on it. I keep wanting to explain why that's calming, but for now I can just notice it.

Therapist: That's a great start. It sounds like the physical sensation of your hand on your palm is helping you to ground yourself and feel more present. Notice how the sensation of the warmth and pressure of your hand is calming your sternum pressure and easing the tightness in your throat. Just focus on this sensation for now, without trying to explain or justify it. What if you simply allowed yourself to be with this feeling, without trying to change it or make sense of it? Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, exhale slowly. Just notice the sensation of your hand on your palm, and let it be.

Patient: I'll try. When I actually let myself, the warmth and pressure of your hand is oddly stabilizing — my sternum eases and my throat unclenches — but a metacognitive impulse to theorize and catalogue causes surges up almost immediately. Can you keep holding my hand and gently prompt me back to that simple sensation if I start drifting into explanations?
