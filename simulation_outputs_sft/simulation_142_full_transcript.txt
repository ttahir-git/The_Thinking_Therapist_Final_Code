--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been noticing that I mostly intellectualize my feelings—breaking them down into problems to solve—because it's the only way I can cope with this adjustment disorder after a recent health scare. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to say out loud, but I'm a student and I get stuck analyzing details instead of actually feeling things.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing intellectualization as a coping mechanism after a health scare, which is a common response to significant stress. Core emotion seems to be discomfort, specifically about not feeling. Goal: Explore how intellectualization affects emotional experience and how it might be related to your adjustment disorder.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectualize your feelings? What does it feel like to analyze your emotions like you're breaking down a problem? For example, when you're stuck analyzing details, what do you notice right then? Is there a particular sensation or thought that comes up?

Patient: I don't know, I guess when I start analyzing things I lock onto facts and timelines—like what happened, what could happen, stats—so I don't have to sit with the fear or sadness. Physically it's like my head gets buzzy and my chest feels tight but dull, and I'm more focused on arranging details than actually feeling anything. Sorry, it's kind of hard to say more than that.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Intellectualization is leading to avoidance of emotional experience, which may be contributing to the adjustment disorder. The physical sensations (buzzy head, tight chest) are indicative of tension. Goal: Explore the physical sensations and emotional avoidance in more detail.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're using your mind to create a sense of control by focusing on facts and details. Can you tell me more about what's happening when you notice your head buzzing and chest feeling tight? Is it like your whole body is just holding onto that tension, or is it like you're aware of it, but it's not really registering as a significant feeling? How does that contrast with when you're analyzing details?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the chest tightness is more like background pressure — I can notice it but it doesn't feel like a clear emotion, more like something to ignore. When I start analyzing, that fuzzy stuff gets replaced by a checklist in my head and suddenly things feel controllable, even if it's not really dealing with the feeling. It's hard to talk about—I'm getting a bit panicky now—so I keep wanting to shift to something less... close.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Intellectualization is causing avoidance of emotional experience and physical sensations, leading to feelings of control but also possibly disconnection from emotional pain. Panic is setting in, making it hard to continue exploring. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help you acknowledge and tolerate the physical sensations without needing to control them or shift away.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a pause for a moment. I want you to bring your attention to your breath, just for a second. Notice how your body is feeling right now, including that background pressure in your chest. Can you simply acknowledge that pressure without trying to change it or push it away? Just observe it, like a physical sensation. Don't worry about intellectualizing or analyzing anything just yet. Just focus on the sensation, as it is.

Patient: I tried to notice it. I guess the pressure is a dull weight under my sternum and my breathing is shallow, but my head immediately starts counting breaths and making a checklist about why it's happening instead of just feeling it. I'm getting a bit panicky and overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know, it's hard to stay with it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Mindfulness exercise didn't work as planned, and panic is setting in, making it hard to continue. Goal: Slow down the pace, offer reassurance, and try to connect with the emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to slow down. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough right now. Can I just check in with you? How are you feeling in this moment? Not thinking, not analyzing, just feeling. Are you noticing any sensations, any emotions, anything at all?

Patient: I don't know. I guess right now I can feel that dull pressure under my sternum and my breaths are shallow, and there's this buzzy tension behind my eyes. Emotion-wise it's fuzzy—some anxiety and helplessness, but I can't really name it without my brain trying to make a checklist about it. I'm getting kind of panicky—can we take it slower? I don't know, it's hard to stay with this.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to access emotions, which is likely due to the intense avoidance of emotional experience. Panicking is increasing, making it harder to continue. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental statement to help the patient reconnect with their physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to take your time. Can I just say something to you right now? Your body is doing its best to tell you something, even if it's just a small sensation. That dull pressure under your sternum, the buzzy tension behind your eyes – these are just your body's ways of trying to communicate. No need to think about it, no need to analyze it. Just be with it, as it is.

Patient: I don't know, I guess your words help a little, but when I try to stay with the sensation my head immediately starts making lists about causes and solutions and I lose the feeling. It's uncomfortable—my throat tightens and I just want to change the subject—can we slow down? I'm not sure how to do this without panicking.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Gentle, non-judgmental language is not being received as helpful, possibly due to its similarity to the patient's usual thinking patterns. Panic is increasing, making it harder to continue. Goal: Introduce a more concrete and tangible approach to help the patient regain a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something a bit different. I want you to notice how your body is moving right now. Are your arms tense? Are your legs relaxed? Can you notice even small things like the feeling of the chair beneath you or the sound of your breathing? Sometimes, by focusing on the physical sensations in our body, we can gain a small sense of control and calm. Can you try that for me? Just observe your body, without thinking or trying to change anything.

Patient: I don't know, I guess my shoulders are tight and my hands feel a bit clammy, and the chair feels hard under my thighs. My breathing's shallow and I can hear it, but as soon as I try to just notice it my brain starts listing reasons and fixes—I'm getting anxious and want to move on, can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble staying present and noticing physical sensations due to their typical thinking patterns. Anxiety is increasing, making it harder to continue. Goal: Introduce a brief, concrete exercise to help the patient ground themselves in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small exercise for just a minute. I want you to bring your attention to one thing, just one thing. It can be anything: the sensation in your feet on the ground, the sound of the clock ticking, the feeling of the air on your skin. Just pick one thing and focus on it. Don't think about it, don't analyze it, just notice it. Can you do that for me? Just for one minute?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try. I'll focus on the feeling of the chair under my thighs — it's hard because my head's already making lists about why I'm doing it and what it should feel like. I'm starting to get a bit panicky, so can we go really slow and you remind me if I start analyzing?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to focus on the physical sensation despite their typical thinking patterns. Panic is increasing, making it harder to continue. Goal: Use a gentle reminder to help the patient stay grounded in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Take a deep breath in. You're going to focus just on the chair under your thighs right now. When you notice that, just notice it. Don't think about what it should feel like or why you're doing it. Just be with the feeling of the chair. Right now, it's hard. You're already making lists. That's okay. Just bring it back to the chair. The sensation of the chair on your thighs. Can you focus on that one thing? Just for a second, please. Remember, I'll remind you if you start to think too much.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can feel the chair—it's firm under my thighs and a little cool where it touches my skin. My breath is still shallow and my head's already making a checklist about whether I'm doing it right, so I'm starting to feel panicky—can you remind me to come back to the chair when I drift and maybe... like, count with me or something?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to stay present and noticing physical sensations despite their typical thinking patterns. Panic is increasing, making it harder to continue. Goal: Introduce a gentle, consistent reminder to help the patient stay grounded in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something. I want you to breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and breathe out for a count of four. Ready? Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4. Breathe out... 1... 2... 3... 4. As you breathe, I want you to focus on the chair under your thighs. Just notice it. Feel the firmness, the coolness where it touches your skin. Don't think about anything else. Just the chair. Ready to start again when you're ready?

Patient: I don't know, okay—I'll try. Inhale 1...2...3...4, hold 1...2...3...4, exhale 1...2...3...4. I guess it helps a little—my chest feels a bit less tight and the chair's still firm under my thighs, but my head's already making lists about whether I'm doing it right; can you count with me and remind me to come back when I start analyzing? I'm starting to feel panicky.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling with their typical thinking patterns, but is starting to show some improvement in noticing physical sensations. Panic is still present, but is slightly less intense. Goal: Continue to use the breathing exercise as a anchor, and gently remind the patient to come back to the present moment when they start to analyze.

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4. Breathe out... 1... 2... 3... 4. I'm still counting with you. Keep breathing. Focus on the chair. Feel the firmness, the coolness where it touches your skin. Don't think about the breathing, don't think about the counting. Just the chair. When you start to think again, I want you to take a deep breath and say "start again" to yourself. Just one word: "start again". Ready? Inhale...

Patient: I don't know, okay — I'll try. Inhale 1...2...3...4, hold 1...2...3...4, exhale 1...2...3...4. Start again. I'm already getting the checklist in my head and feeling panicky—can you keep counting with me and remind me to come back when I drift?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is acknowledging the need to bring their focus back to the present moment. Panic is increasing again. Goal: Continue to use the breathing exercise as an anchor, and gently remind the patient to stay grounded in the moment.

Therapist Answer:

Just the breath. Just the chair. You were here, you were focused. Take one breath, and come back. Inhale... (pausing slightly) 1... 2... 3... 4.

Patient: I don't know, I think I managed to come back for that breath. Inhale 1...2...3...4, hold 1...2...3...4, exhale 1...2...3...4. It helps a little—my chest feels a touch less tight—but my head's already making lists again. Can you keep counting with me and remind me to come back when I drift? I'm getting kind of panicky.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain focus, despite the gentle reminders. Panic is increasing again. Goal: Continue to use the breathing exercise as an anchor, and try to gently nudge the patient towards a greater sense of acceptance and presence.

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4. Breathe out... 1... 2... 3... 4. Start again. I'm still counting with you. Don't worry about the lists, don't worry about the panic. Just the breath. Just the moment. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Remember, it's not about controlling your thoughts, it's about being present with your thoughts. Let them be, without judgment. Just be. Inhale... (pausing slightly) 1... 2... 3... 4.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that last round helped a little—my chest feels a bit less tight and the chair's still firm under me, but my head's already filling up with checklists again. I'm getting kind of panicky and keep wanting to change the subject; can you keep counting with me and gently bring me back when I drift, and maybe help me notice where the panic shows up in my body? I'm not sure this is working, but I want to try—can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling to maintain focus, and is beginning to feel frustrated and panicky. It's clear that they're not ready to give up yet, and are willing to try to slow down and explore their experience further. Goal: Use the breathing exercise as an anchor, and gently explore the physical sensations of panic with the patient.

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4. Breathe out... 1... 2... 3... 4. Start again. I'm still counting with you. Let's take a deep breath together. As we breathe in, bring your attention to your body. Where do you feel the breath in your body? Where do you feel the air moving in and out of your body? Now, as we breathe out, bring your attention to any sensations in your body that don't feel like the breath. Where do you feel the tension or the panic? Is it in your chest? Your throat? Your shoulders? Just notice it, without trying to change it. Just be with it. Inhale... (pausing slightly) 1... 2... 3... 4.

Patient: I don't know, I guess the breath's mostly in my chest and throat — my chest feels like a heavy pressure, my throat's tight like a knot, my shoulders are up, and my hands are a bit clammy; my head's still buzzy. As soon as you ask me to notice other sensations my brain starts listing causes and I feel myself drift into analysis. I'm getting panicky — can we slow down and can you keep counting with me and remind me to "start again" when I start overthinking?

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is starting to feel overwhelmed by their physical sensations and is struggling to maintain focus on the present moment. It's clear that they're not ready to analyze their thoughts yet, and need to learn to tolerate the physical sensations without judgment. Goal: Use the breathing exercise as an anchor, and gently remind the patient to focus on the present moment without thinking about the past or future.

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4. Breathe out... 1... 2... 3... 4. Start again. I'm still counting with you. Let's focus just on the breath, right here, in this moment. Don't think about your chest, your throat, your shoulders, your hands. Just the breath. Just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. I want you to notice that sensation, just that sensation. Don't think about what it means, don't think about where it's coming from. Just notice it. Inhale... (pausing slightly) 1... 2... 3... 4. Remember, whenever you feel like you're starting to overthink, just take a deep breath and say "start again" to yourself. Let's try that together. Inhale... (pausing slightly) 1... 2... 3... 4. Start again.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess I can notice the breath a little, but my head immediately starts listing whether I'm doing it right and why it's happening, and that just makes me more panicky and confused. Can we slow down? Can you keep counting with me and tell me to "start again" when I drift?
