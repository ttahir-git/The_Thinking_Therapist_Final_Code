Patient: Honestly, what's been on my mind is this constant worry about how I'll perform when I try to go back to work — it paralyzes me and I end up procrastinating on every application or task. I’ve been dealing with PTSD and a recent health scare, so it all feels amplified and exhausting. I'm skeptical therapy can fix this — how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing intense worry about returning to work, feeling paralyzed by it, and how PTSD and a recent health scare have amplified these feelings. You seem skeptical about therapy's effectiveness, mentioning that you're not sure how it will help. Core emotion appears to be frustration and skepticism. Goal: Explore how these feelings relate to your current avoidance and procrastination strategies.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the weight of uncertainty about your work performance, combined with the ongoing impact of PTSD and the recent health scare, has created a sense of overwhelm that's making it hard for you to even start applying or taking action. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from making a single small step, like sending out one application or updating your resume? What is it about the thought of performing at work that feels so daunting, right now?

Patient: I freeze because it feels like everything will fall apart if I don't do it perfectly, so I just avoid starting anything. With the PTSD and that health scare, my concentration's shot, I get exhausted fast, and my head fills with 'you'll fail' and 'they'll notice' thoughts. I've tried breaking things into smaller steps and using timers before and it didn't stick — how is that supposed to help me now?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a pattern of avoidance due to a fear of not doing things perfectly, which is being exacerbated by your current state of PTSD and recent health scare. You mention that breaking down tasks into smaller steps and using timers hasn't been effective for you before. Goal: Introduce a new perspective on your current avoidance strategies and how they might be contributing to your emotional state.

Therapist Answer:
Those 'you'll fail' and 'they'll notice' thoughts sound like they're coming from a place of intense self-criticism. It's as if you're carrying a heavy burden of expectations for yourself, which is making it hard to even start taking action. I'm not suggesting that you should change who you are or how you think, but I want to gently explore whether there's a way to bring some more kindness and flexibility into your thinking. Can you think of a time when you've done something imperfectly, but still managed to get through it and maybe even learn something? How might that experience inform your approach to starting these tasks again?

Patient: I guess once, years ago, I had to organize a small community event — a bunch of things went wrong but we still pulled it off and people were fine. I learned that it didn't have to be perfect and I could improvise when plans fell apart. But with my PTSD and that health scare, the worry's louder now and I don't see how that memory actually helps me open my laptop and update a resume — how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've mentioned a past experience where you successfully organized an event despite some setbacks, and you've begun to reflect on how that might inform your approach to current challenges. However, you're expressing skepticism about how this memory can be applied to your current situation. Core emotion seems to be a mix of frustration and skepticism. Goal: Explore how the act of recalling and reflecting on this past experience might help you find a way forward.

Therapist Answer:
It's like the memory of that event has been lying dormant, waiting to be drawn upon. When you revisit it, you see that it's not just about the event itself, but about the process of adapting and making do with what you had. It's about being present in the moment and finding a way to navigate uncertainty. Can you think about how that process might be different when you're faced with updating a resume or applying for a job? How might you be able to bring some of that same mindset – a sense of curiosity, openness, and willingness to adapt – into your current situation? Instead of focusing on the end goal of a "perfect" resume, what if you tried to focus on the small, imperfect steps it takes to get there?

Patient: I get the idea, but that event had people around and quick feedback — updating a resume is lonely, vague, and feels permanently scrutinized, so my brain treats it like a life-or-death test. I've tried tiny steps and timers before and they never stick; I just end up feeling useless and shut down. How is that supposed to help me actually open my laptop and keep going when my PTSD keeps screaming that I'll fail?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're expressing the feeling of intense loneliness and scrutiny that comes with updating a resume, which is triggering your PTSD. You've tried small steps and timers before, but they haven't been effective in helping you stay motivated. Goal: Introduce a new perspective on how to work with your current state, rather than trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in a loop of feeling overwhelmed by your PTSD, and it's making it hard to even start working on your resume. Can we try something different for a moment? Instead of trying to "fix" your PTSD or overcome it with sheer willpower, what if we tried to create a tiny, small-space between you and that voice of self-doubt? Just for a moment, just a tiny breath, can you try to acknowledge that voice without engaging with it? It's like taking a step back and saying, "Okay, I see that voice. It's trying to tell me something. But for now, I'm going to focus on just this one tiny step." Maybe, just for one tiny step, we can create a small space between your PTSD and your need to start working on your resume. Can you try to just pick up that laptop, even if it feels like the whole world is watching, and just look at the screen for one second?

Patient: Okay — I picked it up and looked at the screen for a second. My hands shook, my chest tightened, and the 'you'll fail' voice got louder so I closed it again. I don't see how that one tiny moment changes anything when it just feeds the panic — how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a tiny step, but it's backfired due to the intense anxiety. You're feeling like you're right back at the starting point, with the "you'll fail" voice dominating again. Goal: Explore the potential benefit of acknowledging and accepting the anxiety, rather than trying to suppress it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you've taken a breath, opened the laptop, and looked at the screen, and for a moment, you were able to acknowledge the anxiety. The shaking, the tightening, the 'you'll fail' voice - it's all there, but it's not consumed you. Can you see how that tiny moment of acknowledgment might be different from the moment before? It's not about trying to push the anxiety away or fight it; it's about recognizing that it's there, and maybe, just maybe, that's enough to create some space. Instead of closing the laptop again, can you try to just... hold it for a moment longer? Just hold the laptop, and the screen, and the anxiety, without trying to change it or push it away? What if that tiny act of holding is enough to create a tiny shift in your relationship with the anxiety?

Patient: I tried holding it a little longer — maybe ten seconds — but my hands trembled, my chest felt like it was caving in, and I shut it again. I don't see how that tiny hold is supposed to undo weeks of panic and the constant "you'll fail" loop. I'm feeling really frustrated and overwhelmed; can we slow down and be more specific — what's the next concrete step and how would I actually notice even a small improvement? I've tried mindfulness and tiny steps before and they didn't stick, so how is this different?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tried to hold the anxiety for a brief moment, but it's back to the same feeling of overwhelm. You're expressing frustration and skepticism about the effectiveness of mindfulness and tiny steps. Goal: Introduce a more specific and concrete approach to help you build on the tiny hold and create a sense of progress.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're feeling frustrated and skeptical, but before we slow down or try something new, can we take a moment to acknowledge what did happen when you held the laptop for those ten seconds? What did you notice about your body and mind during that brief moment? Was there anything that felt slightly different, even if it was just a tiny change? For example, was your chest tension slightly lessened? Were your hands trembling slightly less? Were you thinking about the 'you'll fail' voice at all? It's not about trying to "fix" everything right now, but about being aware of even the smallest shift in your experience. If we can identify even a tiny improvement, even a tiny change in how you're feeling or thinking, that can give us a foothold to build on. Can we start by trying to notice those tiny details, even if it's just for the next breath?

Patient: I did notice something — my chest felt a hair less tight and my hands steadied for a second, and that "you'll fail" voice was a tiny bit quieter before it surged back. It felt fleeting and pointless though, like a glitch rather than a change. So seriously — how is noticing that supposed to help me actually sit down and finish a resume without bailing?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged a tiny improvement in your physical sensations and the 'you'll fail' voice, but it feels fleeting and unhelpful. You're still feeling the urge to bail. Goal: Introduce a more practical and tangible approach to help you build on the tiny improvements and create a sense of momentum.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that noticing the tiny improvement wasn't enough to give you the confidence to keep going. Let's try to focus on the tangible aspect of what you can do next. You've noticed that your hands steadied for a second, which means you've made progress in one specific area. Can you use that as a small, concrete goal to build on? For example, you could say to yourself, "Okay, I'm going to hold the mouse steady for just one more second." Noticing that tiny improvement can be a great way to create a sense of small wins, which can be motivating. Let's focus on that. What if, instead of trying to push through the anxiety, you tried to build on that tiny improvement? You could try to hold the mouse steady for just one more second, or type one sentence without looking up. What if that tiny act of commitment becomes a small, tangible step towards finishing the resume? Can we try to take that tiny step together?

Patient: Okay... I did it — I held the mouse for one more second. My hands trembled but for that one second they steadied and my chest eased a hair before the panic came back. It still feels trivial — how does that turn into typing a paragraph without me bailing? If that’s supposed to be the next step, be specific: do you want me to type one sentence now while you guide me, or tell me exactly what line to write on the resume? I’m not convinced, but I’m willing to try if it’s actually concrete.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the next tangible step of holding the mouse for one more second, which is a small improvement. You're feeling a bit more invested in the process. Goal: Introduce a clear, specific, and incremental goal for the next step, which is typing a paragraph without bailing.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try. Let's break it down into a very specific and manageable task. For the next 30 seconds, I want you to type a single sentence at a time, without looking up, but not necessarily with a specific goal of editing or perfecting the sentence. Just type one sentence at a time, focusing on getting the words down on paper. Here's the first sentence: "I am a strong candidate for this position, with [number] years of experience in [industry/field]." I want you to type that sentence without looking up, just start typing. Once you've typed that sentence, take a deep breath and move on to the next one. You'll start with the first sentence, and we'll take it from there. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Alright... I'll try, but I'm not convinced. Here's the sentence: "I am a strong candidate for this position, with 20 years of experience in office administration." It feels awkward and false to type that — how is saying it supposed to quiet the panic enough for me to actually finish a paragraph?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've typed the first sentence, but it still feels awkward and false, which is understandable given your current state. You're wondering how saying it out loud is supposed to calm the panic enough to finish a paragraph. Goal: Focus on the incremental progress and the small, tangible steps, rather than the larger goal of finishing a paragraph.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and acknowledge the progress you've made so far. You've typed a single sentence, which is a significant achievement. It's not about whether the sentence feels authentic or not; it's about the physical act of typing it. You've also acknowledged the panic, which means you're aware of how you're feeling. That's a huge step. Now, let's focus on the next step. I want you to type the next sentence, without looking up, without worrying about whether it's true or not, just focus on getting the words down. I'll wait for you to type the next sentence. Here's a question for you: What's the first thing that comes up when you think about the sentence you just typed? Is there something specific that's triggering the panic or making you feel uncomfortable?

Patient: Mostly I feel like an impostor — that sentence sounded dishonest and my brain immediately started listing all the ways I could be exposed as useless. It pulls up that helplessness from the health scare and the PTSD — the body tenses, my mind races, and it feels like everything's riding on one imperfect sentence. How is naming that supposed to get me to actually keep typing when it just makes the panic louder?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the source of the panic: feeling like an impostor and the fear of being exposed as useless. This is triggering the PTSD and the helplessness from the health scare, leading to physical symptoms like tension and racing thoughts. You're wondering how naming this exactly what's happening is supposed to calm the panic and get you to keep typing. Goal: Introduce a small, gentle, and non-judgmental intervention to help you cope with the physical symptoms of the panic, while acknowledging the emotional reality.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the panic is becoming overwhelming right now. Can I offer you a gentle, non-judgmental phrase to help you cope with the physical symptoms? When your body starts to tense up or your mind starts racing, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "This too, I can sit with." That's it, just "This too, I can sit with." Try it with me. (pause) Okay, now I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say it to yourself: "This too, I can sit with." And then, I want you to gently bring your attention back to the task at hand, which is typing the next sentence. You can start whenever you're ready.

Patient: Okay — I did the breath and said, "This too, I can sit with." My chest eased for a beat, then the impostor voice crept back and I felt stupid for even trying. I typed: "My strengths include attention to detail, organization, and reliability developed over 20 years in office administration." It still feels false and flimsy — how is this actually supposed to get me to finish a whole resume without bailing?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a step back, focused on your breath, and acknowledged the panic. You've typed a sentence, which is a significant achievement. However, the impostor voice has crept back, and you're feeling stuck again. You're wondering how this sentence, even with your strengths listed, is supposed to give you confidence to finish a whole resume. Goal: Introduce a new perspective on your strengths, one that emphasizes their value in a way that might help you feel more confident.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to shift your focus away from what you think your strengths are, and towards how they might be valuable to someone reading your resume. Can I ask you, what do you think someone reading your resume might be looking for in terms of strengths? What qualities or skills do they might value in an administrative professional like you? Try to think about this from the perspective of someone who is genuinely interested in your work experience and skills. What if, instead of focusing on what you think your strengths are, you focused on what you can offer to someone who is looking for those qualities? For example, how might your attention to detail, organization, and reliability contribute to the success of an organization? Can you think of a specific example from your experience where you've used one of these strengths to make a positive impact? Let's start with one of these strengths. How do you think your attention to detail might have helped you in your previous role?

Patient: I guess my attention to detail showed up in catching invoice errors and keeping the filing straight—once I spotted a billing mistake that would've cost the office thousands and we fixed it before it became a bigger problem. It helped keep things running and saved people time, but with my PTSD and the health scare those memories feel distant when the panic hits. How is pointing to a past win supposed to help me actually sit down and finish a resume right now?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've shared a specific example of how your attention to detail helped you make a positive impact in a previous role. However, you're feeling distant from this memory, and the panic is overwhelming. You're wondering how pointing to a past win is supposed to help you finish a resume right now. Goal: Introduce a more present-centered approach to help you build confidence and momentum.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel distant from your past successes when you're in the midst of a panic attack. It's not about trying to re-experience that memory or use it to distract yourself from your current anxiety. It's about recognizing that you've already demonstrated strengths and capabilities in the past, and that you can tap into those strengths again in the present.

Can I ask you to try something? I want you to look at the sentence you just typed, "My strengths include attention to detail, organization, and reliability developed over 20 years in office administration." Can you look at those words, "attention to detail," "organization," and "reliability," and think about how they might be relevant to this moment? How might you apply those strengths to this task of writing a resume, right now? It's not about creating a perfect sentence or paragraph, but about acknowledging that you have skills and capabilities that can help you get through this task.

Let's try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in past memories or worries about the future. Can you take a deep breath and try to bring your attention to the task at hand? Just focus on typing the next sentence, without worrying about how it's going to turn out. Are you ready to try?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try. "For example, I identified a billing error that would have cost the office thousands and put a checking process in place to prevent it from happening again." I typed it, but it feels a bit like I'm pretending and my chest's already tightening again — how is this actually supposed to get me to finish a whole resume, and what's the next exact, tiny step you want me to do?

Therapist Thinking:
You've typed a new sentence, which is a significant achievement. However, you're feeling like you're pretending again, and your chest is tightening. You're wondering how this is supposed to help you finish a whole resume. Goal: Introduce a small, specific action that will help you build momentum and confidence.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel like you're pretending, especially when you're trying to focus on a task that feels overwhelming. But I want to gently nudge you to focus on the physical act of typing, rather than the content of the sentence.

Can you look at the screen in front of you? Can you see the words "For example, I identified..."? Can you see the cursor blinking? What if you were to type just one word at a time, without thinking too much about the sentence? Just type the word "I" right now. Just type it, without stopping, without thinking about what it means, just type the word "I". Can you do that for me?

Patient: I typed "I." My hands shook and my mind jumped all over the place so fast I couldn't stay with it — I feel scattered and more anxious than before. How is typing one word supposed to get me to finish a resume? If we're doing this, tell me the very next tiny step—one exact word or action—and stay with me while I do it.

Let's try to break it down even further. You've typed the word "I". Now, I want you to type the word "am". Just type the word "am" right now. Don't think about the sentence, don't think about the meaning. Just type the word "am". I'll wait for you to type it, and then we'll take it from there.

Then, exhale slowly through your mouth, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here." Just say it to yourself: "I am here."

I want you to stop thinking about the word "small" and the feelings that come with it. I want you to focus on the physical act of typing. Look at the screen, and type the next word: "now". Just type the word "now". Focus on the sensation of your fingers on the keyboard, the movement of your hands, and the sound of the keys pressing down. Don't think about the sentence, don't think about the words, just focus on the physical act of typing.

Okay, you're focusing on the physical act of typing. Now, I want you to type the word "now" again. Just type it. One more time.

Patient: I typed "now" again. My hands shook, my chest tightened, and that shame popped up so I felt small and flat — I'm running on empty. What's the next single exact word or tiny action you want me to do, and stay with me while I do it, because I don't see how repeating words is going to finish a resume.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to stop thinking about the word "now" and the feelings that come with it. I want you to take a break from typing the word "now". Instead, I want you to think about the sentence you've been typing, and what you want to say. What do you want to express? What do you want to convey? Take a moment to reflect on the sentence, and what's coming next.

Okay, you've taken a break from typing the word "now". Now, I want you to look at the sentence again, and think about what you want to say. What do you want to express? What do you want to convey? Take a moment to reflect on the sentence, and what's coming next. When you're ready, I want you to start typing again. But this time, I want you to start with a new word. Just start typing, and see where it takes you.

Patient: Okay. I'll start with the word "Please." 

Please — I want to finish this resume but I'm worn out, my hands are still shaking, and my head keeps jumping all over. I don't see how this turns into a finished document; give me the next single exact word or tiny action and stay with me while I do it.

You've started typing again, and it's a small step. You're expressing frustration and exhaustion, but also a desire to finish the resume. Goal: Introduce a new tiny step that will help you build momentum and stay focused.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to acknowledge the physical sensations in your body right now. Can you feel the shaking in your hands? Can you feel the tension in your chest? Can you feel the fatigue in your body? Take a deep breath and acknowledge these sensations. Recognize that it's okay to feel this way, and that it's a normal part of the process.

( Wait for a brief moment )

Okay, you're acknowledging the physical sensations in your body. Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you feel the air entering and leaving your nostrils? Can you feel the rise and fall of your chest? Notice this sensation without judgment. Just notice.

( Wait for a brief moment )

Now, I want you to type one word that describes how you're feeling right now. Just one word. What is it?

Patient: Overwhelmed

Therapist Answer:
 pen I need.

Patient: Okay — there's a pen on the desk, but my hands are shaking so it's hard to hold steady. How is using a pen supposed to help with finishing the resume? Fine — I'll pick it up, but stay with me and tell me the exact tiny thing you want me to write with it.
