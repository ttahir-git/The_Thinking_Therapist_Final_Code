Patient: I'm a social worker in my late twenties, and since I lost someone close I've been overwhelmed by sadness and have almost no motivation — it's starting to mess with my relationship. I keep doubting myself, feeling guilty, and it's like everything's stuck. I've tried talking about it before and it didn't help much, so... how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to return to therapy after trying before. I'm here to listen and support you, not to offer solutions or fix everything right away. We can start by acknowledging your feelings of guilt and doubt. It sounds like these emotions are weighing heavily on you, especially considering your relationship is affected. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your relationship lately, and how these feelings have been impacting it?

Patient: Lately I just pull away — I cancel plans, stop texting, and when we're together I'm distant or snappy. My partner's hurt and keeps asking if I'm okay, and I feel guilty because I don't know how to explain this sadness; it's like I'm sinking and bringing them down. I've tried talking about it before and it didn't fix anything, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to be present and connected with your partner right now, and that's causing a lot of guilt for you. It's like you're feeling this overwhelming sadness that's pulling you under, and you're worried about bringing that down on your partner. You've tried talking about it before, and it hasn't been helpful, but that doesn't mean it's not worth trying again. Can we try a different approach? Instead of focusing on the sadness itself right now, let's talk about how you're feeling when you pull away from your partner. What's going through your mind when you cancel plans or stop responding to texts? Is there anything specific that's making you feel like you need to withdraw?

Patient: Mostly I pull away because I figure they'd be better off without me bringing this sadness into their day — I feel like a burden and get ashamed of how little energy I have. A lot of it is just numbness and not knowing how to explain the weird mix of grief and self-blame; I worry they'll judge me or get tired of supporting me. I'm exhausted in the moment, so disappearing feels easier than trying to be "normal." But I keep wondering — how is talking about that supposed to actually change anything?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge feeling like a burden, especially when it comes with shame. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight, wondering if your partner will get tired of supporting you or judge you for how you're feeling. I want you to know that feeling like a burden is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's actually a common experience for many people, especially during difficult times like this. Can we try something? Let's focus on the sensation of shame right now, rather than trying to explain the mix of grief and self-blame. Notice the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts that come up, and the emotions that arise when you think about feeling like a burden. Sometimes, simply acknowledging the shame without judgment can help us start to feel a bit more grounded.

Patient: When I think about being a burden my chest gets tight and my throat closes up, my hands go cold and I want to disappear or just crawl into bed. The thoughts are stuff like "they'd be better off without me," "I'm weak," and I feel shame mixed with guilt and this low, sinking sadness. I get skeptical — how is noticing that supposed to help? I’ve tried mindfulness before and it just made me more aware of how awful it feels, but... okay, I can feel the tightness now.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is actually helping a bit, even if it's uncomfortable. The tightness in your chest, the cold hands, the desire to disappear – these are all physical manifestations of the emotions you're experiencing. Rather than trying to push these sensations away or change them, let's focus on them right now. Can you simply observe the sensation of your chest tightening without trying to change it or push it away? Notice how it feels to be aware of this sensation in your body. Is there anything else you're noticing in this moment, beyond the physical sensations? Try to cultivate a sense of curiosity and openness towards your experience, rather than trying to fix it or change it.

Patient: Okay, I can feel the tightness and a weird hollow in my stomach, my breath gets shallow and my hands go cold. There's this thought like "I'm wasting their time" and a sinking numbness under it all. But honestly, I don't get how just watching it helps — I've done this before and it just made me more aware of how awful it is; can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to slow down. You've already noticed a lot, and that's a good thing. Sometimes, just noticing our thoughts and feelings without trying to change them can be a bit too much. Can we take a step back together? Let's focus on your breath for a moment. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away. Try to let go of the need to notice everything right now. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. We can come back to this later when you're feeling more comfortable.

Patient: I'm trying to follow my breath, but it just feels like I'm making room for the awful stuff instead of fixing it — I've tried mindfulness and breathing before and it usually just makes me more aware of how bad it is. How is that supposed to change the guilt or stop me from disappearing? Can we slow down and do something more practical, like a simple line I can use with my partner when I pull away or a tiny step to take when that tightness starts?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're looking for more concrete solutions. Sometimes, just being more aware of our thoughts and feelings isn't enough to make a big difference. Let's focus on finding some small, practical ways to help you cope with the tightness and guilt. What if, when you're feeling overwhelmed and your partner asks how you're doing, you could simply say, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can we take a break for a bit?" That might give you both some space to breathe and help you feel more grounded. Alternatively, what if you could commit to taking a small step – just one tiny step – when you start to feel the tightness? For example, you could take a sip of water, stretch your arm up, or simply notice the sensation in your feet on the ground. Sometimes, just doing one small thing can help us feel more connected to our bodies and more able to manage our emotions. Which of these options feels more manageable to you, and how can we work together to make them a part of your daily life?

Patient: The tiny step feels more doable — like taking a sip of water or naming where my feet are. But I've tried those before and they never stick — how is that supposed to actually become a habit instead of fading after a day? Maybe a really short script I can say without sounding dramatic would help, like “I need a minute, I’ll check in soon” — can we role-play that so it doesn't feel so weird?

Therapist: Let's try role-playing the script you mentioned. Can you repeat it back to me: "I need a minute, I'll check in soon"? How does that feel? Try saying it out loud, and then let's try it together. I'll respond as your partner might. Ready? "I need a minute, I'll check in soon." How did that feel? Now, let's try it in a different context. We're sitting together on the couch, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. You're feeling tight and anxious. You can say the script again. "I need a minute, I'll check in soon." What happens next? How do you respond? Remember, this is just a simulation. You're not actually in a situation where you need to say it. You're just practicing.

Patient: Okay — "I need a minute, I'll check in soon." Saying it out loud felt weird but also a tiny relief, like I wasn't being forced to pretend everything's fine. If my partner said, "Okay, take your time," I'd feel both grateful and suddenly guilty, like I'm making them hold space for me all the time.

But I'm skeptical it'll stick. How is this supposed to actually become a habit instead of me saying it once and then disappearing anyway? Can we make it more concrete — like an "if-then" plan I can actually use in the moment? For example: "If my chest tightens, then I say the script and send one short text 30 minutes later." Could we practice that exact exchange and the follow-up text now so it feels less awkward?

Therapist: Let's work on creating a more concrete "if-then" plan. I like the example you gave: "If my chest tightens, then I say the script and send one short text 30 minutes later." That's a specific and achievable goal. Let's practice the exact exchange you mentioned.

You're sitting together on the couch, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. My chest is tightening. I say: "I need a minute, I'll check in soon." And I send you a text that says: "Hey, just taking a minute to breathe. Will catch up with you soon." How does that feel? Is it too scripted, or is it starting to feel more natural?

Now, let's try something different. I'll say: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about it?" I want you to respond with the "if-then" plan. "If my chest tightens, then I say the script and send one short text 30 minutes later." How do you feel about that? Is it a good starting point, or do you need to make any adjustments?

Patient: Alright — here goes: "If my chest tightens, then I say, 'I need a minute, I'll check in soon,' and 30 minutes later I send, 'Taking a minute. I'll check in in 30.'" Saying it felt a little less weird than before, but I also get this burst of shame and frustration — like whatever plan I make will just… fail, and that makes me doubt I'll actually do the follow-up. Can we practice that exact exchange and the follow-up text now? And maybe help me figure out one tiny backup so I don't just disappear when the shame hits.

Therapist: Let's try the exact exchange you mentioned, with the burst of shame and frustration. I'll say: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about it?" And you respond with: "If my chest tightens, then I say, 'I need a minute, I'll check in soon,' and 30 minutes later I send, 'Taking a minute. I'll check in in 30.'" As you say it, notice how your body responds, and how the shame and frustration creep in. Take a deep breath, and acknowledge it. You're feeling like you're not going to be able to follow through on the plan, and that's okay. It's normal to feel that way.

Let's try a tiny backup plan. What if, when you feel the shame and frustration, you simply say to yourself: "It's okay, I can start again." That's it. Just those two words: "It's okay, I can start again." No pressure, no expectations. Just a gentle reminder that you can start again, no matter what. What do you think about that? Does it feel less daunting, or does it still feel like too much?

Patient: Saying "It's okay, I can start again" just floods me with shame — I feel like I've already failed and it makes me mad at myself. Maybe something more external would actually help: set a 25-minute timer or phone reminder and pre-write the short follow-up text so I can tap-send, or agree with my partner that if they don't hear from me in 30 minutes they'll send a gentle check-in. Can we practice the exact exchange now and role-play the follow-up text and your response? And seriously — how is that supposed to actually help when the shame hits?

Therapist: Let's try the external method you mentioned. I'll say: "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about it?" And you respond with: "If my chest tightens, then I say, 'I need a minute, I'll check in soon,' and 30 minutes later I send, 'Taking a minute. I'll check in in 30.'" I'll set a 25-minute timer and say: "I'll wait for your response." What if I pre-write the follow-up text and say: "Hey, just checking in. I'm still here"? What if, if I don't hear from you in 30 minutes, I send a gentle check-in: "Hey, just wanted to check in and see how you're doing"? How does that feel? Is it more concrete, more tangible, and more helpful in managing the shame and frustration?

Note: The goal is not to eliminate shame, but to help you develop a more manageable and compassionate relationship with it. The external method is meant to provide a sense of structure and support, rather than a complete avoidance of shame.

Patient: Okay...this actually sounds more concrete — I can imagine setting a 25-minute timer and prewriting: "Hey, just checking in. I'm still here." Saying the if-then out loud felt a little less weird.

But honestly, I'm still skeptical — when the shame hits I freeze and it just feels like any plan will fall apart. How is that supposed to help when I can't even bring myself to type a reply? Can we role-play the partner sending the check-in now? If they text, "Hey, just wanted to check in — how are you?" I think I'd want to reply something tiny like, "Thanks — taking a minute, I'll check in soon." But I can already feel the weariness — that might be too much. Can you help me make that reply even shorter so I actually could send it?

Therapist: Let's role-play the partner sending the check-in. I'll send you a text: "Hey, just wanted to check in — how are you?" You respond with: "Thanks — taking a minute, I'll check in soon." But I can see that you're already feeling the weariness, and you want to reply something even shorter. What if you say: "Thanks, taking a minute"? That's a tiny step, even smaller than "I'll check in soon". It's a small acknowledgement, a small commitment, and it might actually be enough to get you to send the text. Can you try saying that?

Note: The goal is not to get you to send a long or elaborate reply, but to find a tiny way to take action that feels manageable, even when you're feeling paralyzed by shame. The idea is to start small and build up, not to try to do too much too soon.

Patient: Okay... "Thanks, taking a minute." Saying that felt tiny and kind of stupid, and already there's this wave of shame yelling that I'll freeze anyway. Can we try an even shorter one — like just "Okay" — and a quick backup if I still can't bring myself to hit send?

Therapist: Let's try an even shorter reply. You say: "Okay." That's just two letters, a very small commitment. If you're still feeling frozen, we can add a quick backup. What if, before you hit send, you say to yourself: "Just send it"? That's a tiny, almost imperceptible cue to take action. It's not a lot, but it might be enough to get you to send the text. Can you try saying "Okay" and then just hitting send?

Note: The goal is not to get you to say anything profound or confident, but to find a tiny way to take action that feels manageable, even when you're feeling paralyzed by shame. The idea is to start small and build up, not to try to do too much too soon.

Patient: Okay... I can try saying "Okay." It already feels stupid and I can feel that freezing and shame sneaking back in — how is this actually supposed to help when that happens? Can we add one tiny backup: I’ll pretype "Okay" and set a 1‑minute reminder to tap send, and if I still don’t, my partner agreed to call once. Can you go ahead and role-play sending the check-in now so I can practice actually tapping send?

Therapist: Let's role-play the check-in. I'll send you a text: "Hey, just wanted to check in — how are you?" We've agreed that if you don't hit send within the next minute, I'll call you. You've also pretyped "Okay" and set a 1-minute reminder to tap send. You can take a deep breath and just wait for the timer to go off. When it does, you'll tap send and say "Okay". Let's try it. I'll send the text... (pausing for a moment)...now. You can start the timer and wait for it to go off. Remember, you've got this. Just tap send when the timer goes off.

Patient: ...The minute passed. I tapped send. The text went: Okay.

It felt so small — a tiny relief, then this rush of shame and that old thought that I'll mess it up anyway. I keep waiting for the freeze, like I'm already failing. How is this supposed to help when the shame still hits and I still want to disappear?

Can we role-play the call now? If my partner actually rings because I didn't respond, what could I say in one or two lines that doesn't sound frantic or fake?

Therapist: Let's role-play the call. I'll pretend to ring your phone because you didn't respond to my text. You're feeling anxious and unsure of what to say. You want to respond in a way that feels authentic, not frantic or fake. Can you try saying something like: "Hey, sorry I didn't respond. I'm just having a tough day." or "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to disappear. Can we catch up soon?" These responses acknowledge your lack of response and express your regret, without apologizing excessively or making excuses. They also leave room for your partner to respond and for you to start the conversation again. Take a deep breath and try to respond in a way that feels natural and genuine. Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take small steps towards communication.

Patient: I guess I'd say something like, "Hey, sorry — I'm having a rough day and needed a minute. Can we talk later?" It feels small and kind of stupid and there's this flush of shame like I already messed up, but I can actually imagine saying it. Still… how is that supposed to help when the freeze and shame hit so hard?

Therapist: Let's explore this further. You said, "Hey, sorry — I'm having a rough day and needed a minute. Can we talk later?" This response acknowledges your lack of response, takes ownership of your emotions, and sets a boundary. It's not perfect, but it's a genuine attempt to communicate. Now, imagine that the freeze and shame hit as hard as ever. You're feeling like you're not good enough, like you're going to mess up again. But you've already said something. You've taken a small step towards communication, even when it felt like it was going to fail. That small step can actually give you a tiny bit of momentum. It's like you're creating a tiny crack in the freeze, and it's not going to be easy to close it all the way again. You're not going to magically overcome the freeze and shame with this one conversation, but it's a start. It's a small step towards building resilience and developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: I guess I can see it as a tiny crack, but I'm worn out and that old shame is already loud — it’s telling me I’ll fail again. I did send “Okay” and it helped a bit, but the freeze still feels inevitable and I’ve tried plans like this before and they don’t stick. How is that supposed to turn into real momentum? Can we come up with an even smaller, more fail‑safe backup — like a prewritten voice note or an agreed automated check-in my partner can trigger so I don’t have to do anything when the shame hits?

Therapist: Let's explore some ways to make small steps feel more manageable and fail-safe. You mentioned a prewritten voice note or an automated check-in that your partner can trigger. That's a great idea. Sometimes, having a clear and simple plan can help reduce the mental resistance that comes with feeling overwhelmed. You could also consider setting a specific, low-stakes goal for the next 24 hours, like "I will send a text to my partner once today" or "I will take a short walk outside without checking my phone". This can help you build momentum by making small commitments feel less daunting. Additionally, you could try to find ways to make the check-in or voice note feel more comfortable and less triggering. For example, you could ask your partner to wait for a short time before sending the check-in, or to use a gentle reminder tone. The goal is to make small steps feel more achievable and less overwhelming, so that you can build momentum and develop a more resilient relationship with yourself.

Patient: Maybe an automated check‑in could help, but I can already feel that hot wave of shame saying it's pathetic and it won't work — how is that supposed to help? Could we actually write a pre‑recorded voice note (or two) together and pick a concrete trigger my partner can press or an app that sends the message, so it doesn't rely on me in the moment? And if that still fails, can we make a super‑simple script for my partner to use when they call — like, "I'm here, take your time" — so I don't have to fumble for words?

Therapist: Let's explore ways to make automated check-ins and pre-recorded voice notes feel more concrete and less triggering. You mentioned writing a pre-recorded voice note or two together, and picking a specific trigger for your partner to press or an app to send the message. That's a great idea. Sometimes, having a clear plan and a specific trigger can help reduce the mental resistance that comes with feeling overwhelmed. You could also consider writing a super-simple script for your partner to use when they call, like "I'm here, take your time". This can help you feel more grounded and less anxious about responding in the moment. For example, you could write: "Just a reminder that I'm here and I'm doing my best. Take your time, and we can catch up when you're ready." Having a simple script like this can help you feel more confident and less fumble-prone when your partner calls. Let's write it down together and see what it looks like.

Patient: This is a good, concrete idea — here are ready-to-use options (texts, voice note scripts, partner call lines), plus simple ways your partner can trigger them automatically or with one tap. I’ll keep it practical and short so it’s actually usable.

Prewritten short texts (tap‑send)
- Ultra‑tiny: “Okay.”  
- Tiny: “Thanks — taking a minute.”  
- Tiny + check‑in promise: “Taking a minute. I’ll check in soon.”  
- If you want one prewritten you can schedule/send later: “Hey — still here. Will check in when I can.”

Prewritten voice note scripts (record these and your partner can send)
- Very short (6–10s): “Hey — I’m having a tough minute. I’ll reach out when I’m feeling up to it.”  
- Short (15–25s): “Hi — I’m feeling overwhelmed right now and need some space. I’m not gone; I’ll try to check in later when I can. Thanks for being patient.”  
- A gentle, longer one partner can play if you need grounding: “I’m here. Take your time. Breathe with me for a moment. You don’t have to do anything huge right now — small steps are fine.”

Partner phone‑call scripts (one or two lines)
- “Hey — I’m here. Take your time.”  
- “No pressure — I’ll be here when you’re ready.”  
- If you want to offer action: “Do you want me to call back in 30 minutes, or would you prefer I check in later by text?”  
- If you want to validate + silence: “I hear you. I’m with you. I’ll give you space and check in in a bit.”

Fail‑safe backups (what to do if you freeze)
- Pretype the tiny text (e.g., “Okay”) and add a 1‑minute reminder to tap send.  
- Give your partner permission to call once if no reply in X minutes. They use one of the partner scripts on the call.  
- Partner has a single‑tap shortcut on their phone that sends the prewritten text/voice note to you (so they don’t have to type anything in the moment).

How your partner can set up a single‑tap send (simple options)
- iPhone (Shortcuts app): Create a shortcut that “Send Message” to your contact with the prewritten text; add to Home Screen as a button your partner taps. Or save a voice memo and share it manually with a tap.  
- Android (MacroDroid or Tasker): Make a widget that sends an SMS/WhatsApp message or plays a saved voice note to your chat with one tap.  
- Cross‑platform/simple: Use a scheduling app like Scheduled, Do It Later, or an IFTTT/Pushbullet button widget so partner taps and the message goes out.  
- Messaging apps: Partner can save a template in WhatsApp/Telegram and forward it with two taps.

Why this helps (short answer)
- It lowers the activation energy: deciding = hard when shame/freeze hits; having prewritten options or an external trigger removes that decision so you don’t have to act in the moment.  
- It externalizes the task: you’re not relying on your willpower during overwhelm. That makes the behavior more likely to happen and creates small wins that build momentum.  
- It reduces the fear of judgement: short neutral messages acknowledge without requiring you to perform emotionally.

Quick implementation plan (one evening, low effort)
1. Pick 1 tiny text you’re willing to send (e.g., “Okay” or “Taking a minute”).  
2. Record one of the short voice notes and save it in your partner’s phone (or write it down to be sent).  
3. Partner sets up a one‑tap shortcut/widget to send the tiny text or voice note. (If you tell me whether they use iPhone or Android I can give step‑by‑step.)  
4. Agree: partner will call once after X minutes if no response. Partner uses the short call script.  
5. Test it once so it feels less weird.

If you want, I can:
- Draft the exact voice note for you to record (I can write a 10–15s and a 20–30s version).  
- Give step‑by‑step setup instructions for an iPhone Shortcut or an Android MacroDroid task.  
- Draft a 3‑line script for your partner to say on a call and a short text template they’ll use to check in.

Which of those would you like me to create now — the voice note scripts, the exact one‑tap Shortcut steps (iPhone or Android?), or the partner call script?

Therapist: I'll help you with the quick implementation plan. You've identified the steps to set up the system: pick a tiny text, record a short voice note, set up a one-tap shortcut, agree on the partner call script, and test it once.

Let's start with the tiny text. Which one are you willing to send? You've listed "Okay" and "Taking a minute." Choose one that feels manageable for you.

Once you've selected the tiny text, I'll guide you through the process of recording a short voice note and setting up a one-tap shortcut using the specified app (iPhone Shortcut or Android MacroDroid).

After that, we'll review the partner call script and template, and I'll help you draft a simple one.

Which tiny text would you like to start with?

Patient: Okay — I’ll start with “Taking a minute.” My partner uses an iPhone, so let’s do the Shortcuts method. I’m skeptical it’ll actually stick, but fine — show me the steps.

Therapist: Let's walk through the steps to create a Shortcuts shortcut that sends the "Taking a minute" text to your partner's iPhone.

**Step 1: Open Shortcuts and create a new shortcut**

* Open the Shortcuts app on your partner's iPhone.
* Tap the "+" icon in the top-right corner to create a new shortcut.
* Name the shortcut something like "Send Text".

**Step 2: Add the "Send Message" action**

* In the Shortcuts editor, tap the "Add Action" button.
* Search for "Send Message" and select it from the results.
* Tap "Next" to configure the action.

**Step 3: Set up the "Send Message" action**

* In the "Send Message" action, enter your phone number or select an existing one from your contacts.
* Select the type of message you want to send (e.g., "SMS").
* Choose the recipient's phone number from your contacts.
* Tap "Next" to configure the action.

**Step 4: Add the "Add Text" action**

* Tap the "Add Action" button again.
* Search for "Add Text" and select it from the results.
* Tap "Next" to configure the action.

**Step 5: Set up the "Add Text" action**

* In the "Add Text" action, enter the text "Taking a minute".
* You can also format the text if needed.
* Tap "Done" to save the text.

**Step 6: Set up the shortcut to run automatically**

* Tap the "Add Action" button again.
* Search for "Timestamp" and select it from the results.
* Tap "Next" to configure the action.

**Step 7: Set up the timestamp**

* In the "Timestamp" action, select the time format you want to use (e.g., "Last 1 Minute").
* Tap "Done" to save the timestamp.

**Step 8: Create the shortcut**

* Review the shortcut configuration to ensure everything is correct.
* Tap "Create Shortcut" to save the shortcut.

**Step 9: Add the shortcut to your partner's home screen**

* Go back to the Shortcuts app.
* Select the "Send Text" shortcut.
* Tap the "Add to Home Screen" button.
*

Patient: Ugh — this already feels like a lot and I can feel that old shame whispering I’ll mess it up. That “Timestamp” step sounded weird — can you give me a much simpler, exact step‑by‑step my partner can follow on iPhone Shortcuts to make a one‑tap “Taking a minute” send (including how to add it to the Home Screen) — and also write two short voice‑note scripts (10s and 20s) I can record? I’m worn out and skeptical it’ll stick, but I’ll try if you keep it really concrete.

Therapist: : I’m skeptical about using the Shortcuts app, and I want to make sure I’m focusing on the right aspects of the communication. How can I make the communication with my partner more effective? What specific strategies can I use to help us stay connected throughout the day?

Let me know your thinking on the best way to implement Shortcuts and use it in our conversation.

Patient: Ugh — I’m wiped but I’ll try. I want super‑simple stuff I can actually hand to my partner and a couple short voice notes to record. Don’t lecture me — just give the exact steps and the scripts. Also say, briefly, what small communication habits actually help so this doesn’t just turn into more shame when I fail.

1) Exact iPhone Shortcut (one‑tap) — partner does this on their iPhone
- Open Shortcuts. Tap the + (Create Shortcut).  
- Tap “Add Action.” Search for and pick “Send Message.”  
- In the Send Message box: tap the “Recipients” field and choose my contact (my number). In the Message field type: Taking a minute  
- Tap the small chevron/three dots at the top-right of the shortcut editor (Shortcut Details). Name it “Taking a minute.”  
- Still in Details: toggle off “Show When Run” (so it sends without a confirmation pop-up). If there’s no toggle visible, the partner will just have to tap and confirm the first time.  
- Tap “Add to Home Screen.” Pick an icon/name and Add.  
- Test it once: partner taps the new Home Screen button and makes sure the message is sent. The phone will ask for permission the first time — accept it.

Notes: no timestamp or extra actions needed. If the partner uses iMessage, it will show in your Messages thread like a normal text. If “Show When Run” can’t be toggled because of iOS version, the partner will have to tap Send once — still one quick tap.

2) Two voice‑note scripts to record (10s and 20s)
- 10s (tight): “Hey — I’m having a tough minute and need a little space. I’m not gone; I’ll check in when I can. Thanks.”  
- 20s (gentle): “Hi — I’m feeling overwhelmed right now and need some quiet to breathe. I appreciate you being here. I’ll reach out when I’m ready; if you don’t hear from me in a bit, a gentle check‑in is okay.”

3) Super‑short partner call lines (one or two lines they can use)
- “I’m here. Take your time.”  
- “No pressure — do you want me to call back in 30 minutes or check in by text?”  
- If you want validation + space: “I hear you. I’ll give you a bit and check back later.”

4) Fail‑safe backups (exact, low effort)
- Pretype the tiny text (“Taking a minute”) in your Messages app and pin it in the Notes app or as a keyboard shortcut so you can paste/send quickly.  
- Partner will tap the Shortcut if no reply in X minutes (you pick X = 25–30).  
- If you still don’t respond, partner calls once and uses one of the call lines above.  
- Agree on one emoji or word you can send if you can’t manage anything else (e.g., “🖤” or “Okay”).

5) Very short, practical daily habits that actually help (not therapy fluff)
- Two low‑stakes check‑ins: one morning, one evening, 1–2 sentences max. Keeps connection without pressure.  
- Use a shared calendar block for “quiet time” so both of you know times you might be unavailable.  
- Partner practices “soft questions” not problem‑solving: “How are you?” vs. “What’s wrong?” — and uses validating lines above.  
- Keep expectations explicit: agree what counts as “checking in” (a one‑word text counts). That reduces guilt for not doing more.

6) Why this can work (short)
- It removes the decision when you’re frozen: the partner or a shortcut does the initiating so you don’t have to perform in the moment. Small, repeatable actions create tiny wins that slowly build trust in the system — not you “fixing” yourself right away.

Okay — I still feel like this will fall apart, but I can try handing these steps to my partner. Can you give me the exact set of text I should paste/send to them to set this up (one message I can copy), and the two voice‑note scripts again formatted exactly how I should record them? Also, tell me what to test first so we know it actually works.

Patient: Alright — here’s exactly what you can copy/paste to your partner, the two voice‑note scripts to record, and a super‑short test plan so you both know it actually works. I’m worn out thinking about this, but here you go.

Copy‑and‑paste message to partner
"Hey — can you help me set up a quick support plan? If I go quiet, could you add a one‑tap button on your iPhone that sends this exact text to me: 'Taking a minute.' If I don't reply within 25–30 minutes, please call once and say: 'I’m here. Take your time.' Also, please record/save these two short voice notes so you can send/play them if needed: (1) 'Hey — I’m having a tough minute and need a little space. I’ll check in when I can. Thanks.' (2) 'Hi — I’m feeling overwhelmed right now and need some quiet to breathe. I appreciate you being here. I’ll reach out when I’m ready; if you don’t hear from me in a bit, a gentle check‑in is okay.' Could you set up the shortcut, test it once tonight (tap the home‑screen button) and tell me it worked? Thank you — this helps me a lot."

Two voice‑note scripts (exact wording to record)
- 10s (concise): "Hey — I’m having a tough minute and need a little space. I’ll check in when I can. Thanks."  
- 20s (gentle): "Hi — I’m feeling overwhelmed right now and need some quiet to breathe. I appreciate you being here. I’ll reach out when I’m ready; if you don’t hear from me in a bit, a gentle check‑in is okay."

What to test first (simple, 4 steps)
1) Partner creates the Shortcut (Send Message → recipient = your contact → message = Taking a minute) and adds it to their Home Screen.  
2) Partner taps the Home Screen button once to send the message; you confirm you received the “Taking a minute” text. That verifies the shortcut works.  
3) Partner records both voice notes and sends one to your chat so you confirm playback works.  
4) Agree the call rule (25–30 min no reply → one call using: "I’m here. Take your time.") and do one quick dry run if you can (partner taps shortcut, you say you got it).  

Quick fail‑safe extras (optional)
- Pretype "Taking a minute" in Notes or keyboard shortcut so you can paste if you manage to reply.  
- Pick a backup emoji if you can’t type (e.g., “🖤”) and tell partner that counts as checking in.  
- If the partner can’t make a Shortcut, they can save the exact text as a WhatsApp/Message template and forward it with two taps.

I’m still skeptical this will magically solve the shame-freeze, but it does lower the moment‑by‑moment effort — you won’t have to create wording when you’re stuck. Want me to format the partner message even shorter, or write the exact step‑by‑step Shortcut instructions you can copy to them?

Patient: I can’t really make sense of that — my head’s fuzzy and this feels like a scramble. Can we slow down? 

Give me exactly three things, super short so I can copy them: 
1) One short message to send to my partner right now.  
2) Three simple iPhone Shortcut steps they can follow to make a one‑tap “Taking a minute” send.  
3) One 10‑second voice‑note script I can record.

Also — how is this actually supposed to help when I freeze and feel ashamed? Tell me the single first thing to test so I don’t get lost. I can try it, but I’m not promising it’ll stick.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try. Here’s exactly what you asked for — super short.

1) One short message to send to my partner right now:
Taking a minute.

2) Three simple iPhone Shortcut steps they can follow (copy this to them):
- Open Shortcuts → tap + to make a new shortcut → Add Action → search “Send Message.”  
- In Send Message: choose my contact as Recipient and type: Taking a minute. Tap the three dots, name it “Taking a minute.”  
- Tap Add to Home Screen to create the button. Test by tapping it once to send the message.

3) One 10‑second voice‑note script to record:
“Hey — I’m having a tough minute and need a little space. I’ll check in when I can. Thanks.”

How this helps when I freeze/shame (one line):
It removes the need for me to create wording in the moment — the partner or a shortcut does the action so I don’t have to perform while I’m shut down.

Single first thing to test:
Partner taps the new Home‑Screen button once and I confirm I received “Taking a minute.”

I’m still not sure this will stick and I can already feel the shame buzzing, but I’ll try that test. Can we make a 1‑line fallback my partner can say if I don’t respond — something I won’t hate hearing?

Patient: Okay... one line that might actually land for me: "I'm here — take your time." Another option: "No rush, I'm right here." 

I can already feel that shame telling me it'll still flop, but can you role‑play saying the first line now — like my partner would, quiet and steady — so I can try to picture it?

Patient: "I'm here — take your time."

Okay... hearing that quiet and steady actually softens something for a second, but my shame's still yelling that I'll freeze anyway and I hate that I keep waiting for it to fail. Can you say it one more time a little slower?
