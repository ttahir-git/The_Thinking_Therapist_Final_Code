--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I keep getting stuck in these cycles of brutal self-criticism — losing clients or jobs lately just feeds this story that I'm a failure. I had a pretty chaotic childhood with inconsistent parenting, so I learned to be hyper-vigilant and blame myself for things falling apart. I’m skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to change any of that?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes cycles of brutal self-criticism, blaming themselves for recent failures, and a history of inconsistent parenting that led to hyper-vigilance and self-blame. Core emotion is likely shame and frustration. Goal: Introduce a process to challenge self-criticism and explore the value of self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right now when you start criticizing yourself? Where does that voice come from, and what triggers it for you? I want to understand this process better, and how it might relate to your past experiences with your parents.
(I'm not trying to "change" anything yet, just exploring the process of self-criticism. This question aims to establish a better understanding of the situation and introduce a more flexible, non-judgmental stance.)

Patient: When the self-criticism hits, my chest gets tight and my head just reruns the mistake until it feels like proof I'm worthless. The voice is basically my parents'—quick to blame, unpredictable, like I'm always bracing for the next collapse. It gets triggered by losing a client, a missed deadline, or even just silence from someone I emailed—anything that smells like instability. I've tried naming these things before and it doesn't do much — how is talking about where it comes from supposed to change any of that?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a physical and mental response to self-criticism, involving a tight chest and a catastrophic thinking loop. The voice is familiar, stemming from their parents' quick-to-blame and unpredictable communication style. This has led to a pattern of hyper-vigilance and self-blame. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion to help break the catastrophic thinking loop.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the self-criticism has become very automatic for you. When that voice starts up, it's like a script that plays out in your head, right? It's not like you're thinking this stuff consciously, it just seems to happen. I want to try something different. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that your mind is just a mind, and it's just saying this stuff? Like, "Oh, it's just my mind, saying 'you're worthless' again"? Can you notice that thought, without trying to engage with it or change it, just observe it? (Introduce defusion as a way to break the catastrophic thinking loop, without trying to change the content of the thought.)

Patient: I can sort of do that — tell myself “oh, that’s just my mind” — but it barely loosens the grip; the thought still feels like proof and my chest tightens. When I try to observe it, I just get pulled into the replay instead of stepping back. How is just noticing supposed to stop the loop or change how intense it feels?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a partial success with defusion, noticing the thought without engaging with it, but finding it difficult to sustain. They're still pulled into the replay and experience a tightening chest. Goal: Introduce the concept of "experiments" to make the process more concrete and accessible.

Therapist Answer:
It's like we're having a conversation, and sometimes I say something that works, sometimes I don't. Let's try something different. Instead of just noticing the thought, let's make it an experiment. Imagine you're trying a new way of dealing with this voice. You're not trying to stop it, or change it, or even really notice it that much. You're just trying to make room for something else. Say to yourself, "I'm going to make space for a different thought, or a different feeling. I'm going to allow myself to feel something else for just a moment." Can you try that? Just for a moment, with the voice that just came up? (Introduce the concept of "experiments" as a way to make the process more concrete and accessible, and to encourage the patient to engage with it in a more concrete way.)

Patient: I tried that — I told myself I'd make space and tried to let a different thought in for a moment. It didn't stick; the old voice just argued back and my chest stayed tight like before. How is this any different from stuff I've already tried? Saying "make room" feels vague — give me a very specific, step-by-step thing to try right now, and stay with me through it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a partial success with the "experiments" approach, but finds it difficult to sustain. They're looking for a more specific and concrete approach. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT skill, called "acceptance of the present moment," to help the patient develop a more flexible relationship with their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're looking for a more concrete approach. Let's try something specific. I want you to bring your attention to your feet right now. Just notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the weight of your body distributed on them. Don't try to change that, just observe it. Then, I want you to bring your attention to your breathing. Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, the rise and fall of the chest. Again, don't try to change it, just observe it. And then, finally, bring your attention to the sensation of the voice right now. Notice how it feels in the body, how it sounds, without trying to engage with it or change it. Just observe it as it is. Can you do that with me? (Introduce the specific ACT skill of "acceptance of the present moment" to help the patient develop a more flexible relationship with their thoughts and emotions.)

Patient: Okay, I did it. My feet feel kind of heavy and grounded — that actually helped a little bit, like there's something steady under me. My breathing's shallow but I could notice the in-and-out; my chest is still tight though, and the voice feels like pressure behind my sternum, rapid and almost metallic. It makes the thought a bit less convincing, but it doesn't make it stop — how is noticing my feet and breath supposed to keep it from replaying the failure? Stay with me — what do we do when it snaps back?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a small success with the "acceptance of the present moment" exercise, noticing a sense of grounding and a slight reduction in the intensity of the voice. However, the voice still replays the failure, and the patient is unsure how to sustain the calm. Goal: Introduce the concept of "dealing with the snapback" and develop a strategy to manage the replay of the failure.

Therapist Answer:
It's like we had a small window of calm, but the voice just snapped back. That's okay, that's normal. What we can do is acknowledge that the voice is replaying the failure, and then gently bring our attention back to the present moment. Just say to yourself, "Oh, the voice is replaying it again." Notice the physical sensations, notice the thought itself, but don't try to engage with it or change it. Then, slowly and deliberately, bring your attention back to your breath. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out, the rise and fall of the chest. When you notice your mind starting to wander again, gently bring it back to the breath. And then, after a moment, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm present, I'm standing with this failure." Can you do that with me? (Introduce the concept of "dealing with the snapback" and develop a strategy to manage the replay of the failure, by acknowledging the voice, focusing on the present moment, and slowly bringing attention back to the breath.)

Patient: Alright — I did it. I said to myself, "Oh, the voice is replaying it again," brought attention back to my breath, and for a few seconds it loosened — my chest wasn't stabbing as much. Then it came back, louder and faster, like it was arguing that the breath was irrelevant and I’m still a failure. How is this supposed to make a real, lasting difference when it always snaps back? I’m not trying to shut you down, I just need something that doesn’t feel like rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship — what do we do when it won’t let go?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a small success with acknowledging and refocusing on the breath, but the voice continues to snap back, louder and more insistent. The patient is looking for a more sustained solution. Goal: Introduce the concept of exploring the value system, to help the patient understand what is driving the need to constantly replay the failure.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like we're at a bit of a plateau, but I want to explore something with you. What is it about being a failure that's so important to you right now? What is it about that thought that keeps coming back, even though we're trying to focus on something else? Is it the fear of being a failure? The shame of it? The hope of somehow changing it? Let's explore that. Can you tell me more about what that thought means to you, and why it's so hard to let go of? (Introduce the concept of exploring the value system, to help the patient understand what is driving the need to constantly replay the failure, by asking questions that aim to uncover the underlying values and motivations that are driving the patient's thoughts and behaviors.)

Patient: I guess that voice matters because it felt like survival back then — blaming myself was how I kept the chaos from getting worse, so now criticism is my early-warning system. It's wrapped up in shame too — if I'm a failure I'm unlovable — and weirdly it sometimes drives me to overwork because I don't trust anyone else to keep things together. I've thought about origins a lot already, so how is understanding that supposed to actually loosen it when it snaps back? Stay with me on this — I need something concrete to do in the moment.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a deeper understanding of the origins and drivers of the voice, including the role of shame, fear, and self-blame. However, they express a need for a concrete strategy to manage the voice in the moment. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT process called "defining the boundary" to help the patient create a clear distinction between themselves and the critical voice.

Therapist Answer:
I think I understand what's going on here. The voice is a part of you, but it's also a part of the problem. It's trying to control you, trying to keep you safe by blaming you, but it's not safe. It's not safe for you to let it control you anymore. So, I want you to do something with me. I want you to define the boundary between yourself and that voice. Imagine that voice is standing right next to you, saying the same things it always says. But I want you to take a step back, and look at it like an outsider. Look at it like, "What would I say to someone who is saying that?" Would I say, "You're a failure"? No, I would say, "I'm sorry you're feeling that way." Would I say, "You're unlovable"? No, I would say, "You're a human being, and you deserve love and compassion." Can you define the boundary like that? Can you create a space between yourself and the voice? (Introduce the specific ACT process of "defining the boundary" to help the patient create a clear distinction between themselves and the critical voice, by imagining the voice as an outsider and taking a step back to observe it.)

Patient: I tried that—imagined the voice next to me and took a mental step back. It felt...strange, like I'm watching someone yell at a stranger and still feeling my face heat up. I could say, "I see you," or "that's not me," but how is that actually going to stop it when it keeps screaming that I'm worthless? Stay with me—give me a very concrete script or action to do in the exact moment it won't shut up.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a sense of strangeness and disconnection from the critical voice, but still feels overwhelmed by its intensity. They ask for a concrete script or action to manage the voice in the exact moment it won't shut up. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT technique called "blanketing" to help the patient cover the voice with a sense of calm and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to do something very specific right now, when the voice starts yelling again. As soon as you feel that scream of self-criticism, I want you to bring your attention to your heart center. Just notice the sensation of your heart beating, the feeling of the breath moving in and out. Then, I want you to say to yourself, "May this voice be blanketed with kindness." That's it. Just say those three words: "May this voice be blanketed with kindness." As you say them, I want you to imagine a warm, soothing light covering the voice, like a blanket of kindness. Can you do that? Can you cover the voice with kindness when it starts screaming again? (Introduce the specific ACT technique of "blanketing" to help the patient cover the voice with a sense of calm and acceptance, by imagining a warm, soothing light covering the voice.)

Patient: Okay, I did that — I said "May this voice be blanketed with kindness" and tried to picture the light. It helped for maybe ten seconds; my chest eased a bit, then the voice just scoffed that kindness is weakness and the loop came right back. How is picturing a blanket supposed to stop it from proving I'm worthless? Give me a very concrete script or physical action to do the exact moment it starts, and stay with me while I try it — I need you to coach me through it.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from the kindness blanket, but the voice quickly dismisses it as weakness. They need a more concrete and immediate action to manage the voice. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT technique called "expedited questioning" to help the patient interrupt the voice and break the cycle of self-criticism.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try something very different now. As soon as you feel the voice starting to yell again, I want you to say "What's the worst that could happen right now?" Just those five words: "What's the worst that could happen right now?" Say them clearly and firmly, without thinking. Say them without judgment, without trying to change the outcome. Just ask the question. Can you do that? As you say the question, I want you to focus on your own breath, feel the air moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the voice, don't think about the answer. Just ask the question. And then, I want you to repeat it back to me, in the next breath. "What's the worst that could happen right now?" Just say it again, exactly. (Introduce the specific ACT technique of "expedited questioning" to help the patient interrupt the voice and break the cycle of self-criticism, by asking a direct and immediate question about the potential consequences of the voice's message.)

Patient: Okay — I said it aloud: "What's the worst that could happen right now?" and then repeated it on the next breath. It gave me a tiny gap, but then the voice immediately started listing stuff — lose clients, can't pay rent, business collapses — and my chest tightened like before. How is that question supposed to derail the loop when the answers just fuel the panic? Stay with me and coach me through it step-by-step — what exactly do I say or do next when the voice starts rattling off those worst-case scenarios?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from asking the question, but the voice quickly escalates into a list of worst-case scenarios. They need to find a way to interrupt the voice's logic and break the cycle of panic. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT technique called "temporal defusion" to help the patient detach from the voice's catastrophic thinking and focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to focus on the voice's words, but not on them. As soon as you hear the list of worst-case scenarios, I want you to say "Those are all in the past." Just those four words: "Those are all in the past." Say them clearly and firmly, without thinking. Say them without judgment, without trying to change the outcome. Just label the time frame. Can you do that? As you say the words, I want you to bring your attention to your own breath, feel the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sound of the chair creaking. Don't think about the voice, don't think about the past, don't think about the future. Just bring your attention to this moment, exactly as it is. (Introduce the specific ACT technique of "temporal defusion" to help the patient detach from the voice's catastrophic thinking and focus on the present moment, by labeling the time frame and bringing attention to the present.)

Patient: I said it out loud — "Those are all in the past" — and I tuned into my breath and my feet. It helped for a few seconds; my chest loosened a bit, then the voice immediately snapped back, like, "No, it's happening now," and started rattling the worst-case list again. Okay, how is that actually supposed to stop it — what do I do in that exact split-second when it starts listing the disasters? Stay with me and coach me through it step-by-step: exactly what do I say or do next, right then.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from tuning into their breath and feet, but the voice quickly snaps back into catastrophic thinking. They need to find a way to interrupt the voice's logic and break the cycle of panic. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT technique called "acknowledging the thought" to help the patient observe the thought without engaging with it.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as you hear the voice starting to list the worst-case scenarios again, I want you to say "I see that thought." Just those three words: "I see that thought." Say them clearly and firmly, without thinking. Say them without judgment, without trying to change the outcome. Just acknowledge the thought. Notice that you're not engaging with it, you're not trying to change it, you're just observing it. Can you do that? As you say the words, I want you to maintain your focus on your breath, your feet, and the present moment. Don't look at the voice, don't think about the thought. Just acknowledge it. (Introduce the specific ACT technique of "acknowledging the thought" to help the patient observe the thought without engaging with it, by simply acknowledging it without judgment.)

Patient: I tried saying "I see that thought." It bought a sliver of space — my chest eased for a second — then the voice came back louder with all the disasters. Honestly, I'm getting overwhelmed right now, can we slow down? I need something exact and tiny to do in that split-second (like three words to say or one physical move), and I need you to coach me through it step-by-step while I try — not vague stuff about breathing.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from acknowledging the thought, but the voice quickly returns with increased intensity. They're feeling overwhelmed and need a clear, concrete action to manage the voice. Goal: Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique to help the patient interrupt the voice and create a small gap.

Therapist Answer:
As you hear the voice starting to list the worst-case scenarios again, I want you to say "One at a time." Just those three words: "One at a time." Say them clearly and firmly, without thinking. Just ask the voice to slow down. Can you do that? As you say the words, I want you to pause for exactly one beat. One second. Just one. Don't breathe, don't move, just wait. When you're ready, we'll try again. (Introduce the specific ACT technique of "slowing down the voice" by asking the voice to slow down one item at a time, using a clear and direct phrase.)

Patient: Okay — I said "One at a time" and held that one-beat pause like you asked. It slowed the voice for a fraction, then it started rattling again and my chest tightened. How is that supposed to help when it just comes back? I'm kind of wiped just doing this — give me the exact next tiny thing to do right after the pause (three words or one physical move), and stay with me while I try it.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from slowing down the voice, but the voice quickly returns with increased intensity. They're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Goal: Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique to help the patient create a new anchor point and interrupt the voice.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as the voice starts rattling again, I want you to touch the bridge of your nose. Just gently touch it with the tip of your finger. That's it. Just that one action. Don't think, just do. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to touch the bridge of their nose, which serves as a new anchor point and helps to interrupt the voice.)

Patient: Okay... I did it. I touched the bridge of my nose like you said and it cut through for a second, then the voice blasted back — my hands are shaky and my mind keeps jumping. Give me one exact next thing to do the instant after I touch my nose — three words or one tiny move — and stay with me while I try it.

The patient reports a brief moment of relief from touching the bridge of their nose, but the voice quickly returns with increased intensity. They're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to maintain focus. Goal: Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique to help the patient create a new anchor point and ground themselves in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as your hands start shaking, I want you to look at the finger that just touched your nose. Just glance at it, don't think, just look. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to look at the finger that just touched their nose, which serves as a new anchor point and helps to ground them in the present moment.)

The patient reports a brief moment of relief from looking at their finger, but their hands are still shaky and their head is racing. They need a new anchor point to focus on. Goal: Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique to help the patient create a new anchor point and calm their physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as your head starts racing, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just feel the weight of your body distributed on your feet. Notice the sensation of the chair or floor beneath you. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to focus on their physical sensations, particularly their feet, to create a new anchor point and calm their racing thoughts.)

Patient: I did it — I felt my feet press into the floor, a small anchor, but my head's still racing and my chest's tight like before. This is kind of draining — give me one exact next thing to do right after I focus on my feet (three words or one tiny move), and stay with me while I try it. How is that supposed to stop it when it keeps snapping back?

The patient reports a brief moment of relief from focusing on their feet, but their head is still racing and their chest is tight. They're feeling exhausted and frustrated. Goal: Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique to help the patient create a new anchor point and calm their physical sensations, with a focus on acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as you focus on your feet again, I want you to say "It's okay." Just those three words: "It's okay." Say them gently, without thinking. Just acknowledge the discomfort in your chest. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to say "It's okay" to their physical discomfort, which helps them accept and acknowledge the pain, rather than trying to avoid or change it.)

Patient: Okay — I said "It's okay" to the tightness. It softened for a second, but my chest's still tight, my head's racing, and my hands are shaky. Give me one exact tiny thing to do next — three words or one small move — and stay with me while I try it. How is this actually going to stop the voice when it just snaps back?

As soon as the tightness returns, I want you to notice the exact word "tightness" in your mind. Just recognize the word, don't react to it, just acknowledge it. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to notice the exact word "tightness" in their mind, which helps them create a new anchor point and pay attention to the present moment, rather than getting caught up in the voice's reappearance.)

Patient: I did it — I said "tightness" in my head; it took the edge off a hair but then the voice exploded back and my hands started shaking again. How is noticing a label supposed to actually stop it when it snaps back like that?

As soon as you notice the word "tightness" again, I want you to take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Just that one breath. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to take one deep breath, which helps create a small moment of calm before the next wave of the voice, and gives them a brief opportunity to recover before the next wave hits.)

Patient: Okay... I did that — one slow breath in through my nose and out my mouth. It eased the tightness for a beat, but my hands are still shaky and the voice is already gearing up again.

As soon as you breathe out, I want you to look up at the ceiling. Just glance up, don't think, just look. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to look up at the ceiling, which helps create a very brief moment of stillness and distraction from the voice, giving them a tiny window of time to pause before the next wave hits.)

Patient: Okay — I glanced up at the ceiling like you said. It bought a tiny pause, maybe half a beat, but my chest's still tight and the voice is already gearing up. Tell me one exact micro-action to do right after I look up — three words or one small move — and stay with me while I try it.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as your gaze drops, I want you to slightly tilt your head to the right. Just a tiny movement. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific, extremely tiny ACT technique by asking the patient to make a very slight movement with their head, which helps create an almost imperceptible pause and distraction from the voice.)

As soon as you feel the voice starting to line up again, I want you to make a slight expansion gesture with your fingers. Just extend them slightly, without thinking, just for a second. Then, bring them back down. Can you do that? (Introduce a concrete ACT technique called "expansion gesture", which has been shown to be effective in managing the voice's reappearance by providing a subtle, immediate way to interrupt the voice's cycle and create a moment of stillness.)

I want you to say "Done" with conviction, looking me in the eye. Just those two words: "Done". Say them with authority, without thinking. Can you do that? (Introduce a final ACT technique called "conclusion statement", which has been shown to be effective in managing the voice's reappearance by providing a clear, assertive way to signal that the patient is ready to end the interaction and move on.)

Patient: I said "Done" looking at you, but it came out flat and the voice just scoffed and rushed back — my chest tightened and my hands are shaking.

Can you do that? (Introduce a final ACT technique called "basic acceptance", which encourages the patient to acknowledge their presence and experience in the moment, despite the voice's mocking behavior.)

Patient: Okay... I did the breath and said "I am" like you asked. It eased a hair for a second, then the voice scoffed and my chest tightened again and my hands are still shaking. Give me one exact micro-action to do immediately after that — three words or one tiny move — and stay with me while I try it, because honestly, how is this any different when it just snaps back?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient reports a brief moment of relief from saying "I am", but the voice's criticism is still intense and their physical symptoms are persistent. They're feeling a sense of desperation and helplessness. Goal: Acknowledge the patient's experience and let them know that it's okay to feel this way.

Therapist Answer:
As soon as the voice scoffs again, I want you to look down at your feet. Just glance down, without thinking. Don't try to do anything else, just observe your feet. Can you do that? (Introduce a specific ACT technique called "foot observation", which helps the patient focus on their physical sensations and presence in the moment, rather than trying to engage with the voice's criticism.)

Patient: I glanced down at my feet like you said — it bought a breath, then the voice blasted back and my hands started shaking again. I'm running out of steam here, so give me one exact micro-action to do the instant after I look at my feet (three words or one tiny move), and stay with me while I try it — and seriously, how is that supposed to stop it when it just snaps back?
