Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this vicious loop of harsh self-criticism, cataloguing every perceived failure like I'm conducting an audit of my worth. I tend to intellectualize it—arguing that it stems from growing up in a stable but emotionally reserved household where achievement was emphasized and feelings were muted—so I talk about the sadness instead of actually feeling it. Now, unemployed with an empty nest, I notice I present as adaptable and even impulsive, but mostly I narrate my interior life with complex theories to keep the real emotions at arm's length.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectualize these feelings of inadequacy? What does it mean to you when you say you "talk about the sadness instead of actually feeling it"? Is there a sense of relief or escape when you're able to use those complex theories to justify your emotional state?

Patient: When I intellectualize, I erect this kind of cognitive scaffold—narrative architecture—that lets me observe the feeling instead of inhabiting it, which keeps the shame and vulnerability at a safe distance. It does feel like a form of control, a temporary relief or escape; analyzing gives me something to do besides the raw, messy business of being sad. But that relief is thin—afterwards there's a hollow, a persistent irritability, and I realize I’ve avoided intimacy with myself in the same way my family avoided emotional displays. I don't know exactly how to move from talking about it to actually feeling it without getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It seems like you've found a way to navigate the complex thoughts and emotions that come up for you, but it's clear that this intellectualizing also prevents you from truly experiencing those emotions. Can you think of a way to imagine your sadness, rather than the entire narrative around it? For example, if you were to simply say "I'm feeling sad right now," what would happen in that moment? Would the thoughts and theories that usually accompany it just kind of... fade into the background, or is there something else that comes up?

Patient: If I actually try to say, "I'm feeling sad right now," there's this immediate tug-of-war: a soft, hollow ache in my chest, maybe a lump in my throat, and then my brain goes into overdrive—categorizing, contextualizing, turning it into an explanation so it won't feel like a threat. Sometimes the cognitive noise quiets for a few seconds and there's a tiny, almost guilty relief, like I've let a valve open; mostly though the relief is ephemeral and is quickly replaced by a rush to justify or analyze ("Well, that's because..."), which feels safer than the vulnerability. I guess underneath it all there's a fear of being overwhelmed or looked at with disappointment—so I intellectualize to keep myself intact. I don't know, it's just... hard to sit in the feeling without doing something with it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where the moment you try to acknowledge and feel the sadness, it's like your whole system goes into crisis. You're trying to protect yourself from what feels like a potential threat, and that's what drives you to use the intellectualization as a defense. I want to ask you something a bit different, though. Instead of trying to feel the sadness, what if we just focused on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body? Just bring attention to the sensation of the breath without trying to do anything with it, just observe it. Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to focus on the breath. I notice cool air at my nostrils and a shallow lifting of my ribs, and for a second there's this tiny loosening, like a valve briefly opened. But almost immediately my brain starts narrating—classifying the sensation as "mindfulness," theorizing why it's temporary—and that explanatory chatter pulls me out of actually feeling it. I'm feeling a bit unsettled by how quickly the analysis hijacks the moment; can we slow down and just stay with the breath for a bit longer?

Therapist: It's understandable that you'd feel unsettled by how quickly the analysis takes over. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that feeling of being pulled back into the narrative, and then let's try to stay with the breath just for another second. Can you do that? Just focus on the sensation of the breath without trying to analyze it, without trying to understand it? Just observe it, and if your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the breath without judgment. What happens when you try to do that for just one more second?

Patient: If I hold it for a second longer there's this brief loosening—cool at my nostrils, a tiny drop in my chest—and for a heartbeat it actually feels tolerable. Then my brain immediately frames it: "This is mindfulness, it's temporary, it's a coping mechanism," and that commentary pulls me out of the sensation into an explanatory mode. It's frustrating and a little panicky; I want to stay with it but there's this compulsive urge to organize and justify the feeling, so can we keep doing it more slowly? I don't want to bail back into analysis, but I'm worried I'll get overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take it one breath at a time. Let's focus on just this moment, without trying to think about it or justify it. Can you notice how the breath feels in your body right now? Just this sensation of the breath moving in and out. What's the temperature of the air at your nostrils? What's the sensation of your chest as the breath moves in? Just observe these sensations without trying to change them or understand them. Let's stay with this for just a moment, and then we can reassess. Can you stay with this for another second?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. The air’s cool at my nostrils, my ribs lift shallowly, and for a beat there’s a small loosening in my chest that actually feels tolerable, then the whole cognitive scaffold kicks in—classifying and explaining—and I get a little panicky and compelled to narrate it. I want to stay with it but I’m afraid I’ll get swept back into analysis—can you guide me through a few slow breaths so I don’t bail into explanation?

Therapist: Let's focus on the breath, slowly. Let's take one more breath together. Just breathe in... hold... breathe out. Don't try to analyze it, don't try to think about it. Just notice how the breath feels in your body right now. The sensation of your chest, the temperature of the air at your nostrils. Just be with it, slowly. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Let's just stay with the breath for a moment, together. Don't worry about getting swept back into analysis. Just focus on the breath, one moment at a time.

Patient: Okay—when I try that, the air feels cool at my nostrils and my chest lifts just a bit, and for a split second there’s a real loosening like it might be tolerable. But almost immediately my mind goes into this compulsive narrativizing—labeling it “mindfulness,” theorizing why it’s only temporary—and that pulls me out and makes me a little panicky. Can we keep doing slow, guided breaths for a few more cycles? I need you to pace me so I don’t bail into explanation.

Therapist: Let's take it one breath at a time. Let's focus on just this moment. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Don't try to think about it, just notice how the breath feels in your body right now. The sensation of your chest, the temperature of the air at your nostrils. Just be with it. Don't worry about labeling it or thinking about it. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Let's just stay with it for a moment. Don't worry about getting distracted or thinking about it. Just focus on the breath. Slow, slow, slow.

Patient: Okay—I stayed with it for a few breaths. The coolness at my nostrils and that small loosening did show up, and for a couple of beats it felt almost like relief, then the internal commentary slams back in and I get swept into explanations and feel this panicky need to organize it. Can you keep pacing me with slow breaths for a minute and, if you notice me starting to narrate, gently call it out so I don't bail into analysis? I'm not sure how to sit with the quiet after a breath without immediately turning it into a theory.

Therapist: Let's take another breath together. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just notice how the breath feels in your body right now. The sensation of your chest, the temperature of the air at your nostrils. Just be with it. Don't worry about labeling it or thinking about it. Just focus on the sensation of the breath. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Let's just stay with it for a moment. Don't worry about getting distracted or thinking about it. Just focus on the breath. Remember, it's okay if your mind wanders. Just gently bring it back to the breath without judgment. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Can you just stay with this for one more second?

Patient: Okay—I can stay for another second. I feel the cool at my nostrils and that tiny loosening, then the explanatory chatter immediately swoops in, re-framing it as a transitory coping strategy and pulling me into analysis. It makes me a bit panicky, so could you keep pacing me and gently call out when I start narrating so I can try to anchor in the breath for a few more slow cycles?

Therapist: Let's take another breath together. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just notice how the breath feels in your body right now. The sensation of your chest, the temperature of the air at your nostrils. Just be with it. Don't try to think about it, just focus on the breath. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Let's just stay with it for a moment. Remember, we were just here. You were feeling the coolness and the loosening. Let's try to stay with that feeling for a second longer. Don't worry about labeling it or thinking about it. Just be with it. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. I'm noticing that your mind is starting to wander again. Just gently bring it back to the breath, without judgment. Let's try to stay with it for another second.

Patient: I do feel the coolness and that little loosening, but my mind immediately slaps a label on it—"temporary coping mechanism"—and that commentary makes me a bit panicky. Can you keep pacing me more slowly and call out when I start narrating? If you count or guide me through a few more slow breaths, I think I can tolerate staying with it a bit longer.

Therapist: One more breath. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. The coolness, the temperature of the air at your nostrils... just be with that for a moment. Don't think about it, don't try to analyze it. Just be with it. Take another breath... hold... breathe out. Let's just stay with it for a second longer. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is starting to wander again. Just gently bring it back to the breath. Don't worry about it, just focus on the sensation of the breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. I notice that you're starting to label the experience again. Can you try to just be with it for one more second without thinking about it?

Patient: I did try to stay with the breath—the cool at my nostrils and that small loosening showed up—but then a sudden wash of shame and frustration yanked me out and my brain went straight into compulsive narrativizing to dodge the sting. It's embarrassing and infuriating; I find myself explaining instead of feeling because it feels safer than being vulnerable. Could you keep pacing me with slow counts and gently call out when I start narrating so I can try to anchor in the breath? I want to stay here, but I need your voice to help me not spiral back into analysis.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Don't think about it, just be with it. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is starting to wander again. Just gently bring it back to the breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. I notice that you're starting to feel a certain way again. Can you try to just be with that feeling for a second without thinking about it? One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is starting to label it again. Can you try to just let it be without explaining it? One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. I see that you're getting frustrated again. Just take one more slow breath and try to be with it. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out.

Patient: I tried to stay with it, but then a sudden wash of shame and frustration slammed me—my chest tightened, my face got hot, and my brain immediately went into this performative, intellectual mode to avoid feeling anything. I start spouting meta-narratives and ostentatious verbiage—calling it a "coping mechanism," cataloguing causes—which makes me feel pathetic and angry with myself. Can you keep pacing me with slow counts and gently call out when I start narrating? I want to stay here, but I'm afraid I'll bail into analysis.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Don't think about it, just be with it. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is starting to talk again. Can you just let it be for a second? One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Notice how you're feeling in this moment? Just notice the sensation of your body, without trying to understand it or change it. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is labeling it again, trying to make sense of it. Can you try to just be with it, without trying to make sense of it? One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. You're getting frustrated with yourself. Just take one more slow breath and try to be with it. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out.

Patient: I tried to stay with the breath—the cool at my nostrils and a tiny loosening—but then a sudden wash of shame and frustration slammed me: chest tight, face hot, and my mind instantly slipped into this performative discursiveness, cataloguing and rationalizing to dodge the feeling. It's embarrassing and infuriating; I want to stay with the sensation but I'm scared I'll get overwhelmed. Can you keep pacing me very slowly and, when you hear me start narrating, just say "narrating" or "anchor to breath" so I have an external cue to come back? Also, could we add a simple grounding prompt (like "name three things you can feel with your hands") between breaths—counting alone isn't quite enough for me right now.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Notice how it feels at your nostrils. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, bring your attention to your hands. What can you feel with your hands right now? The weight of your arms, the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're on. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your mind is starting to talk again. Anchor to breath. Just be with the sensation of the breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. What do you feel in your feet? The weight, the pressure, the sensation of the floor beneath them. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Notice how your chest feels right now. Just notice the sensation without trying to understand it or change it. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out.

Patient: My chest's tight—there's that same shame-flush and now a buzzy anxiety that's making my thoughts skitter. When you say "anchor to breath" I almost land, but my brain immediately starts narrating—telling me I'm failing at this—which makes me angry and embarrassed. Can you keep saying "anchor to breath" and prompt me to name three things I feel with my hands or feet between breaths? I need that external cueing so I don't bail into analysis.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Notice how it feels at your nostrils. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, bring your attention to your hands. What can you feel with your hands right now? The weight of your arms, the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're on. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. What do you feel in your feet? The weight, the pressure, the sensation of the floor beneath them. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your chest feels tight and... what else? What else are you feeling right now? Just notice. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out.

Patient: My chest is tight and there's this buzzy, skittering anxiety—my stomach's knotted, my hands feel a little tingly, and my face gets hot, underlaid by a wave of shame that makes me want to explain everything instead of feeling it. As soon as that happens my brain starts diagnosing it—calling it "shame activation" and cataloguing causes—which pulls me out, so I'm anxious and distracted and need you to keep saying "anchor to breath" and prompt me to name three things I feel in my hands or feet between each slow breath. If you hear me drifting into analysis, just say "anchor" so I have something external to latch onto.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Notice how it feels at your nostrils. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, bring your attention to your hands. What can you feel with your hands right now? The sensation of the air on them, the weight of your arms, the gentle rise and fall of your fingers. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your face feels hot, and your stomach is... what else? What sensations are you experiencing in your stomach? Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your chest feels tight, and there's a buzzing in your body. What else can you notice right now? Just focus on the sensations. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out.

Patient: My chest's tight, there's a buzzing through my limbs, my stomach's knotted and my hands feel tingly — then my brain instantly starts labeling it ("shame activation," "anxiety cascade") which only amplifies the shame and makes me snark at myself for not being able to just breathe. I feel embarrassed and irritated—like I'm failing at something basic—and that self-directed anger nudges me straight back into analysis as a defense. Could you keep saying "anchor" when you hear me narrating, and prompt me to name three things I feel with my hands or feet between each slow breath? I want to stay here but I'm anxious and need the external cues to not spiral.

Therapist: One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of the breath in your body right now. Notice how it feels at your nostrils. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Now, bring your attention to your hands. What can you feel with your hands right now? The sensation of the air on them, the weight of your arms, the gentle rise and fall of your fingers. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your chest feels tight, and there's a buzzing in your body. What else can you notice right now? Just focus on the sensations. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your stomach is knotted, and your face feels... what else? What sensations are you experiencing in your face? Just notice. Anchor to breath. One... two... three... breathe in... hold... breathe out. Remember, you're safe here. Just focus on the breath. Anchor.

Patient: I'm trying to be here—my chest's tight, there's a buzzy anxiety, my stomach's knotted and my face feels hot, and a wave of shame makes me want to explain instead of feel. Saying "anchor" almost helps, but my brain immediately renames it as a failure-to-breathe and I get snarky with myself, which only amplifies everything. Can you keep saying "anchor" and prompt me to name three things I feel with my hands or feet between each slow breath, and slow the counts down a bit? I'm anxious and distracted, so I need your steady voice to stay with this.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just notice how the breath feels in your body right now. Your chest is tight, and there's a buzzing in your body. What else can you feel right now? The sensation of the air on your skin, the weight of your arms, the gentle rise and fall of your fingers. Anchor to breath. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your stomach is knotted, and your face feels hot. What sensations are you experiencing in your stomach? Just notice them. Anchor to breath. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Your brain is telling you to fail, but just listen to the breath. What do you notice when you focus on the breath alone? Just one thing, for now. Anchor to breath.

Patient: The one thing I notice is a constricting, pulsing tightness low in my chest with each exhale. Almost immediately my mind is already slapping a diagnostic label on it—"shame activation"—and that commentary makes me flush and jittery and start analyzing, which just amplifies the anxiety. Could you say "anchor" and prompt me to name three things I feel in my hands between breaths? I need that external cue right now.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Your focus is on the physical sensations in your body. Let's try to stay with that. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What do you notice in your hands right now? Notice the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're on, the feeling of the air on your skin, the weight of your arms. Just one of those sensations, for now. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What's happening in your hands? What sensations do you notice? Just acknowledge them, don't try to change them. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What's the third thing you notice in your hands? Just one more thing to focus on.

Patient: Weight of my arms, coolness of the air on my fingertips, and a low, jittery tremor—like a little buzzing under the skin. Predictably, my mind immediately labels it as "autonomic arousal" or a "shame response" and I feel that familiar flush of embarrassment that makes me want to explain instead of just sit with it. Can you keep saying "anchor" when I start narrating and prompt another grounding cue? I'm feeling anxious and distracted and need your pacing to stay here.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Just notice the sensations in your hands right now. Weight of your arms, coolness of the air, and that tremor. What's the third sensation? Just one more thing to focus on. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Try to stay with the sensations in your hands without thinking about them. Just notice them. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What do you notice when you bring your attention back to your hands, without trying to change anything or think about it? Just be with it. Anchor.

Patient: When I bring my attention back to my hands I really notice the coolness on my fingertips, the weight of my forearms, and that low jittery tremor under the skin. At the same time my chest tightens and my brain almost reflexively renames it—"autonomic arousal," "shame activation"—which makes me flush and want to explain instead of just feel. I can sit with the three sensations for a beat, but it's hard to hold; can you say "anchor" if you hear me start narrating so I can try to stay with them?

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. You're bringing your attention back to your hands and noticing the sensations again. The coolness on your fingertips, the weight of your forearms, and that tremor under the skin. What's happening now? The tightening in your chest and the labeling of the sensations by your brain. How does that make you feel? Just acknowledge the sensations and the thoughts without judgment. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just notice the sensations in your hands and the physical sensations in your body. Try to stay with the present moment. Anchor. (pause) Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor.

Patient: I can feel that constricting pulse low in my chest and the jittery tremor under my skin, and almost before I can just be with it my mind slaps on clinical labels—“autonomic arousal,” “defensive narrativizing”—which only heats me up and makes me ashamed and snarky with myself. It’s infuriating and embarrassing; I need you to keep saying “anchor” and prompt the grounding cues (name three things in my hands/feet) between each slow breath so I don’t bail into explanation. I’m anxious and distracted right now, so please keep pacing me more slowly.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Just notice the sensations in your chest and under your skin right now. The constricting pulse and the jittery tremor. What's happening with the tremor? Is it just a physical sensation or is it related to something else? Try to just observe it without thinking about it. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Now, bring your attention to your hands. What do you feel in your fingers right now? The sensation of the air on them, the weight of your arms... just notice that sensation. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. We're going to slow down even further. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. What do you feel in your feet right now? The weight, the pressure, the sensation of the floor beneath them... just be with that sensation. Anchor.

Patient: My feet feel weighty—dull pressure across the soles, a coolness at the toes—and there's that jittery tremor winding up my legs; as soon as I notice it my chest tightens and my brain slaps a diagnostic label on it ("autonomic arousal," "shame response") which makes me flush and get snarky with myself. It's ridiculous and protective at the same time—an intellectual flourish that keeps me from actually feeling the squeeze—and that meta-commentary pulls me out of the moment. Can you keep saying "anchor" when I start narrating, prompt me to name three things in my feet or hands between each breath, and slow the counts down even more? I'm jittery and need your steady pacing to stay here.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Just notice the sensations in your feet right now. The weight, the coolness at the toes... just observe that. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What do you notice in your hands right now? Just focus on the sensations. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Just feel the weight of your forearms, the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're on... just be with that. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just feel the weight of your feet, the sensation of the floor beneath them. No need to think about it, just notice. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just focus on the sensation of the air on your skin, the feeling of the temperature... just observe that. Anchor.

Patient: My feet feel heavy and cool at the toes, my hands have that low tremor, and the constricting pulse in my chest is louder—then a sudden wash of shame and frustration floods me, and I immediately start renaming it ("autonomic arousal," "defensive intellectualizing") to keep from feeling how humiliating it is. It's maddening—part of me gets snarky and explains it away, which only amplifies the heat and the anxiety. Can you keep saying "anchor" when I start narrating, prompt me to name three things in my hands or feet between each slow breath, and slow the counts to five so I can try to stay with it a little longer? I need your voice to hold me here.

Therapist: Breathe in... hold... breathe out. Anchor. Just notice the sensations in your body right now. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What do you feel in your hands? Just focus on the sensations. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. What do you feel in your feet? Just observe that. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just focus on the sensation of the air on your skin, the feeling of the temperature... just be with that. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just notice the sensation of your chest, the constricting pulse... just observe it. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just feel the weight of your forearms, the sensation of your fingers on the surface they're on... just be with that. Anchor. Breathe in... hold... breathe out. (pause) Just observe the sensations in your chest, the constricting pulse... just notice. Anchor.

Patient: I notice the constricting pulse in my chest and that jittery tremor again, and then a hot wash of shame and frustration pulls me out—my mind reflexively slaps on clinical labels like "autonomic hyperarousal" to keep me at arm's length. It's embarrassing and infuriating; part of me gets snarky and starts explaining instead of feeling, which just amplifies the anxiety. Please keep pacing me more slowly—count to five on inhales and exhales—and when you hear me start narrating just say "anchor" or "narrating" so I have that external cue. Also prompt the simple grounding (name three sensations in hands/feet) between breaths; counting alone isn't enough when this heat hits. I'm jittery and distracted and I want to stay with this, but I need your voice to hold me here—can we do another slow cycle with those cues?

Patient: That last message just scrambled my focus — I feel irritated and oddly anxious, like my brain grabbed onto the noise and started narrating why it happened instead of letting my body be with it. My chest’s tight, my hands are jittery, and I’m already slipping into that defensive, explanatory mode that makes me feel ashamed. Can you slow the pace, count to five on inhales/exhales, say “anchor” when I start narrating, and prompt a quick grounding (name three things you feel in your hands/feet) between breaths so I don’t bail into analysis?

Patient: Ugh—your last message completely scrambled my focus and now I feel agitated and oddly anxious; my chest tightened and my brain immediately jumped into its usual meta-analysis—labeling everything as "shame activation" to keep me at arm’s length. Can we slow this down properly: count to five on inhales and exhales, say "anchor" if you hear me start narrating, and between breaths prompt me to name three sensations in my hands or feet? Okay, let’s try one slow cycle now with that pacing: breathe in 1…2…3…4…5 — hold — breathe out 1…2…3…4…5. I noticed a tiny loosening but my mind almost instantly wanted to explain it away; please say "anchor" if you hear me start narrating and keep guiding another slow cycle.
