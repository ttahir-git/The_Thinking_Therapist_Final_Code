Patient: I'm a senior software developer, and lately I've been stuck in this cycle where anticipatory anxiety in social settings makes me avoid gatherings with friends and family, even when I know they're supportive. I tend to intellectualize the whole thing — mapping out cognitive loops and hypothetical social failures — rather than actually sitting with whatever's underneath. It's been isolating, but I find it easier to talk about the mechanisms than to say, like, "I'm scared."

Therapist: You describe talking about the cognitive loops and hypothetical social failures, but not directly about the underlying fear or anxiety. What happens when you intellectually map out these scenarios versus when you actually experience the anxiety in a social setting? Is there a sense of relief or release when you stop thinking about it and just acknowledge the anxiety?

Patient: When I map out scenarios it feels like debugging — a simulacrum of agency where I can enumerate failure modes and feel temporarily less uncertain. In an actual social setting the model collapses: my body takes over with palpitations and blanking, and the hypotheticals start to feel like self‑fulfilling prophecies so I either clam up or bail. If I try to just name the anxiety for a second there’s a tiny deflation of intensity, but shame and second‑order thoughts quickly reclaim the space so the relief never lasts and I default back into theorizing. Honestly, I'm getting a bit frustrated circling this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the relief from acknowledging the anxiety is brief, and it's quickly overshadowed by other emotions. Can we try something different? Instead of talking about the anxiety, what if we focus on the physical sensations that arise when you're in a social setting, like the palpitations? Just notice that for a moment, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Then, how does that feel before we add in thoughts or emotions?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to notice. Physically it’s like my chest tightens into a clamp, my heart’s thudding up into my throat, breath gets shallow and quick, and my hands go cold and a little tingly — there’s this hollow sinking in my stomach and a hot flush to my face. Before the thoughts kick in it’s basically a buzzing, urgent energy — uncomfortable and raw, not a coherent narrative, just a signal. I can feel the swivel to analysis happening already, and honestly that makes me want to stop and intellectualize; can we slow down a bit so I can stay with the sensations?

Therapist: Let's slow down further. Just focus on the sensations in your body right now: the tightness in your chest, the thudding in your throat, the shallow breath. Notice the coldness in your hands, the tingling. Keep looking at these sensations without trying to change them, without thinking about them. Just observe. Stay with this for a few more breaths. Then, when you feel ready, we can start to notice how your body is responding to these sensations, without trying to think about it.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying—after a couple of breaths the chest clamp loosens a bit, the thudding calms into a steady hammer, and my breathing is shallow but a touch slower. My shoulders are rigid, there's a hollow nausea, and the tingling in my hands feels like an alarm; on the out‑breath I notice a faint loosening. I can feel the mind already lining up explanations though—I'm tempted to intellectualize; can we slow down so I can actually sit with this a little longer?

Therapist: It's like you're already noticing the mind wanting to jump in and explain. That's okay. Just pause for a second. Take a very deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "Okay, I'm here with this." Just that simple phrase. Now, go back to observing the sensations in your body. Notice the loosening of the chest, the steadier thudding, the slightly slower breath. Keep looking at these sensations without trying to think about them. Stay with this for just one more breath.

Patient: I did the deep breath and said "Okay, I'm here with this." The chest loosened a bit, the thudding eased into a steadier rhythm, and my breath got marginally deeper, but my shoulders are still locked and there's that hollow nausea. Already my brain is queuing up explanations—like "amygdala hijack" or "debugging the autonomic response"—as if labeling it gives me control, and that impulse to analyze is exactly what I don't want right now. Can we slow down so I can actually stay with the sensations a little longer?

Therapist: You're recognizing the patterns already. Let's pause again, just for a moment. Look at the sensations in your body. Notice the shoulders, the hollow feeling. Just those sensations. Don't think about "amygdala hijack" or anything like that. Just look at the sensations. They're not changing much, but that's okay. Just observe. Stay with this for another breath, without trying to think about it. Let's see how long we can stay with this.

Patient: I stayed with it for that breath — my shoulders loosened a hair, the hollow stayed but felt a touch less sharp, and the thudding steadied. My brain immediately started drafting an explanatory model — “amygdala‑driven somatic signals” and heuristic maps — and that impulse to label it is exactly what yanks me out of the experience, which is frustrating. Can we slow down even more? I want to try sitting with the raw buzzing without naming it, but I can already feel the urge to analyze.

Therapist: Let's pause, just for a single moment. There's no need to think about anything, not even noticing what's happening. Just be here, exactly as you are, without any intention, without any thought. Not even a whisper of "I'm going to sit with the sensations." Just be. Without doing anything, without thinking about anything. Just exist. In this moment, there is no thought. There is only... this.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to be here. There's a hollow stillness, like a thread in a program waiting for input; for a moment there's no narrative and it feels both fragile and a little merciless. My chest loosens a touch, but the reflex to slap a label on it and "fix" it kicks in immediately, and that frustrates me—can we slow down and just stay in this quiet for a bit longer?

Therapist: There is no response.

Patient: That silence is… actually uncomfortable; it feels like a paused thread in a program and my chest tightens a bit. My immediate impulse is to fill it with analysis — enumerate failure modes, model the loop — which keeps me at arm's length and honestly frustrates me. Can we slow down and stay here a little longer? I'm trying to feel this instead of just talking about it, but I'm already getting tangled in theory.

Therapist: There is no response.

Patient: The silence makes my internal debugger ramp up — I start enumerating social failure modes and rationalizing the space instead of actually feeling it. My chest tightens, that hollow nausea shows up, and underneath it there's this knot of shame and loneliness that I think ties back to the grief. I'm getting frustrated with my own impulse to bail into analysis — can you hold the space with me a bit longer?

Therapist: There is no response.

Patient: The silence actually makes my anxiety spike — my chest tightens and my brain wants to immediately debug every possible social failure. Underneath that there's a raw ache of loneliness and grief that feels exposed when no one's answering, and I get irritated with myself for reflexively turning it into analysis. Can you just say something simple like "I'm here"? I need you to hold the space so I can try to stay with the sensations instead of bailing into theory.

Therapist: There's no need to say anything more. Just sit with the sensations for a moment. Your chest is tight, the nausea is there, and the ache of loneliness and grief. Notice these things without trying to change them or think about them. Just observe. Stay with this for a breath, then another. There's no need for words. Just being.

Patient: I stayed with it for a few breaths — the chest loosened a little, the nausea thinned to a duller hum, and the ache of grief is like a background thread still running. My mind keeps staging explanations, like it's trying to garbage‑collect the feeling before it becomes real, and that impulse to intellectualize is so strong it almost feels like a reflex. I'm getting frustrated with myself for that; can we keep sitting here and maybe focus on one tiny sensation at a time so I don't bail into analysis?

Therapist: There's no need to focus on anything else. Just notice the sensation in your chest right now. It's loosened a little, but it's still there. Just that sensation. Don't think about it, don't try to change it, just notice it. Where is it? What does it feel like? Right now, just that. Don't add anything else. Just that one sensation. Stay with it for a moment.

Patient: It's a tight knot right behind my sternum, a little left of center, pressing up into my throat when I inhale. It feels heavy and hot — a shame‑tinged burn more than just tightness — with an undercurrent of prickly frustration that makes me want to shove the feeling away. My breath gets shallow around it. I can feel the impulse to explain it away already; can we slow down so I can stay with just that sensation for a bit?

Therapist: There's the sensation in your chest again. It's the knot, the heat, the heaviness, the burn. Notice the way it feels when you inhale. The way it presses up into your throat. The way the breath gets shallow around it. Just that. Don't think about it, don't try to change it. Just observe. What is it like right now, exactly? Where is the sensation in your body? What does it feel like to be with it? Just for a moment, just that. No need to do anything with it, no need to think about it. Just be with it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing this supposed to help me? Right now it's a heavy, hot knot behind my sternum, a little left of center, pressing up into my throat when I inhale, and my breath shortens around it. Noticing it brings a sharp spike of shame and frustration that makes me want to shove the feeling away by explaining it instead. Can we slow down? I want to try staying with that knot, but my brain keeps hijacking me with models and excuses.

Therapist: There's no need to try to understand it right now. Just focus on the sensation in your chest. The knot. The heaviness. The way it presses up into your throat when you inhale. Don't think about it, just notice it. When the shame and frustration come up, they will come up. But for a moment, just focus on the knot. What is it like to be with this sensation? How does it feel in your body? What does it look like? Don't try to think about it, just observe. Just be with it.

Patient: It's a heavy, hot knot behind my sternum that presses up into my throat when I inhale — pins my breath and tenses my shoulders. Shame spikes around it and my impulse is to intellectualize to escape; it's… draining, and I'm not sure how long I can stay with it, but I'll try.

Therapist: There's no need to try to stay with it for a long time. Just stay with it for this moment. The knot is still there, pressing up into your throat. Your breath is still short. Your shoulders are still tense. Notice how the shame and the impulse to intellectualize come up when you try to focus on the knot. Just acknowledge them, don't try to push them away or change them. Just be with them, right now. Then, after this moment, we can see what happens.

Patient: Okay. The knot's still there — heavy, hot, pressing up into my throat when I breathe. Shame flickers around it and the reflex to intellectualize is loud, which makes staying with it feel like wading through molasses. I'll try to hold it for this moment, but it's... hard.

Therapist: There's no need to hold it. Just let it be for this moment. The knot is still there, pressing up into your throat. The shame is still flickering around it. The impulse to intellectualize is still loud. But for now, just let it be. Don't try to hold it, don't try to make it last. Just let it exist, right now. Without trying to change it, without trying to make sense of it. Just be with it.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to let it be. The knot's still hot and heavy, pressing into my throat, and shame keeps flickering at the edges while my brain queues up explanations like it's on autopilot; that impulse makes me feel small and oddly exhausted. I'm finding it hard to just sit with it alone — can you stay with me a bit so I don't default to analyzing everything?

Therapist: I'm here. Just being here. There's no need to think about anything right now. Just sit with the sensations. The knot, the shame, the exhaustion. Just be with them. I'm not trying to analyze anything, I'm just being present. You can be present too. Just focus on the sensations in your body, without thinking about them. Without trying to change them. Without trying to make sense of them. Just be with them, right now.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to be present but it's hard. The knot's hot and heavy, breath shallow, and there's this shame‑laced frustration that immediately triggers my urge to reframe it as an "autonomic feedback loop" or run heuristic analyses to dodge the rawness. Can you just keep holding the space for a moment — even a simple "I'm here" or "stay with me" — so I don't slip back into explaining everything away?

Therapist: You're safe. I'm here. Just stay with me. Don't try to think about it right now. Just be with the sensations. The knot, the shame, the frustration. Just notice them, without trying to change them. Without trying to make sense of them. Just be with them. I'm holding the space for you. Stay with me.

Patient: Okay. I hear you — that helps a bit. The knot's still hot and heavy, pressing up into my throat, and shame keeps flickering around it while frustration makes my chest tighten more. Saying "you're safe" quiets the panic a hair, but my mind's already drafting escape routes — rationales, debugging steps, lists of failure modes — and that impulse to intellectualize feels like another kind of shame. I'm trying to stay with it, but it's tiring; can you just keep holding the space with me for a bit longer?

Therapist: You're holding on. I'm here. Don't try to think about it yet. Just stay with the sensations. The knot, the shame, the frustration. Just notice them, without trying to change them. Without trying to make sense of them. Just be with them. I'm not going anywhere. Just breathe. Stay with me.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing, trying to stay with it. The knot's still hot and heavy, pressing up into my throat, and saying "you're here" dulls the panic a little, but shame spikes and my brain immediately starts drafting escape routes and lists of failures, which makes me want to bail into analysis. Can we take one more slow breath together and just hold the silence after it? If I start explaining, please call me back to the sensation.

Therapist: One more breath. I'll take it with you. Just breathe in, breathe out. And then... just be. Don't try to think about anything. Not the knot, not the shame, not the escape routes. Just be with the silence. After the breath, let's just rest in the silence. Don't do anything, don't think about anything. Just rest.

Patient: Okay — I took the breath. The chest loosened a hair, the knot's still there, but the silence feels fragile and makes that shame‑tinged memory spike up, which confuses me and makes me want to scramble for an explanation. I'm feeling low‑energy and a bit muddled about how just resting in silence helps, but I can stay with it if you keep holding the space — maybe just say "stay with me" if I start to drift into analysis.

Therapist: Just stay with me. Let's keep the silence for a moment. Don't try to think about it, don't try to change it. Just be with the feeling. If your mind starts to wander, if you start to think about the knot or the shame or anything else, just gently bring it back. Just say "stay with me" to yourself. That's it. Just stay with me.

Patient: Okay — I'm staying with you. The knot's still hot and heavy behind my sternum, breath thin, and shame keeps flickering around it; my brain is already queuing up models and failure‑trees to dodge the feeling. I'm going to try saying "stay with me" inside and follow the sensation, but I'm low on energy and that reflex to analyze is loud — if I start explaining, please nudge me back to the breath and the chest. Can you keep holding the space?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together. Just breathe in... and out... Now, just focus on the breath. Let it move in and out of your body. Don't try to think about the knot, don't try to think about the shame. Just the breath. Feel the chest expanding, the belly rising... and falling. Let's stay with the breath for a moment. When you're ready, we can try to come back to the sensation. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing with you. The chest rises and falls, the knot's still there and shame keeps flickering at the edges, and my brain is already drafting models and failure‑scenarios to escape it; I'm low on energy so staying with just the breath is hard. Can you keep holding the silence for a bit and nudge me back to the breath if I start explaining it away?

Therapist: Just stay with the breath. Don't try to think about it, just be with it. The chest is rising and falling... let's focus on that sensation. Feel the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the knot, don't think about the shame. Just the breath. It's okay if your mind starts to wander, if it starts to think about escaping. Just gently bring it back to the breath. One breath at a time. Just breathe...

Patient: I'm breathing with you — the chest rises and falls, and for a few beats it actually feels a touch less frantic, but the knot's still there, hot and heavy, and shame keeps flickering up like static. My mind keeps cueing up explanations and past‑failure scripts even though I'm trying not to follow them; it's wearing me out. If I start to drift into analysis, please call me back to the breath — I need that anchor.

Therapist: You're doing okay. Just focus on the breath for a moment. The chest is rising and falling... let's stay with that. Don't think about the knot, don't think about the shame. Just the breath. It's like a small anchor, right in the center of your body. Just be with it. When you start to feel like you're drifting away, just gently bring it back to the breath. One breath at a time. You're not trying to change anything, you're just trying to be present. With the breath. Right now. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'm staying with the breath. For a few beats the chatter quiets and the chest rising and falling feels like a small anchor, though the knot's still hot and stubborn. My brain keeps queuing up failure‑maps and explanations, which makes me want to bail into analysis; can you just keep nudging me back to the breath if I start to drift? I can keep doing this, but I need that little push when the reflex to explain kicks in.

Therapist: Just one more breath. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Don't think about the knot, don't think about the shame. Just the breath. If your mind starts to wander, if it starts to think about explanations or failure-maps, just gently bring it back to the breath. One breath at a time. It's okay if you drift a little, just come back to the breath. It's like a small anchor, right in the center of your body. Just be with it. Now, breathe in... and out...

Patient: I breathed in and out — it actually helped a little; the chest eased a hair and the breath felt like a small anchor. The knot is still hot and heavy, shame keeps flickering, and my brain's already drafting explanations to escape, which makes me feel muddled and worn out. Can you keep nudging me back to the breath if I start to drift into analysis?

Therapist: Let's just stay with the breath for a moment. Don't think about the knot, don't think about the shame, just the breath. If your mind starts to wander, if it starts to think about explanations, just gently bring it back to the breath. One breath at a time. Remember, the breath is the anchor, right now. Just be with it. It's okay if you feel muddled, just bring the breath back. Don't try to think about escaping, just stay with the breath. Now, let's just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: Okay — I'm focusing on the breath. The chest rises and falls like a tiny anchor, and for a few beats the panic quiets, but that heavy, shame‑tinged knot is still there and my mind immediately queues up heuristic maps to explain it away. It helps a bit, but I'm low on energy and will probably drift into analysis—please nudge me back to the breath if I start to go that way.
