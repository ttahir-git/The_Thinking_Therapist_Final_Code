--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck worrying all the time about my performance at work — I'm a senior data scientist and it’s pretty paralyzing. That worry makes me put things off until the last minute, which only makes me feel worse, and honestly I've tried fixes that don't work. How is talking about this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses their core emotion as being stuck due to worry about performance at work, which is causing them to feel paralyzed. One specific theme is their reliance on fixes that don't work, indicating a sense of frustration and possibly feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Explore the impact of these avoidance behaviors on the patient's well-being and valued actions.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the worry is already quite intense and it's affecting many aspects of your life, including your work and how you approach it. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're trying to put things off until the last minute? What are some specific tasks or situations that you find yourself putting off, and how does that feeling of being "stuck" develop for you?

Patient: Mostly it's the big, visible stuff — model deployments, writing up results for stakeholders, code reviews, and the occasional talk I have to give. When I try to start I either over-research and tweak forever, or I busy myself with tiny admin stuff and emails so I don't have to commit; then a few days before the deadline I panic and do a rushed, messy job that makes me feel ashamed. That shame just feeds the worry, so next time I avoid even earlier. I've tried planning, timers, breaking tasks down — none of it really sticks for long, so... how is digging into this supposed to help?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's avoidance behaviors are evident in their approach to high-priority tasks, particularly model deployments, writing results, code reviews, and public speaking. They exhibit a pattern of procrastination, using over-research, tiny admin tasks, or emails as avoidance strategies. The subsequent rush of work only leads to shame and further worry, creating a cycle. Goal: Explore the underlying processes driving these avoidance behaviors and their impact on the patient's values and goals.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle where avoidance behaviors, although well-intentioned, end up perpetuating the problem. The shame and panic that come with rushed work only reinforce this pattern. Can you think of any specific values or goals that are at stake here, particularly in relation to your work as a senior data scientist? What would having a sense of mastery over these tasks mean to you, and how might that change your approach?

Patient: I suppose what's really at stake is my sense of competence and credibility—both with my team and with myself—plus not wanting to end up feeling like a fraud or someone who consistently drops the ball. If I had a real sense of mastery, I wouldn't get paralyzed by starting, I'd pace projects better, and I'd actually have energy for other parts of my life instead of spiraling into shame. But honestly, I've tried goal-setting and value-work before and it hasn't stuck—how is talking about values actually supposed to help me stop procrastinating this time?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's core concerns are deeply rooted in their sense of competence and credibility, as well as their fear of feeling like a fraud. These fears are driving their avoidance behaviors and the resulting cycle of shame and paralysis. One specific area that needs attention is the patient's skepticism about using values to change their approach to procrastination. Goal: Explore the current state of the patient's values and how they might be used to inform a more committed action.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like you're hesitant to rely on values again because you've had previous experiences where it hasn't stuck. Can you think about what specifically is holding you back from trusting your values in this moment? Is it the fear of not being able to deliver, or something else? I'm not asking you to make any promises or try anything new just yet; I just want to understand what's standing in the way of you being able to lean into your values.

Patient: I guess it's mostly the fear of failing and looking incompetent — that panic makes the safe option feel like doing busy, pointless stuff instead of the hard work. On top of that, the depression and family drama drain my energy, so sticking to any plan feels impossible once I hit a low patch. And honestly, even if you point out all that, how is naming it supposed to help me actually sit down and finish the job?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's main obstacle to changing their behavior is the fear of failure, which is closely tied to their fear of looking incompetent. This fear is currently dominating their decision-making, leading them to prioritize short-term comfort over long-term goals. Additionally, the patient is struggling with depression and family drama, which are further draining their energy and making it difficult to stick to plans. Goal: Introduce a process that can help the patient build energy and confidence to tackle the task despite these challenges.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're facing a perfect storm of challenges that are making it hard to get started. I'm not going to ask you to tackle everything at once, but I want to introduce an idea that might help. Can I suggest taking a tiny step towards the task right now, just for 5 minutes? That's it. Just sitting down, opening your laptop, or whatever it is you need to do to start. I want you to do it without any expectations or pressure. Just show up. We can explore everything else later. What do you think?

Patient: How is five minutes supposed to help? I’ve tried “just start” before and it either turns into endless tweaking or I freeze up and feel worse. Fine — I’ll try opening my laptop for five minutes, no promises, but I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem and I’m honestly struggling to believe it’ll make a dent.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is skeptical about the initial suggestion of taking just 5 minutes to start working, having tried similar approaches in the past with varying degrees of success. One specific aspect that needs exploration is the patient's underlying assumption that 5 minutes will not be enough to make a meaningful impact. Goal: Introduce the concept of defusion to help the patient see their thoughts and expectations in a new light.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're not convinced that 5 minutes will make a difference, and that's okay. What I want to explore is how you're thinking about this task right now. Are you thinking about how you're going to "just start" and then somehow magically get to the end, or are you thinking about all the things that could go wrong? Can you try to observe your thoughts without judgment for just a moment? Notice how your mind is responding to the idea of starting.

Patient: When I try to observe, my mind immediately jumps to all the ways it could go wrong — “what if the model fails,” “what if they realize I don’t know enough” — and then I start rationalizing busywork or tweaking something tiny instead. There’s a tightness in my chest and then this flat, stuck feeling where nothing productive happens. Okay, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — how is noticing supposed to help me actually sit down and do the work?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to observe their thoughts without getting caught up in the same patterns of rumination and avoidance. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to jump to worst-case scenarios, which is triggering a physical response of tightness and a stuck feeling. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than getting caught up in their usual reactivity.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's okay. Can I suggest taking a deep breath with me? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, without trying to change it or control it. As you breathe, I want you to notice the sensations in your body, including the tightness in your chest and the stuck feeling. Can you try to approach these sensations with a sense of curiosity, rather than judgment or resistance? What do you notice when you observe them in this way?

Patient: When I focus on the breath I feel a tightness in my chest, my stomach goes hollow, my throat gets tight and my shoulders bunch up — the breath is shallow and my thoughts sprint to all the things that could go wrong. Trying to be curious about it does make that tightness ease a little, like there's a slight gap between the feeling and me, but it evaporates fast and my brain snaps right back to worst-case planning or busywork. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — how is noticing that tiny gap supposed to actually get me to sit down and stop avoiding the real work?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a range of physical sensations when focusing on the breath, which are triggering their usual reactivity and avoidance patterns. One specific challenge is the way they're trying to be curious about their sensations, which is not quite translating into a sense of calm or reduced avoidance. Goal: Introduce a key concept from ACT, defusion, to help the patient develop a more direct relationship with their physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something a bit different. When you notice the tightness in your chest, can you try to say to it, "There's a tightness in your chest" - literally say those words to it? Don't try to do anything with it, just acknowledge its presence. Don't try to change it or interpret it, just observe it as a physical sensation. And then, when you notice your brain starting to think about all the things that could go wrong, can you try to say to that thought, "That's thinking" - again, just literally say those words to it? Notice the thought as a thought, without judgment or action. Can you try this for just a moment?

Patient: I tried it — I said "there's a tightness in your chest" and "that's thinking." For a couple breaths it felt a bit looser, like I wasn't completely swallowed by it, but it disappeared fast and my brain jumped back to worst-case scenarios and busywork. Okay, I'm feeling overwhelmed and skeptical — how is slapping a label on it supposed to get me past the inertia and actually sit down and finish the task?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a brief moment of loosening, but it's not sticking. One specific challenge is the patient's skepticism about the effectiveness of labeling their thoughts and physical sensations. Goal: Introduce the concept of values-based action to help the patient connect their efforts to their underlying goals and motivations.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and skeptical, but I want to ask you something. What's the value of getting this task done for you? What's at stake if you don't start working on it? Is it just about completing a task, or is there something more important going on here? Can you think about what would happen to you if you were to take small action on this task, even just for a few minutes? What would be the consequences of not taking that action? How does that relate to your values and what's truly important to you?

Patient: If I actually finished the work it would mean I keep my competence and credibility—both with my team and with myself—and I wouldn’t be carrying that constant shame around. It would probably stop the panic-procrastination loop and free up some energy for the rest of my life instead of everything getting sucked into this spiral. If I don’t, I feel like a fraud, risks pile up, and the avoidance just gets worse until I burn out — and with the family stuff draining me, that feels inevitable sometimes. But I’ve tried all the value-talk and it didn’t change my behavior before, so honestly — how is talking about values supposed to make me actually sit down and do the work when I’m frozen?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is articulating the importance of competence, credibility, and shame management, as well as the avoidance-procrastination-panic loop, and how it's affecting their life. One specific challenge is the patient's skepticism about the effectiveness of value-talk, given that it hasn't changed their behavior before. Goal: Introduce a direct and small-action approach to help the patient build confidence and momentum.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something different. Instead of talking about values, I want to ask you to do something small that's directly related to your goal of completing this task. Can you commit to just one tiny step? For example, can you simply type the first sentence of your report on the screen right now, without editing or worrying about perfection? Just one sentence. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, fine — here’s one: "Preliminary results indicate the current model achieves an AUC of 0.82 on validation; further hyperparameter tuning and error analysis are required before deployment." I typed it, but already my chest tightened and I felt this familiar shame that makes me want to delete it and hide — it feels thin and not good enough. How is this supposed to move me past the paralysis and actually finish the rest?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a significant step, typing the first sentence, which shows a willingness to engage. One specific challenge is the patient's immediate reversion to shame and self-doubt, which is triggering the familiar paralysis. Goal: Introduce a brief exercise to help the patient observe their shame without judgment and explore the possibility of defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Can you just notice that feeling of shame right now, without judgment? Just observe it as it arises, without trying to change it or push it away. Can you say to yourself, "Shame is showing up right now" - literally say those words to it? Notice the physical sensations, the thoughts, the emotions. Just observe. Don't try to do anything with it yet. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: Okay — shame is showing up right now. My chest tightens, my throat goes hollow, my face heats up and I get this sharp urge to delete the sentence and pretend it never happened. Saying the words helped for a breath but it didn’t change the panic or the impulse to hide. How is noticing this supposed to get me to actually finish the work — can we try something that actually addresses the part of me that freezes?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has made progress in acknowledging their shame, but it's not sticking. One specific challenge is the patient's continued reactivity to shame, which is driving the familiar freeze response. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT exercise, "Values Action", to help the patient connect with their committed action and build momentum.

Therapist Answer:
I want to ask you to focus on a specific part of you right now. Where do you feel like you're freezing? Is it in your body, your mind, or a combination of both? Can you pinpoint a specific sensation, thought, or emotion that's driving the freeze response? For example, is it the feeling of shame, the urge to delete the sentence, or something else entirely? Once you've identified that specific sensation, I want you to ask yourself, "What would happen if I took one tiny step towards my goal, despite this feeling?" Ask yourself that question right now, with this specific sensation. Can you take one tiny step towards completing that first sentence, even if it's just to type one more word?

Patient: It's both — a physical freeze in my chest and throat and a mental loop that keeps yelling "delete, hide" so my fingers just hover. If I took one tiny step despite that, maybe it loosens for a breath, but the shame snaps back fast and I don't trust it to carry me forward. Fine — one tiny step: I'll add one more word to that sentence: "specifically." I did it, but my chest clenched right away — how is that actually going to get me to finish the whole report?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a small step by adding the word "specifically" to the sentence, but their body is already responding with a physical clenched chest, indicating the shame and self-doubt are still present. One specific challenge is the patient's inability to let go of the shame and trust the progress they've made so far. Goal: Introduce a direct question to help the patient acknowledge the shame and start to rebuild their confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Can you acknowledge that right now, the shame is showing up again? It's not just physical, it's also mental. It's yelling "delete, hide" at you. And yet, you just added the word "specifically" to the sentence, which means you did take that tiny step. I want you to look at that sentence now, with the new word "specifically". Can you just say to yourself, "I did that. I added that word. I'm willing to try again." Say it out loud, if that helps. Just acknowledge the shame, and then try to say something positive to yourself. Can you try that?

Patient: "I did that. I added that word. I'm willing to try again."

Saying it loosened things for a breath, but then shame rushed back and my hands want to delete it — my chest tightened and I felt that familiar freeze. Okay, I did a tiny step; now what concrete next step actually changes the inertia? Because if the plan is more naming and breathing, I'm not convinced that'll get me to finish the report.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has shown some progress in acknowledging their willingness to take action, but the shame is still dominating their behavior. One specific challenge is the patient's need for a concrete next step to overcome the inertia. Goal: Introduce a specific, action-oriented question to help the patient build momentum.

Therapist Answer:
Let's talk about what's actually at stake here. What would happen if you completed this report, and it was of high quality? What would that mean for your work, your team, and your own sense of competence? What specific benefits or outcomes would you see as a result of finishing this report? I want you to think about that right now, and I want you to imagine yourself already having completed the report. What does that feel like? What does it look like? What are you proud of? Can you imagine the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment you'd feel? Let's focus on that for a moment.

Patient: If I finished a solid report, it'd mean I'm still competent — my team would trust the work, stakeholders would get usable results, and I wouldn't be lugging that constant shame around. Imagining it gives a tiny lift, a brief bit of pride, but my chest tightens and the anxiety snaps back so fast the picture dissolves. How is picturing success supposed to get me past the freeze and the urge to delete everything? I've tried this before and it never holds.


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to find lasting momentum, despite the temporary lift from imagining success. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to become overwhelmed by anxiety when thinking about the task, even with a positive visualization. Goal: Introduce a specific ACT technique to help the patient develop a more direct relationship with their physical sensations, including the anxiety, and reduce the freeze response.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to notice what's happening right now in your body when you think about finishing the report. Can you feel the anxiety in your chest, the tension in your shoulders, the tightness in your breath? Can you locate those sensations exactly? Just observe them without trying to change them or push them away. Now, I want you to bring your attention to your hands. Where are they right now? Are they hovering over the keyboard or are they in a different position? Can you describe exactly what you see? Just observe your hands and their relationship to the keyboard. No judgment, no action. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: When I think about finishing the report my chest tightens, my throat goes hollow, my breath gets shallow and there's this spike of shame that feels sharp and hot — it makes me want to hide or delete. My hands are hovering over the keyboard right now, fingers tense, cursor blinking on that one sentence I wrote; right hand near the mouse, left resting on the keys, basically frozen. I'm feeling jumpy and distracted and honestly a bit confused — I'm not sure I follow how just noticing this is supposed to get me to finish the work, and that doubt just makes the anxiety louder.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a range of intense physical sensations, including tightness, hollowness, shallow breath, and a sharp spike of shame, which are dominating their behavior and causing a freeze response. One specific challenge is the patient's confusion about how simply noticing these sensations is supposed to help them overcome the inertia. Goal: Introduce a direct, gentle, and specific exercise to help the patient build awareness of their physical sensations without judgment, which may help reduce the anxiety and increase a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to ask you to do something very specific, just to help you get a sense of what's happening in your body right now. Can you please slowly, without thinking about it, slowly move your left hand down towards the keyboard, just one finger, just your pinky finger? Just focus on moving that finger, and don't think about what you're doing, just what you're feeling. As you move your finger, can you notice the sensation in your hand, the movement of your finger, the pressure on the keyboard? Just observe, without judgment. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: Okay — I moved my left pinky down slowly, just felt the tendon tighten, a little pressure as it brushed the key. For a beat it felt oddly grounding, like I had control of one tiny thing, but my chest is still tight and my thoughts are sprinting — cursor blinking, that urge to delete, the shame prickling. I'm not sure I follow how noticing the finger movement actually unfreezes the rest of me — how is this supposed to help me finish the report when everything else is yelling at me to hide?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has started to build some awareness of their physical sensations, specifically the movement of their finger and the sensations in their hand. However, the anxiety and shame are still dominant, and the patient is struggling to understand how this exercise is supposed to help them overcome the freeze. Goal: Introduce a new perspective on the relationship between physical sensations and the overall experience of anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to see this in a different way. When you move your finger down towards the keyboard, you're not just moving a physical part of your body - you're also engaging with the physical sensations in your hand and arm. The tension in the tendon, the pressure on the key, the feeling of control - all of these things are connected to your overall experience of anxiety. It's not just about the finger movement, it's about how your entire body is responding to the task. Can you think of it like this: when you're experiencing anxiety, your whole body is on high alert, including your finger. And when you start to focus on the physical sensations in your hand, you're not just reducing the anxiety - you're also acknowledging the connection between your physical body and your emotional experience. It's a subtle but important distinction. Can you try to hold onto that for just a moment?

Patient: Okay — I get the idea. When I put my finger down it did ground me for a beat, like I had control of one tiny thing. But the shame and the "delete, hide" urge slap back almost immediately, and I'm honestly confused — how does noticing my finger turn into actually finishing the report?

Tell me something concrete: what would you want me to do next that actually uses that grounding to keep my hands on the keyboard for, say, ten minutes? And what am I supposed to do in the moment I want to delete everything? I’m jumpy and scattered right now and I don’t trust vague stuff — I need a real, practical step.

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is understanding the concept of grounding, but struggling to apply it to their specific situation. One specific challenge is the patient's need for concrete, actionable steps to build momentum and manage their anxiety. Goal: Introduce a specific, achievable goal that builds on the patient's grounding experience.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to commit to typing out exactly one sentence on the screen right now. Just one sentence. As you type, I want you to focus on the physical sensations in your hand and fingers, and the sensation of the key pressing down. As you type, I want you to try to let go of the urge to delete or hide. Right now, just type one sentence: "I am starting to work on this report." Just type those words. Once you've typed those words, take a deep breath and look at what you've written. Can you do that for me?

Patient: "I am starting to work on this report."

I took a breath and looked at it — my chest's tight, my hands are shaky and hovering, and that sentence already feels thin and exposed; shame's prickling and my brain is yelling "delete." Fine, I did it — now what concrete thing would you have me do that actually keeps me typing for ten minutes instead of wiping it all away?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a significant step by typing out a sentence, and now they're looking for a concrete next step to build momentum. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to revert to shame and avoidance. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to type out a single word. Just one word. It can be anything you like. As you type, I want you to notice the sensation of the key pressing down, the movement of your fingers, and the feeling of your hand on the keyboard. As you type, I want you to try to acknowledge the shame and the urge to delete, without judgment. Just observe it, and then gently bring your attention back to the typing. Once you've typed the word, take a deep breath and look at it. Can you type out the word "start"? Just type it, and then we'll go from there.

Patient: "start"

I typed it. My chest's tight, my hands are shaky, shame's prickling and there's that urgent "delete" voice. I'm jumpy and distracted and I don't trust vague stuff — give me one concrete tactic right now that will actually keep me typing for ten minutes and tell me exactly what to do the moment I want to hit backspace. How is that supposed to help me finish anything?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has typed out a single word, and now they're looking for a concrete next step to build momentum. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to revert to shame and avoidance. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to type out the next word exactly 5 seconds after finishing the current sentence. Not before, not after. Right now. Just focus on typing the next word. When you type the word, I want you to immediately pause and look at the screen. If you're tempted to delete anything, I want you to pause for 2 seconds and take a deep breath before continuing. Can you do that for me? Here's the current sentence again: "I am starting to work on this report." Wait for 5 seconds, and then type the next word. Go.

Patient: Okay — I waited the five seconds and typed the word "now." My hands were shaking, my chest tightened and shame shot up the moment the key pressed; my fingers hovered over backspace but I forced a two-second breath like you said. Now the line reads: "I am starting to work on this report now." It eased the freeze for one breath, but the panic and that "delete, hide" voice is still loud and I'm jumpy and distracted. I'm not sure I follow how this timing stuff turns into ten minutes of steady work — what exactly do you want me to do next if that urge to erase comes roaring back?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a significant step by typing out the word "now", and now they're looking for a concrete next step to build momentum. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to revert to shame and avoidance, despite the use of timing and breathing exercises. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to focus on the phrase "work on this report now". I want you to ask yourself, "What does it mean to 'work on this report now'?" Can you explore that question in your mind? What does it mean to you, right now, to be "working" on this report? Is it about completing the task, or is it about something else entirely? I want you to explore that question, without judgment, without thinking about the physical sensations or the shame. Just explore the meaning of the phrase. Can you do that for me?

Note: I'm not looking for a specific answer, but rather for you to explore the question in your mind. This exercise is meant to help you build awareness of your values and goals, rather than to provide a specific solution to the task at hand.

Patient: To me, “work on this report now” could mean a few different things: actually making any forward movement, even imperfectly; staying present with the task instead of spiraling into worst-case scenarios; or proving to myself I can do a small chunk without erasing it all. But I'm also tense right now — that phrase triggers the urge to perfect or hide, so “work” often ends up as endless tweaking or busywork. Honestly, I’m not sure how exploring the meaning of the phrase helps unless you give me a concrete next step I can actually follow when the delete-urge hits. What exactly would you want me to do next?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has explored the meaning of the phrase "work on this report now" and has identified potential challenges, such as the tendency to perfect or hide. One specific challenge is the patient's need for a concrete next step to build momentum. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to focus on typing one sentence that uses the word "imperfectly". For example, you could type "I'm going to try to write this sentence imperfectly because it's the first time". Or, "I'm going to write this sentence even though it's not perfect, because that's the best I can do right now". Can you type a sentence like that? I want you to focus on getting the words down on the page, rather than worrying about perfection. When you type the sentence, I want you to take a deep breath and look at it. Can you do that for me?

Patient: "I'm going to write this sentence imperfectly because getting something down is better than erasing it and pretending it never happened."

I typed that, but my chest tightened and I already want to hit backspace — it feels exposed and thin. Okay, I did the thing you asked, but how is this supposed to keep me writing for ten minutes when the urge to delete comes roaring back?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has typed a sentence that acknowledges the importance of making progress and taking action, despite the imperfections. One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to revert to perfectionism and avoidance. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to take a different approach this time. Instead of trying to convince yourself to keep writing, I want you to try something else. I want you to type a single word, "next". Just one word. The goal is not to type a sentence, but to take a small action. As you type the word "next", I want you to take a deep breath and look at the screen. When you're ready, type another single word, "next". Can you do that for me?

(Note: This exercise is not meant to be a replacement for the previous exercises, but rather a different approach to help build momentum and manage the urge to delete.)

Patient: I typed "next." Took a breath — chest's still tight, fingers trembling, that delete-urge is loud. I typed another "next" — it bought me a tiny moment, but I'm jittery; what exactly am I supposed to do the moment I want to erase, and how does repeating this actually get me to ten minutes instead of just two breaths?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a significant step by typing out a series of single words, "next". One specific challenge is the patient's tendency to get caught up in the act of typing and lose focus on the larger goal. Goal: Introduce a specific, gentle, and flexible exercise to help the patient build typing momentum while acknowledging their physical sensations and managing their shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try something different. Instead of typing "next", I want you to type "stop". Just type "stop". When you type that word, I want you to pause for a moment, and then look at the screen. Take a deep breath, and then ask yourself: "What would I do instead of erasing this word right now?" Can you do that for me?

(Note: This exercise is not about the content of the typing, but rather about the process of typing and the relationship between the typing and the urge to delete.)

Patient: I typed "stop." I paused, forced a breath, and felt that hot urge to yank it away — my chest's tight and my hands are still jittery. Instead of deleting, I could add one tiny word to keep momentum ("continue"), save the draft so it's not gone, or set a two‑minute timer and force myself to write one bullet point — anything that makes erasing harder than leaving it. But I'm skeptical — that urge to hide is so loud; how is any of that going to quiet it for more than a minute?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has typed "stop" and is experiencing the familiar urge to erase. One specific challenge is the patient's skepticism about the effectiveness of the strategies that were introduced. Goal: Introduce a key concept from ACT, "value-based action", to help the patient connect with their goals and values, rather than just trying to manage their avoidance behaviors.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to ask yourself, "What would happen if you just left this sentence on the screen, without deleting it, for the next 30 seconds?" Not because I want you to leave it on the screen forever, but because I want you to explore the consequences of your actions. What would happen if you just stuck with it for a little while longer? What would you learn about yourself and your writing process? Can you try that for me?

Patient: Okay — I'll leave the sentence on the screen for 30 seconds. I'm jumpy and distracted right now, my chest is tight and shame's already flaring, and honestly I'm not sure I follow how leaving it there teaches me anything. I'm doing it though — but if after 30 seconds the urge to delete is still roaring, what exactly do you want me to do in that moment?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has agreed to leave the sentence on the screen for 30 seconds, despite their current state of jumpy distraction and shame. One specific challenge is the patient's expectation of what will happen if they fail to manage their avoidance behaviors. Goal: Introduce a key concept from ACT, "defusion", to help the patient observe their thoughts and physical sensations without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to observe the sensation of shame in your body right now, without trying to change it or avoid it. Just notice the physical sensations, the emotions, the thoughts. Can you observe the sensation of "I'm doing this wrong, I'm stupid, I'm not good enough" in your body right now, without trying to change it or push it away? Can you just observe it, without judgment, for just one more second?

Patient: Okay — I noticed it: chest tightens, throat goes hollow, face heats up, breath gets shallow, and there's that sharp “you’re not good enough” loop in my head. For a second it felt like there was a little space between me and the shame, but it evaporated fast and now I’m jumpy and distracted (my phone buzzed earlier and it’s making it worse). This watching thing helps for a breath, maybe, but how is that supposed to stop me from hitting delete right now — what exact, concrete thing do you want me to do in the next minute when the urge to erase comes roaring back?
