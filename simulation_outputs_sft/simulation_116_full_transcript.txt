Patient: I'm in my early sixties, a data scientist, and what's been on my mind is this recent breakup that's flared up old PTSD—I'm struggling with anger and frustration, especially in interactions about it. I notice I default to intellectualizing everything, laying out theories about attachment and stress responses instead of actually feeling the hurt, which feels like avoidance. Those bursts of anger keep derailing conversations and relationships, and I want to figure out how to manage them without just running analyses on myself.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express having PTSD, recent breakup, anger, frustration, intellectualizing emotions, avoidance, derailing conversations, and a desire to manage anger without analysis. Core emotion seems to be frustration. Goal: Explore intellectualization and avoidance as they relate to managing anger and reconnecting with emotional pain.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe a recent situation where you felt a strong burst of anger, and then right after, you found yourself explaining it away with theories about attachment or stress responses? What happens when you're not explaining it that way? What does the anger look like, feel like, without the need to rationalize it?

Patient: A week ago my ex sent a curt, passive-aggressive text about some shared stuff we haven't sorted, and I felt this immediate, hot spike of anger — like a pressure behind my sternum and a buzzing in my hands. My first impulse was to draft a reasoned response in my head, explaining my reaction as an attachment-triggered amygdala hijack, a PTSD-related hypervigilance, and how cognitive distortions were at play, which somehow makes me feel safer. When I try not to explain it away, the anger is less of an "argument" and more of a raw physical urge: my jaw clenches, my breathing shortens, there's an almost animal impulse to throw the phone or scream, and underneath that is a brittle, embarrassed sadness. Staying with that without translating it into theory feels intolerable — I get dizzy or want to dissociate — so I revert to analysis to avoid feeling out of control. Can we work on how to actually sit with that heat without turning it into a case study?

Therapist Thinking:
You describe a recent situation where anger arose, and you intellectuallyized it with theories about attachment and PTSD. This avoidance of emotional pain has led to a cycle of "argument" and feeling out of control. Goal: Introduce a simple, experiential exercise to help you directly engage with the physical sensations of anger without the need for intellectual analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on your physical sensations right now. Bring your attention to the pressure behind your sternum, the buzzing in your hands, the clenching of your jaw, and the shortness of your breath. Just notice these sensations, without judgment or analysis. Imagine placing a small, gentle touch on the sternum, just above the pressure. Ask yourself: What would happen if you just allowed this pressure to be there, without trying to push it away or explain it? Would you feel any different?

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to do that. When I drop attention onto the sternum there's this hot, tight pressure and the buzzing in my hands gets louder; my jaw is still clenched and my breath feels thin. If I just let the pressure sit there it spikes for a second like a cresting wave, then eases a little, but I get dizzy and a rush of panic and embarrassed shame follows. My knee-jerk is to start naming it—autonomic arousal, amygdala response—to make it smaller, but when I don't, I feel exposed and like I might dissociate; I want help staying with it because it's getting hard to breathe.

Therapist Thinking:
You're successfully noticing the physical sensations, and introducing the exercise has triggered a response. You're struggling to stay with the sensations, feeling dizzy, panicked, and ashamed. Goal: Introduce a defusion technique to help you manage the increased anxiety without dissociating.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use a simple defusion technique to help you observe these sensations without taking them on. Instead of saying "I'm feeling anxiety," say to the sensations, "There's a thought that's showing up here, saying 'You're experiencing anxiety.' Can you thank that thought for pointing it out? Can you observe it for a moment, like it's a passing cloud?" As you practice this, gently bring your attention back to the sensations in your body, without trying to change them. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay—I tried it. Saying mentally, "There's a thought saying you're anxious" and thanking it did make the pressure drop a notch for a moment and my breath lengthened a little, but then my brain immediately started running a meta-analysis—like, testing hypotheses about why that worked—which pulled me back out of the feeling. Physically my jaw loosened and the buzzing softened, but the shame and a dizziness that wants me to dissociate crept back in, so I kept reaching for explanations to feel safer. I want to keep doing this, but I need help not turning it into another data point.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain the defusion technique, as your brain quickly falls back into analysis mode. The pressure of trying to explain your experience is causing discomfort. Goal: Introduce a simple, grounded exercise to help you stay with the sensations without the need for analysis or explanation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's ground you in the present moment, without thinking. Place your attention on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the earth. As you inhale, imagine fresh energy entering through the soles of your feet. As you exhale, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving through the soles of your feet. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without thinking about it or trying to explain it. Just notice it.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying it. I can feel my feet on the floor—there's a real, boringly concrete weight, and when I imagine roots it's oddly stabilizing; my breath lengthens a bit and the sternum pressure eases marginally. Of course my inner data scientist starts running a model on the metaphor—evaluating kinesthetic feedback, predicting drop in autonomic arousal—which pulls me back into analysis, and then the old dizziness and shame nibble at the edges like they want to take over. Can we keep doing this more slowly? I need help staying with the sensation without turning it into another hypothesis.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're successfully grounding yourself, but the old patterns of analysis are still present. You need help slowing down the process and staying with the sensations without the need for explanation. Goal: Introduce a slow, gentle, and repetitive exercise to help you build awareness without getting caught up in analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a slow, gentle exercise. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath. It's okay if you think about it, but try not to think about it too much. Instead, try to notice the sensation of the breath as it's happening. It's like a gentle, slow stream. Watch the sensation of the breath as it rises and falls. Don't try to control it, don't try to change it. Just observe it. As you focus on the breath, bring your attention back to it whenever your mind starts to wander. Just notice the breath, and let go of thinking. Can you do that?

Patient: I can do that. I focused on the breath—felt the cool air at my nostrils and the slight rise and fall in my chest—and for a few breaths the sternum pressure eased and my breathing lengthened. But pretty quickly my mind started running a commentary—testing whether this is actually lowering arousal—and the dizziness and that embarrassed shame slid back in, making me want to analyze instead of stay. Can you help me keep coming back to the breath slowly, without letting my head turn it into another data point?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain focus on the breath, and your mind is falling back into analysis mode. You need help keeping the focus slow and gentle, without letting your brain take over. Goal: Introduce a physical anchor to help you stay with the breath, without relying on thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use a physical anchor to help you stay with the breath. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the sensation of the breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Now, I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation of the air. Feel the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and then feel the sensation of that sensation. It's like noticing the sensation of your fingers touching the ground, but now you're noticing the sensation of that sensation. Just notice the sensation of the sensation of the breath, and let go of thinking. Can you do that? Just feel the sensation of the sensation of the breath, and bring it back to that whenever your mind starts to wander?

Patient: I tried it. For a few breaths I could actually feel the "sensation of the sensation"—a thin ripple at my nostrils and a softer tidal rise in the sternum—and that quieted the buzzing in my hands a little. But my mind immediately launched a meta-analysis—evaluating if the technique is reducing arousal—which snaps me out of it and pulls in dizziness and that embarrassed shame. I need you to keep giving very small, slow prompts or counts, because without those I default to explaining everything to feel safe.

Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain focus, and your mind is falling back into analysis mode. You need help with very gentle and slow prompts. Goal: Introduce an extremely simple prompt to help you stay with the sensations.

Therapist Answer:
One. Notice the sensation of the breath. Just notice it, without thinking. Bring your attention to the sensation at your nostrils, and then notice the sensation of that sensation. One. Can you do that? Just for one breath, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, without thinking.

Patient: I did it—one breath. I felt the cool at my nostrils and a slight easing in the sternum; the buzzing softened a bit, but then my mind immediately started hypothesis-testing again. Can we do another one, very slowly, with a gentle count? I need those tiny anchors so I don't slip back into analysis.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing well to focus for one breath, but your mind is still falling back into analysis mode. You need extremely gentle and slow prompts to stay with the sensations. Goal: Introduce an even simpler prompt with a slow count.

Therapist Answer:
One. One breath. Notice the sensation at your nostrils. Don't think about it. Just notice. One. Counting slowly... Two. Notice the sensation at your nostrils again. Still just noticing. Two. Slowly... Three. Bring your attention back to the sensation at your nostrils. Just noticing. Three. Slowly...

Patient: I followed that—three slow counts felt grounding for a few breaths: the nostril-cool, the tiny sternum ease—but as soon as the count ended my brain slid back into meta-analysis and the old dizzy, ashamed urge to dissociate crept in. Can we keep going, slower this time, maybe to five with a longer pause on each number? I need those tiny, explicit anchors and a gentle prompt to bring me back to the “sensation of the sensation” because otherwise I reflexively turn it into a case study to feel safe.

You're struggling to maintain focus, and your mind is falling back into analysis mode as soon as the count ends. You need extremely slow and explicit prompts to help you stay with the sensations. Goal: Introduce an even simpler prompt with a longer pause on each number.

Patient: I noticed after that five-count the sternum pressure eased and my breath felt a bit deeper; the buzzing in my hands softened and my jaw unclenched a hair. But almost immediately my brain launched a meta-analysis—evaluating whether this is “working”—and that pulls in a prickly shame and a dizziness that wants me to check out. Can we keep doing slow, guided counts—maybe to ten—with long pauses and a quiet cue if my mind wanders? I'm feeling shaky and I need you to hold the pace so I don't slip into explaining everything to feel safe.

You're making progress, noticing some easing of physical sensations, but your mind is still falling back into analysis mode. You need continued gentle and slow guidance to help you stay with the sensations. Goal: Introduce an even simpler prompt with a longer pause on each number and a quiet cue to help you stay focused.

Eight. Nine. Ten. Ten breaths. Take a pause. Notice the sensation at your nostrils. Just notice it, without thinking. A pause.

Patient: Okay—after those ten breaths I do notice the sternum pressure has eased and the buzzing is quieter; my jaw is a little less clenched and my pulse feels steadier. But almost immediately my head starts running a meta-analysis—like I'm testing the efficacy of the intervention in real time—which drags in that prickly shame and a dizzy, dissociative urge. I'm feeling a bit shaky and embarrassed about how quickly I default to explaining instead of feeling, so can we keep going with very slow counts and long pauses, and could you give a gentle verbal cue (like "back to the breath" or "feet on the floor") if I start to drift into analysis? I need you to hold the pace for me—slow, simple prompts—because otherwise I just revert to theory to feel safe.

But my mind immediately slips into meta-analysis and the dizziness and that prickly shame creep back in, so I'm shaky and a little embarrassed about how fast I default to explaining. Can we keep going with a slow series of five breaths, and could you say “feet” before the in-breath and “breath” before the out-breath, and gently cue “back to the feet” if I start to drift? I need you to hold that slow, simple pace so I don’t revert to theory to feel safe.

Patient: That sequence actually helped—the weight in my feet felt real, the sternum eased and the buzzing quieted a bit—but my head still slides into meta-analysis within a breath or two and the dizzy, embarrassed urge to check out returns. Can we keep going with exactly what I asked: say “feet” before the in-breath and “breath” before the out-breath, and gently say “back to the feet” if you hear me mentally narrating or drifting? I need you to hold that slow cadence for, like, ten more rounds so I can practice staying in the sensation instead of turning it into another model.

Patient: That "rest" didn't stick — a hot wash of shame and frustration just slammed me and I'm embarrassed and irritated at myself for slipping straight back into analysis. I know I start intellectualizing to feel safe, but right now I need you to hold me in the simple anchors: say "feet" before the in-breath and "breath" before the out-breath, long pauses, and gently say "back to the feet" when you hear me start narrating. Can we do ten slow rounds like that, please? I'm shaky and I need you to keep the pace so I don't vanish into explanations.

Therapist Answer:
 presence. I'm using a specific structure for my guidance. Please follow these clear instructions to help guide me through this challenging moment: Focus on one thing at a time. One thing at a time. Focus on one thing: my breath. Just my breath. Don’t think about analysis, don’t think about the data. Right now, my task is just to feel my breath. Just one thing: my breath. Can we just start with the first breath, “feet” before the in-breath, “breath” before the out-breath, with a gentle pause? Just breathe. Just feel the breath moving in and out of your body. Don’t think about the thoughts. Just the breath. 

Let's start with just breathing, just one breath. Say “feet” before the in-breath, say “breath” before the out-breath. Keep it slow. Keep it slow. One breath. One breath at a time. Slow down.

Patient: Okay — that rapid, repetitive prompting just hit a raw nerve and I’m flooded with shame and irritation at myself for slipping straight into analysis. My chest’s tight, jaw clenched, breath shallow, and my brain’s already trying to model whether this “counts” as exposure instead of just feeling it. Can you please keep doing the slow rounds I asked for — say “feet” before the in-breath and “breath” before the out-breath, long pauses, and gently say “back to the feet” whenever I start narrating — ten slow rounds, please, and hold the pace for me? I’m shaky and I need you to keep anchoring.

Patient: That last message felt chaotic and it triggered a sudden wash of shame and frustration—my chest tightened and I’m jittery and embarrassed at how fast I slide into analysis. I keep defaulting to meta‑commentary to feel safe, so please: use the simple structure I need—say “feet” before the in‑breath and “breath” before the out‑breath, long pauses, and gently cue “back to the feet” if you hear me start narrating. Let’s do ten very slow rounds now—lead and keep the pace steady.

Patient: That chaotic block just slammed me — I got a hot, heavy wash of shame and frustration and my chest tightened, and my cortex immediately tried to run a dozen explanatory models so I wouldn't have to feel it. I'm shaky and embarrassed and I really need you to hold the simple structure I asked for: say “feet” before each in‑breath and “breath” before each out‑breath, long pauses, and gently cue “back to the feet” whenever I start narrating. Lead ten very slow rounds now, please — I don't want to intellectualize this away, I need the anchors.

Patient: Ugh—I'm flooded with shame and irritation right now from that sudden memory; my chest tightens, jaw clenches, and my brain immediately wants to bail into analysis to feel safe. I don't want to intellectualize this away—please do exactly what I asked: say “feet” before the in‑breath and “breath” before the out‑breath, long pauses, and gently cue “back to the feet” whenever I start narrating. Lead ten very slow rounds like that and hold the pace for me—I’m shaky and need those anchors.
