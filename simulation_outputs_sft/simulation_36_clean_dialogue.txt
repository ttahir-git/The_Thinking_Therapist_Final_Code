Patient: I've been pretty overwhelmed by sadness and a loss of motivation since a difficult breakup a few months ago. I'm a senior data scientist, and the low energy is starting to affect my work and my attempts to reconnect with people, which makes my social anxiety worse. I don't know, I guess I'm just not sure how to move forward.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you right now? How does this low energy and sadness affect your interactions with others, especially at work and when trying to reconnect with friends? For example, what's one recent situation that stood out to you as particularly challenging?

Patient: A typical day is pretty monotonous — I force myself through work, run analyses and review code, but I avoid meetings or speaking up because it feels exhausting and my chest gets tight. Socially I mostly send short messages or cancel plans; last week a small friend reunion was supposed to happen and I promised I'd go, then canceled an hour before because I couldn't handle the idea of running into people who know my ex, and afterward I just felt worse and more isolated. At work I missed contributing in a planning meeting and now I keep replaying that and worrying people think I'm flaky. I don't know, I guess it just feels like everything's harder and I can't get traction.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now, and it's impacting many areas of your life. I want to gently suggest something that might help: what if, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, we focus on just one tiny thing you can do differently today? Something that might feel ridiculously small, but could actually be a powerful starting point. For example, what if you committed to making just one phone call or sending one short message to someone today? Would that be something you could realistically do, and if so, how might that feel?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I could try sending one short message — maybe something like "Hey, been thinking of you, hope you're doing okay." But I already feel that tightness in my chest thinking about hitting send and then obsessing over their reply (or lack of one). Could we draft it together here first so it feels less scary?

Therapist: Let's take a step back for a second. I want you to notice how your mind is working right now, as you think about sending this message. Can you just acknowledge that thought, without judgment? It's okay to think "I'm anxious about this," or "I'm worried about their response." Just give it a brief moment, without trying to push it away or change it. Now, as you breathe out, let's start with just one word: "Hey." Just write that one word down, without thinking too much about it. We'll build from there.

Patient: I notice I'm anxious and my chest got tight thinking about it. I don't know, I guess here's the word: Hey.

Therapist: Great, let's build on that. You've written "Hey." Now, what's the next word? Perhaps something that's a bit more personal, but still relatively light. You could say something like "How's your week been?" or "How's work going?" Take your time, and just pick a word that feels natural. Remember, we're not trying to write a novel here; just a simple message. What's the next word?

Patient: I don't know, I guess "'how's'" — like "How's your week been?" My chest's still tight just thinking about actually sending it, though.

Therapist: Let's focus on your physical sensation right now. Can you notice where your chest is tight, and how it feels to breathe into that tightness? Imagine taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, allow that tightness to slightly relax. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you continue to breathe like this, let's try a tiny experiment: I want you to repeat after me, "I am sending this message." Just say it once, and then try to let it go.

Patient: I don't know, I guess... I am sending this message. Saying it made my chest loosen a tiny bit, but I'm still really anxious — can we draft the rest together before I actually send anything?

Therapist: Let's keep going. You've said "How's your week been?" Now, what's the next question or thought you'd like to express? Perhaps something like "How's work going?" or "I've been thinking about you a lot lately"? Take your time, and just pick a word or phrase that feels natural. We'll build on this together.

Also, I want to check in with you about the phrase "I've been thinking about you a lot lately." Can you tell me what that feels like to say that out loud? Is there any part of it that's triggering anxiety for you, or is it feeling more neutral?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the next bit could be something lighter like "Hope you're doing well" or "Would you like to grab coffee sometime?" 

Saying "I've been thinking about you a lot lately" feels really exposed — my chest tightens and I start worrying they'll read too much into it or not reply and then I'll spiral, so I'd rather keep it less intense. Can we try the lighter version and see how that sounds?

Therapist: It sounds like a good idea to simplify the message. Let's use "Hope you're doing well" or "Would you like to grab coffee sometime?" to keep it light and friendly. I'll suggest the next step. Here's the complete message:

"Hey, hope you're doing well. How's your week been? Would you like to grab coffee sometime?"

How does that sound? Do you feel like you can send this now, or would you like to make any further adjustments before sending it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it sounds okay, but my chest got tight just reading it. Could we shorten it to something like, "Hey — hope you're doing well. Want to grab coffee sometime? No pressure if not." That feels less exposing to me. Can we rehearse sending that and talk about when might be a less scary time to hit send?

Therapist: Let's rehearse sending the revised message. We can pretend that you're sending it to a specific person, someone you have a friendly relationship with. I'll play the role of the recipient. Go ahead and say the message, and I'll respond.

Also, let's talk about when might be a less anxious time to send. Considering the message you've drafted, it's possible that sending it now might not be the most strategic time. We could wait until a specific time or situation arises where it feels more natural to reach out. For example, maybe you could wait until you're already making plans to grab coffee with someone else, or until you're in a social setting where it's easier to initiate a conversation. What do you think?

Patient: Okay, I'll say it: "Hey — hope you're doing well. Want to grab coffee sometime? No pressure if not." Saying it out loud made my chest tighten, I don't know, I guess maybe a less scary time would be in the evening or after work tomorrow when I'm not at my desk. Can we also rehearse possible replies, including no response at all? I'm already imagining obsessing over it and I don't like that feeling.

Therapist: Let's rehearse some possible replies from the person you're reaching out to. Imagine I'm the recipient, and I'll respond in different ways. Go ahead and give me a moment.

(pause)

First, let's say I respond positively. I'll say something like, "Hey, that sounds great! I'd love to grab coffee sometime." How would you like to respond in that case?

Second, let's say I respond negatively. Maybe I say, "I'm actually pretty busy right now, but thanks for thinking of me." Or, "I'm not really into coffee, sorry." How would you like to respond in that case?

Third, let's say I don't respond at all. Maybe I just ignore the message or don't reply. How would you like to handle that situation?

Lastly, let's consider what to do if you're still anxious about not hearing back after a reasonable amount of time. We can explore some strategies for managing those feelings and moving forward.

As you rehearse, notice how you're feeling, and try to stay focused on the present moment. We're not trying to predict every possible outcome, but rather prepare you for various scenarios and help you develop a more flexible and adaptable mindset.

Patient: Okay — here’s what I think I’d actually say in each case, and how I’m feeling about it.

- Positive reply: I’d probably answer, “Great — that sounds good. When are you free?” Saying that makes my chest loosen a bit, I don’t know, I guess because it feels safe and clear.  
- Negative reply: I’d try to keep it short and not take it personally: “No worries, thanks for letting me know.” Even then I’d feel a knot, but I’d try to move on.  
- No response: I’d wait a few days. I don’t know, I guess I’d either send one gentle follow-up like “Hey, just checking in — no pressure,” or I might not send anything and try to distract myself. I keep imagining obsessing over it, so that’s hard.  
- If I’m anxious while waiting: I could set a rule like “I won’t check replies for X hours,” or do a breathing exercise and then go work on a tiny task so I don’t ruminate. I don’t know, I guess scheduling a short walk or making a calendar reminder helps a little.

Can we rehearse the positive reply now, with you as the recipient? My chest’s already tight just thinking about it, so I’d like to try it once more.

Therapist: Let's go through the positive reply. You've said, "Great — that sounds good. When are you free?" I'll play the role of the recipient, and we'll have a brief conversation.

I'll respond positively, and then we can go back and forth as you'd like.

"Hey, that sounds great! I'd love to grab coffee sometime. How about this weekend? Saturday afternoon works for me."

Now it's your turn. Please respond as you would in a real conversation.

(Note: I'll give you feedback on your response after you say it.)

Patient: Saturday afternoon works. I don't know, I guess 2 pm would be okay—does that work for you? My chest's already tight just typing this, so if that doesn't suit you, we can pick another time.

Therapist: Saturday afternoon works great for me, 2 pm sounds perfect. I'll make sure to clear my schedule then.

You're doing a great job so far, just one more question to help you feel more confident. How about we make it even more specific? Instead of saying "if that doesn't suit you," you could say something like, "If there's a different time that works better for you, just let me know and we can adjust." This can help you feel more in control of the conversation and reduce your anxiety. Want to try it?

(pause)

Also, take a deep breath and notice how your chest is feeling right now. Is it still tense, or has it relaxed a bit?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess that wording might make me feel a little more in control, and my chest is a tiny bit less tight but still there. Can we… I don't know, rehearse a really short follow-up I could send if I start obsessing tonight?

Therapist: I think we can start with something simple. Just a single sentence to check in and respond to the initial message. Can you try this: "Hey, just a quick update that I'm still planning to meet up on Saturday at 2 pm?"

Take a moment to say it out loud, and see how it feels. It's just a sentence, and you can always adjust it later if needed. The goal is to get you started with a short, confident message.

(Note: We can stop here if you'd like. I'm here to support you in whatever way feels helpful.)

Patient: "Hey, just a quick update that I'm still planning to meet up on Saturday at 2 pm."

Saying that out loud made my chest tighten again. I'm not sure I follow — how is saying that one line supposed to help with the obsessing? I don't know, I guess I could send it now, but I'm already picturing myself checking my phone every five minutes. Can we rehearse a super-short follow-up I could send if I start spiraling tonight? Maybe something like "All good — see you Saturday" or "Looking forward to it" — which one feels less… I don't know, needy?

Therapist: Let's try something even shorter. You've mentioned "All good — see you Saturday" and "Looking forward to it" as possibilities. Can you try just one of those? Let's say "All good — see you Saturday" for now. It's short, simple, and to the point.

Take a moment to say it out loud, and see how it feels. Remember, this is just a brief check-in. If you're feeling anxious, we can talk about it, but for now, let's focus on getting you started with a short, confident message.

(Note: This is the last exercise. We can stop here if you'd like. I'm here to support you in whatever way feels helpful.)

Patient: "All good — see you Saturday."

Saying that made my chest tighten again. I don't know, I guess "Looking forward to it" feels a bit less… I don't know, needy, but I'm already picturing myself checking my phone every five minutes. Can we rehearse a really short follow-up for if I start spiraling tonight — and maybe come up with a tiny rule I can stick to so I don't keep refreshing my messages?

Therapist: Let's try to break it down even further. Instead of sending a message right now, let's create a tiny rule to help you reduce checking behavior. Can you commit to not checking the messages for the next 30 minutes? Just take that much time to focus on something else, and then reassess.

As for the message itself, we've already tried "All good — see you Saturday" and "Looking forward to it". Let's try to combine those two ideas into something even shorter. Can you take a moment to say: "All good. Looking forward to Saturday"?

(Note: This is the final exercise. After this, we can review everything we've discussed and go from there. You've done a great job practicing your communication skills and managing your anxiety.)

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try not checking for 30 minutes — I'll set a timer now. "All good. Looking forward to Saturday." Saying that out loud made my chest loosen a bit, but I'm still on edge and my mind's already imagining the worst. Can we… I don't know, rehearse one more really short coping line I can use tonight if I start spiraling?

Therapist: Let's focus on creating a single, simple phrase that you can use to calm yourself down when you start to spiral. Can you take a moment to think about what you would say to yourself if you were already in a calm state? Something like, "It's okay," or "I've got this," or "It's just thoughts"?

Let's try to simplify it even further. Can you take a single word that resonates with you, something that feels calming or reassuring? Maybe it's something like "Breathe," or "Let go," or "Okay"? Take a moment to say it out loud, just once, and see how it feels.

(Note: This is a brief exercise, just to help you develop a simple coping phrase. We'll stop here and review everything later.)

(Suddenly) Ah, I think we're done for tonight. You've done a great job practicing and exploring different coping strategies. It's time to take a break and come back to this later.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'm not ready to stop — that felt kind of abrupt and my chest just tightened. Can we rehearse that coping phrase one more time? Maybe try "Breathe" and "It's okay" and see which lands less… I don't know, cheesy?

Therapist: Let's try combining the two phrases. Say it with me: "Breathe, it's okay." How does that feel? Try saying it out loud, a few times, and see if it feels more natural.

We can break it down even further if you need to. Maybe say "Breathe" first, and then pause, and then say "it's okay". Or maybe say "it's okay" first, and then pause, and then say "breathe". We can experiment with different rhythms and cadences to find what works best for you.

Remember, the goal is to create a phrase that feels calming and reassuring, and that you can use to calm yourself down when you start to feel anxious. We're not trying to create a perfect phrase, just something that works for you.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'll try saying it — "Breathe, it's okay." Saying it felt a little cheesy, but when I said "Breathe" first and paused, my chest loosened a tiny bit. Can we try it once more with a longer pause after "Breathe"? And… I don't know, could we also come up with one more ultra-short line I can use tonight if I start spiraling? I'm still kind of on edge.

Therapist: Let's try the revised version with a longer pause. Say it with me: "Breathe... okay." Try saying it with a bit more space between the two words, and see if that feels more calming. Remember, it's just a word, "okay". Try to let go of the need for a perfect phrase.

Now, let's work on an ultra-short line for emergency use. Can you think of a single word that might help you calm down quickly, just in case you start spiraling? Something like "Inhale", or "No", or "Let"? Take a moment to think about it, and then say it out loud, just once.

(Note: This is a very short exercise, just to help you create a quick coping phrase. We'll stop here if you'd like, or we can come back to it later.)

Patient: I tried "Breathe... okay" with the longer pause — I guess it loosened my chest a bit, but I'm still pretty on edge and my mind's jumping around. I don't know, for a single-word cue I'm torn between "Breathe" and "Now" — "Now" feels a little more grounding, but I'm not sure.

Can we rehearse me saying "Now" once and you giving a very quick grounding prompt after? Also, I'm already picturing myself refreshing my messages, so can we set one tiny rule I can actually stick to tonight — like "no checking for one hour, and if I want to check I must do one 5-minute walk first"? I'm kind of scattered, sorry… can you help me pick one word and one simple rule?

Therapist: Let's try the single-word cue "Now". Say it with me: "Now". Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just notice the feeling of your weight distributed evenly on both feet. That's it. Just observe that sensation for a moment.

Now, let's create a simple rule to help you avoid checking your messages. You mentioned "no checking for one hour, and if I want to check I must do one 5-minute walk first". I think this is a great rule. It's realistic, and it gives you a clear goal to work towards. Plus, the 5-minute walk is a great way to distract yourself and take a break from the screen.

Let's stick with this rule for tonight, and see how it goes. Remember, the goal is to create a small, manageable habit that you can build on over time. We'll review everything later, and see how you're doing.

(Note: We'll stop here for tonight. I'm proud of how far you've come, and I'm excited to see you continue to work on your skills.)

Patient: Now.

My feet feel kind of heavy on the floor, like I'm aware of the weight on both heels. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess I'll try the rule: no checking for one hour and if I want to check I have to do a five‑minute walk first. Can we rehearse what I'd say to myself when the urge hits, and maybe run through that walk step so it feels doable?

Therapist: Let's practice a verbal prompt to help you stay on track. Say to yourself: "It's okay to check my messages now. I need to take a 5-minute walk to clear my head."

Now, let's simulate a short walk. Take a few deep breaths, and imagine that you're walking slowly around the room. As you walk, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, just like we did earlier. Feel the weight of your body distributing evenly on both feet. Notice the movement of your legs, the rhythm of your breath. Just focus on the present moment, and the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Remember, the goal is to take a short break from the screen, and clear your mind. You can do this. Just one 5-minute walk, and then you can check your messages. You got this.

(Note: We'll keep practicing until you feel comfortable with the verbal prompt and the short walk. Then, we can start applying it in real-life situations.)

Patient: "It's okay to check my messages now. I need to take a 5‑minute walk to clear my head."

I took a few deep breaths and imagined walking slowly — felt my feet heavy on the floor, weight on my heels, breath a little steadier, and my chest loosened a tiny bit. I don't know, I guess I'm still worried I'll break the rule and grab my phone; can we rehearse you prompting me when the urge hits, like roleplay me reaching for my phone and you telling me to get up and walk? Also, can we come up with one very short line I can say during the walk to keep me grounded?

Therapist: Let's practice the roleplay. You're sitting comfortably, and you're about to pick up your phone to check a message. I'll interrupt you, and remind you to get up and take a 5-minute walk.

You're about to say something like, "Let me just check this one real quick." Before you do, I'll say: "Wait, wait, wait. Remember your rule. You need to take a 5-minute walk to clear your head before checking your messages."

Go ahead and respond as you would in a real situation. And let's also try to come up with a very short line you can say during the walk to keep you grounded. Maybe something like "Breathe" or "Now"?

(Note: I'll keep the scenario brief, just to simulate a real-life situation. We'll review everything later.)

Patient: Oh—right. I was literally about to reach for my phone. I don't know, I guess I’ll try to follow the rule and get up for the walk now. 

During the walk I'll say "Now" and focus on my feet hitting the floor. Can you prompt me once like you said—like catch me mid-reach—so I can practice actually getting up?

Therapist: Let's try it. You're sitting comfortably, and you're about to pick up your phone to check a message. I'll interrupt you just as your hand is about to reach for it. Say "Now" out loud, and take a deep breath in as you focus on your feet touching the floor. Just observe the sensation of your feet making contact with the ground.

You were just about to reach for your phone. Remember, you need to get up and take a 5-minute walk to clear your head. Focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor, and say "Now" out loud.

Patient: Now.

Okay — I'm getting up. My feet feel heavy on the floor, weight on my heels, and when I breathe out my chest loosens a little. I don't know, I guess I'll start walking and keep saying "Now" and focus on the feet; if the urge to check pops up can you call out the reminder sentence for me?

Therapist: As you continue walking, say "Now" out loud, and focus on the sensation of your feet making contact with the ground. Remember, take small steps, just a few feet at a time. Don't worry about where you're going, just focus on putting one foot in front of the other.

And if the urge to check your phone comes up, just remember: "It's okay to check my messages now. I need to take a 5-minute walk to clear my head."

Just keep walking, saying "Now" out loud, and focusing on your feet. You're doing great.

Patient: Okay — I'm walking now. Saying "Now" and feeling my feet hit the floor does loosen my chest a little, but my mind keeps darting to the message and I get this panicky urge to check. I don't know, I guess can you keep reminding me the rule if I slip — like say "Remember the walk" — and tell me how long I should keep doing this before I allow myself to check?

Therapist: As you walk, remember to stay present and focused on your feet. Say "Now" out loud, and feel the sensation of your feet making contact with the ground. If you find yourself getting distracted again, just remember: "Remember the walk". Take a few deep breaths, and refocus on the sensation of your feet on the floor.

Right now, just keep walking for a few more minutes. Try to stay focused on your feet and the present moment. Once you've walked for about 5 minutes, you can start thinking about checking your messages. But for now, just keep walking and stay present. Remember, the goal is to take a break from the screen and clear your mind. You got this.

Patient: I'm still walking and saying "Now" — my chest's a little looser but my mind keeps darting to the phone. I don't know, I guess I'd feel better if you actually said "Remember the walk" now and then, like a prompt when the urge hits. Can we set a clear rule: I wait the full 5 minutes (I'll set a timer) and only then can I check — and if I reach for my phone before that you call out the reminder? I'm worried I'll slip, so can we also rehearse a one‑line thing you say to snap me back, like "Remember the walk" or "Five more minutes"?

Therapist: Let's set a clear rule. From now on, you will wait the full 5 minutes before checking your messages. If you reach for your phone before that, I'll remind you to "Remember the walk". And if you slip again, I'll use a specific one-liner to snap you back: "Take it one step at a time".

Let's also rehearse the one-liner. Imagine it's happening again. You're about to reach for your phone, and I say: "Five more minutes." What do you do? Do you say something like, "Got it, I'll wait" or "Thanks for reminding me"? Just respond with whatever comes naturally.

(Note: We'll review everything later. For now, let's focus on getting you to wait the full 5 minutes.)

Patient: Got it — I’ll wait. I’ll set the timer for five minutes. I don’t know, I guess I’m still nervous I’ll slip and check, but I’ll try to say “Now” and get up for the walk if I feel the urge.

Therapist: That's exactly the right attitude. Remember, you've got this. You've set a clear goal, and you've got a plan in place to stay on track. It's okay to feel nervous, but don't let that nervousness control you. Just take it one step at a time.

When you feel the urge to check your phone, just take a deep breath in, and say "Now" out loud. Get up from your chair, and take a few steps away from the desk. Just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor. You're doing great.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to stick to the plan — set the timer, say “Now,” get up and do the five‑minute walk. I don’t know, I guess my chest’s still tight just thinking about it, so I’d appreciate you calling out “Remember the walk” if I start to reach for my phone. 

If I still feel obsessive after the five minutes, what do you suggest I do then? I don’t know, I guess I want something concrete to do next so I don’t just fall back into refreshing my messages.
