--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I started a demanding new program recently, and what's been on my mind is this constant worry about my performance—it's become this almost clinical-feeling rumination about competence and outcomes. Ironically, that worry pushes me into procrastination; I can pontificate about avoidance, self-handicapping, and executive-function overload, but I struggle to articulate what it actually feels like. I try to stay upbeat and social, but I'm easily distracted and it's starting to wear me down.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a complex emotional state, likely anhedonia and rumination, driven by worry about performance. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the emotional experience of performance-related rumination.

Therapist Answer:
What's the first thing that comes up when you're worrying about performance, like right now? Try to step back and notice the exact words, images, or physical sensations that show up without judgment. For example, what are you noticing about your body, breath, or thoughts?

Patient: I don't know, the first thing is this rehearsed internal monologue—like a performance script saying, "You won't be ready, you'll look incompetent"—and it comes with this tightness across my chest and a shallow, quick breath. Visually I get these rapid-fire scenarios—flubbing a presentation, blanking in a seminar—kind of like counterfactual simulations on loop, and my shoulders tense up and my stomach knots. It's easier for me to call it ruminative metacognition and autonomic arousal than to say whether I'm actually scared or just anxious, which is probably my avoidance strategy in action.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient effectively describes the internal monologue, physical sensations, and visual imagery associated with performance-related worry. They also acknowledge the avoidance strategy of labeling their emotions. Goal: Explore the avoidance and its impact.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine trying to make space for one of these worried scenarios, just for a moment, without judgment? It's like asking yourself, "What would it be like if you actually looked up from this script right now and simply noticed the tightness in your chest, the shallow breath, and the images flashing by without trying to change them or push them away?" Just an experiment, just for a beat, without needing to write down anything or achieve anything. How does that feel?

Patient: When I try, there's this immediate tightness across my chest and my breath clips—images of flubbing things just flicker by like a storyboard. My reflex is to intellectualize it—tagging it as 'autonomic arousal' and rapid counterfactual simulation—because that keeps me at arm's length, which is, honestly, a kind of numbness that's slightly panic-adjacent. I'm trying to stay with the sensation but I keep sliding into analysis instead; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient successfully conveys the struggle to make space for the physical sensations without judgment, and the tendency to intellectualize the experience. They also express a desire to slow down. Goal: Gradually build trust and create a more conducive environment for exploration.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down just a bit more, and try to create some more space for the sensations. Instead of asking yourself to "make space" or "experiment," let's try something even simpler: notice the sensation in your body right now, without trying to do anything with it. Just notice the tightness in your chest, the shallow breath, the images flickering by... Just observe. What is it like, right now, without any labels, without any thoughts about it, without any goals?

Patient: There's a tight band across my chest, my breaths are short and clipped, my stomach feels knotted, and images flash by like quick film frames. I already want to call it "anxiety" and run a mini case study about avoidance instead of sitting with it—can we slow down so I can try to actually stay with the sensations, even though I'm drifting into analysis?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the sensations in the moment, and their mind is drifting towards analysis. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental defusion technique to help them return to the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It's like trying to focus on a single frame in a movie, just for a moment. Can you try to notice just one of the images that's flashing by, without thinking about what it means or where it fits in the story? Just look at it, notice its edges, its colors, its texture... and then let it go. Don't try to hold onto it or analyze it. Just let it be there, in front of you, for a second. What happens when you do that?

Patient: One frame does stick — me at the front, lights too bright, my slides blurring, and everyone’s faces a smudge of muted colors. The edges feel grainy, there's a sharp twist in my stomach and my breath shortens; it's visceral and annoying in a way that analytics can't fix. Of course I immediately start narrating it as "performance anxiety" and "self-handicapping," which is my go-to protective move to keep some distance, but that's exactly what pulls me out of actually feeling it. Can we slow down so I can try to hold that one image without turning it into a mini case study?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has successfully identified a single image and is attempting to hold onto it without analyzing it. Goal: Maintain this fragile presence in the moment, without encouraging the patient to intellectualize it further.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the edges are grainy, the colors are muted, and there's a twist in your stomach. That's what's there, right now. Not "performance anxiety," not "self-handicapping." Just the image itself, without trying to make sense of it, without trying to change it. Just notice it, for a moment, without thinking. What's there, in front of you, right now?

Patient: Right now it's that grainy frame again: lights too bright, my slides smudged, people’s faces blurred into a smear — my chest tightens, breaths get short, and my stomach knots. It feels raw and constricting, like pressure behind my sternum and a looping thought that I'm already failing. I can feel the reflex to intellectualize it into "performance anxiety" to keep distance—can we slow down so I can try to stay with this without turning it into a theory?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has regained the image, and their mind is again trying to intellectualize it. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and grounding defusion technique to help them stay with the physical sensations without getting caught up in thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
The sensation of the grainy frame is still there. It's not the thinking, it's not the words. It's just the sensation of the grainy frame. Imagine that sensation as a drop of water. Now, imagine placing that drop of water on the surface of a pond. What happens to the drop? It forms a tiny ripple. Just like that ripple, let the grainy sensation form a tiny ripple in your body. Don't try to do anything with it, just let it ripple. Where does it start to ripple?

Patient: It starts right behind my sternum—a little tight knot where the drop lands—and that’s where the ripple first forms. Then it moves up into my throat and jaw and makes my breathing even shallower, and it trickles down into my stomach and sometimes into my lower back; my fingers get a faint fizz. Of course I immediately want to call it an "autonomic cascade" and map out the cognitive loops, but honestly, can we slow down so I can try to actually feel that ripple instead of just describing it?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is attempting to track the ripple in their body, but their mind is again trying to intellectualize it. Goal: Introduce a brief period of non-tracking, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without analyzing it.

Therapist Answer:
(Silence)

Note: There is no response, no question, no attempt to analyze or guide the patient. The therapist simply sits in silence, allowing the patient to continue tracking the ripple without judgment or instruction.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to keep tracking that ripple in the silence: there's a hot, tight pressure right behind my sternum that moves up into my throat and makes my breath shallow. My reflex is to slap a label on it—"autonomic cascade," "avoidance loop"—which is exactly the distance-maintaining move, but if I drop the jargon there's a small hollow under my ribs and a sticky, anticipatory dread. I'm sliding into analysis and it's frustrating; can we slow down so I can try to stay with the sensation for another beat?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the intellectualization, but is struggling to stay with the sensation. Goal: Introduce a brief defusion to help the patient reorient to the physical sensation, without labeling or analyzing.

Therapist Answer:
Just a slight pause, a single pause. No thoughts, no words. Just the pause. Right now. Don't think about it, don't do anything. Just the pause.

Patient: There's a very small blank between breaths — a soft slackening behind my sternum and a hush where the images usually flicker. For a split second it feels lighter, then my mind immediately wants to label it "relief" or spin it into a case study about avoidance. I keep feeling the urge to fill the silence with explanation; can we try holding the pause a bit longer? I'm having trouble staying with it without analyzing.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the urge to analyze and label, but is struggling to stay with the pause. Goal: Introduce a gradual extension of the pause, allowing the patient to build a sense of timelessness and reduce the need for analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Silence for 5-7 breaths)

Note: The therapist continues to sit in silence, allowing the patient to hold the pause for an extended period. The goal is to create a sense of timelessness, allowing the patient to drop their need for analysis and simply be present with the sensation.

Patient: Holding the pause a bit longer, I actually notice the tightness soften—like the pressure behind my sternum loosens and my breaths get a touch deeper—then a wave of heat rises into my face for a second. There's this small, annoying voice that whispers, "See? You relaxed; maybe you're not as fragile as you thought," and another that counters, "No, this won't last, you're still going to mess up," and of course I immediately want to run them through a taxonomy of cognitive distortions. Can we keep it quiet for a bit so I can try to sit with the change—I keep wanting to narrate it away, and that's frustrating.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the conflicting voices and the urge to analyze them. Goal: Introduce a brief defusion to help the patient reorient to the physical sensation, rather than getting caught up in the mental narrative.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly) It's okay if the voices come. It's okay if you want to run them through a taxonomy. Just notice the voices, for a moment, without doing anything with them. Just the voices. What happens when you let them be there, without trying to change them or analyze them?

Patient: They sit like two commentators in my head—one saying, "See, you relaxed," and the other countering, "This won't last, you'll screw up"—and they hum there without stopping. Physically it's a low buzzing behind my sternum, a heat in my face, and my breath wants to shorten; emotionally it actually feels exposed and small, which I immediately want to intellectualize. I'm already sliding into analysis—can we slow down and sit with the embarrassment for a moment without turning it into a case study?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the intellectualization and the urge to analyze their emotions. Goal: Introduce a brief period of acceptance and acknowledgment of the emotional experience, rather than trying to label or intellectualize it.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly) It's okay to feel embarrassed. It's okay to feel small. It's okay to feel exposed. Just notice those feelings, right now, without trying to change them or analyze them. Just be with the embarrassment, the smallness, the exposure. What happens when you acknowledge them, without judgment, without trying to fix them or understand them?

Patient: When I try to just acknowledge the embarrassment it hits as a hot flush in my face and a sinking knot under my ribs—there's this immediate, corrosive shame that makes me want to shrink away. My reflex is to taxonomize it as "heightened social self-consciousness" or trace its etiological roots, but beneath that clinical framing there's a sharp, angry frustration at myself for feeling so small. I'm trying to sit with it, but I'm already narrating and deflecting—can we slow the pace so I can actually stay with the feeling for a bit?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the deflection and the struggle to stay with the feeling. Goal: Introduce a pause, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation of the flush, the knot, and the shame without the need for analysis or narration.

Therapist Answer:
(Pause. No questions. No guidance.)

(Note: The therapist sits in silence, allowing the patient to continue experiencing the physical sensations without judgment or distraction. The goal is to create a space for the patient to focus on the present moment, without the influence of analysis or narration.)

Patient: That shame tightens my chest and makes my face hot; there's a sinking hollow under my ribs and a prickly agitation in my hands that feels both humiliating and infuriating. My default move is to annotate it—"heightened social self-consciousness," "metacognitive avoidance"—but that just distances me and makes the sting worse. Can we stay quiet for a few more breaths? I'm trying to sit with it but keep sliding into analysis, and that feels maddening.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the struggle to stay with the feeling and the frustration with their own deflection. Goal: Introduce a brief period of defusion, allowing the patient to focus on the physical sensations without the need for analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Silence for 10-15 breaths)

(Note: The therapist maintains complete silence, allowing the patient to focus on their internal experience without any external influence or guidance.)

Patient: My chest clenches into a tight knot, my face flushes hot, and a sudden flash of shame and frustration wells up—it's sharp and corrosive and makes me want to shrink away. My reflex is to reframe it as "metacognitive avoidance" or some elegant theory to keep distance, but underneath that jargon is real, raw humiliation and quiet anger at myself. I keep wanting to explain or distract—can we stay in the silence a bit longer so I can try not to bolt into analysis?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the urge to analyze and the struggle to stay with the feeling. Goal: Introduce a brief period of acceptance, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without judgment or distraction.

Therapist Answer:
(No response. No guidance. No questions.)

(Note: The therapist continues to sit in silence, allowing the patient to continue experiencing the physical sensations without judgment or distraction. The goal is to create a space for the patient to focus on the present moment, without the influence of analysis or narration.)

Patient: My chest's still knotted and my face heats up into this acute shame that makes me want to shrink—then I get furious at myself for even feeling small. All I want to do is reframe it as "metacognitive avoidance" because that keeps me safe, but underneath that jargon it's just raw humiliation and a bubbling, helpless frustration that feeds into the whole performance-worry/procrastination loop. I'm trying to stay with it, but I keep slipping into analysis—can we slow the pace a bit so I can actually sit with the feeling instead of explaining it away?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the struggle to stay with the feeling and the frustration with their own deflection. Goal: Gradually slow the pace, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without the need for analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly) Take one more breath. Not two, just one. Just breathe.

Patient: Okay — I take one breath. It loosens the knot behind my sternum a fraction and my inhalation actually stretches a touch deeper, but almost immediately a hot, corrosive shame spikes and I feel this flush in my face and a prickly anger at myself. My reflex is to intellectualize it into a tidy concept—"performance-related metacognition"—but beneath that is just raw humiliation and frustration. Can we sit in quiet for a few more breaths? I'm trying not to turn it into an analysis, and it's harder than I thought.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the struggle to stay with the feeling and the frustration with their own deflection. Goal: Continue to slow the pace, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without the need for analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Complete silence)

(Note: The therapist maintains complete silence, allowing the patient to focus on their internal experience without any external influence or guidance. The goal is to create a space for the patient to simply be with their feelings, without judgment or distraction.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is the silence supposed to help? It just makes me more aware of that hot flush and the hollow under my ribs, and I'm confused because my instinct is to look for a concept or a next step. I keep wanting a prompt or a word to anchor me; can we have a tiny bit of guidance so I don't automatically retreat into analysis?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the silence and seeking guidance. Goal: Introduce a minimal amount of guidance to help the patient stay with the sensation without retreating into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Soft whisper) Notice the sensation right now. Don't think about it, just notice. Where does it sit in your body? What's its texture?

Patient: It's a tight, hot band right behind my sternum that feels almost grainy and viscous, like someone pressed a smooth pebble into my chest; it creeps up into my throat and makes my breath shallow, and there's a prickly fizz in my fingers. I want to call it "autonomic constriction" or map its pathways, but that's my reflex to avoid the rawness, so I'm trying to just notice the physical texture instead of naming it. Can we stay quiet for a moment so I can actually sit with that tightness without explaining it away?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is successfully focusing on the physical sensation, attempting to avoid analysis. Goal: Allow the patient to maintain this focus, exploring the sensation further if desired.

Therapist Answer:
(Slight pause, no further guidance)

(Note: The therapist maintains silence, allowing the patient to continue exploring the sensation of the tightness behind their sternum. The goal is to create a space for the patient to discover and understand the sensation on their own terms, without the influence of analysis or labeling.)

Patient: That tight, pebble-like pressure behind my sternum is back—hot, viscous, prickly down to my fingers—and with it this rush of shame and a sharp, irritated frustration that feels like being folded in on myself. My reflex is to rename it—"performance-based hypervigilance," "metacognitive loop"—which is my safety valve, but underneath that jargon it's just burning humiliation and anger at myself. I'm stuck oscillating between explaining and shrinking; can we stay quiet for a few more breaths so I can try to sit with the sting instead of immediately turning it into a case study?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the oscillation between explanation and shrinking, seeking a way to sit with the sensation. Goal: Introduce a subtle shift in focus, encouraging the patient to explore the sensation further, without immediately retreating into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Slowly) What's the sensation like right now, just beneath the surface of your awareness? Is it changing at all?

Patient: It's that hot, pebble-like pressure behind my sternum—just under conscious awareness it's a low, prickly hum that rises into heat and a hollow under my ribs; when I slow my breath it thins out a bit, but any interpretive thought makes it spike into sharp, shame-laced tightness. There's also this irritable anger threaded through it, like I'm frustrated at myself for feeling small, which immediately tempts me to reframe it as "performance-related hypervigilance" to get distance. Can we slow down a notch so I can try to notice the subtle shifts without defaulting to analysis?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the complex interplay between the physical sensation and their tendency to analyze it. Goal: Introduce a minimal slowing of the pace, allowing the patient to focus on the subtlest changes in the sensation, without relying on interpretation.

Therapist Answer:
( Gentle pause) Just the sensation. What's the sensation right now, without thinking? Just notice.

Patient: It's that hot, pebble‑like pressure behind my sternum—a prickly, humming tightness that creeps into my throat, makes my breaths shallow, and sends a fizz down into my fingers. I want to name it—"autonomic constriction"—because naming it keeps me at arm's length, and that urge to intellectualize is actually maddening and shame‑tinged. Can we stay quiet a bit so I can try to feel it without explaining it away?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to avoid analysis, and the urge to name the sensation is causing more shame and discomfort. Goal: Introduce a brief period of silence, allowing the patient to focus on the physical sensation without the need for interpretation or labeling.

Therapist Answer:
(Complete silence)

(Note: The therapist maintains complete silence, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation of the hot, pebble-like pressure behind their sternum. The goal is to create a space for the patient to simply be with the sensation, without judgment or distraction.)

Patient: The silence is making that hot, pebble‑like pressure behind my sternum more insistent — my breath stays clipped and my face heats up, and there's this sharp, corrosive shame threaded with a prickly anger at myself. My knee‑jerk is to intellectualize it into a tidy theory to keep distance, but right now that feels like a dodge and just ramps the frustration. Can we stay quiet but maybe use a tiny anchor — a single soft word or a breath cue every few moments? I keep needing something to stop me from slipping back into analysis.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the effectiveness of silence in intensifying the physical sensation, but is also seeking a way to avoid the familiar reflex of intellectualization. Goal: Introduce a gentle, periodic anchor to help the patient stay focused on the sensation without retreating into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly, every 2-3 breaths) "Notice." One word, spoken softly, every time the patient's breath becomes clipped or their face heats up. The goal is to provide a gentle, periodic reminder to stay with the physical sensation, without becoming too much of a crutch.

Patient: Okay — the soft "Notice" actually tethers me a little; when you say it the pebble‑pressure loosens just a hair. But it also triggers this sharp shame and irritation — I feel embarrassed that I need the cue and my reflex is to immediately label it "metacognitive avoidance," which just makes me mad at myself. Can we keep that word, but maybe gentler? I'm trying not to turn it into a case study, and that's frustrating.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to reconcile the helpfulness of the "Notice" cue with the shame and frustration it triggers. Goal: Introduce a subtle modification to the "Notice" cue to reduce its association with metacognitive avoidance and shame.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly, every 2-3 breaths) "Just... notice." The word "Just" adds a gentle, calming quality to the cue, aiming to reduce the patient's immediate reaction of labeling it as metacognitive avoidance. The goal is to help the patient focus on the sensation without the overwhelming need to analyze it, without exacerbating the shame and frustration.

Patient: Hearing you say "Just... notice" actually tethers me a little — that pebble‑pressure eases by a hair and my inhale gets a fraction deeper. But it also lights up this stupid shame: I feel embarrassed for needing the cue, and my knee‑jerk is to slap on the label "metacognitive avoidance" to keep distance. Can we keep the cue but space it out a bit more? I want to try staying with the sensation longer without my brain turning it into a lecture, because I'm getting frustrated with how fast I drift into analysis.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the mixed effects of the "Just... notice" cue, and is seeking a way to reduce the association with metacognitive avoidance and shame. Goal: Introduce a longer pause between the cue and the patient's verbal response, allowing them to focus on the sensation without the need for analysis.

Therapist Answer:
(Softly, every 4-5 breaths) "Just... notice." The cue is spoken softly, and the patient is encouraged to focus on the sensation for a longer period before responding verbally. This aims to reduce the pressure to analyze and instead allow the patient to simply notice the physical sensation, without the influence of metacognitive avoidance.

Patient: The spaced "Just... notice" actually works a little—the pebble behind my sternum loosens and my inhale gets marginally deeper—but the shame's still there, prickly and impatient, and my reflexive impulse is to reframe it as "metacognitive avoidance" to dodge the rawness. I'm embarrassed by how quickly I default to analysis; it's frustrating and makes me want to procrastinate on tasks so I don't have to feel this. Could we try a longer quiet stretch—like thirty seconds—where I aim to stay with the sensation without labeling, and then maybe briefly explore how that shame tends to trigger my procrastination? I'm worried I'll lapse into explaining again, so I might need a gentle reminder if I start narrating.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the ongoing struggle with metacognitive avoidance and shame, and is seeking a way to break the cycle of analysis and procrastination. Goal: Introduce a longer, more extended period of silence, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without labeling, followed by a brief exploration of how the shame triggers procrastination.

Therapist Answer:
(Pause for 30 seconds)

Note: The therapist maintains complete silence, allowing the patient to focus on the sensation without the need for interpretation or labeling.

(After 30 seconds)

Gently: "How does the shame feel right now, physically?" This prompt aims to help the patient acknowledge the shame without labeling it, and to explore how it manifests in their physical body. The goal is to create a space for the patient to simply be with the sensation, without the influence of analysis. If the patient starts to narrate, a gentle reminder ("Just the sensation...") can be used to gently bring them back to the present moment.

Patient: Physically it's a hot, corrosive knot under my sternum that makes my face flush and my breath clip; my jaw tightens and there's this hollow-sinking feeling in my gut that wants me to shrink away. There's also a prickly, furious edge—I'm mad at myself for feeling so small—which I almost immediately want to reframe as "self-evaluative affect" to avoid the rawness. Can we stay quiet for a bit so I can try to notice those exact sensations without turning them into a case study? I'm having trouble not narrating it away, and that frustrates me.
