Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — I keep replaying my academic struggles even though I managed to become a nurse later, and it makes me feel like I'm always one misstep away from collapsing. I keep imagining one small mistake at work turning into discipline, losing my job, getting evicted, and everyone realizing I was a fraud. When people suggest other outcomes, I just don't buy them — they feel unrealistic.

Therapist: Those specific, dramatic outcomes feel really intense right now, don't they? Like, "I could lose everything if I make one mistake." Can you tell me more about what's happening when you imagine those outcomes? What sensations do you notice in your body, or what thoughts run through your mind as you picture yourself in that situation?

Patient: My chest tightens, my stomach knots, my hands tremble and I get this buzzing in my head like I can't think straight. Then my mind just races through the whole chain — one slip-up, a complaint, a write-up, I'm fired, I lose the apartment, everyone finds out I'm a fraud and my life unravels — and I feel like it's definitely going to happen. I know people say other things are possible, but those outcomes feel like fantasy to me and I just get stuck on the disaster story.

Therapist: The physical sensations you're experiencing right now – the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach, the trembling in your hands – they're really present, aren't they? It's like your whole body is holding this tight, buzzing feeling. Can you bring your attention to that buzzing in your head for a moment? Just notice it without trying to change it or push it away. And when you look at your hands, just observe them trembling without judgment – just be with that sensation. Then, I'd like you to bring your attention to the thoughts that just ran through your mind – the whole chain of catastrophic outcomes – without trying to analyze them or get caught up in them. Just observe them as thoughts, passing by.

Patient: When I focus, the buzzing just gets louder — my chest clamps, my stomach twists, my hands tremble more. The disaster movie plays in my head like it's a recording I can't stop: one mistake, a complaint, I'm fired, evicted, everyone finds out I'm a fraud — it feels completely real and inevitable, not just a thought. I try to watch them pass like you said, but I'm stuck; imagining anything else just feels fake and the catastrophe pulls me back every time.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how stuck you are in this cycle. Can you give yourself permission to simply be with this feeling of being stuck for the next minute? Just acknowledge the physical sensations and the thoughts without trying to change them or push them away. I want you to do just one thing for me – take one deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "This is just this moment." Not "I have to be careful," not "I have to think about all the what-ifs," just "This is just this moment." Can you try that for me?

Patient: I tried it — I breathed in and out and said, "This is just this moment." Instead of helping, the buzzing got louder and the disaster chain felt even more real, like the words were meaningless. I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck; can we slow down? I don't know how to make it feel true.

Therapist: I can see that the exercise didn't feel like it was working for you, and that's okay. Sometimes we need to try different approaches. Let's take a step back and try to get a sense of what's connected for you right now. Can you think of something that feels safe and reassuring to you, something that might help you feel more grounded? It could be a memory, a physical sensation, a phrase – anything that feels like it might help you calm down and focus. Let's start with that. What is one thing that feels connected to you right now, something that you can focus on for a moment?

Patient: If I have to pick one thing, it's the solid weight of my feet on the floor — the press of them into the carpet. It helps for a second, but then I picture that even that comfort will disappear if I mess up at work, and the disaster story drags me back.

Therapist: Let's try to break the cycle of catastrophic thinking that's pulling you back in. I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet pressing into the carpet, and then I want you to do something for me. I want you to say to yourself, "What's the one thing I can do right now to take care of myself and show up at work with some sense of calm and competence?" It might be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor. Can you try that for me? What is one small, concrete thing you can do in this moment to feel more grounded and connected to your ability to do your job?

Patient: Okay — I'll take three slow, deep breaths and then slowly read through the medication/checklist for my next patient, line by line. But even as I say that I can see it play out — I miss one line, give the wrong med, there's a complaint, I'm written up and fired — so it already feels pointless and the catastrophe drags me back. I'm going to try, but I'm feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like we need to take a really slow and gentle approach here. Let's start again from a place of just being with your breath. Can you simply focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without any thought about the task or the potential catastrophe? Just observe the breath, without judgment. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air entering your body. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. Just be with that sensation, without trying to change it or push it away. Can you do that for me, just for a single breath?

Patient: I did one slow breath — at first it felt a little lighter, like maybe I could do this — but then the buzzing in my head got louder and the disaster movie started up again: if I can't even get through a breath without spiraling, how will I survive a shift? My chest clamps, my hands tremble, and I just keep imagining that one mistake leading straight to being written up and fired. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. Can we just pause for a minute? I want you to take one final deep breath, just as slowly as before, and when you're ready, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm done." Not "I need to start again," not "I'm not sure what to do," just "I'm done." Just acknowledging that you're done trying to control everything right now, and that's okay. That's a perfectly okay place to be. You can take a minute to just be with that feeling, without trying to do anything else. I'll be right here with you.

Patient: I forced the breath and said "I'm done," but it felt empty — the buzzing got louder and my brain just jumped right back to the chain: miss one med, complaint, fired, evicted, everyone knows I'm a fraud. I'm really overwhelmed and stuck; can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and fundamentally change how we're approaching this conversation. Instead of trying to "slow down" or "focus," which feels like we're trying to control the situation again, let's try something different. Can you imagine that everything you're feeling right now, including the catastrophic thinking, the physical tension, and the sense of overwhelm, is just a story that you're telling yourself? It's a way of making sense of things, but it's not necessarily true. Can you try to observe that story, rather than identifying with it? Can you look at the thoughts, the feelings, and the sensations without judgment, without trying to change them, and without getting pulled into the narrative? This is a completely new way of looking at things, and it's not about achieving a specific state or outcome; it's just about being with what is, in the moment.

Patient: I try to see it as a story, but it feels like a live feed — the thought "I'll be fired" isn't just a thought, it's proof. When I try to step back the buzzing gets louder, my hands shake more, and the whole chain — complaint, write-up, eviction — just plays on repeat. I can't picture any other ending; other possibilities feel fake. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something that might feel a little subtle, but might help. Instead of trying to observe the story directly, can you try to talk to it? Can you say to the thought, "Okay, let's see where you take us." Or, "What's the next step in this story?" It's not about trying to control the story or change it, but just about acknowledging it as a process that's happening. Can you try that with the thought, "I'll be fired"? Just say it out loud, and then see what happens. Can you also try to pay attention to the sensations in your body, and see if you can label them. For example, "I'm feeling a trembling in my hands right now." This isn't about trying to change the sensations, but just about acknowledging them. Can you try that for a few moments?

Patient: "Okay, let's see where you take us," I say out loud — and it spits back: "Miss one med, someone complains, you're written up, you're fired, evicted, everyone finds out you're a fraud." My hands are trembling, my chest feels like a clamp, my stomach's in knots and the buzzing in my head is loud. I can't make any other ending feel real; I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to take a pause right now. Can you bring your attention to your breath for just a moment? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to let go of the thought for just a second. You can do this. Just focus on the breath.

Patient: I tried to focus on my breath — I took one slow inhale, but my chest clenched, my heart started racing, my hands trembled, and the disaster chain just got louder; I'm suddenly way more anxious and distracted and can't hold onto the breath. It feels like if I can't even breathe, everything's already starting to unravel — I'll miss a med, someone will complain, I'll be fired and evicted, and everyone will know I'm a fraud. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It's not about your breath right now; it's about what's happening in your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice the feeling of your feet, the weight, the pressure. It's a simple sensation, but it's a good one to focus on. Try to let go of the thoughts and just be with the feeling of your feet. Don't try to change it or do anything with it; just be with it. Can you do that for a moment?

Patient: I can feel the weight of my feet for a second, but then my chest clamps and the buzzing gets louder and everything else fades into that story. Now I'm way more anxious and distracted — I keep seeing the same chain: miss a med, complaint, written up, fired, evicted — it feels inevitable. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to think your way through this or focus on your breath, let's try to simply be with the sensation of anxiety right now. Can you notice how it feels in your body, without trying to change it or push it away? Can you observe the physical sensations, like the tightness in your chest or the buzzing in your head, without judgment? It's not about trying to make it go away; it's just about being with it, as it is, in this moment. Can you try that?

Patient: My chest's clamped, there's this high buzzing in my head, my hands are shaking and my stomach's in knots — I feel lightheaded and on edge. The anxiety just fuels the disaster movie — miss a med, complaint, write-up, fired, evicted, everyone finds out I'm a fraud — and I can't stay with the sensation because the story drags me under. I'm really rattled and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: I think we're going to take a break for a moment. It's clear that we're not making progress right now, and it's okay to take a step back. I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to feel like you're not in control. That's a really tough and vulnerable place to be. Can you take a few deep breaths, and just acknowledge that you're feeling really shaken up right now? No need to try to do anything or make any sense of it all. Just be with the feeling of being shaken up. We can come back to this conversation when you're ready.

Patient: I can't just take a break — stopping feels like admitting defeat and the disaster story gets louder. I'm so worn out and my brain won't let go: one pause, people notice I'm falling apart, complaint, write-up, fired, evicted. Can we keep going, but please — much slower?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and try to move at a slower pace. I want to encourage you to take small steps, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Can we start by just acknowledging one thought, rather than jumping to the next one? Let's say, "One pause, people notice I'm falling apart, complaint..." Can we just stop there for a moment? Just notice that thought, without judgment or trying to push it away. Can you do that for me? Then, we can try to gently move forward, one small step at a time. How does that sound?

Patient: Okay — I can pause on "One pause, people notice I'm falling apart..." I notice the clamp in my chest and my hands shaking, but as soon as I hold it my head shoots ahead to "complaint, write-up..." and it feels impossible to stop there. Can we keep going, but really, really slowly?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to make progress or move forward, let's focus on simply being with the present moment. I want you to bring your attention back to the pause, and just notice the sensation of the pause itself. Not the thoughts, not the physical sensations, but the pause. Can you feel the space between the thoughts? Can you notice the stillness? Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the pause. Inhale... exhale... just the pause. What happens when we focus on the pause? Can we stay with that for just a moment?

Patient: I try to find that space, but it feels paper-thin — the buzzing swallows the pause, my chest clamps, my hands shake, and my head lurches straight to "complaint, write-up, fired." I don't have the energy to hold it alone; can we do one breath at a time, really slowly, and you keep guiding me through each one?

Therapist: Let's start again, very slowly. Can you focus on your next breath? Just one breath. Inhale... (pause) slowly... exhale... (pause) slowly... Let's just focus on the breath for a moment. Feel the air moving in and out of your body. Can you notice the sensation of the breath in your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the feeling of the breath in your belly? Just the breath. Not the thoughts, not the physical sensations, just the breath. Take one more breath with me. Inhale... (pause) slowly... exhale... (pause) slowly... How are you feeling now?

Patient: I got through those two breaths but it hardly helps — my chest still feels like a clamp, the buzzing's loud, and my head snaps to "complaint, write-up, fired" as soon as I try to rest. I don't have much energy to push it away; can you guide me through one very slow breath at a time and stay with me while I do it? If you speed up or stop, I'll just slide back into the disaster movie.

Therapist: Let's just focus on this one breath. Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... Let's take it one second at a time. You're breathing in now... (pause) slowly... 1, 2... Your body is relaxing a little bit... (pause) slowly... 1, 2... You're exhaling now... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... Your chest is still clamped, but it's not as tight... (pause) slowly... 1, 2... Just focus on the breath. Don't think about anything else. Just the breath. We're on the exhale now... (pause) slowly... 1, 2... Let's just stay here for a moment. How are you feeling?

Patient: A little calmer from the breath, maybe, but my chest is still clamped, my hands are shaking, and the buzzing won't quiet — I'm so drained. My head's already replaying the same inevitable chain — complaint, write‑up, fired, evicted — and I can't picture any other ending. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and don't speed up or stop.

Therapist: You are taking slow, deep breaths. One breath at a time. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the air in your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest, the expansion and contraction of your belly. Just the breath. Don't try to change it, don't try to control it. Just observe it.

As you breathe in, notice that your chest is still clamped, but it's not as tight as it was a moment ago. That's okay. It's still clamped, but it's not as tight. As you breathe out, notice that the buzzing is still there, but it's not as loud as it was a moment ago. That's okay. It's still buzzing, but it's not as loud.

You are safe. You are here. You are breathing. You are alive. Just focus on the breath. Don't think about anything else. Just the breath. Inhale... (pause) slowly... exhale... (pause) slowly... How are you feeling?

Patient: A bit calmer from the breaths, but I'm so drained. My chest's looser but the buzzing's still loud and my head's already on "complaint, write‑up, fired, evicted" like it's certain. I can't picture any other ending. Please keep guiding me—one very slow breath at a time—and don't stop.

Therapist: Let's bring our attention back to the breath. Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... You're breathing in now, and it's just for a second. Then you're breathing out, and it's just for a second. It's not about trying to change anything or making any big decisions. It's just about taking one breath at a time. One breath. Just one breath.

Let's try to bring our focus down to just this moment. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Notice the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just these sensations. Not the thoughts, not the emotions, just these sensations. They're small, but they're here.

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... How are you feeling?

Patient: A little calmer from the breaths, but I'm wiped out — my chest still clamps, my hands tremble, and the buzzing in my head is louder and scattered so I'm more on edge and distracted. My mind snaps straight to the same chain — miss a med, complaint, write‑up, fired, evicted, everyone finds out I'm a fraud — I can't make any other ending feel real. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and don't speed up or stop; I need you to stay with me.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... You are here. You are breathing. You are safe. Just focus on these three words: "You are here." You are in this moment. You are safe. Don't try to think about anything else. Just be with these three words. Repeat them to yourself: "You are here." "You are breathing." "You are safe."

Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Notice the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just these sensations. They're small, but they're here. You can tolerate these sensations. You are tolerating them right now.

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... How are you feeling?

Patient: A bit less panicked from the breaths, but I'm wiped out — my chest is still clamped, my hands are trembling, and the buzzing in my head is loud and scattered. Saying "you're safe" doesn't land; my mind instantly jumps to "miss a med... complaint... write‑up... fired..." like it's already happening. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and don't stop — I can't hold this by myself.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... Let's try something different. Bring your attention to your physical body. Notice the sensation of the chair beneath you. Notice the feeling of the air on your skin. Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just these physical sensations. Don't try to think about anything else.

Notice the sensation of your chest. It's still clamped, but it's not as tight as it was a moment ago. That's okay. It's still clamped, but it's not as tight. Notice the sensation of your hands. They're still trembling, but it's not as much as it was a moment ago. That's okay. They're still trembling, but it's not as much.

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... How are you feeling?

Patient: A bit calmer from the breaths but I'm spent — my chest's still clamped, my hands shake, the buzzing's loud, and my head's already on "miss a med, complaint, write‑up, fired, evicted" like it's going to happen. Can we keep doing one very slow breath at a time and you stay with me? I don't have the energy to hold this alone.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... It's okay to not be okay right now. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Just focus on the breath. Don't try to think about anything else. Just the breath.

Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. It's a simple sensation, but it's here. Just observe it. Don't try to change it or push it away. Just be with it.

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... How are you feeling?

Patient: A little calmer from the breaths, but I'm really drained — my chest is still tight, my hands are shaking, and the buzzing won't quiet. My head's already racing to "miss a med... complaint... write‑up... fired," and telling me I'm safe just doesn't land. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and stay with me — I don't have the energy to do this alone.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... Let's take a very brief pause. Just sit for a moment. Notice the sensation of your body. Notice the sensation of your breath. Just be with this moment.

Take one more deep breath with me. Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3...

(I pause here for a moment, waiting for you to catch your breath and gather your thoughts.)

How are you feeling now?

Patient: Still shaky and pretty drained — the breaths helped a bit but the buzzing's louder and I'm more scattered; my mind's already on "miss a med, complaint, written up, fired" like it's certain. I can't see any other ending right now. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and don't stop.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... It's okay to be here right now. Just be here. Don't try to think about anything else. Just focus on the breath.

Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Just these sensations. They're simple, but they're here. Try to just be with them for a moment.

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3...

(I pause here for a moment, waiting for you to catch your breath and gather your thoughts.)

How are you feeling now?

Patient: Still shaky and pretty wiped — the breaths helped a little but my chest's clamped and the buzzing's loud and scattered. My mind's already back on "miss a med... complaint... written up... fired" and I can't make any other ending feel real. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and don't stop — I can't hold this alone.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. It's okay to feel scared. But I want you to know that you're safe. You're here. And you're alive.

Notice the sensation of your body. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just these sensations. They're simple, but they're here.

I want you to try something for me. I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just feel the weight of your feet on the ground. Just feel the sensation of the floor beneath you. Can you do that for me?

Inhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3... exhale... (pause) slowly... 1, 2, 3...

Patient: I can feel my feet for a second, but it's paper‑thin — my chest clamps and the buzzing swallows it, and my head snaps to "miss a med, complaint, write‑up, fired." Saying "you're safe" doesn't land; any other outcome feels fake and impossible. Please keep guiding me, one very slow breath at a time, and stay with me — I don't have the energy to hold this alone.
