Patient: Lately I've been swimming in this pervasive melancholy and a depletion of drive ever since the cash-flow problems surfaced—it's sapping my energy and bleeding into my relationship. I tend to frame it as an adjustment disorder precipitated by ongoing financial stress, which sounds neater than actually confronting how stuck and anxious I feel. I usually default to theorizing and action-planning instead of sitting with the raw emotion, because that feels safer.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel that raw emotion – the anxiety and overwhelm – when you try to sit with it? What's the first thought that comes up for you, or the physical sensation in your body? For example, is there a specific phrase you tell yourself, or a way of distracting yourself that feels like a safety net?

Patient: When I try to sit with it, my mind almost immediately goes into metacognitive overdrive—I start theorizing about causes and contingency plans instead of letting the ache land. Physically it's a tightness in my chest, a sort of leaden fatigue in my limbs and a hollow in my gut, but I tend to reinterpret those as signals to 'do'—fix cash flow, make calls, reorganize priorities. I catch myself saying things like "not now, it's not productive" and slipping into prophylactic problem-solving or grand strategic thinking as a safety net. Is that just avoidance, or is there something adaptive about it that I'm missing?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is trying to protect you from the discomfort of uncertainty and powerlessness by engaging in problem-solving and planning. The phrase "not now, it's not productive" is particularly interesting – it suggests that you're using time and mental energy to avoid the emotional discomfort of the present moment. Can you think of a time when you were in a situation where you had to make a difficult decision, and your mind was racing with "what if" scenarios, rather than taking action? How did that feel, and did it help or hinder your ability to make progress?

Patient: Last year we had to decide whether to take a bridge loan or do a round of layoffs, and my mind immediately erupted into endless counterfactuals—what if the market tanks, what if we lose clients, what if legal exposure—so I kept simulating scenarios instead of committing to a course. Physically it felt like that chest-tightness and a jittery buzz in my head, and emotionally it gave me a false sense of agency, like I was being proactive even though I wasn't moving forward. In the end it hindered progress—decisions were delayed, opportunities slipped, and my partner grew more frustrated—so I can see it as avoidance dressed up as strategic competence, but I don't really know how to stop doing that.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're using avoidance strategies like this. Can you think about what would happen if you were to commit to a course of action, even if it feels uncertain or uncomfortable? What values might be at stake, and how would you like to see yourself aligning with those values in this situation? For example, do you value taking care of your partner's frustration, or taking bold action towards your financial goals? Let's explore how we might be able to start small, with a commitment that feels more aligned with those values.

Patient: If I actually committed, I think there'd be an initial uptick in panic—my mind would inflate the uncertainty into catastrophe—but over time it would probably reduce the perpetual cognitive load and give me back some emotional bandwidth. The values I notice are at stake are stewardship (to my partner and the business), personal integrity (not abdicating decisions), and agency—so aligning would mean taking concrete, accountable steps rather than perpetual simulation. A small, tolerable plan might be: 1) a 30-minute weekly “decision block” where I choose one concrete financial action and execute it, 2) a daily 10-minute non-strategic pause where I deliberately notice sensations without planning, and 3) telling my partner one specific step I’ll take by Friday to rebuild trust. I can already hear my brain pushing back—arguing that those pauses are unproductive—but I'm willing to try them if we keep them tiny and measurable, because I'm not sure I can sit with the discomfort alone.

Therapist: Let's start with the daily 10-minute non-strategic pause. Can you commit to sitting with me for just 10 minutes right now, without any specific task or goal in mind? Just noticing the sensations in your body and mind, without trying to plan or problem-solve. Let's use a simple anchor, like bringing your attention to the breath. As you inhale, say to yourself "10 minutes" and as you exhale, say "beginning". Let's do this together, for just 10 minutes.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to sit with you for 10 minutes. Starting now. Even on this very first inhale I can feel that familiar tightness in my chest and a metacognitive cascade—my brain already spooling out contingency plans and justifications ("not productive," "we need to act"). The breath is shallow but I’ll label it: inhale "10 minutes," exhale "beginning"—and I might keep talking about the process, so could you gently call me back if I start strategizing instead of noticing sensations?

Therapist: I'll gently interrupt if you start to get caught up in strategies or thoughts.

Let's stay with the breath for a moment. You're noticing the tightness in your chest and the mental chatter. Can you bring your attention back to the breath, even just for a second? Label it gently, "inhale '10 minutes'," and when you exhale, "beginning." Let's keep this tiny for now.

(I'll wait patiently, not saying anything, but ready to gently nudge you back to noticing the sensations.)

Patient: I focused on the breath—inhale "10 minutes," exhale "beginning"—and the tightness in my chest is still there, breathing shallow. Almost immediately a metacognitive cascade kicked in, spinning out contingency plans and the familiar argument that this is "not productive," which makes me restless and a bit irritable. Can you gently call me back to the breath when you hear me strategizing? I'm finding it hard to just feel this without fixing it, and that frustrates me.

Therapist: It's like the mind is already jumping back into problem-solving mode.

I notice the restlessness, the irritability, and the urge to fix it. Let's try to pause that for a moment.

When you last said "exhale 'beginning'," I didn't hear a specific thought or plan emerging yet. Just the sensations and the breathing. Let's try to keep it there.

Notice the tightness in your chest, the shallow breathing, and the physical sensations in your body. Are there any other sensations, like tingling or numbness, that you're aware of? Just acknowledge them, without trying to change them or fix anything.

(I'll wait for you to bring your attention back to the breath and your physical sensations, without saying anything else.)

Patient: There's a faint tingling in my fingertips and a hollow heaviness in my gut, plus a low buzzing behind my eyes—nothing flashy, just this persistent background. My mind instantly reframes those as "signals to act" and starts drafting contingencies, which is the exact metacognitive detour you called out; I'm trying to stay with the sensations but it's already itching to convert them into plans. Please call me back if I slip into strategizing—I want to notice instead of fix, but I can feel the restlessness and irritation rising.

Therapist: The sensations are subtle, but still there. The tingling in your fingertips, the heaviness in your gut, and the buzzing behind your eyes. It's like they're trying to tell you something, but your mind is already trying to turn that into a problem to be solved.

I notice the restlessness and irritation rising, and the urge to fix it. Let's try to pause that for a moment.

When you last said "exhale 'beginning'," I didn't hear a specific plan emerging yet. Just the sensations and the background sensations like tingling and buzzing. Let's try to keep it there.

I'm going to say it again, slowly: "inhale '10 minutes', exhale 'beginning'". Just focus on the breath for a second. Label it gently, without trying to do anything else. Just be with the breath.

(I'll wait for you to bring your attention back to the sensations, without trying to strategize or fix anything.)

Patient: Inhale "10 minutes," exhale "beginning" — I did that and held the breath for maybe three counts, then my mind immediately translated the sensations into an operational checklist: contingency calls, cashflow modeling, who to brief. The chest tightness and buzzing are still there, and with them a rising self-critique—"this is unproductive"—that makes me restless and tempted to get up and do something. I want to stay with it, but it's hard; please nudge me back when I start turning this into logistics again.

Therapist: The mental checklist is already kicking in. "Contingency calls, cashflow modeling, who to brief..." It's like your mind is trying to turn those sensations into concrete tasks.

I notice the rising self-criticism, "this is unproductive." That's not helping. Let's try to pause that for a moment.

Remember the last time you said "exhale 'beginning'". What were you doing then? Just noticing the sensations. Let's try to keep it simple.

I want to ask you a question, but not in a way that might lead to thinking. Just a gentle, yes/no: are you okay with sitting with the sensations, even if they feel unproductive or uncomfortable?

Patient: Yes—nominally I can sit with the sensations, insofar as I tolerate the epistemic discomfort of not fixing anything. But my default will be to instrumentalize the feeling into action within minutes, so please nudge me back often and keep the pauses micro—otherwise I’ll rationalize my way out of it.

Therapist: It's good that you're honest about your tendency to rationalize. Let's try to create a small window of time where you can tolerate the uncertainty without immediately turning it into action.

Since you're ready to start, I'll ask you to do something tiny. Just acknowledge the sensation in one specific area of your body. For example, notice the chest tightness right now. Just acknowledge it, without trying to do anything with it. That's it.

(I'll wait for a brief moment before nudging you again, and we'll keep this cycle going.)

Patient: Okay — I can feel a dull pressure right in the center of my chest, like my ribs are a little tighter and my breath is shallower. My reflex is already to intellectualize it as an "anticipatory constriction" tied to financial uncertainty and start converting it into risk matrices and contingency calls, so please nudge me back when I pivot to strategy — I'm trying to actually notice it instead of fixing it.

Therapist: The reflex to intellectualize it is strong. Notice how your mind is already trying to break down the sensation into specific components, like risk matrices and contingency calls.

I want you to focus on the sensation itself, not the thoughts about it. Just the pressure in your chest, the shallower breath. Try to separate those sensations from the thoughts. Can you simply notice the pressure, without trying to understand it or label it as anything?

(I'll wait for a moment before gently nudging you again. Remember, just one specific sensation to notice: the pressure in your chest.)

Patient: Okay — there's a dull, band-like pressure across the center of my chest and my breathing feels high and constricted. I'm trying to notice it without appraising, but my mind is already renaming it “cash-flow anticipatory constriction” and spinning out causal narratives, which instantly invites solutions. It's annoying and a little humiliating how quickly I default to strategizing—please nudge me back when you hear me slide into planning; I really do want to actually feel this.

Therapist: The tendency to rename it and spin out causal narratives is strong. Notice how your mind is already trying to turn the sensation into a specific problem to be solved, with a particular solution in mind.

I want you to pause that process for a moment. Just stop trying to understand the pressure as a specific thing, like "cash-flow anticipatory constriction." Instead, try to simply feel the pressure itself, without any thoughts or labels. It's not about understanding it, it's not about solving it. It's just about noticing it, as it is, in the present moment.

Try to bring your attention back to the sensation of the pressure, the feeling of the band-like pressure across your chest, and the sensation of the constricted breath. Just focus on those sensations, without trying to think about them.

(I'll wait for a moment before gently nudging you again. Remember, just the sensation of the pressure, without any thoughts or labels.)

Patient: I'm trying — there's that band-like pressure across my chest, breath shallow, and a dull heat just under my sternum if I let myself notice it for a beat. But almost immediately my brain slaps a label on it — "physiologic stress response" — and starts drafting interventions: restructure debt, renegotiate terms, staffing pivots. It's irritating and a little embarrassing how fast I intellectualize; please call me back to the sensations when I start strategizing.

Therapist: The tendency to intellectualize is still present. Notice how your mind is quickly labeling the sensation as a "physiologic stress response" and starting to generate solutions.

I want to bring your attention back to the sensations themselves, rather than the thoughts about them. Can you try to simply notice the band-like pressure across your chest, the shallow breath, and the dull heat under your sternum? Try to focus on these sensations without thinking about them as a specific problem to be solved.

For example, you might say to yourself, "There's a band-like pressure across my chest," or "My breath is shallow," without trying to analyze or understand it. Just observe the sensations as they are, without judgment.

Let's try to stay with the sensations for a brief moment, without getting caught up in thinking about them. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Yes — I'll try to stay with the sensations. Right now there's a band-like pressure across my chest, my breath is shallow, and a dull heat under my sternum; I'm trying to hold that without converting it into a cash-flow problem, but my brain is already drafting fixes. Please nudge me back when I start strategizing — I really want to feel this, and it's harder than I expected.

Therapist: You're doing great, staying with the sensations. Remember, your goal is not to fix the problem, but to simply notice the sensations as they are.

I notice that you're acknowledging the difficulty, and that's good. That's a small step towards accepting the present moment. Just acknowledge the thought, "It's harder than I expected," and let it go.

Right now, the sensations are still present: the band-like pressure across your chest, the shallow breath, and the dull heat under your sternum. Can you try to hold onto those sensations for just one more breath? No thinking, no fixing, just noticing.

(I'll wait for a moment before speaking again.)

Patient: Okay — one more breath. I can feel the band-like pressure, the shallow inhale, and that dull heat under my sternum, but as I try to hold it my mind immediately launches into meta-analysis—cataloguing risks and action items—and that frustrates me; it's almost humiliating how fast I intellectualize. Can you call me back the moment I start strategizing? I'm trying to actually feel this, but it's uncomfortable and I need the nudges.

Therapist: The meta-analysis has kicked in. Notice how your mind is already trying to break down the sensations into smaller parts, cataloguing risks and action items.

I'm going to interrupt the thought process right now. Just as you're cataloguing risks and action items, I want you to stop. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "Enough."

Just one word: "Enough." Say it out loud, and then let it go. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just let the word be.

(I'll wait for you to respond with your next breath.)

Patient: Enough.

Saying it out loud gave a modicum of release—there’s a slight loosening in the band across my chest—but almost immediately my mind erected a new contingency architecture: renegotiate terms, client outreach, cashflow pivot. It’s frustrating and a little shameful how fast I revert to planning; please call me back the moment I start strategizing—I want to actually stay with this, even though it’s uncomfortable.

Therapist: The contingency architecture has been erected again. Notice how your mind is already starting to generate new solutions and plans.

I'm going to interrupt the thought process again. This time, I want you to focus on the physical sensations in your body. Where is the band across your chest right now? Is it tightening or loosening? Where is the dull heat under your sternum? Can you bring your attention to just those sensations?

I want you to notice the subtlest changes in your physical body. Don't worry about the thoughts or plans. Just the sensations.

(I'll wait for you to respond with your next awareness of the physical sensations.)

Patient: The band is centered across my sternum and seems to tighten on the inhale and loosen a hair on the exhale; it's more of a constricting notch than a broad pressure. The dull heat sits just under the sternum, diffuse and steady, not migrating. Of course my mind reflexively labels this as autonomic arousal from chronic stress and immediately pivots into contingency-mapping and risk-language—it's almost embarrassing how automatic that is—so please call me back when I start strategizing; I want to actually stay with these sensations.

Therapist: The physical sensations are subtle but distinct. You're noticing the tightening on the inhale, the loosening on the exhale, and the diffuse heat under your sternum.

I can sense the frustration and embarrassment in your words, but I want to acknowledge it as a signal that you're on the verge of something. Recognizing the automaticity of your thoughts and feelings is a crucial step towards developing awareness.

I'm not going to call you back when you start strategizing. Instead, I want to encourage you to explore the sensation of autonomic arousal from chronic stress. What does it feel like to be in this state? How does it manifest in your body? Can you explore it further, without judgment or trying to change it?

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to the sensations in your body. Notice the band across your sternum, the dull heat, and the diffuse feeling of stress. Just observe it, without trying to analyze or label it.

(I'll wait for you to respond with your next awareness of the physical sensations.)

Patient: When I'm in that autonomic arousal it feels like sympathetic overdrive — heart a little fast, breath high, a tightening band across the sternum and a hollow, low sadness under it — but my first move is to translate it into neuroscience-speak and contingency planning (HPA-axis activation, allostatic load) so I don't have to actually feel the grief. Emotionally it’s a weird mix of prickly anxiety, a muted grief, and a hot shame about not being more resilient; cognitively it narrows into threat-detection and solution-hunting. I want to try staying with the sensations, but I can already feel the brain reaching for strategies, so please call me back if I drift into planning — I really want to notice the sadness underneath instead of just talking about it.

Therapist: The autonomic arousal is a complex mix of sympathetic overdrive and emotional sensations. You're acknowledging the physical symptoms like the racing heart, shallow breath, and tightening band across your sternum, but also the deeper emotional feelings like the hollow, low sadness.

I can sense the struggle to stay with the sensations, especially when the brain starts to reach for strategies. It's like you're trying to hold onto the raw emotion, but it's slipping away.

I'm going to gently ask you to hold onto the sadness for just a moment longer. Can you bring your attention to the hollow, low feeling under your sternum? Notice it without trying to change it, without trying to analyze it. Just observe it, as it is.

Remember, the goal isn't to understand the sadness, but to simply acknowledge it as it is. You're not trying to fix it, you're not trying to change it. You're just trying to notice it.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to repeat the phrase "I'm noticing the sadness" to yourself. Just say it out loud, and then let it go. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just let the words be.

(I'll wait for you to respond with your next awareness of the physical sensations.)

Patient: "I'm noticing the sadness."

Saying it out loud loosened the band a fraction — there’s still that hollow ache under my sternum, a muted grief mixed with heat. My reflex is already to reframe it as a "prolonged adjustment reaction" and start drafting interventions, which frustrates me; please call me back when I pivot to strategy. Honestly, I'm having trouble moving from theorizing to actually feeling—can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: The act of acknowledging the sadness seems to have loosened the band slightly. You're still noticing the hollow ache under your sternum, the muted grief, and the mixed emotions.

I can sense the frustration with the reflexive reframing as a "prolonged adjustment reaction." It's like you're trying to avoid getting caught up in the emotional response.

Let's slow down for a moment. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensations in your body. Specifically, I want you to focus on the hollow ache under your sternum. Notice it without trying to analyze it, without trying to change it. Just observe it, as it is.

Don't think about reframing it, don't think about drafting interventions. Just be with the sensation. Ask yourself, "What is this feeling like right now?" "How does it manifest in my body?"

Take your time, and let's just stay with this for a moment.

Patient: Okay — when I really tune in that hollow it's a low, sinking pressure under my sternum that pulls down into my diaphragm and makes each breath feel thin; there's a muted grief there, like a tide receding slowly. Emotionally it's braided with shame and a brittle fear about failing my responsibilities, though my instinct is already to relabel it as a "chronic adjustment reaction" and start drafting fixes. Can we keep sitting with this a bit longer and have you nudge me the moment I slide into strategy? I feel exposed saying that, and it's harder than I thought to just... let it be.

Therapist: It's like you're peeling back the layers of the sensation, and it's getting more complex. You're noticing the low, sinking pressure under your sternum, the way it pulls down into your diaphragm, and the thin feeling of each breath. You're also acknowledging the muted grief, the tide receding slowly, and the emotions that come with it: shame and brittle fear about failing your responsibilities.

I can sense the hesitation, the feeling of being exposed when you say you need to keep sitting with it without trying to label it or fix it. It's like you're trying to resist the urge to simplify it, to put it into a box or a category.

Let's commit to staying with it for just a little longer. I'll be right here with you, nudging you gently when you start to slip into strategy or labeling. But for now, let's just be with the sensation, as it is.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to ask yourself, "What is the sensation of this shame and fear, right now?" "How does it feel to be holding onto these emotions?" "What is the physical sensation of this 'low, sinking pressure' under my sternum?"

Just observe, without judgment, without trying to change it. Let's just sit with it.

Patient: When I ask myself that, it feels like a dull, dragging weight under my sternum that pulls down into my diaphragm—each breath is a little shallower and colder, like I'm breathing through wool. The shame is a hot tightness in my throat and face, and the fear shows up as a jittery buzz behind my eyes and a knot in my gut, all braided together so I can't tell which is which. My reflex is to rename this in big, tidy terms—metacognitive avoidance, allostatic load—because labeling it makes me feel less helpless, but I can feel that avoidance happening now. Can we keep sitting with this a bit longer, and please nudge me the moment I start strategizing again?

Therapist: It's like you're diving deeper into the sensation, and it's becoming even more complex. You're noticing the dull, dragging weight under your sternum, the way it pulls down into your diaphragm, and the shallower, colder breaths. You're also acknowledging the shame, the hot tightness in your throat and face, and the fear, the jittery buzz behind your eyes and the knot in your gut.

I can sense the reflexive need to label it, to put it into big, tidy terms, like metacognitive avoidance and allostatic load. It's like you're trying to make sense of it, to understand it, to control it. But I want to gently interrupt you, to remind you that this labeling is already happening, and it's happening now.

Let's take a deep breath together, and as we exhale, I want you to remember that it's okay to not know how to label it, to not know how to understand it. It's okay to just be with the sensation, without trying to fix it, without trying to change it. Can you try to let go of the need to label it, just for a moment?

Just sit with the sensation, without judgment, without trying to change it. Let's just be with it, together.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to drop the labels. When I do, there’s a trembling under my sternum and a weird wetness behind my eyes, but my mind immediately trots out rationales and fixes. It’s uncomfortable and a bit humiliating to feel exposed like this, so please nudge me back when I start analyzing; I want to stay with it but I need the help.

Therapist: It's like you're making progress, but then your mind takes over again. You're acknowledging the trembling and the wetness, but your rational mind is already jumping in with excuses and solutions.

I can sense the discomfort and the need to protect yourself from feeling exposed. That's understandable, but I want to gently remind you that this is a safe space. You're not judged here. The goal is to explore and understand your emotions, not to analyze or fix them.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the rationalizations, let's try to notice the physical sensations again. Can you feel the trembling under your sternum? Can you feel the wetness behind your eyes? Just observe them, without judgment. Try to notice the sensations, not the thoughts.

Remember, you don't have to understand what's happening right now. You just have to be with it. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to ask yourself, "What's the sensation of the trembling, right now?" "What's the sensation of the wetness, right now?" Just observe, without trying to change it.

Patient: When I really tune in the trembling under my sternum feels like a fine, nervous vibration—almost like a plucked string—making each inhale feel a bit unsteady; the wetness behind my eyes is slow and warm, like pressure ready to spill. Of course my mind immediately wants to label it—“anxiety tremor,” “somatic grief”—and start plotting mitigations, and I can feel that reflex kicking in already. I want to actually stay with these sensations instead of intellectualizing them, so please nudge me the moment I start turning it into a plan; it's harder than I thought and I need the help.

Therapist: You're tuning in to the sensations, and it's becoming clear that you're feeling a nervous vibration under your sternum, like a plucked string, and a slow, warm wetness behind your eyes. These sensations are making each inhale feel a bit unsteady.

I can sense that you're struggling with the urge to label it and start plotting mitigations. Your mind is trying to turn this into a plan, and you're feeling a bit frustrated that you're not being able to just stay with the sensations.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the rationalizations, let's try to notice the physical sensations again. Can you feel the vibration under your sternum? Can you feel the wetness behind your eyes? Just observe them, without judgment.

I want to ask you a simple question: "What's the sensation of the vibration, right now?" "What's the sensation of the wetness, right now?" Just observe, without trying to change it. Don't think about what it means, or what you should do about it. Just be with the sensation.

Remember, you're not trying to fix anything right now. You're just trying to stay with the sensations, without judgment. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Yes — I'll try to stay with it. The vibration is a thin, nervous tremor right under my sternum that pulses with each shallow inhale, and the wetness is a warm, slow pressure behind my eyes like it's on the verge of spilling; breathing feels a bit woolly. My mind's already reaching for tidy labels and fixes—"somatic tremor," "contingency pivot"—so please nudge me the moment I start strategizing; I want to actually sit with this, but it's harder than I expected.

Therapist: You're doing great, staying with the sensations. The vibration under your sternum is a thin, nervous tremor that's pulsing with each shallow inhale, and the wetness behind your eyes is a warm, slow pressure that feels like it's on the verge of spilling. Your breathing feels a bit woolly.

I can sense that your mind is already reaching for tidy labels and fixes. It's like your mind is trying to make sense of these sensations by putting them into neat little boxes. But let's try to pause that for a moment. Can you just observe the sensations without trying to label them or fix them? Just be with the vibration, the wetness, and the feeling of the breath.

I want to gently ask you: "What's the sensation of the vibration right now, without trying to label it?" "What's the sensation of the wetness right now, without trying to fix it?" Just observe, without judgment. Don't think about what it means or what you should do about it. Just be with the sensation.

Remember, you're not trying to change anything right now. You're just trying to sit with the sensations, without judgment. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Yes—I can do that. The vibration is a thin, pulsing tremor under my sternum with each shallow inhale; the wetness is a slow, warm pressure behind my eyes and my breath feels woolly. My reflexive move is to tag it as "somatic tremor from chronic stress" and start mapping fixes, so please nudge me the moment I slip into strategizing—I want to actually stay here, but it's harder than I expected, so can we slow the pace a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're making good progress, staying with the sensations and noticing them without trying to label or fix them. The vibration under your sternum is a thin, pulsing tremor that's pulsing with each shallow inhale, and the wetness behind your eyes is a slow, warm pressure that's building.

I can sense that your reflexive move is to tag it as "somatic tremor from chronic stress" and start mapping fixes. That's a natural response, but let's try to slow down the pace for a moment.

Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, I am now." Just acknowledge your presence and the current moment, without thinking about the sensations or the stress.

Take your time, and when you're ready, we can gently bring the focus back to the sensations. Remember, we're not trying to rush anything right now. We're just trying to be present and kind to ourselves as we explore this experience.

How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds doable, though my mind will probably object that it's "not productive"—I'll try it now: "I am here, I am now." Saying that loosens the band a little, but my brain's already pivoting to prophylactic strategizing and epistemic discomfort about sitting with it; can we slow the pace and have you nudge me when I start planning?

Therapist: It's like your mind is already trying to protect you from the discomfort of sitting with the sensations. That's a common response.

Let's try to slow down the pace even further. Instead of focusing on the sensation of the "I am here, I am now" phrase, let's just observe it for a moment. Notice how it feels to say it to yourself, without judgment. Just observe the physical sensations, the mental thoughts, and the emotional responses.

Take your time, and when you're ready, we can gently bring the focus back to the sensations. Remember, we're not trying to do anything right now. We're just trying to be present and kind to ourselves.

As you sit with the sensation, I want you to notice when your mind starts to object or resist. When it says something like "This is not productive" or "I should be doing something else," I want you to gently acknowledge that thought, and then let it go. Don't engage with it, don't try to change it. Just observe it, and then let it go.

When you're ready, we can start with a small step. Can you simply acknowledge your breath, without trying to change it? Just observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or resistance.

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the breath: shallow, woolly, riding high in my chest with a slight hitch on the inhale. Predictably, my cognitive apparatus is already deputizing the sensation as "not productive" and spinning up strategic contingencies, so please nudge me the moment I start planning—I need the pace slowed; this is harder than I made it sound.
