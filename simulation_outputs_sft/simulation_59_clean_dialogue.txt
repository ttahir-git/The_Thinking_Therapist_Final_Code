Patient: I'm an artist in my early sixties, and lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because I get intense anxiety in social settings. I mostly rely on myself and it's been making me feel lonely and unstable, especially after some job instability. I don't know, talking about it feels... uncomfortable, but it's been on my mind.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in a social situation and you start to feel anxious? What's the first thing that goes through your mind, or what's the physical sensation you notice? Is there a specific part of the conversation or activity that triggers this feeling for you?

Patient: Usually my chest gets tight and my heart starts racing, and my breathing feels shallow like I need to get out. The first thought is often that people are judging me or that I'll say something stupid—especially if the conversation turns toward work or my situation. I guess specific triggers are being put on the spot or when attention is on me, but… I don't know, it's hard to pin down, it just becomes this overwhelming urge to disappear.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to focus on your physical sensations. Can you bring your attention to the tightness in your chest right now? Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it or think about it too much. Also, notice your breathing. How does it feel to focus on just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? As you breathe, can you notice any thoughts without judgment? They might arise, but just acknowledge them gently, like "thinking" or "judging." For now, stay with the breath and the sensations in your chest.

Patient: I can feel the tightness in my chest—it's kind of a sharp pressure—and my breathing's shallow and quick when I try to notice it. Thoughts keep popping up like "they're judging me" or "I shouldn't be here," and I keep wanting to push them away. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to stay with it. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's okay to take a pause. You can just acknowledge the thought "I don't know how to stay with this" and let it go. Imagine taking a deep breath out, slowly exhaling it out, and as you do, gently let the focus return to the present moment. Bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them or think about them too much. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or simply the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just be present with that for a moment.

Patient: Okay… I can feel my feet on the floor, and the air on my skin is kind of faint but real. My chest is still tight and the breath is shallow, and the thought "get out" keeps showing up. I don't know, it's hard to stay with this — can we go slower?

Therapist: It's not about going slower, but about noticing the subtleties. Can you notice the word "get out" as it arises, without judgment? It's just a thought, a phrase that pops up. What's the tone of that thought? Is it a whispered warning, a shouted command, or a gentle suggestion? Gently observe that, without trying to change it or react to it. Now, notice how the body responds to that thought. Where do you feel the tension, the tightness, or the restlessness? Can you bring that to your attention, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: It's mainly in my chest and throat, and my shoulders pull up—my jaw clamps and my hands feel a little numb. The "get out" is like a sharp, urgent whisper that swells into a small panic and my breathing speeds up. I don't know, it's overwhelming... can we not go too deep right now?

Therapist: It's okay to pause. You're doing a good job of noticing the physical sensations and the thought "get out." Let's focus on something simple and calming. Bring your attention to your breath, but this time, notice how the sensation of the breath changes as you exhale. Feel the way the air leaves your body, and imagine any tension or tightness slowly releasing with that breath. You can say to yourself, "Let it go," or "Release," without judgment. Just focus on the sensation of the breath and the release of tension.

Patient: I tried saying "let it go" in my head, but it felt kind of hollow — my chest's still tight and that "get out" whisper just keeps getting louder. I don't know, it feels like if we keep poking at this it’ll tip me into a full panic. Can we... slow this down or do something a bit less intense?

Therapist: It's okay to take a step back. Let's simplify the approach and focus on the physical sensations for a moment. Bring your attention to your breath again, but this time, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Notice the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet, deep into the ground, anchoring you in this moment. Just be present with that sensation for a moment, without trying to think about anything else.

Patient: Okay, I can feel my feet on the floor—there's a little more of a steady weight, I guess. My chest is still tight and that "get out" whisper is hanging around, though the roots thing makes it a bit quieter. I don't know, grounding helps some but it's still scary—can we keep it really slow?

Therapist: Let's just focus on your breath again, and notice the sensation of your chest. Can you bring your attention to the spot where the tightness is most noticeable? Just notice it, without trying to change it or push it away. Now, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Is there any particular sensation that stands out to you? Noticing the sensation of the breath and the tightness in your chest, what do you think might happen if you simply allowed it to be, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I just let it be maybe it would ease a bit, or maybe it'll build and I'll panic — it's hard to tell. Sitting with it feels risky and kind of makes me want to run, so I'm struggling to stay here. Can we... talk about some practical things I could do when I'm out with people instead?

Therapist: Let's talk about something that might help you feel more prepared and in control when you're out with people. What are some things you usually do or say when you feel anxious or uncomfortable in social situations? For example, do you try to make small talk, change the subject, or excuse yourself? Are there any specific phrases or questions you use to try to break the ice or feel more at ease? Let's explore some practical strategies that might help you feel more grounded and confident when you're out with people.

Patient: I usually make an excuse to arrive late or leave early, hang back by the wall, and keep a drink or my sketchbook in my hands so I have something to do. I steer the talk away from work—if it veers there I either change the subject or say something vague like "oh, that's complicated" and freeze up. I don't know, I guess I also rehearse a few safe lines beforehand, but half the time I just say I have an early thing and slip out. Can we stick to a couple really simple, practical things I can try next time?

Therapist: Let's focus on a couple of simple things you can try next time. One idea is to take a few deep breaths before the social gathering. Just sit quietly for a minute, feel the air moving in and out of your body, and try to calm your nerves a bit. Another idea is to prepare a simple question or two to ask others. This could be something like "How was your weekend?" or "What do you like to do in your free time?" Asking a few questions can help take the focus off of you and give you a chance to feel more comfortable. Let's try to build on these small steps, okay?

Patient: Okay... I can try the deep breaths beforehand — that feels doable. I usually blank out when I'm there, so can you help me pick one fail-safe question and a simple, polite exit line if it gets too much? I don't know, I worry I'll still freeze, but having concrete lines might help.

Therapist: Let's create a simple question that's easy to ask and won't put too much pressure on you. How about this: "How was your weekend?" This question is casual, conversational, and shows interest in the other person's life. As for the exit line, let's go with something simple and polite: "I think I'm going to grab another drink/refill my glass, can I catch up with you later?" This gives you a clear way to excuse yourself without making a big deal out of it. Just remember, the goal is to take small, manageable steps. You're not trying to be perfect; you're just trying to be yourself and feel more comfortable in social situations.

Patient: Okay... "How was your weekend?" feels simple enough, I guess. The drink line sounds polite but a bit stiff — something like "I'm going to step outside for a minute, I'll catch up with you later" might feel more natural to me. Can we... quietly rehearse those once or two? I don't know, I'm kind of worn out but maybe practicing would help.

Therapist: Let's just sit here for a minute and rehearse the question and exit line together. I'll start by saying the question: "How was your weekend?" Just repeat it back to me in your own words, and then we'll work on the exit line. "I'm going to step outside for a minute, I'll catch up with you later". Just say it, and then let's slow down and practice together.

Patient: "How was your weekend?"

"I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later."

Can we try that once more, slowly? I don't know, saying it out loud feels a bit easier.

Therapist: Let's try it again, even slower this time. I'll say the question: "How was your weekend?" Pause for a moment, then say the exit line: "I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later." Take your time, breathe, and just repeat it back to me. How does that feel?

Patient: "How was your weekend?"

"I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later."

Saying it out loud felt... kind of okay, I guess—a little hollow but doable. I don't know, can we do it one more time, slowly?

Therapist: Let's try it one more time, very slowly. I'll say the question: "How was your weekend?" Pause for a moment, take a deep breath, and then say the exit line: "I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later." As you say the exit line, notice how your body feels. Do you tense up or relax? Are there any thoughts that come up for you? Try to acknowledge them gently, without judgment. Just observe them, and see if you can accept them as they are.

Patient: "How was your weekend?"

"I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later."

Saying the exit line my shoulders eased a little but the tightness in my chest stayed and my jaw clenched; my hands felt a bit numb. Thoughts like "they'll notice" or "I'm being awkward" kept coming up, and I don't know — it still feels risky, but saying it out loud made it a bit easier. Can we do that again, slowly?

Therapist: Let's try it again, slowly. I'll say the question: "How was your weekend?" Pause for a moment, take a deep breath, and then say the exit line: "I'm going to step outside for a minute. I'll catch up with you later." As you say the exit line, notice how your body feels. Where does the tightness in your chest come from? Try to bring it to your attention, without judgment. Just observe it, and see if you can breathe a bit more into it. What thoughts come up for you as you say the words? Can you acknowledge them gently, without getting caught up in them? Remember, it's okay to have thoughts like "they'll notice" or "I'm being awkward". Just try to observe them, and then let them go.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing into it supposed to help? The tightness feels stuck in my chest and throat, like an old alarm that snaps tighter when I think people are looking. When I say the exit line, thoughts like "they'll notice" or "I'm being rude" pop up and my jaw clamps; I don't know, it's hard to let my breath do anything. Can we just go really slowly with this?

Therapist: Let's start again, from the very beginning. I'll say the question: "How was your weekend?" Just hear the words, and take a moment to acknowledge them. Don't think about the answer, just the sound of the question. Then, I'll say: "I'm going to step outside for a minute." Just focus on these two words. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to slowly, slowly tense the muscles in your neck. Just the muscles in your neck, and shoulders. Don't try to relax, just tense them a bit. Hold for a second, and then release. Just a tiny release. Let's try it again, slowly, and see how it feels.

Patient: I don't know… tensing my neck feels like it'll make it worse — my neck already feels like a vice. How is that supposed to help? Maybe we could just stick to slow breathing for now; this feels like a lot. I guess I can try the tiny tensing thing if you really think it matters, but really slowly.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together. Inhale slowly, and as you exhale, say "out" to yourself. Just a slow, gentle "out". Let's try it a few more times. Inhale... out. Inhale... out. Just focus on the breath, and try to let go of any thoughts or tension. If your neck or any other part of your body feels uncomfortable, just acknowledge it and keep breathing. We're going to take this very slowly, and see how it feels.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Inhale — out. Inhale — out. It helps a bit, but my chest's still tight and my jaw keeps clenching. I don't know, it's hard to stay focused; can we just do a couple more slow breaths and keep it really gentle? I guess we can try the tiny tensing after, but very, very slowly.

Therapist: Inhale... out. Inhale... out. Just breathe, and try to let go of any thoughts or tension. It's okay if your jaw clenching happens again, just acknowledge it and keep breathing. We're going to take it very slowly. One more time... inhale... out. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly say "out" to yourself. One more time... inhale... out. Just breathe, and try to let go. If you're ready, we can try the tiny tensing exercise again. Very slowly, just the muscles in your neck. Hold for a tiny second...

Patient: I don't know... my neck already feels like a vice. I guess we can try one tiny, very slow tensing—just a brief hold—and then let it go. If it spikes, I need to stop, and can we take a couple slow breaths after?

Therapist: Let's try it one more time. Just the muscles in your neck. Hold for a tiny second... Go ahead and let me know how it feels. If it's okay with you, I'll just hold for a second. Hold... Okay, now let it go. Just slowly release the tension in your neck. How do you feel? If it feels like it's making it worse, or if you're just not feeling it right now, we can stop and take a break. In fact, let's take a couple slow breaths after this. Inhale... out. Just breathe and relax for a moment.

Patient: I guess the neck release helped a tiny bit—my shoulders dropped a notch—but the chest tightness is still there and my jaw won't unclench. Breathing's a little steadier but the "they'll notice" thoughts keep barging in. I don't know... can we just do a few more really slow breaths, quietly, and maybe skip any more tensing?

Therapist: Let's take a few more slow breaths, quietly. Inhale... out. Inhale... out. Just breathe, and try to let go of any thoughts or tension. No need to focus on anything in particular; just the breath. We'll keep it very slow and gentle. One more time... inhale... out. Just breathe, and relax for a moment.

Patient: Inhale... out. It helps a bit — breathing's steadier, but the chest's still tight and my jaw won't unclench. I don't know, can we pause the breathing stuff and just talk about one simple, concrete thing I can do if someone asks about my work or why I wasn't at something?

Therapist: Let's talk about what you can say if someone asks about your work or why you weren't at something. Can you think of a specific example or situation where this has happened before? How did you handle it? What did you say? We can use that as a starting point to develop a simple, concrete response that you can use in the future. What do you think would be a good thing to say in this situation?

Patient: Once, at a small get-together, someone asked, "So what are you working on these days?" and I just froze and muttered, "Oh, it's complicated," then moved away. Usually I say something vague like "just doing some projects" and steer the conversation off me. I guess a simple line that might feel honest and safe is, "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key," and if they press about not coming, something like, "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite." I don't know, that feels a little rehearsed, but maybe practicing it a couple times could help—can we try that once or twice, slowly?

Therapist: Let's start by just repeating the response without any pressure. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key." Just say it a few times, slowly. No need to think too much, just let the words come out naturally. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key." Take a deep breath and try it again. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key." One more time...

Patient: "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key."

"I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key."

"I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key."

That felt... kind of flat, but doable. I don't know, can we try the follow-up—"I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite"—slowly next?

Therapist: Let's start with just the follow-up phrase, without the initial response. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite." Just say it a few times, slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite." Take a deep breath and try it again. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite." One more time... Then, let's try combining the two phrases together, slowly. Just start with the initial response, and then add the follow-up phrase. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key. I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite."

Patient: Okay... I'll try it, slowly.

"I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key. I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite."

That felt a bit flat and rehearsed — I don't know, maybe usable. Can we do that one more time, even slower?

Therapist: Let's start with the initial response, and then add the follow-up phrase, very slowly. "I'm doing some studio work right now..." Take a deep breath, and then say it again, slowly. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key..." Now, add the next part, very slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately..." Take a deep breath, and then say it again, slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but..." Pause for a moment, and then say it again, slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite..."

Patient: "I'm doing some studio work right now... keeping things low-key."  
"I've been keeping my schedule small lately... but I appreciate the invite."

That felt a bit easier, I guess—still sounds rehearsed and my chest's tight, I don't know. Can we do one more, very slowly? It's a bit of an effort, but maybe helpful.

Therapist: Let's try it again, very slowly. "I'm doing some studio work right now..." Take a deep breath, and then say it again, slowly. "I'm doing some studio work right now, keeping things low-key." Now, add the next part, very slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately..." Pause for a moment, and then say it again, slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but..." Take a deep breath, and then say it again, slowly. "I've been keeping my schedule small lately, but I appreciate the invite." One more time...

Patient: Okay... I'll try, slowly.

"I'm doing some studio work right now... keeping things low-key.  
I've been keeping my schedule small lately... but I appreciate the invite."

"I'm doing some studio work right now... keeping things low-key.  
I've been keeping my schedule small lately... but I appreciate the invite."

I don't know, that felt a bit easier—still kind of flat, my chest's tight—can we try a more casual exit line next?

Therapist: Let's try a more casual exit line, slowly. "It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now." Just say it a few times, slowly. "It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now." Take a deep breath, and then say it again, slowly. "It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now." One more time...

Patient: "It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now."  

"It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now."  

"It was great catching up with you... actually, I think I'm going to head out now."

I don't know, that felt a bit stiff—can we try a softer one, like "I'm going to step outside for a bit, I'll catch up with you later"?
