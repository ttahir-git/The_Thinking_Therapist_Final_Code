--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been overthinking stuff at work and, I guess, turning my feelings into plans or theories so I don't have to actually feel anxious about it. I run a small business and the instability lately makes me dive into spreadsheets and strategies instead of admitting I'm scared. I don't know, it just feels like I'm numbing myself by being clever about my feelings.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging how overthinking and using plans as a way to cope with anxiety, which is a step in exploring the issue. The core emotion here seems to be avoidance, specifically of feeling scared and uncertain. Your goal is to start understanding how this avoidance affects your work and overall well-being.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel anxious about something at work? What specific thoughts or plans do you find yourself creating as a way to cope with that feeling? For example, is there a particular situation or task that triggers a strong desire to intellectualize or strategize?

Patient: Usually when a client delays payment or I get a pitch meeting coming up, I start building worst-case financial models, competitor analyses, and ten contingency plans so I can “solve” the anxiety instead of feeling it. I pore over metrics, read every strategy article, and rehearse scripts until I feel numb. I don't know, I guess that's just easier than actually sitting with the panic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're describing a clear pattern of using overthinking and mental planning as a defense mechanism to avoid anxiety. This avoidance strategy is affecting your ability to experience and process emotions, leading to a sense of numbness. Your goal is to explore how this avoidance is impacting your business and overall sense of well-being.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're creating a lot of mental "work" to try to manage your anxiety. Have you ever stopped to consider what would happen if you simply acknowledged the anxiety, rather than trying to "solve" it through planning and metrics? For example, what might it be like to take a few deep breaths, notice the physical sensations in your body, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious right now, and that's okay"? Would that allow you to approach a pitch meeting or client payment issue with a different mindset?

Patient: I've tried that—deep breaths and naming it—but it only calms me for a minute or two. Then I immediately jump back into cashflow scenarios and contingency plans because if I don't, I worry I'll miss something important. I don't know, saying "I'm anxious" feels kind of pointless, like I'm not being productive. Can we maybe focus on small, practical things I can do when I start spiraling?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the temporary nature of calming down through deep breathing and acknowledging anxiety, and how it's quickly replaced by a sense of responsibility to address potential problems. This indicates a strong desire for control and productivity. Your goal is to explore ways to introduce more mindfulness and flexibility into your coping strategy.

Therapist Answer:
It can be tough to step away from the feeling of being productive and focused on tasks. Instead of immediately jumping into planning, what if you tried taking a very small, tiny pause before getting back to work? For example, you could say to yourself, "I'm going to take 30 seconds to notice how I'm feeling right now, and then I'll decide what to do next." What if, during that pause, you simply noticed the physical sensations in your body, the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin? Would that allow you to come back to the task with a slightly different mindset?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it sounds okay in theory, but when I'm in that loop 30 seconds feels like forever and then I'm just worried I'll miss something important. Maybe I could try it if it's very structured—like set a 30-second timer so it feels purposeful—and then have one tiny action to do afterward so I don't just slip back into spreadsheets. Can we think of one concrete, quick follow-up I can commit to after the pause?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the practical need for structure and purpose in the pause, and how a timer can help make it feel more focused. You're also identifying a specific goal for the follow-up action, which is to maintain momentum and prevent slipping back into planning. Your goal is to find a concrete, quick action that can help bridge the pause and transition back to work.

Therapist Answer:
Having a timer set for 30 seconds can create a sense of purpose and structure. For the follow-up action, what if, after the pause, you simply wrote down one specific question related to the task or issue at hand? For example, "What's the one thing I need to focus on right now?" or "What's the one decision I need to make?" Writing down just one question can help ground you in the present moment and give you a clear direction to move forward.

Patient: I don't know, I guess that could work. Maybe I'll set a 30‑second timer and then write, "What's the one next step I can take right now?" on a sticky note and actually do that one thing. I'm nervous it'll feel pointless, but I'm willing to try it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're open to trying a new approach and willing to experiment, despite initial reservations about its effectiveness. This willingness to take a small risk is a positive step towards exploring new possibilities. Your goal is to continue developing this new strategy and applying it in various situations.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're thinking of taking concrete action. As you set the timer and write down your next step, what would happen if you also said it out loud to yourself? For example, "What's the one next step I can take right now?" Just hear yourself say it, and see what it feels like. Sometimes, hearing ourselves think aloud can help us feel more connected to our intentions and more likely to follow through.

Patient: I don't know, I guess saying it out loud feels kind of... weird, like I'm dramatizing something that should just be efficient. I could try whispering, "What's the one next step I can take right now?" before I jump back in, but I'm worried I'll say it and immediately go back to building models. Can you help me figure out a phrasing or tone that might actually stick so it doesn't feel pointless?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the potential for self-dramatization and the risk of getting caught up in mental planning. You're also identifying the need to find a phrasing or tone that feels authentic and useful. Your goal is to develop a concise and meaningful phrase that will help you stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked.

Therapist Answer:
Let's experiment with a different phrasing. Instead of saying "What's the one next step I can take right now?", what if you simply said "Okay" or "Let's do this"? These short, simple words can help you transition from pause to action without feeling like you're saying too much. You're not trying to come up with a brilliant plan or make a big statement; you're just acknowledging that it's time to move forward. Try saying "Okay" or "Let's do this" out loud, and see if it feels more natural and effective.

Patient: I don't know, "Okay" sounds kind of dumb, but "Let's do this" feels more like an actual prompt I could follow. I guess I could try saying it out loud and then do a tiny physical cue — like tap the desk or hit the timer — so it feels like a ritual, not just a line. I'm nervous it'll just feel performative and I'll immediately slip back into modeling.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're considering adding a physical cue to make the phrase feel more ritualistic and concrete. This could help you create a tangible connection between the verbal prompt and the action, making it more likely that you'll follow through. You're also acknowledging the risk of feeling performative, which is a good sign that you're aware of the potential pitfalls. Your goal is to find a balance between creating a meaningful ritual and avoiding self-consciousness.

Therapist Answer:
Adding a physical cue can be a great way to make the phrase feel more grounded. Instead of just saying "Let's do this" out loud, what if you added a small gesture that signals to yourself that it's time to move forward? For example, you could tap the desk three times, hit the timer, or even just raise your hand slightly. This small action can help create a sense of ritual and make the phrase feel more concrete. Try saying "Let's do this" out loud and then performing this small gesture, and see how it feels. Remember, the goal is to create a feeling of clarity and focus, not to add unnecessary complexity.

Patient: I don't know, I guess tapping three times and saying "Let's do this" might make it feel less dumb and more like a real cue. Maybe if I use something tactile—like clicking a pen or snapping a rubber band—it'll feel less performative and more like a tiny ritual. But I'm worried I'll still just slide back into modeling right after; can we figure out a quick fail-safe if that happens?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're refining your approach by incorporating a tactile cue, which can help create a sense of ritual and make the phrase feel more concrete. You're also acknowledging the potential for still falling back into mental planning, and wanting to implement a fail-safe to prevent that. Your goal is to find a way to gently bring yourself back to the present moment if you catch yourself slipping back into planning.

Therapist Answer:
A tactile cue like clicking a pen or snapping a rubber band can be a great way to create a sense of ritual. To help with the fail-safe, what if, immediately after saying "Let's do this" out loud and performing your chosen tactile cue, you simply took a very small, brief pause to breathe? For example, you could inhale for a count of one, hold your breath for a count of one, and then exhale for a count of one. This brief pause can help you refocus on the present moment and remind you that it's time to move forward, rather than getting caught up in planning. It's a small, gentle reset, and it might help you stay on track.

Patient: I don't know, the one-count breath feels a little too tiny—like it could be another ritual that doesn't stick. Maybe the fail-safe could be: after the snap and the breath, start a 5‑minute timer and commit to just that one tiny action; if I catch myself spiraling during those five minutes, I have to text one person "holding me to 5 mins" or actually stop and talk it out for 30 seconds. I guess I'm willing to try that, though I'm nervous it might still feel performative.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're thinking of increasing the fail-safe to a longer, more substantial commitment, which can provide a sense of accountability and help you stay focused. The 5-minute timer and the commitment to just one tiny action can create a sense of clarity and purpose. The added element of texting someone "holding you to 5 mins" or having a 30-second conversation can also help you stay connected to the present moment and prevent yourself from getting too caught up in thinking. Your goal is to create a system that helps you stay grounded and focused, even when you're feeling anxious or uncertain.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're willing to try the more substantial fail-safe. Let's make sure it feels authentic and not too performative. Instead of saying it out loud right away, what if you simply remind yourself of the plan for the next 5 minutes, without drawing attention to it? You could think to yourself, "For the next 5 minutes, I'm just going to do one thing, no matter what," or "I'm committed to focusing on this task for the next 5 minutes." This way, you're setting the intention without drawing attention to it, which might help you feel more natural and less performative.

Patient: I don't know, I guess silently reminding myself "five minutes, one thing" could feel less performative. I'm worried I'll still slide back into planning even if it's quiet, but I'm willing to try the 5‑minute timer and the text fail-safe. Can you help me pick one tiny, realistic action I can commit to for those five minutes?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try the 5-minute timer and the text fail-safe, and you're looking for a tiny, realistic action to commit to for those five minutes. This action should be simple enough to focus on, yet challenging enough to keep you engaged. Your goal is to find an action that will help you stay focused and avoid slipping back into planning.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pick an action that's easy to execute and focus on, but still requires some attention. How about this: for the next 5 minutes, you simply need to write down the one thing that's currently on your mind, without editing or analyzing it? Just write whatever comes up, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. This action requires minimal thinking, but still keeps you engaged and focused on the present moment. By doing this, you'll be able to quiet your mind and avoid planning, and you can use the text fail-safe to check in and refocus if needed.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try that. It feels weird to just write without editing, but okay—I'll set a 5‑minute timer. If I start spiraling, should I text "holding me to 5 mins" right away or wait until I notice?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're thinking about the timing of texting "holding me to 5 mins" and it's good that you're considering how to use this fail-safe effectively. You want to catch yourself before you spiral out of control, but you also don't want to break the flow by texting too early. Your goal is to use this text as a gentle reminder to refocus, rather than a distraction.

Therapist Answer:
Instead of texting "holding me to 5 mins" right away, what if you wait until you notice that you're starting to spiral out of control or feel yourself getting caught up in planning? This could be a subtle shift in your thoughts or a sense of increasing anxiety. When you notice this, take a brief pause to assess the situation and remind yourself of the goal: to focus on the one thing for the next 5 minutes. If you feel like you're getting too caught up in thinking, you can then send the text as a gentle reminder to refocus. This way, you'll avoid breaking the flow and can use the text as a subtle nudge to get back on track.

Patient: I don't know, I guess waiting until I notice makes sense, but I'm worried I won't realize I'm spiraling until it's too late. Maybe I could set a 2‑minute midpoint beep as a backup — like, start the 5‑minute timer and also set a 2‑minute check to see if I'm still on task. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all these steps, though, like it might just become another thing to manage.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed by the multiple steps and the need to constantly monitor your progress. This is a common challenge when introducing new systems or strategies. You're right to consider whether these steps will actually help or create more stress. Your goal is to find a balance between structure and simplicity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's simplify things. Instead of the 2-minute midpoint beep, what if you just focus on checking in with yourself at the 5-minute mark? Ask yourself: "Am I still on task? Am I feeling overwhelmed or caught up in thinking?" If you're not, it's okay. You can pause the timer, take a few deep breaths, and reassess. Don't worry about texting a reminder yet. Just focus on getting back on track. If you find that you're consistently getting too caught up in thinking, we can revisit the idea of using a text reminder. But for now, let's keep things simple and focus on your ability to check in with yourself.

Patient: I don't know, simplifying does help a bit—I guess I can try just the 5‑minute check‑in. But I'm nervous I'll only notice at the end and then feel worse; if I realize I'm spiraling at the 5‑minute mark, what do you want me to actually do in that moment? I feel kind of awkward saying it out loud, but I want something concrete I can do that doesn't feel like another performance.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete action to take at the 5-minute mark, and you want something that feels more grounded and less performative. You're right to be cautious about saying something out loud that might feel awkward or like another performance. Your goal is to find a simple, tangible action that can help you regain focus.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on a simple physical action. Instead of saying anything out loud, what if you simply take a sip of water? Just pick up the glass and take a sip. This action is neutral, easy to do, and can help you pause and reassess the situation. The physical act of drinking water can also help calm your nervous system and give you a brief moment to regroup. No need to think about what to say or do anything more complex. Just take a sip of water and see where you're at.

Patient: I don't know, that actually sounds doable—less performative than saying something out loud. I guess I'll try the sip at the 5‑minute check, but I'm worried it'll just delay the spiral instead of stopping it; if that happens can I have a backup like standing up and walking away for 30 seconds or texting one person? I'm feeling kind of awkward asking, but I want something concrete so I don't just keep overthinking.


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a backup plan to prevent the spiral from continuing, and you're willing to consider more drastic measures. You're right to be concerned about delaying the problem instead of addressing it directly. Your goal is to find a concrete action that can help you regain control and move forward.

Therapist Answer:
Let's address the more drastic measures you're considering. If you feel like the sip at the 5-minute mark isn't working and you're spiraling, what if you take a short break? You can stand up, take 30 seconds to stretch, move around, or do some deep breathing exercises. This brief pause can help you clear your head and come back to the task with a fresh perspective. Alternatively, if you feel like the sip isn't working, you can send a quick text to a trusted friend or accountability partner, like the one you mentioned earlier ("holding me to 5 mins"). This can help you get support and encouragement without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, the goal is to take control of the situation and move forward. If the sip isn't working, these alternatives can help you regain momentum.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is taking a sip of water supposed to actually stop the spiral? I don't know, it just sounds like adding another tiny ritual to my list that I'll perform and then immediately go back to building models. I guess standing up could help sometimes, but what if I'm on a call or in a meeting and can't just leave? Can you explain why these small physical things are better than the planning I default to, or give something that would actually work in those situations?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of taking a sip of water in stopping the spiral, and I should have provided a clearer explanation earlier. The goal of these small physical actions isn't to magically stop the spiral, but to create a subtle shift in your focus and perception. By performing a simple action like taking a sip or standing up, you're interrupting the automatic flow of planning and mental rumination. This brief pause can help you refocus on the present moment and regain a sense of control. Your goal is to create a tangible anchor that can help you break the cycle of overthinking and spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
You're right that standing up might not be feasible in all situations, like during a call or meeting. In those cases, what if we explore other physical actions that can help you stay focused without disrupting the situation? For example, you could try using a tactile anchor like a stress ball or a fidget toy. Alternatively, you could use a subtle adjustment to your posture, like rolling your shoulders or adjusting your grip on the steering wheel. These small physical actions can help you release tension and stay present, even in challenging situations. We can discuss these options further and find a strategy that works best for you in different contexts.

Patient: I don't know, that still feels kind of vague and… I guess small stuff just blends into my other rituals. If I'm on a call I can't fidget with a ball—maybe something really subtle, like pressing my thumb into my palm or grounding my feet—would that actually help, or is that just another thing I'll end up doing mechanically? This is getting kind of heavy and I'm not sure where to go with it.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're right to feel overwhelmed and skeptical about the effectiveness of these subtle physical actions. It's true that small actions can blend into existing habits and rituals, making it harder to achieve a lasting shift. Your goal is to find a way to create a sense of distinction and novelty, making these actions more noticeable and impactful.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and focus on the specific action you're considering: pressing your thumb into your palm. Is this a movement that you've done before, perhaps in a different context or during a different emotional state? If so, it's likely that this action has already become automatic and might not be effective in breaking the cycle of overthinking.

Instead, what if we try to create a sense of distinction around this action? For example, you could try to do it in a way that's slightly more pronounced or deliberate than usual. You could also try to pay attention to the sensations in your hand and thumb as you press them into your palm, noticing the tension and relaxation as you release. By focusing on the sensory experience of this action, you might be able to create a brief moment of awareness that could help you break out of your usual patterns.

It's not about doing something new and exciting, but rather about being more mindful of the actions you're already taking. Can you try this approach with the thumb press, and see if it makes a difference?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try that. I'll press my thumb into my palm and try to actually notice the pressure, temperature, and tension instead of doing it on autopilot. It feels awkward and kind of pointless, but can we check in after I try it so I don't just slip back into planning?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to give it a try, and that's a good starting point. It's understandable that you might feel awkward or pointless about it, especially if you're not used to paying attention to your physical sensations. However, it's worth noting that this exercise is not about doing something new and exciting, but rather about being more mindful of your actions.

Your goal is to create a brief moment of awareness that can help you break out of your usual patterns. If you're able to notice the pressure, temperature, and tension in your hand and thumb, you might be able to create a sense of distinction that can help you stay present.

Therapist Answer:
Let's check in after you try pressing your thumb into your palm. How did it feel? Did you notice anything unusual about the pressure, temperature, or tension in your hand and thumb? Did you feel yourself slipping back into planning or overthinking, or did you notice a brief moment of awareness that might be useful for you to build on in the future? Take a few deep breaths and notice how you're feeling right now.

Patient: I did it — pressed my thumb into my palm and actually tried to notice the pressure and warmth. For a few seconds it was...different, like the loop loosened a bit, then my head slid right back into cashflow scenarios. I don't know, it helped a little but I'm feeling pretty worn out and still stuck. Can we try a simpler in‑call option or something I can do without feeling performative?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try again, and it's good that you're acknowledging your feelings and the lack of lasting impact. It's also realistic to admit that you're worn out and still stuck.

Your goal is to find a way to create a sense of calm and clarity in the midst of a call, even if it's a small and temporary reprieve. I'm not looking for another elaborate strategy, but rather something simple and straightforward that can help you manage your emotions and stay focused.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something simple: take a few deep breaths. Just focus on your breath, feeling the air move in and out of your body. Try to let go of any tension or distractions, and simply be present with your breath. You can do this without thinking about anything else, including cashflow scenarios or the call itself. Just breathe. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it sounds...really basic, but maybe that's okay. When I'm on a call, I'm worried breathing will make me miss something, so could we pick a super-subtle pattern — like slow nasal breaths, inhale 3, exhale 4 — that I can do without anyone noticing? I'm feeling pretty drained right now, but I'm willing to try that.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a subtle pattern that won't distract from the call, but still provides a sense of calm and focus. I understand that you're concerned about missing important information, and I appreciate your willingness to try.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple 3-4 nasal breath pattern. Inhale for a count of 3, hold for a count of 1, exhale for a count of 4, and hold again for a count of 1. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, rather than the counting itself. If you're on a call, try to tune out the other person's voice and focus on your own breathing. Just one cycle, see how it feels.

Patient: I did one cycle — it helped a little for a few seconds, then my head drifted back to scenarios. I don't know, I'm worried it won't hold during a long call; can we try an even subtler cue I can do while talking that won't feel performative? I guess something like a really light thumb press or tiny jaw release every minute might work, but I'm feeling pretty wiped and sloppy about all this.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the previous attempt may not have been sustainable, and you're looking for an even more subtle cue that won't feel performative. You're also concerned about the physical and mental exhaustion that's affecting your ability to focus.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very gentle, almost imperceptible cue. Instead of a thumb press or jaw release, try a tiny, almost imperceptible movement of your lips. It's just a slight, brief movement of your mouth, almost like a tiny, almost imperceptible "ah" sound. This movement is so subtle that it's unlikely to be noticed by the other person on the call. It's just a gentle reminder to yourself to stay present and focused, without drawing attention to it. Try it for just a minute, see how it feels.

Patient: I tried it—just the tiniest lip movement while pretending to listen. For a few seconds it snapped me back, then my brain slid right into cashflow scenarios again. I don't know, I guess it felt less dumb than some of the other stuff, but I'm pretty wiped and it's hard to keep doing these little rituals; can we pick one ultra-simple thing I can reliably do on long calls that won't feel fake or make me self-conscious?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the limits of your ability to perform small rituals, and you're looking for something that's even simpler and more reliable. You're also feeling physically and mentally exhausted, which is affecting your ability to focus.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go back to the basics. How about just taking a deep breath every 5-10 minutes during the call? That's it. Just one breath. No movement, no sound, no thinking. Just a simple, quiet breath. It's something you can do without even thinking about it, and it might help you stay present for a little while longer. Try it for just one deep breath, and see what happens.

Patient: I guess I can try just one quiet breath every 5–10 minutes—it's stupidly simple but less performative, so maybe it'll stick. I don't know, if that falls apart can we pick one tiny fallback like a silent thumb press I won't overthink? Can we check in after I try it so I don't just slide back into planning?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try the simple deep breathing, and that's a good starting point. It's indeed simple, but sometimes simplicity can be the most effective approach.

For the fallback, a silent thumb press can be a good option, but only if it doesn't feel like it's taking over. You want to keep it as a last resort, not a crutch.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the deep breathing first. Just take one quiet breath every 5-10 minutes during the call. Don't think about it too much, just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. If you find yourself slipping back into planning or thinking, that's okay. Just acknowledge the thought and bring your attention back to your breath.

If the deep breathing doesn't work out, we can revisit the idea of a silent thumb press. But for now, let's just focus on getting through the call with one quiet breath. How do you feel about trying it?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I can try the one quiet breath every 5–10 minutes — that actually feels doable compared to all the other stuff. I'm pretty wiped and worried I'll just forget and start modeling, so if it doesn't work can we switch to the silent thumb-press fallback? Can we check in after I try it so I don't just slip back into overthinking?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling more realistic about your ability to stick with the one quiet breath every 5-10 minutes, and that's a good sign. You're also concerned about forgetting and falling back into old patterns, which is understandable given your exhaustion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the one quiet breath every 5-10 minutes first. If you find that you're struggling to remember or that you're getting too tired, we can definitely switch to the silent thumb press as a fallback. But for now, let's focus on getting through the call with one simple, quiet breath.

We'll check in after you've tried it for a bit, say in about 10-15 minutes, to see how it's going and if you need to make any adjustments. Sound good?

Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds doable. I don't know, I'm worried I'll forget—what's a tiny silent phrase I can use to trigger the one breath so it doesn't feel like another thing to manage? Also I'm already pretty worn out, so can we check in in about 10 minutes so I don't just slide back into modeling?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a tiny silent phrase to trigger the one breath, and that's a good idea. You want something subtle that will help you remember without feeling like you're adding another layer of complexity.

Therapist Answer:
How about the word "pause"? Just say "pause" to yourself quietly, and it can help trigger the one breath. It's a simple word that's easy to remember, and it's not too distracting. Using a word like "pause" can also help you focus on the sensation of the breath, rather than trying to remember a complex procedure.

As for checking in, I can definitely accommodate your request for a shorter wait. Let's check in in about 10 minutes, rather than 15. This will give you a chance to get a feel for the one breath without feeling overwhelmed. Sound good?

Patient: I don't know, I guess "pause" could work — I'll try to use it and take that one quiet breath. I'm pretty wiped and worried I'll forget and slip back into modeling, so please check in in about 10 minutes because I don't trust myself to stay on task right now.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling uncertain about your ability to stick with the one quiet breath, and that's understandable given your exhaustion. It's good that you're acknowledging your limitations and seeking support.

Therapist Answer:
I'll check in with you in about 10 minutes to see how it's going. If you're struggling to remember the "pause" phrase or if you're feeling too tired to take a breath, we can adjust our approach as needed.
