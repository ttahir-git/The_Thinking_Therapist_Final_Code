Patient: I'm a senior student and lately I've been stuck in this loop of really harsh self-criticism whenever I think I've messed up — even small things feel like big failures. I've always been fiercely independent, so asking for help feels... hard, and my social anxiety just amplifies everything, especially after that health scare. I don't know, it's just been exhausting.

Therapist: Exploring the tangible context of'stuck' right now feels important. You've mentioned your health scare, and how it might be impacting your social interactions and independence. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you've "messed up" in a small way? For example, what's the first thought that comes up for you, and how do you react to it?

Patient: I don't know... usually the first thought is something like "I'm such an idiot" or "I messed everything up." After that I replay it in my head, my chest gets tight, and I either try to fix it immediately on my own or I shut down and avoid people. I guess because I've always been independent, asking for help feels like admitting I'm weak, so I just push through and then feel worse.

Therapist: That sounds like a really painful cycle. It seems like your initial thought is a harsh self-critic, and then you get caught up in replaying it and physically experiencing anxiety. The avoidance behavior also feels like a way to cope, but it's clearly not sustainable. Goal: Introduce a small, concrete step to practice defusion, specifically noticing the thoughts without acting on them. Can you imagine, for just a brief moment, taking a deep breath and acknowledging the thought "I'm such an idiot" as a thought, without judgment or reaction? Just a moment of observation?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I take a breath and tell myself "that's just a thought," but I don't know — it still feels like a fact, my chest tightens, and I either want to fix it right away or disappear. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed talking about it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Process over problem for a moment. It sounds like, even with the attempt at defusion, your body and mind are still reacting strongly. That's okay. It's normal. Let's just focus on the fact that you're trying, and that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's happening when you feel like you want to "fix it right away"? Is it a physical urge, or more of an emotional feeling?

Patient: I guess it's both — there's a tightness in my chest, my heart speeds up, and I feel restless like I need to do something right away. Emotionally, it's this panic mixed with shame, like I have to prove I'm competent, so I start rewriting emails, over-explaining, or trying to fix whatever I think I messed up. I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to say and I'm getting anxious — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Validation: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these feelings, especially the shame and the need to prove competence. It sounds like you're feeling really raw right now, and that's okay. The physical symptoms are also very real. Let's slow down further. Instead of trying to process everything at once, can we just focus on one thing for now? You mentioned the urge to "rewrite emails" as a way to cope. Can you tell me more about what's driving that specific urge, without worrying about what we're discussing or how it sounds?

Patient: I guess it's about wanting control — like if I can fix the email I won't have to face someone thinking I'm incompetent. There's this knot in my stomach and I feel like changing the wording will stop the judgment, even though it's probably small. I don't know, it's embarrassing and I'm getting anxious — can we slow down?

Therapist: The desire for control is a big one. It's like you're trying to use the email as a way to avoid feeling like you're being judged or found wanting. That knot in your stomach makes sense - it's a physical manifestation of the anxiety and self-doubt. Can we try something different for a moment? Instead of focusing on the email or the judgment, can you bring your attention to the sensation of the knot in your stomach? Just notice it, without trying to change it or push it away. How does that feel?

Patient: I guess when I notice it it's this tight, heavy knot low in my stomach and my breath gets shallow. It feels hot and a bit like fizzing, and it makes me want to jump up and fix whatever caused it. I don't know, it's making me anxious — can we slow down?

Therapist: The sensation of the knot is really intense. It's like a physical anchor that's pulling you in. The heat, the fizzing, the desire to jump up and fix it... it's like your body is trying to respond to this anxiety. Let's take a deep breath here. Instead of trying to fix the knot or the anxiety, can you just observe the heat for a moment? Can you feel where it's centered in your body, and what it's like to notice it as a sensation? Just for a second, without trying to change it or push it away. How is that?

Patient: I guess... when I try to notice it, it's still that hot, heavy knot low under my ribs, like a tight fist. My breath gets shallow and there's this restlessness, like I need to get up and change something right away. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to sit with—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are still really present, even when you're trying to focus on them. The knot, the heat, the restlessness... it's like your body is holding onto it tightly. It's understandable that it's uncomfortable to sit with, especially when it feels like you need to take action. Can we take a slightly different approach? Instead of focusing on the sensations themselves, can you bring your attention to the urge to get up and change something right away? What is it about that feeling that's driving you? Is it the restlessness, the need for action, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's a mix — the restlessness makes me want to move, but underneath it's this fear of being seen as incompetent, like doing something proves I'm okay. I don't know, it's making me uneasy and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: The mix of physical restlessness and the fear of being judged is creating a lot of tension. It's like your body is trying to escape, but at the same time, you're holding onto this need to prove yourself. It's understandable that it's making you feel uneasy and overwhelmed. Let's pause for a moment. Instead of trying to push through or talk about it, can you just acknowledge the feeling of being overwhelmed right now? Can you simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed," without judgment or trying to change it? Just notice the sensation of being overwhelmed, and be with it for a moment.

Patient: Okay. I'm feeling really overwhelmed — my chest is tight, that knot's still low in my stomach, and my breath's shallow. I can say it, but I don't know, it's really hard to just sit with it without wanting to fix it or run away. Can we slow down some more?

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in this cycle of overwhelm and desire to escape. The physical sensations are still present, and it's hard to just sit with them without trying to change or push through. That's okay. Can we take a tiny step back? Instead of trying to sit with the overwhelm right now, can you just focus on your next breath? Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body, without trying to change it or use it as a way to escape? Just observe the breath, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay—I breathe in and out, and it's shallow and quick, like it's not really doing much. When I try to notice it, my chest stays tight and my mind jumps to fixing stuff again. I don't know, it's weirdly hard to just watch it without doing something.

Therapist: The physical sensation of the breath is still present, but it's not really calming or grounding. Instead, it's fueling the same old patterns of thinking and reacting. It's like your mind is too busy trying to fix things to actually notice the breath. Can we try something different? Instead of focusing on the breath or trying to change it, can you simply acknowledge the thought that just came up? You just jumped to "fixing stuff" again, and that's okay. Just notice that thought, and see what happens. What do you want to do with that thought?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I want to fix it — rewrite the email or say something so I don't look stupid. But I'm also tired of doing that all the time and it's making me anxious, so can we slow down?

Therapist: The cycle is repeating itself. You're caught up in the desire to control the situation by "fixing" it, but that's creating more anxiety. It's like you're stuck in a vicious loop. Can we try to break it down for a moment? Instead of focusing on the email or trying to "fix" it, can you just ask yourself what's driving this desire to control? What's underneath the need to rewrite the email or say something to avoid looking stupid? Is it fear of judgment, fear of failure, or something else? Let's take a step back and explore what's really going on here.

Patient: I guess it's mostly fear of being judged — like if someone notices a mistake they'll think I'm incompetent, and that threatens this whole thing I tell myself about being independent and capable. After the health scare, needing help feels extra terrifying, like admitting I'm weak. I don't know, talking about this makes me uneasy and I'm getting anxious — can we slow down?

Therapist: The fear of being judged is really driving this need to control the situation. It's like you're terrified that someone will see your "mistake" and think you're not capable, which is deeply tied to your sense of independence and self-worth. And to make matters worse, the health scare has made you even more anxious about needing help, which feels like admitting weakness. Can we just acknowledge the anxiety for a moment? It's understandable that talking about this is making you feel uneasy, but trying to slow down might be counterproductive right now. Instead, can we focus on how the fear of being judged is affecting your thoughts and behaviors? How does that fear show up for you in this moment?

Patient: I guess right now it comes up as this quick voice saying "they'll think I'm incompetent," and my head immediately starts replaying things and hunting for fixes. Behavior-wise I either over-explain, rewrite messages, avoid eye contact, or just clam up and not ask for help — and since the health scare, that avoidance feels even louder. I don't know, it's making me anxious talking about it—can we slow down?

Therapist: The quick voice is really loud right now, isn't it? It's like a constant critic that's always jumping in and making you think you're not good enough. And the replaying of things, the hunting for fixes... it's like your mind is trying to control every situation, every interaction. You're trying to avoid any potential judgment, any potential criticism. And the health scare has made that avoidance feel even more overwhelming. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and fear. Can we just take a deep breath and acknowledge the fact that you're trying to avoid judgment, even though it's not serving you? It's not serving you right now, in this moment, but you're trying. Can we explore that feeling of trying to avoid judgment a bit more? What does it feel like, really, when you're trying to avoid judgment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is exploring that supposed to help me right now? When I'm trying to avoid judgment it feels like walking on eggshells: my heart races, I rehearse every word, my stomach tightens, and part of me goes numb so I don't have to feel vulnerable. I don't know, talking about it makes me uneasy and overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Exploring how to avoid judgment might not seem directly helpful right now. But sometimes, taking a step back and understanding the underlying patterns and emotions can actually help us move forward in a more meaningful way. It's like trying to take a deep breath and see the situation from a different perspective. It's not about avoiding judgment right now, but about acknowledging what's driving your behavior.

It's clear that the feeling of vulnerability is overwhelming you, and that's making it hard for you to interact with others or even yourself. It's like you're stuck in a state of hyper-vigilance, where every interaction feels like a potential threat. Can we just acknowledge this feeling of vulnerability for a moment? It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to not know how to deal with it right now.

Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to repeat after me: "I am feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable right now." Just say it, and feel the words. Don't try to analyze it or fix it, just acknowledge it.

Patient: I... I am feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable right now. I don't know, saying it out loud feels weird — my chest is tight and I'm kind of shaky. How is that supposed to help? Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's understandable that saying it out loud feels weird. It's like your body is already tensed up, and hearing your own words can be jarring. But sometimes, acknowledging those feelings, even if it's just for a second, can be a tiny step forward.

It's not about how it's supposed to help, exactly. It's just about being present with those feelings right now. Can we focus on that, for just a moment? The feeling of being overwhelmed and vulnerable is right here, in this moment. It's not something to be fixed or changed right away. It's just something to be acknowledged.

Take a deep breath in, and out, and try to let go of that need to fix it or change it right now. Just be with the feeling of being overwhelmed, and the feeling of vulnerability. Let's just sit with those feelings for a second, without trying to do anything about them. Can you do that?

Patient: I can try. I don't know—when I try to sit with it my chest gets tighter and my mind just starts hunting for fixes, like rewriting something or rehearsing explanations. I'm not sure I'm doing it right and it's making me anxious, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like your body is already responding to the feeling of being overwhelmed, even before you try to sit with it. The physical tension, the mental distraction... it's like your body is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable.

That's okay. It's not about doing it "right" or "wrong". It's just about being gentle with yourself, right now. Can we take a tiny step back? Instead of trying to sit with the feeling of being overwhelmed, let's try to notice just one small thing. Like, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just notice that. Don't try to think about anything else. Just be with that small sensation.

If your mind starts to wander (and it probably will), that's okay. Just acknowledge the thought, and gently bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet. Don't try to push the thought away or fix it. Just be with it, for a second. Can you do that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my feet supposed to help? I can try though: I feel the heels on the chair, my toes are a bit cold, and my weight feels a little uneven. I don't know, my mind's already racing to fixes and it's making me anxious, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Noticing your feet might seem like a small thing, but it's a tiny step to help you focus on the present moment. It's not about how it's supposed to help, exactly. It's just about giving your mind a tiny break from trying to fix everything.

The fact that your mind is already racing to fixes is actually a good sign. It means you're recognizing that you're trying to avoid feeling vulnerable, and that's a step forward. Now, instead of trying to push those thoughts away, can we try to acknowledge them? Just acknowledge the thought "I need to fix this" or "I need to explain that." Don't try to act on it right now, just acknowledge it.

And then, can we go back to noticing your feet? Just for a second. Don't think about anything else. Just be with the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — I notice the thought "I need to fix this" and "I need to explain," and I'm not going to act on it right now. My feet: I feel the heels on the floor, my toes are cold, my weight's a bit uneven, but I'm really jumpy and my mind keeps racing. I don't know, I'm getting more anxious and distracted — can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It's like you're doing a good job of acknowledging your thoughts and your physical sensations. The fact that you're recognizing the jumpy feeling is a good sign.

Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the sensation of your feet again. Just for a second, try to notice the sensation of your feet on the floor without thinking about anything else. Don't try to push the thought "I need to fix this" away, just acknowledge it and let it be.

If you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious again, that's okay. Just take a deep breath and bring your attention back to your feet. Try to focus on the sensation of the floor beneath you, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your feet touching the floor.

Can we start with just one thing? Can you notice the sensation of one foot touching the floor? Just that foot, for a second, without thinking about anything else?

Patient: Okay, I can try. I notice my right foot — heel on the floor, a little pressure under the ball, toes a bit cold — but my chest's tight and my mind keeps leaping to things I should fix. I don't know, it's really hard to stay with just the foot; I'm jumpy and anxious, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're doing a great job of bringing your attention back to your foot, even though your mind keeps wandering. The fact that you're noticing the sensation of your right foot, including the pressure under the ball and the cold toes, is really helpful.

Let's try something. Instead of trying to focus on your right foot, can you try to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out, without thinking about anything else. Can you do that?

If your mind starts to wander (and it probably will), just gently bring your attention back to your breath. Don't try to push your thoughts away or fix them, just observe them for a second and then come back to your breath.

Can you try that for just a second? Just focus on your breath, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: Okay—I can try. I notice the air going in and out but it's shallow and my chest's still tight, and my mind keeps leaping to things I should fix so I can't settle. I don't know, it's really hard to just watch it—I'm getting more anxious and distracted, can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to focus on your breath, but your mind is still racing and your body is tense. That's okay. It's not about focusing on your breath right now, it's about taking a tiny step back and acknowledging how you're feeling.

Can we try something? Can you just say to yourself, "I'm feeling really anxious right now"? Don't try to analyze it or fix it, just acknowledge the feeling. You can even say it out loud if that feels helpful.

Then, can we try to take one tiny step back further? Can you take a deep breath and slowly count to one with me? Just one breath, and one count. One...

Patient: One. I tried to breathe in but it's shallow—my chest's tight and my mind's already leaping to things I should fix. I don't know, I'm feeling pretty anxious and distracted right now; can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and struggling to focus. That's okay, we can definitely slow down further.

Can we try something completely different? Instead of trying to focus on your breath or calm down, can we just acknowledge that you're feeling really anxious right now? That's all we're going to focus on for a moment.

It's okay if you're feeling anxious, it's okay if you're feeling overwhelmed. Just acknowledging that you're feeling this way right now is a big step. Let's just stay with that feeling for a moment, without trying to change it or fix it.

Can you just say to yourself, "I'm feeling really anxious right now"? No need to analyze it, no need to justify it. Just acknowledge it. You can even say it out loud if that feels helpful.

Patient: I... I'm feeling really anxious right now. My chest's tight, my heart's racing, and my mind's already leaping to things I should fix. I don't know, saying it out loud feels weird and I'm still pretty overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to acknowledge your anxiety, but it's still feeling overwhelming and hard to process. That's okay.

Let's try something gentle. Can you just put one hand on your chest, where you feel the tightness? Just put your hand there for a second, without thinking about it too much. Just notice the sensation of your hand on your chest, and the sensation of the tightness.

Then, can you just take a tiny step back further? Can you look away from me for a second, and just focus on your breath? Not really breathe, just... just notice that your body is still. Just notice that you're sitting there, with your hand on your chest.

Let's just sit with that for a second. No need to do anything, no need to fix anything. Just be.

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest and it feels tight and kind of fluttery, my breath's still shallow. I tried to look away and just be, but my mind keeps leaping to things I should fix and now I'm more jumpy and distracted. I don't know, this is making me really uneasy — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to calm down and just be present, but your mind is still racing and your body is tense. That's okay, we can take it one step at a time.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on your hand on your chest or your breath, can you try to focus on your feet on the ground? Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the feeling of your weight distributed on them.

Can you just look down at your feet for a second? Notice the shape of your feet, the color of your socks. Just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor.

We don't have to do anything with your anxiety or your mind right now. We just need to focus on this tiny, tiny thing. Can you try that for a second?

Patient: I... I can try. I look down — my feet are flat on the floor, heels heavy, toes cold, weight a bit more on my right foot — but my chest's still tight and my mind's already jumping to things I should fix. I don't know, this is really hard and I'm getting jumpy; can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to focus on your feet, but your mind is still racing and your body is tense. That's okay. We can take a step back even further.

Let's try something really simple. Can you just say to yourself, "I am sitting." That's all you need to say. Just "I am sitting." No need to think about anything else, no need to analyze anything. Just be with that single sentence.

Say it with me: "I am sitting." Just say it, and don't think about anything else. Let's just sit with that sentence for a second.

Patient: I am sitting. I don't know, saying that out loud feels strange — my chest's still tight and my mind keeps jumping to things I should fix. I'm getting really anxious; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like saying the sentence "I am sitting" is a bit uncomfortable for you, and it's not helping with your anxiety. That's okay.

Let's try something else. Instead of saying a sentence, can you just take a moment to notice the physical sensations in your body? Just notice the feeling of your feet on the floor, the feeling of the air on your skin, the sensation of your chest tightening.

Can you just sit with that sensation for a second, without thinking about anything else? Just observe it, and see what happens. We don't need to do anything with your anxiety right now. We just need to focus on this tiny, tiny thing. Can you try that for a second?

Patient: I don't know... I can try. My chest's tight, that knot's low under my ribs, my hands feel cold, my heart's racing, and my mind keeps leaping to stuff I should fix. I'm getting really anxious and distracted—can we slow down?
