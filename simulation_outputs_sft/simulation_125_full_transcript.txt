Patient: Lately I've been feeling overwhelmed by this sadness and a kind of fogged motivation since I lost someone close to me. It's starting to leak into my relationship — I find myself withdrawing or snapping, and I guess that's worrying me. I don't know, I try to stay upbeat and distract myself at work as a data scientist, but at home it's getting harder.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses feelings of being overwhelmed by sadness and a lack of motivation, which are likely tied to the recent loss of someone close. They mention specific challenges in their relationship due to their emotional state, such as withdrawing or snapping. The goal is to explore how these emotions and behaviors are impacting their life and relationships.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pain of losing someone close is really seeping into your daily life, making it hard to find motivation and connect with others. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel that sadness or fog at work? Does it feel like it's affecting your performance or interactions with your colleagues?

Patient: Mostly I throw myself into work and use it as a distraction — I can hyperfocus on a dataset for a while, then the fog hits and I drift off. I guess my performance hasn't collapsed, but I miss deadlines sometimes and get impatient in meetings, and I worry colleagues notice. I don't know, I try to laugh it off, but it's getting harder to keep up the upbeat act.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using work as a distraction to cope with their emotions, but this is leading to decreased performance, missed deadlines, and irritability in meetings. They're worried that their colleagues might notice and are struggling to maintain the facade of being upbeat. The goal is to help them acknowledge the difficulty of hiding their true emotions and consider the impact on their relationships and overall well-being.

Therapist Answer:
It seems like the distraction of work isn't quite working for you like it used to. When you're in the middle of focusing on a dataset, it's like your mind is there, but when the fog hits, you're not really present in your work. It's understandable that you're worried about how your colleagues might perceive you. Can you think of a moment recently where you felt like you couldn't keep up the act, and what happened after that?

Patient: A couple weeks ago I was leading a project meeting and mid-way my head just went fuzzy — I couldn't follow the thread and I stumbled through my slides. Afterwards a colleague pulled me aside and asked if I was okay and I just said "I'm fine" and left feeling ashamed; at home I snapped at my partner over something tiny and then shut down. I don't know, I guess I pushed them away — it's kind of hard to talk about, can we... maybe talk about ways to handle the fog instead?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient shared a recent experience where their emotional fog significantly impacted their professional performance, leading to feelings of shame and self-doubt. They also revealed a subsequent incident where they snapped at their partner, indicating a pattern of avoidance and defensiveness. The goal is to help them acknowledge the patterns and explore ways to address the emotional fog without pushing them away or avoiding difficult emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to share that, especially the part about snapping at your partner. It sounds like you're struggling to manage the fog when it hits, and it's affecting not just your work but also your relationships. Before we dive into strategies, can I just say that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that you're not alone in this? It's not about being "fine" or putting on a mask; it's about being human and facing these emotions head-on. How does that sound to you?

Patient: I appreciate that — I don't know, it helps to hear, but it also makes me feel exposed and a little defensive. I guess I'm nervous about going into the messy parts, so can we start with concrete strategies for when the fog hits instead?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a mix of emotions - relief that we're discussing this further, but also defensiveness and nervousness about exploring the emotional aspects. They're requesting a shift to more practical strategies for managing the fog, which suggests a desire to build confidence and momentum before delving deeper into emotional exploration. The goal is to establish a balance between offering reassurance and support while still pushing for progress.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on some concrete strategies for when the fog hits. One approach is to take a brief pause before reacting to a situation. Can you think of a time recently where you might have reacted impulsively, and how taking a short pause might have changed the outcome? Another idea is to use a simple physical cue, like taking a few deep breaths or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, to ground yourself before responding. Which of these resonates with you, or is there another way you've found helpful in the past?

Patient: Yeah, like after that meeting — when the fog hit and a colleague asked if I was okay, I just sort of froze and then later snapped at my partner. If I'd paused to take a few deep breaths or just felt my feet on the floor, maybe I wouldn't have reacted so badly. I don't know, I guess the breathing thing sounds doable, but I get weird when someone asks me point-blank if I'm okay — can we talk about quick things I could say in that moment?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient recognizes the value of pausing and grounding themselves in the moment, but is struggling with the immediate question of how to respond to concerns about their well-being. They're requesting some alternatives to "I'm fine," which might help them avoid feeling defensive or dismissed. The goal is to find a way to acknowledge the question without feeling like they're being interrogated or forced to reveal more than they're ready to share.

Therapist Answer:
It makes sense that the question of "Are you okay?" can be a bit triggering. What if, in the moment, you wanted to respond with something like "I'm good, thanks" or "I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, but I'm managing"? Or maybe you could say something like "I need a minute to think about that" or "Can we talk about this later?" These responses acknowledge the question without feeling like you're giving a full report. What do you think about trying out some of these alternatives in a low-stakes situation, like with a colleague or friend, before it comes up in a more high-pressure situation like with your partner?

Patient: Yeah, "I need a minute" or "Can we talk about this later" sounds doable. I don't know, I'm worried it'll come off like I'm dodging things or being fake — I hate rehearsed lines. Can we practice a couple of short, simple responses together, maybe role-play a low-stakes version? Also, I'm starting to feel a bit exposed talking about this, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concern about using rehearsed responses, fear of coming across as insincere, and a desire to slow down the conversation due to feeling exposed. They're also seeking a way to practice using alternative responses without feeling like they're "dodging" or being insincere. The goal is to find a way to build confidence in using these new responses without feeling overwhelmed or like they're revealing too much.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and start with something really simple. Can I ask you a question, and then you can just respond in the moment, without thinking too much? If it's okay with you, I'll start with something like, "Hey, how's your day going so far?" Just give me a brief response, and we can go from there. No need to worry about saying anything in particular; we can just see how it feels to respond in a more natural way.

Patient: I guess it's been kind of up and down — busy at work but distracted, and at home I'm just tired. I don't know, it feels a bit exposing to practice this, but yeah, can we try a low-stakes role-play now?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to open up a bit more, sharing a general sense of their day without putting too much emphasis on their emotions. They're also acknowledging the discomfort of practicing these responses, but willing to try. The goal is to use this opportunity to practice the alternative responses in a low-stakes setting, making it feel less exposed and more manageable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a low-stakes role-play. I'll start by asking you a question, and you can respond as you normally would. Then, I'll try one of the alternative responses you've been thinking about, and we can see how it feels. Here's the question: "You seem a bit distracted at work today. Everything okay?" Go ahead and respond naturally.

Patient: I don't know, I'm a bit off today — busy with work but my head keeps drifting. I guess I'm okay, just need a minute to collect myself.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient responded with a natural, concise answer, but also slipped back into using the "I'm fine" phrase. This is an opportunity to introduce one of the alternative responses we've been practicing.

Therapist Answer:
You said "I guess I'm okay, just need a minute to collect myself." Instead of responding with "I'm fine," what if you had said something like "I'm good, thanks" or "I need a minute to think about that"? This response acknowledges your answer while also being more direct and concise. Let's try it out. You can respond again, and I'll try the alternative response this time.

Patient: Okay... I'm good, thanks — I just need a minute to collect myself. I don't know, this feels a bit awkward to rehearse, but I guess I can try.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient responded with the alternative response we've been practicing, "I'm good, thanks." This shows a good understanding of how to use the new phrase without feeling forced or insincere. The goal is to continue practicing and building confidence with this new response.

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to feel a bit awkward when rehearsing, but it's a good sign that you're willing to try. Let's keep going. I'll try to ask a question that might trigger a similar response. Here's another one: "You seem like you're carrying a lot on your plate right now. Is everything okay?" Take your time, and see how you respond.

Patient: I don't know, I guess I am carrying a lot — deadlines, the grief, and just feeling worn out. It makes me snappy and I hate that I shut people out. Can we practice a really short line I can use, like "I need a minute" or something even simpler?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient shared a lot of emotions and challenges, but also expressed a desire to keep the conversation concise and focused on a single response. They're looking for a simple, effective way to handle the emotional overwhelm.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a very brief response, maybe something like "I'm okay" or "I need a minute." Let's practice one more thing. What if you just said "I'm okay"? It's a simple, direct response that acknowledges the question without feeling like you need to explain everything. Can you just say that to me, without thinking too much?

Patient: I'm okay. I don't know, it feels weird saying that—like I'm shrinking it down to something tidy when it's not. Can we slow down a bit? I think "I need a minute" might actually feel more honest.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to reconcile their desire for simplicity with the emotional complexity of their feelings. They're feeling a bit uneasy about saying "I'm okay," but also acknowledging that it might be more honest to say "I need a minute." The goal is to find a balance between simplicity and honesty.

Therapist Answer:
It's natural to feel a bit uneasy about simplifying your emotions, but sometimes saying "I need a minute" can be a powerful way to acknowledge your needs without feeling like you're dodging the issue. Let's take a step back and try to find a way to use this phrase that feels more honest for you. Can we start by exploring what it means to say "I need a minute" in a way that feels authentic to you? What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about that phrase?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the first thing is that it feels like permission to stop pretending for a moment, to breathe and not perform. But it also feels exposing, like admitting I'm not coping and that makes me nervous — can we talk about how to use it with my partner instead?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing the value of "I need a minute" as a way to pause and recharge, but also acknowledging the anxiety of admitting vulnerability. They're seeking guidance on how to use this phrase in a more specific context, with their partner.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're thinking about how to use "I need a minute" in a way that feels authentic and vulnerable with your partner. That takes a lot of courage. Let's explore how you can use this phrase to communicate your needs in a way that feels safe and honest with your partner. What do you think might happen if you say "I need a minute" to your partner, and then take a few deep breaths, or go for a short walk, or do something that helps you feel more grounded? What if, instead of feeling exposed, you felt more connected and understood? Can we practice a scenario where you say "I need a minute" to your partner, and see how it might go?

Patient: I don't know — I can try. I guess I'd say something like, "I need a minute; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we pause and talk in a bit?" But I'm worried that'll sound like I'm avoiding them or being cold — can we role-play how to say it so it feels honest and not dismissive?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the fear of coming across as avoiding or dismissive when using the phrase "I need a minute" with their partner. They're looking for a way to express their need for pause and reassurance without undermining their connection.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're willing to try. Let's role-play how to say "I need a minute" in a way that feels authentic and connected. I'll play the role of your partner, and we can see how it goes. Here's what I'll do: I'll say something that starts a conversation, and then you can respond with "I need a minute; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we pause and talk in a bit?" See how it feels to say that phrase in a way that feels honest and connected.

(Note: The therapist will now pause, then simulate a partner's response. The goal is for the patient to respond as naturally as possible.)

Partner: "Hey, what's up? You seem a bit distant lately. Is everything okay?"

Patient: (thinking) "I need a minute; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we pause and talk in a bit?"

(Note: The therapist will then provide feedback and guidance based on the patient's response.)

Therapist: How did that feel? Did it come across as you intended?

Patient: I don't know — it felt...okay-ish, but awkward. I guess it seemed more honest than saying "I'm fine," but I'm still worried it might come off like I'm shutting them out. Maybe adding a brief reassurance would help, like "I need a minute — I still want to talk, I just need to breathe" — can we try role-playing that version? Also, I'm starting to feel exposed again, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still feeling uncertain about expressing their needs, but is willing to experiment with a few tweaks to feel more authentic. They're also expressing a desire to slow down the process, which suggests they're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the conversation.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're thinking about how to soften the blow of "I need a minute" while still conveying your needs. Adding a reassurance like "I still want to talk, I just need to breathe" is a good idea. Let's slow down and take a more gentle approach. We'll start with a simpler conversation, and then gradually build up to the "I need a minute" phrase. I'll start by asking you a question that's a bit more low-key.

(Note: The therapist will ask a simple question and wait for a brief response.)

Therapist: How's your day going so far?

(Note: The therapist will then wait for a brief response, then ask a slightly more pointed question.)

Therapist: Is everything okay? You seem a bit...distracted.

(Note: The therapist will then wait for a brief response, and the patient can start to work their way up to the "I need a minute" phrase.)

Patient: (thinking) "I need a minute; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we pause and talk in a bit?"

Patient: I need a minute — I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we pause and talk in a bit? I still want to talk, I just need to breathe and collect myself. I don't know, it's kind of awkward to say out loud, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing their needs in a more authentic way, but is still feeling a bit awkward about saying it out loud. They're also expressing a desire to slow down the process, which suggests they're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the conversation.

Therapist Answer:
It's great that you're being honest about how it feels to say "I need a minute." It's okay to acknowledge that it's awkward, and that's a natural part of the process. Let's take a step back and focus on the present moment. I'm not here to judge you or put pressure on you. My goal is to support you and help you feel more comfortable expressing your needs.

(Note: The therapist will then pause and ask a simple question to help the patient focus on the present moment.)

Therapist: What's the first thing you'd like to talk about right now? Is there something specific that's on your mind?

(Note: The therapist will then wait for the patient's response and build from there.)

This is a good point to slow down and focus on the therapeutic relationship. The goal is to create a safe and supportive space for the patient to express themselves. By acknowledging the patient's feelings and needs, the therapist can help them feel more comfortable and build trust.

Patient: I guess the first thing is that I'm worried my grief and this fog are hurting my partner — I keep snapping and then shutting down, and I don't know how to stop it. I'd like to work on ways to say "I need a minute" that actually feel honest, but talking about it makes me feel exposed, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a deep concern about the impact of their grief and fog on their partner, and is seeking ways to communicate their needs without feeling overwhelmed. They're also acknowledging the discomfort of talking about their emotions, which suggests a strong desire to avoid feeling exposed.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that you're worried about how your partner is being affected, and that you want to find a way to communicate your needs that feels authentic. However, I want to gently encourage you to slow down a bit more. Talking about your emotions can be challenging, but it's an important part of processing and healing.

Let's take a step back and focus on one small aspect of this conversation. Can we explore just how you're feeling right now, without worrying about what to say next or how to say it? Can you take a few deep breaths and just notice your physical sensations and emotions?

(Note: The therapist will then wait for the patient to respond, and then ask a simple question to help them focus on their present-moment experience.)

Therapist: What's your body feeling right now? Is there any tension, any relaxation, or anything else?

(Note: The goal is to create a calm and safe space for the patient to explore their emotions. By focusing on the present moment, the therapist can help the patient build trust and confidence.)

Patient: I don't know — my chest feels heavy and my shoulders are tight, like there's a knot in my throat, and my breathing's kind of shallow. My jaw's clenched and my mind keeps drifting to work stuff or memories, which makes it hard to stay here. I'm feeling exposed talking about it, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a range of physical sensations, including a heavy chest, tight shoulders, and shallow breathing, which suggest a high level of emotional distress. They're also struggling to focus on the present moment, as their mind keeps drifting to work-related thoughts and memories. The patient is feeling exposed and uncomfortable about sharing these emotions, which is understandable.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of physical tension right now, and it's hard to focus on anything else. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you feel more comfortable. Let's take a break from talking about your emotions for a minute, and see if we can find a way to calm down your physical sensations.

Can I suggest something? Would you like to take a few deep breaths with me, or try some physical relaxation techniques, like rolling your shoulders or unclenching your jaw? Sometimes, just focusing on our physical bodies can help us feel more grounded and present.

(Note: The therapist will then wait for the patient to respond, and then offer physical relaxation techniques to help them calm down.)

Therapist: Would you like to take a few deep breaths with me? Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let's focus on your breath for a minute.

Patient: Okay... I can try. I just did a slow breath in and out and it helped a little, but my chest still feels heavy — I don't know, can we do one more, slower? I'm feeling exposed, so please go slow.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to continue with the deep breathing exercise, but is still feeling uncomfortable and exposed about their emotions. They're repeating their request to go slow, which suggests that they're trying to create a sense of control and comfort in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I'll go even slower this time. Let's take a deep breath together. I'll count to four, and you take a breath in through your nose to four, hold it to four, and then exhale through your mouth to four. That's a slow, slow breath in. Four... one... two... three... four. Now, hold it. One... two... three... four. And exhale slowly through your mouth. One... two... three... four. Let's take it one step at a time.

(Note: The therapist will continue to count slowly as they breathe, creating a calming and soothing atmosphere. The goal is to help the patient feel more relaxed and grounded, even if they're still feeling uncomfortable about their emotions.)

Patient: Okay... that actually helped a little — my chest feels a bit lighter and my shoulders a tiny bit looser, though there's still a heaviness. Can we do one more slow breath, and then maybe try practicing a very short line I can use with my partner, like "I need a minute" with that extra reassurance? I don't know, I'm feeling exposed talking about this, so please go slow.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is acknowledging the slight improvement in their physical sensations after the deep breathing exercise, but still feels a sense of heaviness. They're willing to try again with a short line, but are still feeling vulnerable about sharing their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one more slow breath together. I'll count to four, and you take a breath in through your nose to four, hold it to four, and then exhale through your mouth to four. That's a slow, slow breath in. Four... one... two... three... four. Now, hold it. One... two... three... four. And exhale slowly through your mouth. One... two... three... four.

After this breath, we'll try practicing a short line with your partner. I'll guide you through it, and you can try using it in a way that feels natural and authentic. Remember, it's okay to take your time, and we'll go slow. We're not trying to rush through this conversation.

Let's start with a very short phrase: "I need a minute to collect myself." Can you repeat that phrase to me, and then we'll think about how to add that extra reassurance you mentioned?

Patient: I need a minute to collect myself. I still want to talk — I just need a moment to breathe and come back. I don't know, it feels awkward saying it out loud, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is practicing the short line, adding reassurance to express their need for a moment to breathe and return to the conversation. They're still feeling a bit awkward about saying it out loud, which suggests that they're trying to create a sense of comfort and control in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting more comfortable with the phrase. Let's try breaking it down even further. Can you focus on just saying "I need a minute" without adding the rest of the sentence? Just say those three words, and then we can add the rest if you feel comfortable.

Let's start with just "I need a minute." Take your time, and when you're ready, say it out loud.

(Note: The therapist will wait for the patient to respond, then gradually build back up to the full phrase.)

Patient: I need a minute. I don't know — it still feels awkward to say out loud, so can we pause for a second and go a bit slower?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still feeling a bit uncomfortable about saying the phrase out loud, and is requesting a brief pause to slow down the process. This suggests that they're trying to create a sense of control and comfort in the present moment.

It's okay to take a pause. Let's slow down for a second. Take a deep breath with me, and when you're ready, we'll try saying the phrase again. This time, I'll start by saying "I need a minute" out loud, and then you can respond with "I need a minute". We can take it one step at a time.

Let's start again. I need a minute.

Patient: I need a minute. I don't know, saying it back still feels weird — can we take one more slow breath and then try it again? I'm feeling exposed, so please go slow.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is requesting a final slow breath before trying the phrase again, which suggests that they're feeling anxious about saying it out loud. They're also reiterating that saying the phrase back still feels weird, which indicates that they're struggling to find their footing.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one more slow breath together. I'll count to four, and you take a breath in through your nose to four, hold it to four, and then exhale through your mouth to four. That's a slow, slow breath in. Four... one... two... three... four. Now, hold it. One... two... three... four. And exhale slowly through your mouth. One... two... three... four.

After this breath, we'll try saying the phrase again. I'll start by saying "I need a minute" out loud, and then you can respond with "I need a minute". Remember, we're taking it one step at a time, and I'm here to support you.

That's a slow, slow breath in. Four... one... two... three... four. Now, hold it. One... two... three... four. And exhale slowly through your mouth. One... two... three... four.

After this breath, we'll try saying the phrase again. Remember, I'm here to support you, and it's okay to take your time. We can try it in a way that feels more natural to you. What do you need to feel comfortable saying "I need a minute"? Is there something specific that would help you feel more at ease?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd need some reassurance that saying it won't be heard as rejection, maybe a tiny script we both rehearse so it doesn't feel so raw (like, "I need a minute; I'll be back in 10"). A clear, agreed-upon signal with my partner and a plan for what I do in that minute would help — even something as simple as a short walk or a breathing exercise. Honestly, I'm feeling exposed talking about this, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a deep need for reassurance and structure in using the phrase "I need a minute", which suggests a significant amount of emotional vulnerability. They're seeking a simple script and agreed-upon signal to help them feel more at ease, which indicates a desire to feel more grounded and in control.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and focus on creating a plan that feels more manageable and reassuring to you. A clear signal and a simple plan for what you do during the minute can help you feel more grounded.

Let's start with the signal. What kind of signal would feel most comfortable for you to use with your partner? For example, a specific word, phrase, or gesture? We can work together to come up with something that feels natural and easy to use.

Once we have a signal, we can think about what you'd like to do during the minute. A short walk, some deep breathing, or just sitting quietly can be a good starting point. We can also explore other options that might help you feel more focused and present during that time.

Remember, the goal is to create a plan that feels manageable and reassuring to you. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way.

Let's start by brainstorming some ideas for signals and plans that might feel more comfortable for you. What do you think might help you feel more at ease when using the phrase "I need a minute"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess a tiny, agreed-on script would make it less raw, like saying aloud, "I need a minute — back in 10," so it doesn't sound like I'm shutting them out. A nonverbal signal could work too (a hand on my chest, or three gentle taps), something simple so I don't have to perform words when I'm blank.

For the minute itself, I think concrete actions would help: a 5–10 minute walk outside, a short breathing set (box breathing: 4-4-4-4), or a quick grounding check (name 3 things you can see, 2 you can touch, 1 you can hear). It would help if my partner agreed to a short script to reassure me afterward — like, "Okay, take your minute. I'm here when you're ready" — so it doesn't feel like rejection. I don't know, it still feels a bit exposing to plan this, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing a desire for a simple, agreed-upon script and nonverbal signal to help them feel more at ease when using the phrase "I need a minute". They're seeking concrete actions during the minute to help them feel more grounded, and a reassuring response from their partner to help them feel less exposed.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're looking for a way to make this process feel more manageable and less overwhelming for you. I'm here to support you, and we can take this at your pace.

Let's start with the script. I like the idea of saying something like, "I need a minute — back in 10." What do you think about using a simple, consistent phrase like that? It might help your partner understand what you need and give you some space.

For the minute itself, the idea of taking a short walk or doing some deep breathing exercises is great. It's also a good idea to have a clear plan for what you'll do during that time. We can explore some of those options further.

Regarding the nonverbal signal, a gentle tap on the arm or a hand on the chest could be a good way to go. It's simple and doesn't require you to say much.

Finally, I think it's a great idea to have your partner agree to a short script to reassure you afterward. Something like, "Okay, take your minute. I'm here when you're ready" could help you feel more supported and less rejected.

Let's take a step back and think about how all of these elements might come together for you. What do you think would help you feel most comfortable and supported when using the phrase "I need a minute"?

Patient: I guess having a tiny agreed script and a clear time limit would help — something like, "I need a minute, back in 10," and my partner replies, "Okay, take your minute; I'm here when you're ready." A nonverbal signal option and a concrete plan for the minute (a 5–10 minute walk, box breathing, or a quick grounding exercise plus a phone timer) would make it feel less raw. I don't know, talking about it makes me feel exposed — can we slow down a bit?
