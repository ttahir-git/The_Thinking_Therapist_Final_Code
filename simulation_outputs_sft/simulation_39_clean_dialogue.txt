Patient: I know I tend to over-intellectualize this, but lately I've been feeling paradoxically stuck and directionless — my sense of self seems to have collapsed into just 'business owner' and everything else feels peripheral. Since starting this demanding new program my OCD has flared, and I catch myself constructing elaborate narratives about identity diffusion and role salience instead of actually sitting with the unease. I keep oscillating between exuberant multitasking and this creeping aimlessness, and I'm here because I want to figure out whether anything beyond the company genuinely matters to me.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you catch yourself oscillating between exuberant multitasking and aimlessness? What is it about those states that feels most unsettling or unclear to you right now?

Patient: It usually starts with this frenetic activation—I'm scheduling, onboarding, chasing new projects—like busyness is a prophylactic against the possibility that I might not matter outside the company. Then the pendulum swings to a diffuse aimlessness where nothing registers as having intrinsic weight, and I immediately translate that into theories—role-salience collapse, identity diffusion—rather than actually sitting with the unease. What feels most unsettling is that both states function as avoidance strategies: one by over-activation, the other by cognitive shutdown, and that meta-oscillation itself amplifies the anxiety about whether anything beyond the business is genuinely meaningful, making even small decisions feel paralyzing.

Therapist: Let's break down this meta-oscillation: it sounds like both states, over-activation and aimlessness, serve as avoidance strategies, but in different ways. Can you think of a moment where, instead of immediately falling into either state, you could try sitting with the unease, without judgment or distraction? What would it feel like to actually pause and observe your own unease, rather than trying to fill it with busyness or narratives about meaning?

Patient: If I actually paused—like after shutting my laptop at night or sitting in the car between meetings—it would feel like flipping from an executive narrative into a sensorimotor register: a low, steady constriction in my chest, slightly shallow breathing, a buzzing behind my forehead, and this odd anticipatory silence about whether I matter outside the company. Instead of sitting with that tactile, quietly unpleasant stuff, my reflex is to intellectualize—label it, theorize its origins, or draft a plan to 'fix' it—and I usually last maybe thirty seconds before I distract myself. I'm trying to stay with it, but I get impatient and slip back into analysis, which is maddening because I can't tell if I'm avoiding fear, sadness, or just boredom.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to tolerate the physical sensations of unease, especially the constriction in your chest and the buzzing behind your forehead. Can you think of a way to approach these sensations that doesn't involve intellectualizing or distracting yourself? What if, instead of trying to change them or label them, you simply allowed yourself to be with the physical sensations as they are, without judgment or effort? What would happen if you sat with that physical discomfort for a longer period, say 30 seconds, 1 minute, or even 5 minutes, without trying to escape or change it?

Patient: If I actually sat with it for 30 seconds to a minute, the chest constriction tightens a bit and my breathing skims the surface, and a loop of anticipatory, catastrophizing thoughts kicks in about being nothing beyond the business. By about ninety seconds my reflexive response is cognitive—label it, theorize it, draft a mitigation plan—like narration to domesticate the sensation. If I could force myself to five minutes (which I rarely manage) the intensity sometimes plateaus and morphs into a duller, more mournful ache—less alarm, more a tired, hollow quality—but I almost always bail by switching to busyness or analysis. I'm trying to let it just be, honestly, but impatience and that useful-to-a-fault intellect pull me back into explaining instead of feeling, and that's maddening.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a loop where you try to calm down, but then your mind starts racing with catastrophic thoughts, and you feel the urge to intellectualize again. Can you try to notice when this loop starts to kick in, and what triggers it? Is it when you feel a certain level of discomfort, or when you start to think about specific themes, like your identity or the business? Once you're aware of the trigger, can you try to make a small pause before acting on it? For example, you could take a deep breath, or simply say to yourself, "Wait, let's just observe this feeling for a second." What happens when you make this small pause?

Patient: When I try that pause I usually catch the loop right at the precipice — it’s most reliably triggered by decision points or those mental prompts about whether I’m “just” the business, or by the hollow down-time between meetings. Taking a deliberate breath does open a tiny metacognitive gap: breathing slows, the catastrophic narration loses velocity, and for maybe ten to twenty seconds there’s a neutral, almost flat register where the chest-constriction and buzz are more noticeable. But my reflexive move is to fill that gap with analysis — labeling, theorizing, drafting a mitigation plan — and impatience or a sense of usefulness-as-salvation drags me back into doing rather than being, so the pause feels fragile and short-lived, which is honestly maddening.

Therapist: It's interesting that you mention the pause feeling fragile and short-lived. Can you try to explore what's happening in that brief moment when you're not intellectuallyizing or distracting yourself? What are you noticing about the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts that are arising, and the overall feeling of being present? Are there any sensations, thoughts, or feelings that you're not paying attention to, but that might be worth exploring? Can you try to approach this pause with a greater sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to achieve a specific state or outcome?

Patient: In that brief pause I mostly register a somatic register — the chest tightens, breathing skims the surface, and there's this low, buzzing hum behind my forehead that wants to be put into words. Cognitively, a carousel of self-referential narratives spins up — role-salience questions, identity hypotheses — but beneath that there's a quieter undertow of melancholy, maybe even grief for versions of myself I never cultivated. When I try to approach it with curiosity I get awkward and impatient; my intellect immediately mobilizes to analyze and domesticate the feeling, and then I get annoyed at myself for analyzing the annoyance, which of course I can then theorize about.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to separate your intellectual curiosity from your emotional experience. Can you try to imagine what it would be like to approach this feeling without the need to understand it or make sense of it? What if you simply allowed the somatic sensations and the quieter undertow of melancholy to be present, without trying to analyze or label them? What if you didn't try to intellectualize the experience, but instead simply allowed it to be, like a wave washing over you? Can you try to imagine what that might feel like, and what it might be like to approach this feeling with a greater sense of acceptance and presence?

Patient: I can picture it — a slow, attenuating wave where the chest tightens and then, if I let it, loosens a bit, my breath deepens, and the buzzing behind my forehead becomes more like a hollow, mournful warmth moving through me rather than a problem to be solved. But the metacognitive reflex is instantaneous; my mind itches for an epistemic formulation to domesticate the feeling, and I already feel impatient and annoyed at myself for wanting to intellectualize it. So I'm left describing the idea of being present instead of actually being present, which is maddeningly circular. How am I supposed to practice staying with that wave without my brain turning it into another task or hypothesis — because I'm already getting restless just saying this.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the meta-level thinking again, where you're analyzing your own thought patterns and trying to change them. Can you try to take a step back from that meta-level thinking and simply observe what's happening in the present moment? Instead of asking yourself questions like "How am I supposed to practice staying with that wave?" or "Why am I getting restless?", try simply paying attention to the sensation of the chest tightening and loosening, the deepening of the breath, and the feeling of the warmth moving through you. What does it feel like to simply observe these sensations without trying to change them or intellectualize them? Can you try to stay with that for just a moment, without judgment or distraction?

Patient: When I try to just observe, the chest tugs sharp and then eases a bit, my breath lengthens a notch, and the buzzing behind my forehead drops to a duller hum. Pretty fast a metacognitive commentary kicks in—"label it, fix it"—and that commentary feels like a safety valve, which makes me feel exposed and impatient. I can hold it for maybe twenty or thirty seconds before the OCD reflexes mobilize another plan or narrative, and that failure to stay with it is honestly frustrating and makes me feel stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of directly addressing the metacognitive commentary, rather than trying to sidestep it or label it as "fixing" or "labeled". Can you try to take a more gentle and curious approach to this commentary, rather than trying to suppress or resist it? Instead of thinking "Label it, fix it", try asking yourself "What is the purpose of this commentary? Is it trying to protect me from something, or is it just a habitual response?" Try to explore the function of this commentary in a more nuanced way, rather than simply trying to stop it. What do you notice when you take a more gentle and curious approach to this commentary?

Patient: When I try to treat that "label it, fix it" commentary with curiosity, it actually softens—less an imperious commander and more a nervous bodyguard. Its function seems protective: it wants to inoculate me against vulnerability, shame, and the terrifying possibility that I'm only valuable as a business owner, so it mobilizes analyses, plans, and distractions. Curiosity lowers the chatter's volume enough that a quieter grief or loneliness becomes noticeable, but my reflexive intellect then catalogues the commentary's functions instead of inhabiting the grief, which just becomes another thing to master. I can see the benefit of a gentler stance, but I'm stuck on how to practice that without it turning into yet another productivity metric—what helps me actually do the curiosity without turning it into a task?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of integrating the curiosity and gentle stance into your overall practice, rather than trying to use it as a tool for productivity or self-improvement. Can you try to focus on the process of curiosity itself, rather than the outcome or the "task" of practicing it? Instead of thinking "How can I make this a more effective habit?", try simply asking yourself "What's happening right now, in this moment, as I'm exploring this commentary with curiosity?" Focus on the sensations, the thoughts, the emotions - the entire experience - rather than the goal or the outcome. What do you notice when you focus on the process, rather than the product?

Patient: When I actually focus on the process, I notice the micro-sensations more clearly—the chest tightens and then eases, breath lengthens in small increments, and a low hum of melancholy surfaces that curiosity makes a bit less shouty. Immediately, though, my epistemic reflex kicks in and starts metricizing the experience—timing it, evaluating efficacy, sketching a protocol—which makes me feel annoyed and a little helpless, like even curiosity has been co-opted into OCD-driven optimization. So I get these intermittent, genuine glimpses of presence that feel oddly promising, and at the same time I'm restless and frustrated that I can't seem to hold them without turning them into another project.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the need to disrupt the epistemic reflex, and cultivate a greater sense of acceptance and presence. Can you try to approach the experience with a sense of "what is happening now, without judgment"? Instead of thinking "I'm doing this wrong, or I'm not doing it right", try simply observing the sensations, the thoughts, the emotions - the entire experience - without trying to label, categorize, or evaluate it. Can you imagine asking yourself, "What is present right now, in this moment?" rather than "What am I doing with my mind?" Try to focus on the process, rather than the product. What do you notice when you approach the experience with a greater sense of acceptance and presence?

Patient: When I genuinely ask "what is present right now," I register concrete stuff first—the chest as a damp tightness that loosens in little waves, breath skimming then lengthening, and a persistent, high buzzing behind my forehead. Almost immediately an epistemic reflex recasts those sensations into narratives—role-salience collapse, identity hypotheses—which feels both anesthetizing and organizing. If I lean into acceptance the grief becomes quieter, less dramatized—more like a dimming lamp than a siren—but impatience and the urge to optimize the experience kick in fast, turning curiosity itself into a metric. So I notice the somatic detail and the meta-pattern simultaneously: awareness helps, but my habit of instrumentalizing even presence makes holding it steady really hard, and that frustrates me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the need to gently let go of the epistemic reflexes. Can you try to imagine a sense of "gentle unfolding" - not forcing the experience, but allowing it to unfold naturally? Instead of thinking "I need to get rid of this narrative", try simply observing the sensation of the narrative, without trying to change it. Can you ask yourself "What is the sensation of this narrative right now?" rather than "What is wrong with this narrative?" Try to focus on the process of unfolding, rather than trying to control it. What do you notice when you approach the experience with a greater sense of gentle unfolding?

Patient: Conceptually, the narrative feels like a metacognitive hum — a vigilant commentator that lubricates itself by translating embodied unease into explanatory prose. Physically it manifests as that forehead buzzing and a quick, thin tightening above the sternum, and phenomenologically it both soothes by making things orderly and erases the rawness beneath. I do want to let it unfold more gently, but my reflex is to annotate and optimize—I'm already getting restless just talking about it, and that restlessness feels like another layer of the same narrative.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the need to disrupt the cycle of annotation and optimization. Can you try to approach this experience with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to control it? Instead of thinking "I need to annotate this, or optimize it", try simply observing the sensations and the narrative without judgment. Can you ask yourself "What is the nature of this narrative? Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just a product of my own mind?" Try to focus on the present moment, without trying to change it. What do you notice when you approach the experience with a greater sense of curiosity and openness?

Patient: Approached with curiosity, the narrative reads like a metacognitive bodyguard—both a product of anxious cognition and a communicative signal pointing to a fear of being erased outside the business. Physically I still get that chest ache and a low yearning beneath it, but my epistemic reflex almost immediately proclivities to metricize and proceduralize the noticing, which smothers the openness. I'm trying to sustain a genuinely curious stance, but I get restless and annoyed that curiosity itself becomes another task—I'm not sure how to hold the openness without turning it into something to optimize.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to sustain the openness and curiosity without turning it into another task or metric. Can you try to imagine that the noticing is not something that needs to be done or optimized, but rather something that simply happens? Instead of thinking "I need to notice this more, or differently", try simply allowing the sensations and thoughts to arise, without judgment or attachment. Can you ask yourself "What is the sensation of the chest ache right now, without trying to change it or understand it?" Try to focus on the present moment, without trying to control or direct it. What do you notice when you approach the experience with a greater sense of acceptance and openness?

Patient: Right now the chest ache is a kind of dull, viscous pressure that rides up when my breath clips, and the forehead-buzz is more like static that softens if I let the breath lengthen a beat. Letting that be—without immediately diagnosing it—turns the alarm into a quieter, tender sort of melancholy instead of a siren, which actually feels...vulnerable. But of course my reflex is already trying to make acceptance into a deliverable, so I'm getting restless—can we try staying with this a bit longer without turning it into another protocol?

Therapist: Let's try to slow down and stay with the sensation of vulnerability for a moment. Can you imagine sitting with this feeling, without trying to change it or fix it? Just observe it, like you're watching a small cloud drift by. Try to focus on the sensation of being vulnerable, without judgment or attachment. What does it feel like to be in this state? Is there anything that stands out to you, or is it more of a general feeling of...what?

(Note: I'm trying to help you stay with the feeling of vulnerability without immediately trying to make it into a deliverable or a protocol. This is a delicate balance, and it's okay if it feels a bit awkward at first. Let's see if we can find a way to hold onto this vulnerability without trying to control it.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "watching a cloud" supposed to help? It already reads like another instruction and my OCD immediately wants to operationalize it. 

If I actually try, vulnerability feels like a thin, hot pressure behind my sternum, a queasy hollow in my gut, and that ridiculous buzzing in my forehead; phenomenologically it's tender and embarrassingly small, like a miniature grief I can almost catalog. 

I can try to stay with that, but I'm already getting restless thinking about doing it "right"—could you give me one simple anchor to hold onto, because otherwise my reflex will just turn this into another protocol?

Therapist: Try holding your breath for one second. Just hold it for one second, without thinking about it or doing anything with it. Just hold the breath. See what happens when you do this. No thinking, no doing, no trying. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — I tried it. Holding my breath for that one second created a tiny, useful gap: the chest tightened a notch, the forehead-buzz felt momentarily louder, and the internal narrator hiccupped as if surprised to be silenced. For a sliver of time the catastrophic loop lost momentum, but of course my OCD immediately started metricizing the pause — “Was that long enough? Did you do it right?” — which then undermined the calm. Can we try it again, maybe a few times in a row, and could you tell me what you want me to notice after each one so my brain doesn’t turn it into a performance?

Therapist: Let's try this again. Hold your breath for one second, and then exhale slowly. Don't think about it, don't do anything with it. Just breathe. Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or attachment. Just observe.

(Pause for a brief moment, and then exhale slowly)

After this one, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest expanding as you exhale, without trying to change it or fix it. Just observe the sensation of the breath moving out of your body, and the feeling of your chest expanding.

(If you're ready, we can try another one)

Patient: I did it — when I exhaled slowly the chest eased and felt oddly expansive in a soft way, the forehead-buzz thinned a bit, and there was this tiny surprised silence from the internal narrator. Of course my OCD immediately asked “was that long enough?” and started turning the whole thing into a little ritual of correctness, which annoys me. I'm ready to try another — tell me one simple thing you want me to notice afterward so my brain has less room to turn it into a performance.

Therapist: Hold your breath for one second, and then exhale slowly. As you exhale, notice the feeling of your mouth and lips relaxing, without trying to change it or think about it. Just observe the sensation of your mouth relaxing, and let go of any tension in your face or jaw.

(Pause for a brief moment)

After this, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without thinking about it. Just observe the feeling of your feet connected to the earth, without judgment or attachment.

Patient: Okay — when I exhaled my mouth actually did unclench: jaw softened, lips kind of slackened, and my face felt a little less wired. Noticing my feet on the floor gave a surprisingly steadying sensation — a boring, grounding pressure through the soles and the chair against my thighs — and the forehead-buzz quieted a notch. Of course my brain immediately started grading it — “was that relaxed enough? did you do it right?” — which turns the whole thing into a performance and makes me tense again. I'm not sure I follow how these little anchors are supposed to shift the bigger question of who I am beyond the business, but I'm willing to try one more simple anchor if you give me one and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my mind has less room to monetize it.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly roll your shoulders down towards your chest. As you do this, notice the sensation of your shoulders releasing, without trying to change it or think about it. Just observe the feeling of your shoulders relaxing, and let go of any tension in your arms or hands.

(Pause for a brief moment)

After this, I want you to notice the sensation of the sensation itself. Not the thought "I'm relaxing my shoulders", but the actual feeling of the relaxation spreading through your body. Just observe the sensation of the relaxation, without judgment or attachment. Notice the texture, the temperature, the movement - just the sensation of the sensation.

Patient: When I rolled my shoulders and focused on the “sensation of the sensation,” I actually noticed something real: a slow, spreading looseness from the trapezius down into my arms, a faint warm tingle, and the movement felt like a very quiet tide easing out. Phenomenologically it had a soft, almost velvety texture and lukewarm temperature, but almost immediately my metacognitive reflex started narrating and grading it—“is that relaxed enough?”—so I’m not sure if I’m feeling or just inventing another metric. I’m willing to keep doing this, but can you give me one very simple next instruction to anchor me so my brain has less room to turn it into a performance?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the air on your tongue.

(Pause for a brief moment)

I want you to focus solely on the sensation of the air on your tongue, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Just observe the sensation, the texture, the temperature, the movement. Let go of any judgment, any narrative, any expectation. Just be with the sensation of the air on your tongue.

Patient: Okay — the air on my tongue is cool and slightly damp, a thin, sliding pressure across the front-upper surface; my tongue feels a little heavy and the roof of my mouth a touch warmer. The instant I put words to it my mind wants to catalogue and grade the observation — “was that detailed enough?” — which immediately risks turning this into another performance. Can you give me one very simple next anchor and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my brain has less room to monetize it?

Therapist: Look away.

(Pause for a brief moment)

I want you to simply look away from your face, without focusing on anything in particular. Just let your gaze drift away, without thinking about it or trying to control it. Notice how your body responds to the simple act of looking away, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is simply looking away supposed to help? When I do it, my eyes feel oddly lighter, my blink rate slows, and there's a tiny unclenching around my jaw and chest like a micro-release; the forehead buzz dips for a breath or two. Of course my brain wants to theorize—gaze aversion as attentional disengagement, a brief interrupt to the catastrophic loop—so I immediately start grading the maneuver ("did you do it right?"), which turns it into a protocol again. I can hold that softening for a few breaths before restlessness and performance anxiety creep back in; can you give me one very simple next anchor and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my mind has less room to monetize it?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or control it. Simply observe the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it.

(Pause for a brief moment)

Focus on the sensation of your breath, without judgment or evaluation. Notice the texture, temperature, movement, and feeling of the breath as it moves in and out of your body. Simply be with the sensation of the breath.

Patient: When I track the breath I feel cool air at my nostrils, a gentle rise in my belly and chest, and the forehead-buzz softens for a few beats—there’s a kind of small, tender quiet that feels almost embarrassing to notice. I'm not sure I follow what the intended learning is here—my OCD flips the moment into a metric (“was that deep enough?”), so can you give me one very simple next anchor and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my brain has less room to monetize it?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor.

(Pause for a brief moment)

I want you to simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without thinking about it or trying to control it. Just observe the feeling of your feet, the pressure of the floor, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your feet. Focus on the sensation, not on trying to do anything with it.

Patient: Okay — my feet feel solid and a bit cool under the arches, a diffuse, steady pressure through heels and balls like the ground is quietly holding some of my weight; it actually steadies the chest a little and the forehead-buzz thins for a beat. Of course my OCD immediately starts grading it — “is that grounded enough?” — which risks turning it into a performance, so can you give me one very simple next anchor and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my brain has less room to monetize it?

Therapist: Listen to the sound of your own breath.

(Pause for a very brief moment)

I want you to simply listen to the sound of your own breath, without thinking about it or trying to control it. Just notice the sound, the texture, the movement of the breath as it moves in and out of your body. Focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to do anything with it.

Patient: Listening to my breath — it's an odd little hiss at the nostrils, rhythmic and slightly ragged, and for a brief beat the internal narrator hushes so I can actually hear it. Naturally, within seconds the OCD asks "was that audible enough?" and starts prognosticating the quality of my attention, which immediately risks turning this into a performance. Can you give me one very simple next anchor and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my brain has less room to monetize it?

Therapist:  Justification (IJ): None

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—what does "Justification (IJ): None" mean in this context? It reads like another terse instruction and my OCD is already trying to turn it into a rule to follow, which makes me impatient. Can you clarify what you're asking me to do, and—if you want me to try another anchor—give me one very simple instruction and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my brain has less room to monetize it? I'm getting a bit restless and confused here, so can we slow down a notch.

I'm feeling confused and a bit overwhelmed; could you slow down and give me one very simple, clear anchor to try and tell me exactly what to notice afterward so my mind has less room to turn it into a performance? Right now I'm restless and need a concrete next step.
