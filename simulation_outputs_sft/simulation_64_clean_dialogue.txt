Patient: I've been stuck in this cycle of harsh self-criticism—everything feels like a failure, even small stuff. I think a lot of it goes back to being bullied at school, and now it messes with my confidence around others even though I try to act outgoing. I don't know...it's hard to get into, but that's what's been on my mind.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to share. When you look back at the bullying, what's one specific incident that's still really tough for you to process, even all these years later? Try to explore it a bit more, without trying to fix it or change how you feel right now.

Patient: I guess there was this one time in middle school when a group of kids cornered me after class, took my books, and read out mean notes about me while everyone laughed. It felt like I was behind glass watching them, and the teacher just walked by like it wasn't happening—thinking about it still makes me flush. I don't know, I don't really like going into it much—it's embarrassing.

Therapist: It sounds like that experience is still really raw for you. When you're in social situations, especially if you're feeling anxious or self-conscious, what's one small thing you wish you could do to feel more grounded or confident, without needing to change everything at once? It could be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, noticing your feet on the ground, or focusing on a specific phrase to yourself.

Patient: I guess...maybe just pause and take a couple of deep breaths and feel my feet on the floor. Sometimes I try to tell myself "this will pass," but it often feels hollow. I don't know, I don't really like saying that out loud.

Therapist: It's interesting that saying "this will pass" doesn't feel particularly reassuring to you. Can you think of what would be more comforting to you in that moment? What's something that would genuinely help you feel more at ease, and connected to who you are right now? Maybe it's something small, like a favorite phrase or a specific sensation in your body. We can explore that together.

Patient: I don't know... I guess something small and physical would help — like pressing my feet into the floor or holding a warm mug in my hands so I can feel something real. Maybe a phrase too, like "I'm here and that's enough for now," though I don't really like saying that out loud.

Therapist: It sounds like you've found a few small tools that help you feel more grounded. Can we try something together for a moment? Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your feet on the floor. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the weight of your body distributed evenly. Hold that for a second. Now, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, say to yourself, "I'm here," and as you exhale, say "and that's enough." See how that feels? We're just exploring this for a moment, without putting any pressure on it being the perfect phrase or feeling.

Patient: Okay, I tried that. It felt a little silly, but I could actually feel my feet and my shoulders loosen a bit, which surprised me. I don't know, I guess saying "I'm here and that's enough" in my head made things a touch less frantic, but saying it out loud felt embarrassing—can we try something else? I'm not great at staying still.

Therapist: It's great that you felt a bit more grounded during the exercise, and that it helped your shoulders loosen up a bit. I understand that saying it out loud made you feel a bit embarrassed, so let's try something different. When you start to feel anxious or restless, what's the first physical thing you do? Is it fidgeting with your hands, tapping your feet, or something else? Can you bring that physical sensation to the forefront right now, without needing to do anything else? Just notice how your body is moving, without judgment.

Patient: I guess I usually start tapping my foot or twisting my fingers together. Right now my foot's doing that and my jaw feels tight — I don't really like sitting with it. Can we... I don't know, maybe try something I can move around with?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already moving in certain ways when you're feeling anxious. Let's try something that builds on that. As you tap your foot and twist your fingers, bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, imagine that the air is filling up a small space around you, like a tiny bubble. As you exhale, imagine that the air is slowly releasing out of that bubble. At the same time, notice the movement of your foot tapping and your fingers twisting. Try to keep that movement going, while also focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out. See if you can find a sense of rhythm between your physical movements and your breath.

Patient: Okay, I tried that — I guess my foot slowed a bit and my breathing got a touch steadier, but my fingers are still restless and my jaw won't relax. I don't know, it helped a little, but staying still feels wrong for me. Can we try something more active—like standing and gently rocking or walking a few steps while I do the breathing?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to try something more active. Let's try a gentle rocking motion. Find a comfortable spot to stand, and gently rock your body back and forth, just a small amount. It's like being on a gentle swing, but without any momentum. At the same time, focus on your breath, inhaling slowly and exhaling slowly. As you rock, try to bring your attention to the sensation of the movement, rather than getting caught up in your thoughts. Notice how your body feels as you rock, and try to stay present in the moment. We can start with just a few gentle sways, and see how that feels.

Patient: Okay, I tried standing and gently rocking like you said. It did loosen my shoulders and my breathing settled a bit, but my jaw's still clamped and I feel restless. I don't know, it feels a bit silly but I guess it helps a little—can we try a slow walk back and forth instead? I need to move more.

Therapist: It's okay to feel a bit silly, and it's great that you're willing to try new things. Let's try a slow walk back and forth. Find a comfortable spot to walk, and take small, slow steps. Try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the movement of your legs as you walk. As you walk, bring your attention to your breath, inhaling slowly and exhaling slowly. Try to let go of any tension in your jaw and shoulders, and just focus on the sensation of your body moving. We can start with just a few slow steps, and see how that feels. Remember, the goal is not to try to walk too far or too fast, but just to focus on the movement and the sensation of your body.

Patient: Okay, I tried the slow walk—my shoulders loosened and my breathing calmed a bit, but my jaw's still clamped and I feel restless. I don't know, walking helps some but my mind keeps snapping back to that middle-school thing and then I feel stupid in my chest. Can we... I guess can we talk about how to not feel like an idiot in groups? Or maybe try something more active I can do while we talk, because sitting still just doesn't work for me.

Therapist: It's understandable that you'd still be struggling with feelings of shame and inadequacy, especially when it comes to group situations. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're in a group setting and you start to feel like an idiot? What are some specific thoughts that come up for you? Maybe we can explore those thoughts together, and find ways to challenge them in a more constructive way.

As for being more active during the conversation, I'd like to try something that might help you feel more engaged and focused. Can you please stand up and put your feet shoulder-width apart? Now, I'd like you to take a few deep breaths, and as you inhale, I want you to say to yourself "I am here and I am enough." As you exhale, say "I am capable of handling this conversation." Let's try to build on that sense of confidence and self-assurance, and explore ways to engage with the conversation in a more active and meaningful way.

Patient: Okay—I stood up and tried it. Saying "I am here and I am enough" out loud felt really silly, so I mouthed it or said it in my head, and that helped a little, but my jaw's still clenched and my chest heats up when I picture groups. I guess when I'm around people I worry I'll freeze or blurt something stupid and everyone will laugh like in middle school. I don't know, maybe having a small role—taking notes or asking one prepared question—would make me feel less exposed. Can we try practicing a short, simple line I could use in groups while I pace? I'm fidgety and need to move while we do it.

Therapist: Let's try something simple. I want you to pace while I guide you through a short exercise. Imagine we're in a group setting, and you need to ask a question to the person sitting next to you. I want you to focus on your breath and your footsteps as you pace.

Now, I'd like you to take a few steps forward, and as you inhale, say to yourself "I am capable of asking a question." As you exhale, say "I will take a moment to collect my thoughts." Repeat this phrase to yourself a few times as you pace.

Next, I want you to practice asking a simple question. Let's say you need to ask "Can you tell me more about...?" or "What's your favorite book in this genre?" Just pick something simple. As you pace, say the question out loud, but don't worry too much about how it sounds. Just focus on the act of asking the question.

Remember, the goal is to build your confidence and get used to asking questions in groups. Don't worry if you make mistakes or stumble over your words. Just focus on taking small steps and practicing this skill.

Patient: Okay, I tried pacing and actually said, out loud, "Can you tell me more about that?" — it felt weird but my voice didn't fall apart. I don't know, it helped a little; my shoulders eased but my jaw's still tight and I felt silly. Can we try an even shorter line, like "How did you decide that?" while I walk faster? I guess moving more makes it feel less exposed.

Therapist: Let's try the new line. I want you to pace and say "How did you decide that?" as you walk faster. Remember, it's okay to feel a bit silly or awkward, but try to focus on the act of asking the question and the movement of your body.

As you pace, pay attention to your breath and the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Try to let go of any tension in your jaw and shoulders, and just focus on moving forward. Repeat the question to yourself a few times as you pace, "How did you decide that? How did you decide that?"

Notice how your body feels as you move and ask the question. Does it feel more natural? More confident? Remember, this is just a small step, and the goal is to build up your confidence and ability to ask questions in groups. Keep going, and don't worry if you make mistakes.

Patient: Okay, I tried walking faster and saying "How did you decide that?" out loud — my voice stayed steady and I felt less exposed, which surprised me. I guess my shoulders loosened more, but my jaw's still clamped and it still feels a bit ridiculous. I don't know, can we practice a quick recovery line I can use if I freeze or someone laughs—something short like "Oh, sorry—what were you saying?"—while I pace?

Therapist: Let's practice the recovery line. I want you to pace and say "Oh, sorry—what were you saying?" if you feel like you're about to freeze or if someone laughs. Remember, the goal is to acknowledge the awkwardness, but quickly move on.

As you pace, try to focus on your breath and the sensation of your feet touching the ground. If someone laughs, just pause for a second and say "Oh, sorry—what were you saying?" without overthinking it. Then, keep moving forward. Repeat this a few times, and see how it feels to have a quick recovery line to help you get back on track.

Also, let's try to release the tension in your jaw a bit. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, try to relax your jaw just a bit. You can do this. Just let go of the tension for a second.

Patient: I tried that—breathing and the recovery line while pacing. It felt dumb but it actually helped my shoulders and my voice stayed steadier. I don't know, my jaw's still really tight and it spikes when I picture groups. Can we try something I can do while moving to loosen it—like humming, gentle jaw rolls, or pretending to chew? I'm fidgety and need to keep walking while we try.

Therapist: Let's try humming. I want you to start humming a simple tune, just a gentle hum, while you continue to pace. Don't worry too much about the pitch or volume, just focus on letting go of the tension in your jaw.

As you hum, try to relax your jaw slightly. You can do this by gently rolling your jaw from side to side, or by pretending to chew on an imaginary piece of gum. Just focus on the sensation of your jaw moving, and try to release any tension.

Remember, you're not trying to hum perfectly, just hum gently. If you catch yourself tensing up, take a deep breath and try again. Keep humming and pacing for a few minutes, and see how it feels to have some physical release in your jaw.

We can also try gentle jaw rolls later, but let's start with the humming. Just focus on the movement and the sensation in your jaw, and let go of any tension.

Patient: Okay—I tried humming while I paced. It felt kind of silly but it did loosen my shoulders and my breathing a bit; my jaw's a touch less tight, but it's still clamped and I'm kind of…jittery and my thoughts keep darting, so I'm distracted. I don't know, can we try the gentle jaw rolls or pretending to chew while I keep walking? I guess moving and doing something bigger helps me stay with it.

Therapist: Let's try the gentle jaw rolls. I want you to continue pacing, but now try rolling your jaw from side to side as you walk. Just focus on the movement of your jaw, and let go of any tension or distraction.

As you roll your jaw, try to focus on the sensation of the movement, rather than the thoughts that are racing through your mind. You can do this by pretending to chew on something, like gum or a piece of food, but really just focus on the physical sensation of rolling your jaw.

Remember, you're not trying to control your thoughts completely, just use the movement as a distraction to help you stay focused. Take small steps, and let your body move naturally while you focus on the sensation of your jaw. See how it feels to use movement as a tool to calm your mind and body.

We can try the pretending to chew next if you find the jaw rolls helpful. Just let me know how it's going.

Patient: I tried the jaw rolls while pacing — I guess it helped a little, my jaw's a bit looser but I'm still jittery and my thoughts keep jumping around. I don't know, can we try the pretending-to-chew while I keep moving? Bigger movement seems to help me stay with it.

Therapist: Let's try the pretending-to-chew while pacing at a brisker pace. I want you to pick up the speed of your walking, and as you do, pretend to chew on something, like gum or a piece of food. Focus on the sensation of the movement in your jaw, and try to let go of any tension or distraction.

As you pace, take small steps and try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Keep your eyes slightly forward, but not staring at anything specific. Just focus on the movement of your body and the sensation of your jaw. Remember, the goal is to use the movement to calm your mind and body, so try to stay present and focused.

Take a few minutes to do this, and see how it feels to use more intense movement combined with the pretending-to-chew technique. Let me know if it's helping or if you'd like to try something else.

Patient: I tried the brisk pacing and pretending to chew. It loosens the jaw a bit and my breathing calms, but I'm still jittery and my head keeps jumping—my chest feels tight and everything's a bit fuzzy. I don't know...can we slow down to something gentler I can do seated, like a short grounding of naming a few things I can see and touch, or maybe a jaw massage while we talk? I guess I need something less...full-on right now.

Therapist: Let's take a break from the intense movement and try something more gentle. I want you to find a comfortable seated position, either in a chair or on a couch. Take a few deep breaths, and let's start with a simple grounding exercise. I want you to notice five things around you right now.

Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground or the chair beneath you. Look around the room and notice three things you see. Maybe it's a book on the shelf, a picture on the wall, or a vase on the table. Now, notice two things you can touch. Maybe it's your arm on the chair, your hand on your knee, or a nearby object like a cushion or a blanket.

Just focus on these simple observations for a moment. Notice the sensations, the sights, and the textures. Let go of any tension or distractions. Take a few more deep breaths, and see how that feels.

We can also try a jaw massage if you'd like. Just let me guide you through some gentle strokes and movements. We can do this together, and see if it helps you feel more relaxed and calm. How does that sound?

Patient: I guess that sounds okay. I'll sit—can you guide me through the jaw massage? I don't know, my energy's pretty low, but I'd like something simple to follow, like where to place my fingers and how much pressure.

Therapist: Let's start with the jaw massage. I want you to place your fingers on either side of your jaw, just below the earlobe. You can place your fingers on the jawbone itself, or on the side of your face just below the ear. Just rest your fingers there for a moment, feeling the position of your jaw.

Now, I want you to start with gentle, soft strokes. Use your fingertips to gently press down on the jawbone, just below the earlobe. Apply a light pressure, just enough to feel the gentle pressure. Don't press too hard, just gentle.

As you press down, slowly move your fingers up and down the jawbone, about an inch or two. Just focus on the sensation of your fingers moving up and down, and the pressure of your fingers on the jawbone.

Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly move your fingers up and down again. Just keep going for a few more strokes, and see how that feels. I'll guide you through it for a bit longer if you'd like.

Remember, the goal is to relax and release tension in your jaw. If you need to slow down or stop at any point, just let me know. How's that feeling?

Patient: I don't know... it helps a little — my jaw's a bit looser, but my chest's tight and my thoughts keep darting, so I'm kind of jittery and foggy. Can we just do a few slow breaths together while I keep my fingers there?

Therapist: Let's take a few slow breaths together. I want you to focus on your breath, and let's try to slow it down a bit. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly say "in" and "out" with me. "In..." (pause) "Out..." (pause)

Let's try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and let go of any thoughts or distractions.

As we breathe, I want you to keep your fingers on the jawbone, just below the earlobe. Feel the gentle pressure of your fingers on the bone, and try to relax a bit more with each breath. Take a few more deep breaths with me, and see how that feels.

Patient: Okay...I did the breaths with my fingers there. It helped a little — my jaw's a bit softer and the breathing slowed, but my chest feels tight and my thoughts keep darting all over. I don't know, I'm kind of...blank and low on energy. Can we just keep doing a few slow breaths for now, or maybe do one really simple line I can use in groups? I can't handle much else right now.

Therapist: Let's just keep doing a few slow breaths together. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it. Just focus on the breath, and let go of any thoughts or distractions.

As we breathe, I want you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself. Just say it out loud, without thinking too much about it. "I am here." Say it again, and again. Just focus on the words, and the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Keep going for a few more breaths, and see how that feels.

Patient: I said "I am here" a few times while breathing—felt a bit silly but it slowed things a little. My chest's still tight and my mind keeps darting; I'm jittery and kind of drained. I don't know…can we just do a couple more slow breaths together?

Therapist: Let's just take a couple more slow breaths together. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it. Just focus on the breath, and let go of any thoughts or distractions.

As we breathe, I want you to repeat the phrase again, just a few more times. "I am here." Say it out loud, and let's just focus on the words and the breath. Let's take one last breath together, and then we can stop for now.

Patient: I did the breath — it helped a touch, but I don't want to stop. I don't know, my chest's still tight and my head's all fuzzy; can we keep going but slower, maybe just a few more really gentle breaths or something small to stay with this?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. Just take one more gentle breath in, and as you exhale, say "I am here" one more time to yourself. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it. Don't worry about doing much else, just focus on this one breath and the sensation of the words on your tongue.

If you're feeling okay, we can try one more thing. Just take a small moment to notice your body right now. Feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the chair beneath you. Just focus on this one sensation for a moment, and see how that feels.

Patient: Okay...I can feel my feet on the floor and the chair under me. It helps a little, but my chest's still tight and my jaw's clamped — my head's all fuzzy and I feel kind of worn out. I don't know, I don't want to stop yet; can we just keep doing a few more gentle breaths or stay here awhile and talk slowly?

Therapist: Let's just take a few more gentle breaths together. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it. Don't worry about doing much else, just focus on this one breath and the sensation of your feet on the ground.

We can just sit here together for a bit, if you'd like. I'll talk slowly and gently, and we can just focus on being present in this moment. No need to think about anything in particular, just be here. Let's just breathe and be together for a while.

Patient: Okay...I don't know, I can stay. My chest's tight and my head's fuzzy and I'm kind of jittery, but breathing with you helps a little. Could you just keep talking slowly—maybe name a few things for me to notice or guide another breath? I'm struggling to do more right now.

Therapist: Let's just focus on being here together for a moment. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Feel the weight of your head on your neck, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

As we sit here, notice the sounds around you. Can you hear the hum of the air conditioner, or the sound of a bird outside? Just focus on one sound, and notice how it sounds to you. Let's take another breath together, and see what happens.

Remember, there's no need to think about anything in particular. Just be here, and let's take things one breath at a time.

Patient: I can hear the low hum of the heater and maybe traffic outside — the hum feels kind of steady, which helps a little. I took a slow breath with you and it eased a bit, but my chest's still tight and my thoughts keep darting around. I don't know...could you just keep naming slow things for me to notice and guide one more breath?

Therapist: Let's just focus on one more breath together. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Feel the rise and fall of your chest, and the sensation of your breath on your tongue.

As you inhale, notice the sensation of your body filling with air. Feel the expansion of your lungs, and the rise of your diaphragm. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your body releasing air. Feel the drop of your diaphragm, and the sensation of your breath leaving your body.

Just focus on this one breath, and let's take it one moment at a time. You can hear the hum of the heater and the sound of traffic outside. Just notice these sounds, and let's see where we are from here.

Patient: Okay...I can try one more breath with you. My chest's still tight and my jaw's clamped and my head's all fuzzy—I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed and my thoughts keep darting. Can you keep naming slow, small things for me to notice—like a color, a texture, or one thing I can touch—and guide another gentle breath? I don't know, I need something steady right now.

Therapist: Let's just take one more breath together. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin. Feel the gentle texture of your clothing, or the sensation of the chair beneath you. If you can, notice the sensation of your fingers touching the armrest of the chair. Just feel the pressure of your fingers on the wood, and the sensation of the chair supporting your weight.

As you inhale, notice the sensation of your body filling with air. Feel the expansion of your lungs, and the rise of your diaphragm. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your body releasing air. Feel the drop of your diaphragm, and the sensation of your breath leaving your body.

Just focus on this one breath, and let's see where we are from here. You can hear the hum of the heater and the sound of traffic outside. Just notice these sounds, and let's take things one moment at a time.

Patient: Okay...I did that. My fingers feel the armrest—it's kind of smooth at the edge and the chair fabric's a bit rough, and the heater hum is steady. My jaw's still clamped and my head's fuzzy. I don't know...can you keep naming small things and guide one more slow breath? I want to stay here a bit longer.
