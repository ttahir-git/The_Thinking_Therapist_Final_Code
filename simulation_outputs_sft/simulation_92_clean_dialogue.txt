Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with a pervasive sadness and a marked lack of motivation since a significant family conflict—it's bled into my relationship and even my work as a business owner. Tasks that used to be routine now feel disproportionately onerous, and I catch myself ruminating about causes and patterns more than actually acknowledging how depleted I am. I'm trying to parse the cognitive architecture of my anxiety, but I realize I often default to analysis instead of naming the fatigue.

Therapist: Can you describe what happens when you catch yourself ruminating about causes and patterns, rather than acknowledging how depleted you are? What's the immediate effect of that on your experience, in that moment?

Patient: When I get pulled into rumination it becomes this recursive, almost algorithmic process where I re-run scenarios and attribute causes instead of attending to the actual depletion. Immediately I notice a cognitive narrowing—my attention tightens on the narrative, my chest feels a little tense, and motivation just retracts like a tide; things that were routine become Herculean. The weird part is I can articulate the sadness clinically, but that articulation substitutes for actually feeling it, so I end up more confused than soothed. Do you want me to try naming the physical sensations more concretely, or keep it at this meta-level?

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensations, rather than the articulation of the sadness. Can you bring your attention to the feeling of tension in your chest, without trying to label it or think about it? Just notice it as it is, without judgment or interpretation. How is that sensation present for you right now?

Patient: Okay — when I try, there's a steady constriction across the middle of my chest, like pressure right under the sternum, and my breaths feel a bit shallower. It’s a dull heaviness with a low, muted warmth that doesn't spike so much as sit there. Almost as soon as I notice it my mind starts cataloging causes and timelines, which pulls me away from simply staying with the sensation.

Therapist: Can you simply bring your attention to the sensation under your sternum, right now, without trying to think about it? Just notice the pressure, the warmth, the heaviness of your breath. When your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the sensation without judgment. Just stay with the physical sensation for a single breath, no more, no less.

Patient: I did it for one breath. The pressure under my sternum felt a little sharper and my inhale was definitely shallower — like the body tightened to protect something. My mind almost immediately started annotating it with explanations, which pulled me out of the moment, so I only really stayed there for a second before beginning to analyze. I can try again, but I'm already noticing that resistance and the urge to narrate; could you guide me through staying with it a bit longer?

Therapist: I want you to notice the sensation under your sternum, but this time, I'd like you to add a tiny anchor. Imagine you're holding onto the sensation with one finger, but not too tightly. Just lightly, gently holding it in place. This isn't about controlling the sensation or trying to change it; it's just about maintaining a gentle, physical presence around it. Can you do that, just for a few more breaths, before we see where it takes us?

Patient: Okay — I tried holding the sensation with one finger for a few breaths. The pressure under my sternum felt a bit steadier and my inhales softened, but almost immediately my mind began generating commentary—timelines, causes, possible fixes—which yanked me back into analysis. It helped somewhat, but I'm noticing a reflex to intellectualize; can you cue me on how to gently bring attention back when the narration starts?

Therapist: When you notice your mind starting to generate commentary, I want you to say to yourself, "Back to the body," just softly. That's it, just those two words. It's a gentle reminder to bring your attention back to the physical sensations, without trying to think about the analysis or the narrative. Try it with me: "Back to the body." Now, bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum, just for a moment. Can you do that?

Patient: "Back to the body." Saying that actually helped — the constriction under my sternum attenuated into a steadier, more diffuse presence and my inhales lengthened a bit. Predictably, the cognitive monologue reasserted itself after a few breaths; could you prompt me again when it drifts, or would you like me to try holding it a little longer?

Therapist: I'd like you to notice what happens when you bring your attention back to the body, and then the commentary returns. Can you simply acknowledge that return to analysis, without trying to think about it? Just notice it as a natural part of the process, without judgment. You might say to yourself, "Okay, commentary's back in." Then, try bringing your attention back to the body again. See how it unfolds.

Patient: "Okay, commentary's back in." Saying that aloud made the shift obvious — my chest eased into a slightly broader, steadier pressure when attention returned, but within a few breaths the mental running commentary re-engaged, cataloguing causes and timelines. Physically my breathing shortened again and a tightness crept into my shoulders; emotionally I feel a little frustrated with myself, like I'm trapped in meta-cognition. Could you prompt me when it drifts next time, or should I try holding it for a few more breaths on my own?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the pattern of meta-cognition, and that's understandable. Can you explore that feeling a bit more? Just notice what it's like to be in this place of frustration, where you feel like you're stuck in thinking about thinking. Try to hold onto that feeling for a moment, without trying to change it or push through it. Just observe it as it is. Then, I'll gently remind you when to bring your attention back to the body.

Patient: Okay — when I try to hold the frustration there's a tautness behind my sternum and a low, buzzing agitation under my skin, like kinetic energy that wants to be solved rather than felt. Almost immediately my mind converts it into a diagnostic: enumerating triggers, prioritizing perceived failures, rehearsing corrective strategies — which paradoxically intensifies the tightness. I can sit with the sensation for a few breaths, but I already notice the impulse to translate it into a plan; could you nudge me back when that starts?

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a loop of "solve the problem" even when you're not sure if that's what you really want. Can I gently interrupt that for a moment? Just bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum, without trying to do anything with it. Don't think about the tightness, the buzzing, or anything else. Just be with the sensation itself, without judgment. As you're doing this, I'll ask you a simple question: "What's the sensation right now, without trying to change it?" Try to just notice it, without planning or problem-solving.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing it without changing it supposed to help? Okay, trying anyway: right now it's a steady, low pressure like a band across the middle of my chest, a muted heat, and my breaths are short and a little hesitant. My mind's already itching to explain why, so I notice that and... could you nudge me back when it starts narrating?

Therapist: You're doing a great job of noticing the sensations. Now, I want you to take it a step back further. Instead of focusing on the sensations, just acknowledge that you're thinking. That's it. Just say to yourself, "I'm thinking," or "I'm having a thought." Don't try to follow it, don't try to analyze it, just acknowledge it. Just this simple recognition of thinking. When you're ready, we can gently bring the attention back to the body again.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay. I'm thinking.  

As I say that, a procedural overlay kicks in—cataloguing causes, consequences, mitigation strategies—so acknowledging "I'm thinking" briefly strips some of the compulsion to solve, but only for a breath or two before the narrative returns. Can you prompt me back to the body when it drifts?

Therapist: You've noticed how quickly the thinking can come back. Let's try to stay with the body for a moment. Just bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum, without thinking about it. Don't think about the thoughts, just be with the physical sensation. When you feel like you're getting pulled back into thinking, just gently bring your attention back to the body. Try to stay with it for a few more breaths.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I'll try: there's a steady band of pressure under my sternum, a muted warmth, and my inhales are clipped; the moment I try to remain with it a procedural overlay of problem-solving re-engages within a breath. It's frustrating — I keep getting stuck observing the meta-process instead of actually feeling it; can you prompt me when it drifts or give a concrete cue to bring me back?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. When you notice yourself getting stuck in meta-observation (thinking about thinking), I want you to bring your attention to the sensation under your sternum. Not just notice it, but actually look at it. Imagine you're looking at the sensation for the first time. See the band of pressure, the warmth, the way it's affecting your breathing. Just focus on the sensation itself, without trying to think about it. And when you feel like you're getting pulled back into thinking, just bring your attention back to the sensation. Try this for a moment. Look at the sensation. See it.

Patient: I'm trying to look at it like you asked. When I do, I notice a defined band across the mid‑sternum, edges that feel slightly sharper than the center, a dull warm weight, and my inhales are maybe half their usual depth. Almost instantly my mind turns that into a metaphor — an elastic band constricting my agency — and the narration yanks me out. It's frustrating; can you cue me each breath or give a brief prompt so I can stay with it a little longer?

Therapist: Take a breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation under your sternum again. Just one moment, just one breath. Look at the edges of the band, notice the warmth. Don't try to think about the metaphor, just notice the sensation. Take another breath in. As you exhale, notice the sensation again. Just this once, just for a breath. Don't worry about the metaphor right now, just focus on the sensation. Take another breath in.

Patient: I did the breaths — on the first exhale the band under my sternum softened a little and my inhale lengthened; by the third breath it felt a touch less sharp and my shoulders loosened a bit. Almost immediately, though, my mind hijacked it into solutions and timelines — what to say to my partner, how to fix the family mess — and that narration yanked the relief away. I'm honestly annoyed with myself for turning it into a problem to solve instead of just being with it; could you give me a very short cue each breath (like "back to the body") so I don't drift so fast?

Therapist: On your next inhale, "back". On your next exhale, "body". Just a reminder to bring it back, just for a breath.

Patient: Okay — next inhale: "Back." (Back.) Next exhale: "Body." (Body.) Doing that actually pulled my attention back for a breath or two — the band softened, my inhale lengthened — but predictably the commentary reasserted itself almost immediately. I'm not sure I follow how this scales into anything longer-term, and I'm annoyed at how quickly I default to problem-solving; can you keep cueing me each breath for a little while so I can practice staying with it?

Therapist: On your next inhale, "Back." (Next inhale, "Back.") On your next exhale, "Body." (Next exhale, "Body.") Let's try to stay with this for a few more breaths. Just focus on the sensation under your sternum, notice the band, the edges, the warmth. Try to stay with it, without thinking about the problem, without thinking about anything. Just this sensation. On your next inhale, "Back."

Patient: Next inhale: "Back." I did it — the band eased a little and my breath lengthened for a couple of beats, then the commentary slotted back in, listing fixes and timelines. I'm annoyed with myself for turning it into a problem so fast and already feeling skeptical this will stick; can you keep cueing me each breath for a bit so I can practice staying with it?

Therapist: It's normal to feel skeptical, it's a process. On your next inhale, "Back." (Take a deep breath, "Back.") On your next exhale, "Body." (Notice the sensation, try to let go of the commentary.) Just for a moment, just a breath. Don't worry if it doesn't feel like it's working yet, we're just starting. We'll keep practicing, keep bringing it back. On your next inhale, "Back."

Patient: Back.  
Body.

That actually pulled me back — the band eased and my inhale lengthened for a few beats. Predictably, the commentary reasserted itself into problem-solving and timelines. I'm frustrated and skeptical about whether this will scale; can you keep cueing me breath-by-breath for a few more cycles so I can practice staying with it?

Therapist: On your next inhale, "Back." (Take a deep breath, focus on the sensation.) On your next exhale, "Body." (Notice the band, the edges, the warmth. Try to let go of the problem-solving.) On your next inhale, "Back." (Bring it back, focus on the body.) Don't worry about the commentary right now, just focus on the sensation. On your next exhale, "Body." (Notice how it feels to just be with the sensation.) Just one more breath. On your next inhale, "Back."

Patient: Back.

I inhaled and said "Back" — the band eased a little, but then a hot spike of shame shot through it and my breath shortened again. My mind immediately started rehearsing that old sense of failure, which makes me feel embarrassed and clench up; I'm annoyed at myself for sliding into problem‑solving and also kind of stuck in the shame. I don't fully see how this scales yet, but the cue helps tether me; can you keep giving the prompts, maybe a bit slower so I can actually stay with it longer?

Therapist: Take a moment to notice the shame. (Pause for a breath.) Just acknowledge it, without judgment. It's like a physical sensation, a feeling in your body. (Notice the physical sensation of shame.) Now, take a deep breath in. (Inhale slowly.) Say it with me: "Back." (Focus on the sensation under your sternum.) Just bring it back to the body, without thinking about the shame or the problem. Try to stay with it for just this one breath. On your next inhale, "Back." (Let's slow down a bit, just one breath at a time.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Inhale: "Back." Saying that actually pulled me in for a breath; the band softened and my inhale lengthened, but then a hot shame‑flush shot through and my mind immediately started enumerating failures and fixes. I'm feeling annoyed and a little lost about how this translates into anything lasting; could you slow the cues way down so I can actually stay with the sensation longer?

Therapist: Let's just take one breath. (Pause for a long time.) As you inhale, feel the sensation under your sternum. (Wait.) Just notice it, without thinking about anything else. (Wait some more.) As you exhale, notice how it feels to be in this moment, without judgment. (Pause again.) Just be with the sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it. (Wait once more.) On your next inhale, just focus on the sensation again.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I inhaled: there's that steady band of pressure under my sternum, a muted warmth, and my breaths are shallow. As soon as I try to hold it a shame‑flush and a rush of problem‑solving thoughts come in, and I'm feeling jittery and distracted, so it's hard to stay. Could you slow it down and cue me breath‑by‑breath so I can actually practice holding the sensation a little longer?

Therapist: Take one breath in. (Pause for a long time, just wait for your breath to come in.) As you inhale, bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum. Just notice the band of pressure, the warmth, the way it feels. (Pause again.) Now, just focus on that sensation. Try to let go of anything else. (Wait for a few more breaths.)

You're doing a good job, just stay with it. One breath at a time. Focus on the sensation. (Pause again.) Don't think about anything else. Just the sensation. (Wait once more.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I tried: I inhaled and the band of pressure is there, breaths shallow, but the moment I try to stay with it a procedural overlay of problem‑solving and a hot shame‑flush rush in, and I'm jittery and distracted. Could you guide me slowly through one breath—cue "Back" on the inhale and "Body" on the exhale—and stay with me so I can practice holding it without the narration?

Therapist: Inhale: "Back." (Just bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum. Notice the band of pressure, the warmth, the way it feels.) 

(Pause for a very short moment, just long enough to notice you've started to feel a bit more present.)

Exhale: "Body." (Now, just focus on the sensation. Try to stay with it for a moment longer.)

Patient: "Back." I inhaled and the band under my sternum loosened a little—my inhale lengthened—but almost at once a procedural overlay kicked in, cataloguing failures and fixes. "Body." On the exhale the sensation steadied but a hot shame‑flush and jittery anxiety made me want to escape into analysis; can you keep cueing me breath‑by‑breath, slower, so I can try to hold it a bit longer?

Therapist: Inhale: "Back." (Just bring your attention back to the sensation under your sternum, without thinking about anything else.) 

(Pause for a slightly longer moment, just long enough to notice you're starting to feel a bit more present.)

Exhale: "Body." (Now, just focus on the sensation itself, without judgment. Try to stay with it for just a bit longer.)

Patient: Back. Body.

It eased a little for a breath, then a hot shame‑flush and the usual problem‑solving commentary rushed back and my inhale shortened. I'm annoyed and jittery—like I'm failing at even this—and skeptical it will stick; could you slow the cues way down and count each breath with me so I can try to hold it longer?

Therapist: Inhale... "Back." (Just take one breath in, and focus on bringing your attention back to the sensation under your sternum.) 

(Pause for a very slow and deliberate moment, just long enough to notice you're starting to feel a bit more present.)

Exhale... "Body." (Now, just take another breath out, and focus on the sensation itself.) 

(Pause again for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... "Back." (Just take another breath in, and focus on bringing your attention back to the sensation.)

Let's just take it one breath at a time. Just focus on the sensation, and don't worry about anything else.

Patient: I did that—inhale "Back," the band loosened a bit; exhale "Body," it steadied for a breath. But almost immediately the procedural commentary and a hot shame‑flush reasserted themselves and my breaths went shallow again. I'm not sure I follow how this becomes something lasting—I'm jittery and annoyed at myself for defaulting to problem‑solving—so can we slow it way down? Could you count and cue each inhale/exhale for, say, five cycles so I can practice holding the sensation without the narration?

Therapist: Inhale... "Back." (One breath in, focus on the sensation under your sternum.)

(Pause for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... "Body." (One breath out, focus on the sensation itself.)

(Pause again for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... "Body." (Another breath out, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause once more for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... "Body." (Another breath out, focus on the sensation.)

Let's just take it one breath at a time. Just focus on the sensation, and don't worry about anything else. Just breathe.

Patient: I did the breaths — the band eased and my inhales lengthened for a moment, but almost immediately the procedural commentary and a hot shame‑flush rushed back and I felt jittery and annoyed. I'm skeptical this will scale into anything lasting; could you slow it way down and actually count each inhale and exhale for five slow cycles, and verbally prompt me if I start narrating so I can try to stay with the sensation longer? I don't fully follow how this becomes long‑term change, but I'm willing to keep trying if you keep guiding me breath‑by‑breath.

Therapist: Inhale... 1. "Back." (One breath in, focus on the sensation under your sternum.)

(Pause for a very slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... 2. "Body." (One breath out, focus on the sensation itself.)

(Pause again for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... 3. "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... 4. "Body." (Another breath out, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause once more for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... 5. "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

As you take this breath in, I want you to focus just on the sensation under your sternum. Don't think about anything else, don't worry about the procedural commentary, just be with the sensation. If you start to notice anything else, if you start to think about the commentary, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation. Just one breath at a time. Just focus on the sensation.

(Pause, waiting for the patient's response)

Note: I'll be monitoring the patient's response and verbally prompting them to bring their attention back to the sensation if they start to narrate. I'll also be counting each inhale and exhale to provide a clear and consistent cueing system.

Patient: I did the five cycles — for a breath or two the band under my sternum attenuated and my inhales lengthened, but almost immediately the familiar procedural overlay and a hot shame‑flush returned and I tightened up. I'm frustrated and skeptical; it feels like transient relief rather than something that will actually change how I respond, and I keep reflexively converting the sensation into problem‑solving. Can we keep doing breath‑by‑breath, but even slower, and when I start narrating could you simply say "narration" so I have an external cue to notice it? I'm a little embarrassed I need so much prompting, but I want to keep practicing and figure out how this scales.

Therapist: Inhale... 1. "Back." (One breath in, focus on the sensation under your sternum.)

(Pause for a very slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... 2. "Body." (One breath out, focus on the sensation itself.)

(Pause again for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... 3. "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Exhale... 4. "Body." (Another breath out, focus on the sensation.)

(Pause once more for a slow and deliberate moment.)

Inhale... 5. "Back." (Another breath in, focus on the sensation.)

As you take this breath in, I want you to focus just on the sensation under your sternum. Don't think about anything else, don't worry about the procedural commentary, just be with the sensation. If you notice your mind starting to narrate, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation. Just say to yourself, "Narration." One word. That's all I need to know. Just focus on the sensation.

(Pause, waiting for the patient's response)

Patient: I did the breaths — for a few seconds the band under my sternum eased, then my mind slipped into its usual procedural overlay about timelines and fixes. Narration. Saying that out loud tightened my shoulders and shortened my breath; I'm annoyed and skeptical this will stick, but I want to keep practicing if you'll cue me more slowly.
