Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — like my identity is just "manager" and I don't know what matters beyond that. Whenever I try to think about changing anything, my brain jumps to the worst-case: I’ll make one wrong move, the team’s performance will tank, my boss will notice and replace me, and then I won’t find another role and end up back where I started. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't help feeling like those outcomes are inevitable.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios sound incredibly daunting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if the team's performance were to tank or if you made a "wrong move"? What is it about those outcomes that feels so certain to you?

Patient: If the team's performance tanks, it becomes this obvious chain: metrics drop, clients complain, my boss notices, HR writes me up, they replace me, and I definitely won't be able to find another comparable role — I'll have to move back, lose my apartment, and everyone will see me as a failure. It feels certain because small things have snowballed before, and since I moved here I don't have a safety net, so one wrong move genuinely means collapse. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop my mind from treating that worst-case as the only realistic outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility and self-blame. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to be a manager, and how that sense of responsibility relates to your fear of failure? Is there anything in particular that makes you feel like you're not doing enough to control the outcomes?

Patient: Being a manager feels like the one thing that proves I'm competent — if that goes, I don't know who I am. So any small slip immediately becomes a domino in my head: one missed deadline, metrics dip, boss notices, they replace me, I can't find another role, lose my apartment, everyone sees I was a fraud. I try to control everything — over-planning, checking the team's work, writing backup plans — but that just makes me more convinced I'm barely holding things together and one mistake will show it. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop leaning into those worst-case stories; other outcomes feel unrealistic to me.

Therapist: Let's try something. For the next day, I'd like you to deliberately introduce one small, manageable risk into your work. It could be as simple as checking the team's work without doing a thorough review, or pushing back on one task just slightly. I want you to observe what happens, and see if your worst-case scenario actually plays out. Sometimes, by exposing ourselves to uncertainty in a small way, we can gain a sense of control and clarity that we thought was missing.

Patient: I get why you'd suggest that, but just the idea makes me panicky. If I don't do a thorough review, someone's mistake will slip through, the client will complain, metrics will drop, my boss will notice, and they'll start looking for replacements — it's going to cascade. I know that sounds irrational, but I can't see how a "small" risk wouldn't trigger that chain, so I don't know if I can actually try it right now. Can we slow down and figure out what I'm supposed to observe without setting off the whole collapse?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. I'm not asking you to do anything that feels unbearable right now. We're just going to observe what happens when you try to introduce a small risk into your work. I want you to focus on how you feel, what you notice, and what thoughts come up for you, without trying to change or control the outcome. Can you do that for me? Just observe, and we'll take it from there.

Patient: Okay — I can try to just observe, but I'm already getting panicky thinking about it. If I skip a full review, my mind shoots straight to: mistake slips through, client complains, metrics drop, boss notices, they start looking for someone else — it feels inevitable. I can at least commit to watching what happens in my body and thoughts when I imagine doing this, but I can't promise I won't talk myself out of actually trying it.

Therapist: Let's focus on a small, tangible step you can take right now, without committing to the entire experiment. Can you simply acknowledge to yourself that you're willing to consider taking a different approach to reviewing the team's work, even if it's just for a single task? It doesn't have to be a full review, just a willingness to deviate slightly from your usual process. This is a small, low-stakes step that might help you build momentum and confidence. Will you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can say I'm willing to consider it for a single task, but I don't know, I'm already panicking at the thought. When I picture it, I still see the whole chain — mistake, client complaint, metrics dip, boss notices — so I’m doubtful it’ll stay low-stakes, but I’ll try to notice what happens in my body and thoughts if I do it.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on what's happening right now. As we're talking, can you notice what's going on in your body? Is there tension, anxiety, or any other sensations? Try to observe them without judgment. And then, I want you to ask yourself one question: "What's the thought that's coming up right now when I think about deviating from my usual process?" Let's explore that thought together.

Patient: My chest is tight, shoulders tense, stomach in knots, and my breathing gets shallow — I feel that panic in my throat. The thought is literally the whole disaster loop: if I skip a full review someone will miss something, the client will complain, metrics will tank, my boss will notice and replace me, I’ll lose my apartment and everyone will see I was a fraud — I know it sounds extreme, but that’s what my mind jumps to and I can’t seem to make the alternative outcomes stick. I’m trying to notice it, but I’m already feeling overwhelmed by the image of that chain.

Therapist: I want you to try a simple phrase with me. Repeat after me: "This thought is like a cloud." As you say it, imagine the thought of the disaster chain passing through your mind, but instead of engaging with it, imagine it as a cloud floating by. Just observe it for a moment, without judgment or reaction. See if you can keep your focus on the physical sensations in your body, rather than getting caught up in the thought. We'll continue from there.

Patient: "This thought is like a cloud." I can say it, but the cloud in my head immediately turns into a storm front that won't pass — it just swells into the whole disaster loop: mistake, complaint, metrics tank, boss replaces me, I lose everything. My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow when I try to just watch it; letting it "float by" feels like inviting collapse, so can we slow down? I’m already getting panicky and need help staying with this without my mind racing to the inevitable.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on your physical body again. Can you bring your attention to your feet, grounding yourself in the present moment? Feel the weight of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of each breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about anything in particular, just observe the physical sensations without judgment. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your feet. We'll continue from there, taking it one step at a time.

Patient: I'm trying to focus on my feet but I can't get past the tightness — my heart's racing and my legs feel tingly, like I'm not grounded. Every time I try to notice the sensations, my mind snaps right back to the disaster loop — one slip, metrics tank, boss replaces me — and that just tightens my breathing. Can we slow down? I need help staying with this without spiraling.

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Can you simply acknowledge to yourself that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to focus? It's okay to feel that way. There's no need to try to push through or do anything right now. Just acknowledge the feeling, and then take a deep breath. When you're ready, we can continue from here. Take your time, and remember that we're working together to find a way forward.

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling really overwhelmed and can't focus; my chest is tight and my mind just snaps right back to that disaster chain. I tried a breath but it barely helped — I'm jittery and distracted and scared that if I try to ground myself I'll just spiral into "one mistake, everything collapses" again. I don't want to shut down, but I need you to guide me through one tiny step right now — like telling me to name one neutral sensation — because doing it alone just pulls me back into panicking.

Therapist: Can you just notice the sensation of your tongue? Yes, just the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. That's all I want you to focus on right now. Don't try to think about anything else, just the sensation of your tongue. Just notice it, without judgment or reaction. Take one small moment to focus on that.

Patient: I'm trying to focus on my tongue touching the roof of my mouth, and I can feel it — it's kinda dry and a little heavy — but my chest is racing and my mind won't stop sliding into the disaster story: if I can't even notice this, I'm going to fail at the experiment, a mistake will slip through, metrics will tank, my boss will notice and replace me. I can't hold the sensation for more than a few seconds before my thoughts yank me away. Can you guide me more slowly — like count with me or give me a short prompt to repeat — because doing this alone just makes me spiral.

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath together. Inhale for a count of one... one... one. Hold it for a count of two... two... two. And exhale for a count of three... three... three. As you breathe, I want you to gently repeat to yourself: "Tongue on roof. Tongue on roof." Just say it, one word at a time. "Tongue." "On." "Roof." Let's start with just one word, and then we can add the rest. Can you do that for me?

Patient: "Tongue." I can feel it on the roof of my mouth, but my chest is racing and my mind immediately yanks me back to the disaster loop — if I can't even hold this simple thing, I'll fail the experiment, a mistake will slip through, the client will complain, metrics will tank and they'll replace me. Can you go slower, like say the next word very slowly and count with me out loud?

Therapist: "O-n..." (pause)... "one..." (pause) Let's start again with the word "tongue". Say it with me: "Tongue". (pause) Now, let's add the word "on". Say it with me: "Tongue on". (pause) We're going very slowly here. Just focus on saying the words, and try to let go of the rest. Can you repeat that with me: "Tongue on"?

Patient: Tongue on. I can say it, but I'm really jittery and distracted — my chest's tight and the moment I try to hold it my brain snaps into the worst-case: missed error, client complaint, metrics tank, boss replaces me. I can't keep it for more than a beat; can you slow it down even more and count each syllable with me so I have something to follow?

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "gue..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... of... (pause)... your... (pause)... mouth. Just focus on saying the words, one syllable at a time. Try to let go of the rest. Repeat it with me, slowly: "Tong... u... ge... on... the... roof... of... your... mouth". Let's start again, one word at a time. Are you ready to try that with me?

Patient: Okay... I'm ready to try, but my heart's racing and I'm way more distracted all of a sudden. I'll try: "Tong...u...ge... on... the... roof... of... your... mouth" — I'm saying it but my brain's already insisting that if I can't even hold this, the experiment will fail and the whole disaster chain will follow. Can you count each syllable out loud and stay with me, really slowly? I need you to keep the pace because otherwise my thoughts yank me straight back into "one mistake, everything collapses."

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." Just listen to me saying each syllable, one by one. Don't try to think about anything else, just focus on the sound of my voice. I'm going to say each syllable, and then we'll wait for a moment before moving on. Ready? Here we go again: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth". Take your time, and let's just focus on this one moment for now.

Patient: Okay—I heard each syllable and I tried to follow, but my heart's racing and my mind keeps snapping back to the disaster loop: one mistake, client complains, metrics tank, boss replaces me. I can stay with this if you keep the pace and keep saying the syllables slowly—please keep going and count with me, and tell me the next tiny step, because if you stop I’ll just slide right back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly bring your attention to your feet. Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Don't try to think about anything else, just focus on the sensation of your feet. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth". Can you do that for me? Take it one moment at a time, and just focus on your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. I can feel a little pressure on the balls of my feet and a faint contact at the heels, but my heart's racing and my legs feel tingly, so it's hard to settle. My head keeps yanking me back to the disaster loop — one slip, client complains, metrics tank, boss replaces me — and if I lose this grounding I just know it'll start. Please keep saying the syllables slowly and tell me one tiny, specific thing to notice about my feet (like "right heel" or "left toes") so I have something concrete to hold on to.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of your right big toe. Just focus on that toe, and notice how it's feeling. Is it tense? Relaxed? Heavy? Light? Just take a moment to notice that toe, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Right..." (pause)... "big..." (pause)... "toe..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth". Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice that toe.

Patient: I can feel my right big toe — kind of tingly and a little numb — but my heart's racing and my mind immediately zips to the disaster loop: if I can't even hold this, the experiment will fail and then the whole chain starts. Please keep saying the syllables slowly and tell me the next tiny thing to notice (like "right heel" or "ball of the foot") because if you stop I'll just slide back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of the ball of your right foot. Just focus on that area, and notice how it's feeling. Is it tense? Relaxed? Heavy? Light? Just take a moment to notice the ball of your right foot, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Ball..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "foot..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth". Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice the ball of your right foot.

Patient: I can feel the ball of my right foot — a little warm, pressing into the floor — but I'm way more jittery than before and my heart's racing. Of course my brain is already doing the loop: if I can't even hold this simple focus, the experiment's doomed, a mistake will slip through, the client will complain, metrics will tank and they'll replace me — it feels inevitable. Please keep counting the syllables and tell me the next tiny spot to notice (like "right heel") and go really slowly, because if you stop my thoughts will yank me straight back into that collapse story.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of your right heel. Just focus on that heel, and notice how it's feeling. Is it tense? Relaxed? Heavy? Light? Just take a moment to notice the sensation in your right heel, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Right..." (pause)... "heel..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "floor..." (pause)... "under..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "body..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice your right heel. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus.

Patient: Right heel feels heavy, flat against the floor — dull pressure. But I'm so drained and jittery and my chest's tight, and my brain immediately snaps to the disaster loop — one slip, client complaint, metrics tank, boss replaces me — so I can't hold this unless you keep saying the syllables really slowly and tell me the next tiny spot to notice.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of the arch of your right foot. Just focus on that arch, and notice how it's feeling. Is it tense? Relaxed? Heavy? Light? Just take a moment to notice the arch of your right foot, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Arch..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "foot..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "top..." (pause)... "side..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "foot..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice the arch of your right foot. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus.

Patient: The arch feels flat and a little numb — I can notice it, but I'm running out of steam and my chest's still tight. My head's already flipping to the disaster loop — one slip, client complaint, metrics tank, they replace me — so please keep saying the syllables slowly and tell me the next tiny spot to notice, or I'll slide right back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of the toes on the ground. Just focus on the sensation of your toes, and notice how they're feeling. Are they tense? Relaxed? Heavy? Light? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your toes on the ground, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Toes..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "ground..." (pause)... "under..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "feet..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice your toes on the ground. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus. Take a deep breath, and let's keep going.

Patient: My toes feel kind of curled and a bit numb — I'm drained and my head keeps yanking me back to the disaster loop (if I can't even hold this, the experiment will fail and they'll replace me). Please keep saying the syllables slowly and tell me one tiny thing to notice next, step-by-step, because if you stop I'll just slide right back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just focus on the sensation of the air, and notice how it's feeling. Is it slow? Fast? Light? Heavy? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Air..." (pause)... "moving..." (pause)... "in..." (pause)... "and..." (pause)... "out..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "nostrils..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus.

Patient: I can feel the air — thin, quick, cool at the nostrils — but it's shallow and my chest is tight and my mind immediately zips to the disaster loop: one slip, client complains, metrics tank, they replace me. I can notice it for a beat, but I can't hold it alone — please keep the slow pace and tell me the next tiny thing to focus on, syllable by syllable, so I don't get pulled back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth again. Just focus on the sensation of your tongue, and notice how it's feeling. Is it still a little numb? Or has it changed? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Tongue..." (pause)... "touching..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth..." (pause)... "again..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus.

Patient: It's on the roof — a bit dry and flat, a little numb. But I'm so drained and my chest's tight and my brain's already running the disaster loop — one slip, client complaint, metrics tank, they replace me. I can keep this for a beat if you keep saying the syllables very slowly and tell me the next tiny thing to notice, step-by-step, because if you stop I'll just slide back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Tong..." (pause)... "u..." (pause)... "ge..." (pause)... "on..." (pause)... "the..." (pause)... "roof..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "mouth." I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and notice how it's feeling. Is it slow? Fast? Light? Heavy? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to think about anything else. As you do this, I'll continue to count each syllable out loud: "Breath..." (pause)... "moving..." (pause)... "in..." (pause)... "and..." (pause)... "out..." (pause)... "of..." (pause)... "your..." (pause)... "body..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now..." (pause)... "exactly..." (pause)... "as..." (pause)... "it..." (pause)... "is..." (pause)... "right..." (pause)... "now." Can you do that for me? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. I'm going to say each syllable, and you just listen and focus.

Patient: I can feel the breath — thin and quick, chest tight — but it's fragile; the moment I try to hold it my brain zips to the disaster loop: one mistake, client complains, metrics tank, they replace me. I can stay with this for a few breaths if you keep saying the syllables slowly and count breaths with me — like "inhale one... exhale one..." — and then tell me one tiny next thing to notice (feel your belly rise, or the pause at the top), step‑by‑step, because if you stop I'll slide right back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: "Inhale one..." (pause)... "exhale one..." (pause)... "Inhale two..." (pause)... "Exhale two..." (pause)... "Inhale three..." (pause)... "Exhale three..." (pause)... "Inhale four..." (pause)... "Exhale four..." (pause). I want you to notice the sensation of your diaphragm moving down and then up as you breathe in and out. Just focus on this sensation, and notice how it feels. Is it rising and falling in your chest? Is it tight or loose? Just take a moment to notice the sensation of your diaphragm moving, without trying to think about anything else.

Patient: I can feel the diaphragm — it drops a little on the inhale and rises, but it's shallow and my chest still feels tight. Of course my brain immediately screams the disaster loop — if I can't even hold this, the whole experiment is doomed and they'll replace me — so I need you to keep counting breaths with me and give one tiny next thing to notice, slowly, or I'll just slide back into predicting the collapse.

Therapist: haling breathing rhythm:  breath count: 8 deep breaths. I want you to notice how much your belly drops as you exhale. Just focus on the sensation of your diaphragm dropping down into your abdomen. Notice how relaxed your breathing is, and how much control you have over the breath. Take the first breath in one and out five. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay... I'll try the in-1, out-5. I inhaled — felt the diaphragm drop a bit — exhale was long but shallow and my belly barely sank; my chest's still tight and my head's already snapping to the loop: if this doesn't calm me, the whole experiment's doomed and they'll replace me. Can you keep counting breaths with me slowly and tell me one tiny thing to notice next so I don't slide back into that collapse story?
