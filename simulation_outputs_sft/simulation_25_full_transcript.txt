--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been immersing myself in work — long hours and hyperfocus on deliverables — as a kind of anesthetic against the grief and ongoing family conflict. I can talk about it in terms of avoidance, maladaptive coping, and occupational identity fusion, but when you ask what it actually feels like I tend to theorize instead of naming the sadness. It's starting to affect my effectiveness as a manager and my relationships at home, and it feels like it's becoming unsustainable.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes using work as an anesthetic to cope with grief and family conflict. Core emotion appears to be sadness. Goal: Encourage the patient to describe the sadness in their own words.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it feels like right now, when you're sitting there thinking about the long hours and the stress of managing your team, and the conflict at home? What does it actually feel like, rather than just what's going on?

Patient: Conceptually, I frame it as chronic hypervigilance and affective numbing—an avoidance strategy that I convert into productivity metrics. When I actually notice the body, there's a persistent tightness across my chest, a hollow lump in my throat, and this dull, leaden fatigue that saps even routine pleasure. I keep defaulting to analysis—it's easier to call it "avoidance"—because saying "I'm sad" feels uncomfortably exposed.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient conceptualizes their experience as hypervigilance and affective numbing, but struggles to articulate the physical sensations. They mention a desire to avoid saying "I'm sad". Goal: Help the patient access the emotional experience through gentle exploration, without escalating avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
Those descriptions of physical sensations are really precise. It sounds like there's a sense of being stuck, like the numbness and tightness are persistent. Can you explore what happens if you try to simply acknowledge the sensation, without naming it? Just for a moment, without judgment, what's the experience of that sensation like?

Patient: When I try to simply notice it without naming it, I feel the same chest tightness, a dull hollow behind my sternum, and my breath getting shallow—it's almost embarrassingly physical. Almost immediately I start to theorize—allostatic load, attachment rupture, avoidance schemas—because those frameworks let me observe from a safe distance instead of actually sitting in the sensation. If I try to stay with it for more than a few breaths it feels like vertigo, like something might open up that I don't know how to handle, so I reflexively reach for a task or an email.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's attempt to simply notice the sensations leads to a return to theoretical frameworks and avoidance. Goal: Introduce a gentle defusion technique to help the patient connect with the sensation without getting caught up in theories or avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to stay with the sensation for a few breaths can be quite overwhelming, even if it's just the physical sensations. Can you think of a way to create some small space around the sensation, just for a moment? Maybe imagine that sensation is a leaf floating gently on the surface of a pond. That's it, just the leaf and the water. No need to do anything with it, no need to explore it. Just observe it as it is, for just a single breath.

Patient: Okay — I can picture the leaf and, for a single breath, the chest loosens a hair and that hollow behind my sternum shifts; the breath is shallow but present. Almost immediately my mind jumps to explanatory frameworks—avoidance, allostatic load, occupational fusion—so the observation becomes an intellectual exercise and the tightness ramps up. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to keep it just as a leaf; can we slow down and do another breath together, maybe with a little guidance?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient successfully uses the defusion technique for a brief moment, but quickly returns to theoretical frameworks. They express a desire to slow down and gain more guidance. Goal: Introduce a gentle, gradual slowdown of the observing process, while continuing to support defusion.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. Let's slow down the process together. Instead of just focusing on the leaf floating on the water, can we try to notice how the leaf is moving on the water? Just notice the gentle ripples, the slight eddies. Let's take a deep breath in together... and as we exhale, let's focus just on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. No need to think about the leaf, just the breath. One more breath, together.

Patient: That second breath did something small — my chest loosened a bit and the hollow felt a little less dense. But my brain immediately starts spinning up frameworks again — avoidance, attachment rupture — and I get this awkward, exposed feeling like I want to duck back into a task. I'm a bit shaky; can we slow down and do another guided breath with a count? I don't trust myself to stay with it without some structure.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient experiences a moment of defusion, but it's short-lived due to the return of theoretical frameworks. They express a need for structure and guidance to stay with the sensation. Goal: Introduce a guided breathing exercise with a clear count to help the patient build confidence and stay with the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
It's understandable that you need some structure right now. Let's try a guided breathing exercise with a count. I'll count slowly with you, and we'll take it one breath at a time. When I say "inhale," we'll breathe in together. When I say "hold," we'll pause for a moment. When I say "exhale," we'll breathe out together. Ready? One... inhale... hold... exhale... (pause) Take another breath with me, slowly.

Patient: Okay — breathing with you now. The inhale felt tight and cautious, the hold made the hollow in my chest more obvious, and the exhale let out a small, almost embarrassing loosening like something shifted a millimeter. My mind's already narrating it as "affect discharge" and starts to intellectualize, which almost smothers the actual feeling; I'm a bit shaky — can we do a slower, counted cycle (inhale four, hold two, exhale six) and linger on the exhale so I don't bolt back into analysis?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient successfully engages in a guided breathing exercise, but intellectualization and anticipation creep back in. They request a slower, counted cycle with a longer exhale to linger on the sensation and reduce bolted reactions. Goal: Introduce a deliberate, slow exhale to help the patient stay grounded in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a slower cycle, just for a moment. We'll inhale four times together... 1... 2... 3... 4. Hold for two breaths, just breathe in the body... 1... 2. Now, let's exhale six times, and this time, I want you to linger on the exhale for a moment. Just feel the breath moving out of the body, without thinking about it. Don't try to control it, just allow it to be. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause) Just stay with the feeling of the exhale, for another second. No need to think about anything else. Just the exhale.

Patient: When I lingered on the exhale there was a small unclenching—my chest softened a fraction, a warmth behind the sternum and a prickling at the eyes—nothing dramatic, just a subtle shift. Of course my mind immediately labeled it "affect discharge" and started explaining it away, which makes me feel vulnerable and a bit shaky; can we do another slow exhale together and stay with it a little longer?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient experiences a small, genuine moment of defusion during the longer exhale, but their mind quickly returns to labeling and intellectualizing. They express a desire to linger on the exhale and stay with the sensation longer. Goal: Help the patient gradually build confidence in the present moment, without relying on intellectualization.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel a bit vulnerable right now. Let's try to stay with the feeling of the exhale together. We'll breathe out slowly again... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause) Take a deep breath in, and let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Just notice the rise and fall of the chest, the sensation of the breath in the nostrils. Let's stay with this feeling of the breath for just a moment longer... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause) Just be with the sensation, without trying to think about it or label it. See what happens when you let go of the need to understand it intellectually.

Patient: I tried to let go — there was a thin warmth behind my sternum and a prickling at the corners of my eyes, like sadness trying to surface — but almost immediately my mind labeled it as "affect discharge" and "allostatic load," which feels like a reflexive, almost embarrassed deflection. I'm a bit shaky and would like to slow down; can we do another slow exhale together so I don't rush back into analysis?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient attempts to let go, but their mind quickly returns to intellectualization and labeling. They express a desire to slow down and avoid rushing back into analysis. Goal: Introduce a gentle, non-judgmental acceptance of the emotional experience, without trying to control or understand it intellectually.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel like you're trying to control or understand things intellectually, but that's not what's happening right now. Let's try to accept this feeling without judgment, just for a moment. We'll breathe out slowly again... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause) Just observe the sensation of the breath moving out of the body, without trying to think about it. It's okay if it feels like sadness is trying to surface - just notice that feeling, without trying to push it away or analyze it. Let's just be with the sensation, without judgment or expectation. See what happens when we let go of trying to control it. Let's just breathe...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "just observe" supposed to help? Saying don't analyze just makes me analyze the fact that I'm analyzing, which feels paradoxical and leaves me a bit bewildered. I'm feeling shaky and confused right now; can we do another slow exhale together with a clear count, and maybe give me a concrete anchor besides the breath so I don't immediately retreat into theories?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses confusion about the instruction to simply "observe," and concerns arise about paradoxical thinking and feeling bewildered. They request a clear count and a concrete anchor to help them stay grounded. Goal: Introduce a clear and concrete anchor to support the patient's physical and emotional stability, while continuing to work with the breathing exercise.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to focus on the physical sensations in your body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of the chair beneath you, or the sensation of the air on your skin. Just focus on one of these sensations, and let's try to maintain a slow exhale. We'll count together... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause) Take a deep breath in, and bring your attention back to the anchor. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... (pause) Let's focus on the sensation in your body, and just let the breath move out of your body. When you're ready, we can slowly open our eyes and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Patient: Okay — I opened my eyes a bit and I can feel my feet on the floor, the chair under me, and the air on my forearms, but I'm not sure I follow how "just noticing" is supposed to help; my mind immediately conceptualizes them as data points and explanations. I'm feeling a bit shaky and awkward about how exposed that is. Can we do another slow exhale together, maybe a 4-4-6 count, and keep returning to the anchor so I don't just lapse back into analysis?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to let go of conceptualizing the anchor as data points, and is feeling a bit shaky about being exposed. They request a clear count and a return to the anchor to help them stay grounded. Goal: Use the 4-4-6 count to create a sense of stability and rhythm, while gently refocusing the patient's attention back to the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-6 count together... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... (pause) Now, let's bring our attention back to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed evenly. Just focus on that sensation, without trying to think about it. Inhale... 1... inhale... 2... exhale... 4... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... (pause) Let's take a deep breath in, and bring our attention back to the sensation of your feet on the ground. When you're ready, we can slowly open our eyes and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — focusing on my feet gives a little sensory clarity, but it doesn't stop the intellectualizing; I notice the grounding and then my mind converts it into data. I'm feeling confused and shaky, the hollow in my chest is still there and my eyes feel prickly, and I keep wanting to retreat into theories to make it tolerable. Can we do another slow 4-4-6 breath cycle, but this time add a tactile anchor — like pressing my palms together or holding a small object — so I have something concrete to return to when the analysis kicks in? I want to keep going, but I need that extra structure; can we try that now?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of grounding despite the introduction of a tactile anchor. They express a desire to continue, but require additional structure to help them stay focused. Goal: Introduce a tactile anchor to provide a concrete point of focus, while continuing to use the 4-4-6 breath cycle to create a sense of stability.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-6 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... (pause) Now, let's add a tactile anchor. I want you to press your palms together gently, and then bring them together again. Just focus on the sensation of your palms pressing together, and then releasing. Let's do this a few times... 1... 2... 3... release... 1... 2... 3... release... (pause) As we breathe, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of your palms pressing together, and then releasing. Don't worry about what's happening intellectually, just focus on the physical sensation. We'll keep going with the 4-4-6 cycle... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... 4... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... (pause) When you're ready, we can slowly open our eyes and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Patient: Pressing my palms together helped a little—the hollow eased for a moment—but my attention keeps fracturing into task lists and hypothetical family confrontations and now I'm jittery and distracted. I think I need more structure: can we do another 4-4-6 cycle with the palms plus a short grounding phrase I can repeat silently each exhale so I have something concrete to latch onto? I want to keep going but I'm shaky and need that added anchor.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus despite the introduction of the palms and a grounding phrase. They express a need for more structure to help them stay grounded. Goal: Introduce a short grounding phrase to be repeated silently with each exhale, in addition to the palms, to provide a concrete anchor for the patient's attention.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-6 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... "Root" (pause) exhale... "Root" (pause) exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 4... exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 5... exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 6... exhale... "Root" (pause) Now, bring your attention back to the sensation of your palms pressing together. Just focus on the physical sensation, and repeat the phrase "Root" to yourself as you exhale. Don't worry about what's happening intellectually, just focus on the physical sensation and the phrase. As you inhale, bring your attention back to the sensation of your palms pressing together. Let's keep going... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... "Root" (pause) exhale... "Root" (pause) exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 4... exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 5... exhale... "Root" (pause) inhale... 6... exhale... "Root" (pause) When you're ready, we can slowly open our eyes and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Patient: Okay — the palms plus "Root" helped a little; I can feel the pressure between my hands and that hollow loosened for a beat. But now my chest is tighter, my pulse feels quicker, and my mind is ricocheting through deadlines and hypothetical family escalations, which makes me anxious and jittery. I keep trying to intellectualize it ("is this affect regulation or just a cognitive workaround?") which just makes me feel more exposed and awkward. I want to keep going but I need structure — can we do another slow 4-4-6 cycle together with the palms and "Root," and this time linger on the exhale with a clear count so I have something concrete to hold onto?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a resurgence of anxiety and intellectualization, despite the introduction of the palms and the grounding phrase. They express a need for more structure to help them stay grounded. Goal: Introduce a slower exhale with a clear count to provide a concrete anchor for the patient's attention.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-6 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... exhale... "Root" (pause) 1... exhale... 2... exhale... 3... exhale... 4... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... exhale... 1... (pause) inhale... 4... exhale... 2... exhale... 3... exhale... 5... exhale... 6... exhale... 1... (pause) Now, bring your attention back to the sensation of your palms pressing together. Just focus on the physical sensation, and repeat the phrase "Root" to yourself as you inhale and exhale. Don't worry about what's happening intellectually, just focus on the physical sensation and the phrase. As you exhale, take a deep breath and focus on the counting. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... Let the counting anchor you in the present moment. When you're ready, we can slowly open our eyes and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Patient: I'm actually more confused — that last counting felt scrambled and it made me jittery; my chest's tighter, my pulse is up, and my thoughts are ricocheting through deadlines and family scenarios. I want to keep going, but I need a very clear, steady cycle: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 8, press my palms together, and say "Root" silently on each exhale — lead one slow, measured cycle for me and don't ask me to open my eyes afterward. I know I keep slipping into analysis, but right now I'm just anxious and need that concrete structure.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling confused and anxious, and is requesting a clear and steady cycle to help them stay grounded. Goal: Provide a slow and measured 4-4-8 cycle with a clear instruction to press palms together and say "Root" on each exhale, without asking the patient to open their eyes.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-8 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... inhale... 4... (pause) Hold... 1... Hold... 2... Hold... 3... Hold... 4...

Patient: Okay — I'm pressing my palms together and saying "Root," and it does help a little; there's a millimeter of release but my chest is still tight, my pulse feels up, and my thoughts keep ricocheting through deadlines and family scenarios. My brain immediately turns it into somatic hyperarousal or sympathetic dominance, which makes me feel exposed and awkward. Can we do another slow 4-4-8 cycle led by you — three rounds in a row, slower this time, and don't ask me to open my eyes afterward — and on each exhale tell me to squeeze my palms a bit so I have a concrete thing to anchor to? I need the structure; I'm anxious and a bit shaky.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still experiencing anxiety and a sense of exposure, despite the introduction of the "Root" phrase and the pressure on the palms. They request a slower 4-4-8 cycle with an emphasis on squeezing the palms on each exhale. Goal: Provide a slow and deliberate cycle, with a focus on physical anchoring, to help the patient stay grounded and reduce anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-8 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... inhale... 4... (pause) Hold... 1... Hold... 2... Hold... 3... Hold... 4... (pause) exhale... 1...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—the last counting felt scrambled and it made me more on edge. Pressing my palms and saying "Root" helped a hair, but the chest tightness and the task-racing thoughts are still there and I'm pretty depleted, so I don't have the energy for more analysis right now. Could you just lead one slow, clear 4-4-8 cycle—count each number plainly and tell me when to squeeze my palms on the exhale? I need something simple and steady.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling overwhelmed and depleted, and requests a simple and steady 4-4-8 cycle to help them feel more grounded. Goal: Provide a clear and slow 4-4-8 cycle with a focus on physical anchoring, without any additional analysis or commentary.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-8 cycle... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... inhale... 4... exhale... 1... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 2... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 3... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 4... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 5... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 6... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 7... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 8... Squeeze your palms... (pause) Just focus on the counting and the sensation of your palms.

Patient: Okay—that actually helped a little. There was a tiny unclench in my chest and my breath felt a hair deeper; my palms gave me something concrete to hang onto. But it's brief—my mind already ricochets to deadlines and family scenarios, and I'm too depleted to do the usual intellectual posturing about "avoidance schemas." 

I'm shaky and low-energy; can we do one more slow 4-4-8 with palms and "Root," and then, when we're done, can we talk about one concrete strategy I can use at work when the urge to overwork to numb hits me? I don't trust myself to invent one in the moment.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a brief moment of relief, but is still struggling with low energy and depletion. They request one more 4-4-8 cycle with palms and "Root," and then a concrete strategy for managing the urge to overwork. Goal: Provide a final 4-4-8 cycle, and then help the patient identify a concrete strategy for managing overwork.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the 4-4-8 cycle again... inhale... 1... inhale... 2... inhale... 3... inhale... 4... exhale... 1... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 2... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 3... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 4... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 5... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 6... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 7... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 8...

When we're done, we'll talk about a concrete strategy for managing overwork at work. For now, just focus on the counting and the sensation of your palms. Remember, you can do one step at a time, and one task at a time. When you feel overwhelmed, take a deep breath in, and ask yourself: "What is one thing I can do right now to move forward, even if it's just for a minute?"

Patient: Alright — the “one thing” I can do right now is a concrete implementation-intention: when I notice the urge to overwork to avoid feeling, I stop and do a 2–3 minute anchor routine (one 4-4-8 breath with palms + “Root”), then I either start a single, explicit 25‑minute focused timer on one small, well‑defined task or I close the laptop for 10 minutes and take a short walk. I’ll mark it with a sticky note on my monitor and a phone timer so it’s automatic and doesn’t require decision-making in the moment.

It feels embarrassingly procedural, which is probably why I like it, but I can already picture obstacles — guilt, colleagues noticing, justifying why I stepped away. Can we work on a very short script I can use at work and anticipate two realistic barriers so this actually sticks? I'm pretty drained, so keep it simple.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a concrete implementation-intention to manage the urge to overwork, and is willing to work on a short script to anticipate potential barriers. Goal: Help the patient develop a simple script to address two realistic barriers, and make the plan more automatic and resistant to obstacles.

Therapist Answer:
Let's break down the script into two parts: one for anticipating the barrier of guilt, and one for anticipating the barrier of colleagues noticing.

**Guilt Barrier:**
When you catch yourself thinking "I should be working right now" or "I'm wasting time," say to yourself:
"I'm taking care of my mental health by stepping away from work. I'm not abandoning my responsibilities, I'm just prioritizing my well-being. I can come back to this task when I'm feeling more focused."

**Colleagues Noticing Barrier:**
When a colleague approaches you and asks what you're doing, say:
"I'm taking a short break to recharge. I'll be back to work on [specific task] in [specific amount of time]."

Remember, the goal is to be brief, clear, and confident. Practice these scripts a few times, and see how they feel when you use them in the heat of the moment.

Now, let's take a moment to acknowledge how far you've come. You've taken a huge step by identifying a concrete strategy for managing your overwork, and by creating a simple script to anticipate potential barriers. Take a deep breath, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this.

Patient: That actually lands as something I can imagine doing — the sticky note + timer feels pragmatic — but it also feels awkward and a little exposing, and my head is already generating counter-arguments ("I don't have time," "they'll think I'm slacking"). I'm running on a thin reserve right now, so could we do two brief things before we keep going: 1) roleplay the colleague line once so I can rehearse the tone (I need to hear how to say it without sounding defensive), and 2) help me pick a one-to-two word internal cue that will trigger the anchor without sending me into meta-analysis? Also — if the urge hits late at night and leaving feels impossible, what’s one simple step I can use in that moment?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling more grounded, but still struggling with self-doubt and counter-arguments. Goal: Provide a brief roleplay exercise to help the patient rehearse a key interaction, and introduce a simple internal cue to trigger the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
Let's roleplay the colleague line once, and then help you find a simple internal cue.

**Colleague Line:**
You can try saying: "I'm taking a short break to recharge. I'll be back to work on [specific task] in 25 minutes." Try to say it with a neutral tone, without apologizing or justifying. You want to convey that you're taking care of yourself, without being too vague or ambiguous.

As we rehearse, pay attention to your body language and tone. You want to feel confident and assertive, without being aggressive or confrontational.

**Internal Cue:**
To trigger the anchor without sending you into meta-analysis, let's try a simple phrase: "Breath in, focus." When you feel the urge to overwork, repeat this phrase to yourself, and take a deep breath in. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without thinking about it intellectually.

When you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, try to say this phrase to yourself, without thinking about it too much. It's like a mental anchor, that helps you stay grounded and focused.

Now, let's think about the situation when the urge hits late at night, and leaving feels impossible. What can you do in that moment?

One simple step you can take is to look away from your screen and focus on your breath. Just take a few deep breaths, and try to calm down. This can help you regulate your body and mind, and give you a moment to think about what to do next.

Remember, it's not about finding a solution right now, it's just about taking care of yourself in the moment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the colleague line out loud: "I'm taking a short break to recharge. I'll be back to work on the quarterly report in 25 minutes." Saying it felt a little clipped and I noticed an urge to apologize after — so I think I need to practice the neutral tone so I don't undercut it.

For the internal cue, one word seems best so it doesn't invite analysis — I'll use "Root" since it already ties to the palms anchor and the breathing. And for late-night when leaving feels impossible, a tiny behavioral step I can actually do: stop typing, set a 5‑minute phone timer, do one 4-4-8 breath with palms and "Root," then close the laptop for those five minutes. It feels embarrassingly procedural, but I can picture doing it.

Can you give me one quick line of feedback on my delivery (tone, pace) and then lead one more very brief 4-4-8 with palms and "Root"? I'm pretty drained, so keep it short.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making good progress with the colleague line and internal cue. Goal: Provide a brief piece of feedback on delivery, and then lead a final 4-4-8 exercise.

Therapist Answer:
Your tone came across as slightly guarded, especially when you said "I'll be back to work on the quarterly report." It's like you're trying to convey confidence without feeling too exposed. Try to relax into the phrase a bit more. Remember, it's okay to say it without apologizing or justifying. Just focus on the words themselves, without thinking too much about how you're saying them.

Let's do one more 4-4-8 exercise, just for a minute. Inhale... 1... exhale... 1... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 2... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 3... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 4... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 5... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 6... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 7... Squeeze your palms... exhale... 8... Squeeze your palms...

Patient: That helped a little — a tiny unclench and my palms actually gave me something to hold onto — but I'm still pretty shaky and drained, and my brain's already drafting caveats about how that won't stick. Can we do two very brief things next: 1) rehearse the colleague line once more with you modelling a calm, neutral tone so I can mirror it, and 2) come up with one short sticky‑note phrase I can put on my monitor to trigger the anchor without overthinking?

Therapist Answer:
 4-4-8 cycle with focus on a single 1-2 word phrase, like "I am.".

Patient: Yeah — please model the colleague line once for me, exactly like: "I'm taking a short break to recharge. I'll be back to work on the quarterly report in 25 minutes." Say it calm, neutral, no apology, so I can mirror the tone.

For the sticky note, I'll use one word: "Root" — short, ties to the palms and the breath. Can you say the line, then lead one more slow 4-4-8 with "Root" on each exhale? I need to hear it and mirror it.

Patient: I’m not sure I follow—that string of words just made me more bewildered and a bit on edge. I’ll try to mirror the colleague line: “I’m taking a short break to recharge. I’ll be back to work on the quarterly report in 25 minutes.” It felt clipped and I wanted to apologize afterward. Can you say that once in a calm, neutral tone for me to match, and then lead one slow 4-4-8 with “Root” on each exhale? My energy’s low, so please keep it steady.

Patient: I’m not sure I follow—that last block felt scattered and made me a bit disoriented and on edge. Could you just do what I asked before: say the colleague line once in a calm, neutral tone (“I’m taking a short break to recharge. I’ll be back to work on the quarterly report in 25 minutes.”), then lead one slow 4-4-8 breathing cycle with me, saying “Root” on each exhale? I’m pretty drained, so please keep it slow and simple.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—you're asking me to define avoidance? Okay: in conceptual terms, avoidance is any behavior that operantly reduces or prevents exposure to an aversive internal state. For me, overworking is the behavior; the aversive state is the grief/tightness/hollowness. The immediate payoff is relief (less feeling), plus social reinforcement (praise, progress), so it gets reinforced despite longer‑term costs.

Triggers and maintenance look like: a chest-tightening moment, an intrusive thought about family, or a looming deadline → I reflexively do a task to numb → brief relief → repeat. Barriers to change are guilt about stopping, habit cues (desk, laptop), and the cultural reward for being "always on."

A concrete, simple step that fits that analysis: an if‑then plan tied to a clear cue. Example I can actually use: "If I notice the hollow/tight chest or the thought 'I should keep working,' then I will do one 4-4-8 breath with palms + say 'Root,' and either start one 25‑minute focused timer on a single, clearly defined task or close the laptop for 10 minutes and walk." Pair that with a sticky note ("Root") and a phone timer so it doesn't require deliberation.

I'm pretty worn out right now and would like help narrowing that to one exact phrasing I can stick on my monitor and rehearsing the colleague line once more so I don't undercut it. Can we do that?

Patient: I’m not sure I follow—that last block felt jumbled and it made me a bit disoriented. It sounds like you’re circling the same plan (4-4 breathing, “Root,” then a 25‑minute focused task) which, conceptually, makes sense to me as an implementation intention, but I’m low-energy and need something simple and concrete.

Could you just do two things, plainly and slowly: 1) say the colleague line once in a calm, neutral tone (“I’m taking a short break to recharge. I’ll be back to work on the quarterly report in 25 minutes.”), and 2) lead one clear 4-4-8 breathing cycle with me, telling me to squeeze my palms and say “Root” on each exhale? Keep it slow — don’t ask me to open my eyes afterward.
