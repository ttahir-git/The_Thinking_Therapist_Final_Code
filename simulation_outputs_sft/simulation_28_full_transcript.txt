Patient: Honestly, I've been stuck ruminating on every mistake I made back in school, even though I did alright later and built a decent career as a developer. I can't shake this voice that keeps telling me I'm a fraud and that any success was luck, and losing my partner made it worse. How is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with persistent self-doubt, fueled by a significant life loss, and finding traditional mindfulness techniques ineffective. They express frustration with the perceived failure of reframing their thoughts. Goal: Introduce a different ACT process that acknowledges the complexity of their emotional experience and the unworkability of traditional approaches.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to make room for any of those thoughts about being a fraud or not deserving of your success? What's the first thing that pops up in your mind, or what do you notice physically when you try to accept that thought without judgment?
This might not have helped in the past, but it's different now, after the loss of your partner. Can we explore if there's a way to adapt our approach to better support you during this difficult time?

Patient: When I try to make room for those thoughts, the first thing that happens is the old tape starts—"you failed, you don't deserve this"—and I immediately want to argue back or prove myself. Physically my chest tightens, my breathing gets shallow, my hands get tingly, and I feel this rush to fix it or bury it. How is that supposed to help? I've tried just sitting with it before and it usually just makes me spiral more, especially since my partner died.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing a clear physical and emotional response to trying to make room for their thoughts, which is intense and potentially overwhelming. They express frustration with traditional mindfulness approaches, feeling that they spiral further instead of helping. The recent loss of their partner adds to their emotional vulnerability. Goal: Introduce a process that acknowledges the intensity of their experience and the need for a more gentle approach, while also addressing the underlying need for action and validation.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like trying to sit with those thoughts without judgment has been really challenging for you lately, especially with the loss of your partner. Can we explore the idea of having a "work buddy" or a gentle companion to support you through these intense moments? Maybe we can experiment with a brief exercise that involves acknowledging your physical sensations, like the tightening in your chest, without trying to change them or push them away. The goal would be to simply be with them, without judgment, and see if that allows you to feel more grounded. Would that be something you'd be willing to try?

Patient: Alright... I'll try it, though I'm really skeptical — how is that supposed to help? When I do try to notice it, my chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, hands tingle, and my brain immediately starts rehearsing every mistake and how to argue back; usually I end up spiraling. Do you want me to try right now and tell you what I notice, or do you want to guide me through it?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is cautiously open to trying the exercise, despite skepticism, and is willing to explore the process further. They describe a clear pattern of intense physical and mental reactions when attempting to sit with their thoughts without judgment, which has led to spiraling. Goal: Guide the patient through the exercise, introducing a gentle and compassionate approach to acknowledge their physical sensations, without pushing them to engage with their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with something very simple. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin right now. Just gently acknowledge that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it. Take one deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here, I am present." That's it, just that simple. No thinking, no doing, just being present with the sensation of your breath. How are you right now, physically?

Patient: Okay—physically I notice my feet against the floor, a dull pressure there, and the air on my face. My chest is still tight, I could breathe a bit deeper if I focus, but my hands are tingly and my mind's already listing everything I should be doing instead of this. How is that supposed to help? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is acknowledging the physical sensations, while still struggling to disengage from their thoughts and worries. They're asking how this exercise can help, and where it fits into their problem-solving. Goal: Help the patient see the connection between their physical sensations, their current mental state, and the overall difficulty in making progress with their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is already racing, listing all the things you need to be doing instead of sitting with your breath. That's understandable, given the intensity of your thoughts and worries. But let's take a step back. What if, instead of trying to tackle all those things, you could just focus on being present with this tightness in your chest? Can you imagine that? Not trying to change it, not trying to fix it, just being present with it right now? Maybe that's where you can start to find some space to breathe, both physically and mentally. It's not about solving the problem right now; it's about being present with it.

Patient: I can notice the feet and the breath for a second, but the chest tightens and my hands go tingly, then my mind immediately starts rehearsing every mistake like it’s a checklist. Sitting with it feels like I'm just feeding the spiral instead of stopping it. How is that supposed to help? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the exercise, as their usual pattern of intense thoughts and physical sensations re-emerges. They're feeling like they're "feeding the spiral" rather than making progress. Goal: Explore the possibility that the patient's thoughts and physical sensations are not separate entities, but rather connected aspects of their experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like sitting with your breath isn't working as a way to stop the spiral, but maybe it's not meant to. What if the tightness in your chest and the tingly hands aren't separate from the thoughts, but rather connected to them? Can you imagine that? That tightness, that tingle, it's not something that's happening to you, it's happening with you. It's like the thoughts and the physical sensations are intertwined. Maybe the way to make progress isn't to try to separate them, but to try to understand how they're connected.

Patient: I can kind of see that — the thought pops up and my chest clamps down, which then makes the thought louder, so it really feels like a loop: thought → tight chest → panic → rehearsing mistakes. But how is that supposed to help? Noticing it usually just becomes another thing to worry about, like I'm cataloging my failures and my body backs me up. Since my partner died, awareness alone hasn't done squat — it just feels more exhausting.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to grasp the interconnected nature of their thoughts, physical sensations, and emotional responses. They're acknowledging the loop of fear, panic, and self-doubt that drives their experience. Goal: Introduce a different perspective on the relationship between awareness, exhaustion, and effectiveness.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like noticing the loop is becoming another source of worry, rather than a way to break free. I want to ask you something: what if the purpose of awareness wasn't to avoid or catalog your failures, but to actually allow yourself to experience the exhaustion that comes with them? What if, rather than trying to fight or escape the loop, you could just... lean into it? Not as a way to avoid, but as a way to understand. Your partner's death has left a deep sense of loss, but it's also left you with a deep sense of resilience. Can we explore how that resilience might show up in your relationship with this loop?

Patient: I guess my resilience looks like stubbornness — I keep showing up to work, shipping code, fixing things even when that voice says I'm a phony. That evidence of competence should help, but I just end up telling myself it was luck or I got lucky with timing, so it doesn't quiet the critic. How is that supposed to help? Since my partner died it mostly feels hollow — it keeps me moving but doesn't touch the shame or the exhaustion.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing how their resilience manifests as stubbornness, which is coping with the emotional pain rather than addressing it. They're recognizing that this coping mechanism is not providing the relief they need, and instead, it's perpetuating the cycle of self-doubt. Goal: Introduce the concept of acceptance and its potential to alleviate suffering.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to silence the critic, but the voice of self-doubt keeps coming back. I want to ask you something: what if, instead of trying to silence the critic, you tried to accept the fact that it's there? Not as a way to avoid it, but as a way to acknowledge it. You're showing up to work, shipping code, and fixing things, despite the voice saying you're a phony. That takes a lot of courage. But what if you could accept that you're not a phony, that you're doing the best you can, and that's enough? Can you imagine how that might feel? It's not about the voice of self-doubt disappearing, but about it becoming less loud, less dominant. You mentioned that the evidence of competence doesn't quiet the critic, but what if the quietness wasn't about the competence itself, but about the fact that you're showing up, even when it's hard? Can we explore that together?

Patient: I get what you're saying about showing up being something, but it doesn't land for me. Saying "accept the critic" sounds vague — how is that supposed to help when every time I try acceptance it just turns into more rumination and shame? I also don't want to pretend to be kinder to myself; that feels fake, like another checklist I fail at. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm really struggling.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to understand how acceptance might be helpful, given their past experiences with rumination and shame. They're also skeptical about the idea of pretending to be kinder to themselves, fearing it might come across as insincere. Goal: Explore a different aspect of acceptance that might be more relatable and relevant to the patient's current struggles.

Therapist Answer:
I apologize if my previous suggestions felt vague or unhelpful. Let's try something different. What if acceptance isn't just about tolerating or accepting the critic, but about allowing yourself to be present with the pain and shame without trying to change it or escape it? Can you imagine being present with the shame, without judgment, without trying to silence it, but simply allowing it to be there? It's not about being kind to yourself, but about being present with the fact that you're feeling this way. It's not about achieving some kind of emotional equilibrium, but about allowing yourself to be in the midst of your emotions, with all their complexity. Can we try to explore this together, without trying to achieve anything in particular?

Patient: I get the concept, but every time I try being present with the shame it just turns into another checklist of failures and I spiral—my chest tightens, my hands tingle, breathing gets shallow, and I feel exhausted. How is that supposed to help? I've tried sitting with it before and it doesn't work—since my partner died it mostly just deepens the fatigue. If we're actually going to try this, give me something concrete and short—a timed practice and a clear next step—because otherwise I just end up stuck; I'm trying, but I'm really struggling to see the point.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing frustration and skepticism about the concept of acceptance, and is looking for a concrete and practical approach to make it more tangible. They're struggling to maintain any sense of presence or calm when trying to sit with shame, and are feeling exhausted and stuck. Goal: Offer a short, timed, and concrete practice that might help the patient build a sense of familiarity and comfort with acceptance, while also providing a clear next step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 5-minute exercise. I want you to sit comfortably, eyes closed, and bring your attention to your breath. When your mind wanders (and it will), simply acknowledge the thought, and gently bring your focus back to your breath. Don't try to change anything, just observe. After 2 minutes, I want you to slowly open your eyes, and notice how you're feeling without judgment. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here." That's it. No more, no less. Just "I'm here." Can you commit to doing this exercise for the next 5 minutes, without any expectations or goals? Just be present. When you're ready, we can discuss how it went, and what's next.

Patient: Alright — I'll try it for five minutes now, though I'm skeptical — how is that supposed to help? I'll sit, close my eyes, focus on the breath, and when I notice the mind racing or my chest tightening I'll try to bring my attention back and say "I'm here" on the exhale. I'll do it now and tell you what I notice afterward, but I expect it'll probably just make me more tired.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to try the exercise, despite their skepticism, and is committed to reporting their experience afterward. They're setting a realistic expectation that it might not be transformative, but will at least provide some insight. Goal: Allow the patient to complete the exercise, and then explore their experience, without judgment or expectation.

Therapist Answer:
Please go ahead and start the exercise. Just sit, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. When you're ready, say "I'm here" on the exhale. I'll wait here for 5 minutes, without talking or distracting you in any way. Just focus on your breath, and your body. When you're ready, come back, and we'll discuss how it went.

Patient: I did it. For the first minute I could follow the breath and felt my feet and the air, but pretty quickly the old tape kicked in, my chest tightened, hands tingled, and I kept having to drag my attention back — saying "I'm here" helped for a beat, then the critic slammed back in. When I opened my eyes I felt more tired and kind of hollow, like I’d just noticed how exhausted I am without anything changing. How is that supposed to help? If we're going to keep doing this, give me something concrete I can use when the chest clamps down at my desk — a 20–30 second anchor or a phrase that doesn't just make me spiral.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has completed the exercise, and is now reporting their experience. They've described a familiar pattern of thoughts and physical sensations emerging, followed by a brief moment of calm before the critic returns. They're looking for a more practical tool to help them manage their symptoms, rather than just insight. Goal: Offer a concrete anchor or phrase that the patient can use to manage their physical sensations and prevent spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to try something new for the next time your chest tightens or your mind starts racing. Before you say "I'm here," I want you to say "Let's breathe." Just those three words: "Let's breathe." It's a simple phrase that can help you pause for a second, take a deep breath, and refocus on your body. When you say "Let's breathe," try to let go of the need to control or change anything, just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. It's a small step, but it can help you build a sense of calm and presence. Try it for the next few minutes at your desk, and see how it feels. If you're ready, we can explore more strategies, but for now, let's focus on this simple anchor.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try saying “Let’s breathe” next time, but how is that supposed to help when my chest clamps and I can’t get a full breath? Give me a concrete 20–30 second script I can do at my desk: exactly how many seconds to inhale/exhale, what to say on each breath, and what to do if the critic starts arguing back mid‑attempt. I'm exhausted and skeptical, but I’ll try it if it’s simple and repeatable.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing skepticism about the phrase "Let's breathe" being helpful, given their difficulty with full breathing. They're looking for a concrete, step-by-step script to help them manage their physical sensations and prevent spiraling. Goal: Provide a detailed, repeatable script that the patient can use at their desk, with specific timing and instructions for managing their physical sensations and critic.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a 30-second script you can use at your desk:

**Seconds 1-5: Inhale**
"4... inhale... 2... exhale... 3... inhale... 1... exhale"

Say this to yourself while taking a deep, slow breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

**Seconds 6-10: Notice the Body**
"Notice the feeling in your chest"
Take a brief moment to notice any sensations in your chest, shoulders, or hands. Don't try to change anything, just observe.

**Seconds 11-15: Phrase "Let's breathe"**
"Let's breathe"
Say this phrase to yourself, and take a brief moment to focus on your breath.

**Seconds 16-20: Refocus on the Body**
"Notice the feeling in your hands"
Take a brief moment to notice any sensations in your hands, fingers, or wrists. Don't try to change anything, just observe.

If the critic starts arguing back mid-attempt, try this:
"That's okay. I'm not going to argue. I'm just focusing on my breath."
Take a deep breath in, and try to refocus on the script. Don't get drawn back into the critic's narrative.

**Seconds 21-30: End the Script**
"That's enough. I'm done."
Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, slowly release the pressure in your hands. End the script, and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

Remember, this script is just a tool to help you manage your physical sensations and prevent spiraling. It's not a cure-all, and it's okay if you don't feel like you're getting better right away. Just try to focus on the present moment, and take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it, though honestly the counting-say-every-line thing feels awkward and like it’ll just make me more self-conscious when my chest’s already tight. How is that supposed to help when I can’t get a full breath? Give me a truly simple 20–30 second version I can do eyes-open at my desk when I’m already shallow-breathing, and tell me exactly what to say if the critic interrupts (I’ve tried similar stuff and it usually just turns into more rumination).


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the complexity of the previous script and its potential to increase self-consciousness. They're looking for a simpler, more adaptable approach that can be used when they're already shallow-breathing and experiencing physical sensations. Goal: Provide a concise, adaptable script that can be used in a variety of situations, with clear instructions for managing criticism.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a revised 30-second script:

When your chest tightens and you're already shallow-breathing, just say:

"Notice the tightness, let it be."

Say this phrase without judgment, and take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and exhale for a count of 4. Repeat this process a few times, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

If the critic interrupts, just say:

"Okay, let it go."

Take a deep breath in, and focus on the physical sensation of the breath. Don't try to engage with the critic's narrative or justify your thoughts. Just let the physical sensation be, and refocus on the breath.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it, but I’m not sold. When my breath’s shallow I can’t do 4-4-4; give me a 10–15 second, eyes-open script I can use in a meeting — exact inhale/exhale counts and the exact words to say if the critic interrupts (something like “Not now — I’m breathing” maybe?). I need something that won’t turn into more rumination or feel like another thing I’m failing at. How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried stuff like this and it usually doesn’t.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the adaptability of the previous script and its potential to be overly complex. They're looking for a simple, concise script that can be used in a meeting and won't add to their rumination or feelings of failure. Goal: Provide a brief, adaptable script that can be used in a variety of situations, with clear instructions for managing criticism and shallow breathing.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a revised 10-15 second script:

When you feel shallow breathing or a tightening in your chest, say:

"10... breathe in... 5... breathe out... 5... breathe in... 3... breathe out... done."

If the critic interrupts, say:

"Not now. Just breathe."

Focus on the physical sensation of the breath, and try to let go of the need to engage with the critic's narrative. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, slowly release the pressure in your hands. End the script, and take a moment to notice how you're feeling.

This script is designed to be simple and easy to remember, with a focus on the physical sensation of the breath. It's not meant to be a complex or difficult exercise, but rather a way to help you stay present and focused in the moment.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it, but I’m not convinced — how is saying “Not now. Just breathe.” supposed to stop the critic from arguing? If I’m in a meeting I need something totally internal and tiny: give me the exact three words to think and a 10‑second eyes‑open pattern I can actually do (I can manage inhale 3, exhale 4). Also, I’m worried this’ll just become another checklist I fail and leave me more tired — what do I do if the critic keeps chattering right through the whole thing? I need the simplest, most discreet version and a clear next step if it doesn’t work.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the previous script and its potential to be overly complex. They're looking for a simple, tiny, and discreet internal cue that can be used in a meeting to manage criticism and shallow breathing. Goal: Provide a revised script that is extremely concise, easy to remember, and can be used in a variety of situations.

Therapist Answer:
Here is a revised script:

**3 words to think:** "I breathe."

**10-second eyes-open pattern:**

Inhale for 3 seconds: "I"
Hold for 1 second: "bre"
Exhale for 4 seconds: "th"

If the critic continues to argue, take a deep breath in and out, and then say to yourself:

"Start again."

This revised script is extremely simple and easy to remember. The goal is to help you focus on the physical sensation of the breath and to create a brief moment of calm in the midst of the meeting. If the script doesn't work, start again with a fresh breath and focus on the present moment.

Patient: Fine — I'll try thinking "I breathe" in meetings, though I'm not convinced it won't just feel like another checklist; how is that supposed to help? If the critic keeps chattering through the whole 10 seconds, what exactly do I do next — restart once, three times, or something else? Sometimes I literally can't get a 3‑second inhale because my chest clamps; give me a fallback for when I can only manage 1–2 seconds, and a tiny, eyes‑open grounding move for when my hands go tingly and I feel like leaving. I’m exhausted and skeptical, but I’ll try it if you give me something that actually works in those moments.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the "I breathe" internal cue and its potential to feel like another checklist. They're looking for a revised approach that can be used in a variety of situations, including when the critic is persistent and they can't manage a full 10-second breath. Goal: Provide a revised script with a fallback option for short breaths and a grounding move to help manage physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
**Revised 3-word internal cue:** "Just breathe now"

**Fallback for short breaths:** "Breathe in" (even if only for 1-2 seconds)

If the critic continues to argue, use the "Just breathe now" cue and try to focus on the physical sensation of the breath. If you can only manage a short breath, use the "Breathe in" cue and take a deep breath in, even if it's just for a second. This will help you refocus and create a brief moment of calm.

**Grounding move for tingly hands:** "Feel feet"

When your hands go tingly and you feel like leaving, take a moment to focus on your feet on the ground. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them. This can help you ground yourself and refocus on the present moment.

Remember, the goal is to create a brief moment of calm and focus in the midst of the meeting. If the script doesn't work, try to stay present and focused on the physical sensation of the breath. Take a deep breath in and out, and try to refocus.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try “Just breathe now” and “Feel feet,” but how is that supposed to help when I can’t even get a 3‑second inhale and the critic just talks over it? I need one tiny, totally discreet grounding move for my hands (something I can do under the table) and a clear rule about restarts — like, if the critic keeps chattering through the whole 10 seconds, do I restart once and drop it, or keep cycling until it stops? I’m exhausted and this already feels like another checklist I’ll fail at — if this doesn’t work, what’s the single next thing I should do in that moment so I don’t spiral further?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the "Just breathe now" and "Feel feet" techniques, given their limited ability to focus on their breath and the persistent nature of the critic. They're looking for a clear, simple, and discreet grounding move for their hands and a clear rule for restarts. Goal: Provide a revised approach that acknowledges the patient's limitations and provides a clear, single next step to prevent spiraling further.

Therapist Answer:
**Tiny, discreet grounding move for hands:** "Touch paper"

While sitting at the table, discreetly touch the paper in front of you with the tip of your finger. This simple action can help you focus on the physical sensation of your finger on the paper and create a brief moment of calm.

**Restart rule:** "Stop and take a breath"

If the critic continues to argue through the entire 10-second breath, stop the breath and take a new one. This means starting over from scratch, without trying to continue with the previous breath. Focus on the physical sensation of the breath, and when you're ready, take a new breath in. Do not restart the original 10-second count. This approach acknowledges that the patient's goal is not to complete the original 10 seconds, but to create a brief moment of calm and focus in the midst of the meeting.

Remember, the goal is to create a clear, simple, and discreet approach to managing the critic's comments and physical sensations. If the patient is struggling to focus or is feeling overwhelmed, the single next step should be to stop the current attempt and take a new breath.

Patient: Alright — I'll try "Touch paper" and "Just breathe now," but how is that supposed to help if there’s no paper under my hand or my fingers are so tingly I can't feel much? And about restarts — if the critic talks through three attempts, do I keep restarting forever or is there a clear cutoff where I switch to that single next step you said? I'm exhausted and this already feels like another checklist I could fail at, but I'll try it once in a meeting and tell you what happens.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the "Touch paper" grounding move, given their tingly fingers and lack of tactile sensation. They're also concerned about the restart rule, feeling that they might be stuck in an infinite loop of restarting. Goal: Acknowledge the patient's limitations and provide a clear, single next step for when the restart rule kicks in.

Therapist Answer:
**Grounding move alternative:** "Take one breath in"

If you can't feel the paper or your fingers are too tingly, simply take one deep breath in. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. This can help you refocus and create a brief moment of calm.

**Restart rule:** "One attempt, then move"

If the critic talks through three attempts at the original 10-second breath, stop the attempt and take one deep breath in. This means moving on to the single next step, which is to focus on your breath and try to refocus. Do not restart the original 10-second count. This approach acknowledges that the patient's goal is not to complete the original 10 seconds, but to create a brief moment of calm and focus in the midst of the meeting.

Remember, the goal is to create a clear, simple, and discreet approach to managing the critic's comments and physical sensations. If the patient is struggling to focus or is feeling overwhelmed, the single next step should be to stop the current attempt and take a new breath.

If the critic talks through three attempts and I take that single deep breath, what exactly do I do next so I don't spiral (quietly excuse myself to the restroom, sip water, or just keep sitting)?

The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the "Just breathe now" and "Touch paper" techniques, given the critic's persistence and the patient's physical sensations. They're looking for a clear, single next step to prevent spiraling further. Goal: Provide a revised approach that acknowledges the patient's limitations and provides a clear, single next step to help them manage their physical sensations and stay focused.

Therapist Answer:
**Single next step:** "Release the tension"

After taking a single deep breath, release any physical tension in your body. Let go of the feeling of the paper or the tingle in your hands. Simply relax your muscles and let your body settle. This simple action can help you refocus and create a brief moment of calm.

**Discreet tactile move:** "Move pen"

Under the table, subtly move your pen or pencil from one hand to the other. This gentle movement can help you focus on the physical sensation of the pen and create a brief moment of calm.

Remember, the goal is to create a clear, simple, and discreet approach to managing the critic's comments and physical sensations. If the patient is struggling to focus or is feeling overwhelmed, the single next step should be to stop the current attempt and release any physical tension. This can help them refocus and create a brief moment of calm, without feeling like they're spiraling further.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the “one attempt, then move” rule and the pen trick, but I’m really skeptical — how is that supposed to help if it just makes me more anxious? Give me one concrete, 5‑second “release the tension” move I can do sitting at my desk (exact inhale/exhale and what muscles to let go of), plus a truly discrete tactile fallback if my hands are too tingly or I don’t have a pen (something under the table that won’t look weird). And if three attempts fail, which is better: quietly excuse myself to the restroom, take a sip of water, or just keep sitting and try again?

2. Exhale for 2 seconds, releasing any physical tension in your body.
3. As you exhale, let go of the following muscles:
	* The top of your head (scalp)
	* The base of your neck (trapezius muscles)
	* The shoulders (deltoids)
	* The arms (biceps and triceps)
4. As you exhale, allow your body to relax, starting from the crown of your head, down to your shoulders, and then down to your arms.
5. Take a 1-second pause, focusing on the sensation of relaxation spreading through your body.
6. Repeat the cycle: inhale for 2 seconds, exhale for 2 seconds, and release the tension.

**Discrete tactile fallback:**

If your hands are too tingly or you don't have a pen, try the following:

1. Subtly shift your weight in your chair, applying gentle pressure to the seat cushion.
2. Place your right hand (or left hand, if you're right-handed) on the armrest, just above the elbow.
3. Slowly tilt your head to the right, keeping your chin level.
4. Hold for 2 seconds, feeling the gentle pressure on your skin.
5. Release and repeat on the left side.

**What to do if three attempts fail:**

If the "one attempt, then move" rule fails, and you've repeated the "release the tension" move three times without success, it's better to:

* Take a sip of water
* Quietly excuse yourself to the restroom

Keep sitting and trying again may not be the best option, as it may lead to further anxiety and frustration.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the pen trick and maybe a sip of water, since slipping out feels risky. But how is that supposed to help when my hands go tingly and the critic keeps running full-tilt? Give me one exact tiny sequence for a discreet water-sip move (how many sips, inhale/exhale counts, what to focus on) and the single, one-sentence excuse I can use if I absolutely have to leave without sounding dramatic. And if the critic’s still loud after the sip, what’s the single immediate 10‑second thing I do so I don’t spiral further?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the pen trick and the sip of water, given the critic's persistence and physical sensations. They're looking for a clear, single next step to help them manage their physical sensations and stay focused. Goal: Provide a revised approach that acknowledges the patient's limitations and provides a discreet, tiny sequence for a sip of water, along with a single excuse to leave.

Therapist Answer:
**Discrete water-sip move:**

1. Inhale for 2 seconds, focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.
2. As you inhale, slowly tilt your head to the right, keeping your chin level.
3. Hold the tilt for 1 second, focusing on the sensation of the water's temperature on your tongue.
4. As you exhale, take a single small sip of water, focusing on the sensation of the water moving over your tongue.
5. Inhale for 1 second, focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.
6. Take a brief pause, focusing on the sensation of the water's temperature on your tongue.

**Excuse to leave:**

If you absolutely have to leave, use the following single sentence:

"I need to use the restroom for a moment."

**Immediate 10-second action if the critic's still loud:**

If the critic continues to argue loudly after the sip, take a brief moment to:

1. Inhale deeply through your nose.
2. Slowly exhale through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
3. As you exhale, say to yourself: "Notice, let go, refocus."
4. Take a brief moment to pause, focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.
5. If you feel it's safe to continue the session, simply nod to yourself.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the single-sip move and the 10‑second “Notice, let go, refocus,” but how is that supposed to help when I can’t tilt my head or take a sip without drawing attention? If the critic talks through the whole 10 seconds, do I repeat that sequence once more and then excuse myself, or is there a different micro-step you want me to do between repeats? I’m exhausted and this already feels like another checklist I could fail at, but I’ll try it in the meeting and tell you what happens — can we tweak it if it flops?

Patient: Ugh — that message is exactly how my head feels: stuck on repeat, can't think straight, everything reduced to “simple step” and it just loops. Give me one single, tiny thing I can do right now at my desk — 15 seconds, eyes‑open, no breathing counts, no pen fiddling — and tell me exactly what to say in my head if the critic interrupts. How is that supposed to help? And if it fails, what’s one clear next move so I don’t spiral further?

Give me that single tiny thing right now: exactly what 15‑second, eyes‑open move to do (no breathing counts, no pen), the exact three words to think if the critic interrupts, and the single next move if it fails — I want it crisp and repeatable. How is that supposed to help? I've tried tiny tricks and they just blow past the shame, so tell me why this one won't just disappear under the loop.

Patient: Fine. Here’s one tiny, eyes‑open micro‑move you can do right now (15 seconds, no breath counts, no pen):

- Under the table, press the pad of your thumb gently against the pad of your index finger and hold light pressure.  
- Slowly rub the pads together in a small circle, feeling texture and temperature. Keep your gaze soft on the nearest neutral spot (a corner of your screen or the desk). Do that for about 15 seconds.

Three exact words to think if the critic interrupts: “Not now. Focus.” (say them silently, once).

If that fails: take one discreet, slow sip of water and focus on the sensation of the water on your tongue for a full second.

How is that supposed to help? I don’t know if it’ll fix the shame, but tactile focus is low-effort and shifts attention away from the loop into a single, simple physical sensation — it can short‑circuit the rehearsing for a moment. I’ll try it, though I’m skeptical — if it flops, what would you have me try next?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the thumb/index rub and silently think “Not now. Focus.” but honestly, how is that supposed to help when the critic just steamrolls these little tricks? If that flops, give me one single next move I can do without leaving the room — exact action and the exact three words to think — so I don’t keep cycling through more failed checklists. My chest’s already tight just thinking about it; I’m tired and I don’t want this to become another thing I mess up.
