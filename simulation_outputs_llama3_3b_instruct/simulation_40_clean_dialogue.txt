Patient: Since my move, I've been hit by this persistent, low-grade sadness and a kind of anhedonia that saps my motivation and is starting to erode my relationship. As a business owner I'm wired to problem-solve, so I default to analyzing—cataloguing stressors, hypothesizing about attachment disruptions and environmental incongruence—instead of actually sitting with the feeling. It's been a nonstop mental narrative and I'm trying to figure out how not to let it keep dictating my behavior.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel that sadness or anhedonia creeping back in? What's the first thing you do, and what do you think is likely to happen if you continue down that path?

Patient: I tend to hyper-rationalize it—my first move is to catalogue causes, make lists, and throw myself into work or busier socializing to anesthetize the feeling. That looks like frenetic productivity, being overly-chatty and surface-level with people, and overexplaining my inner state instead of actually saying "I'm sad" to my partner. If I keep running that script I can see it spiraling into deeper demotivation, more resentment and distance in the relationship, and eventually burnout where even my usual coping strategies fail.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that this pattern is not serving you well in the long run. What would happen if, instead of trying to suppress or distract yourself, you were to allow yourself to acknowledge and validate that feeling of sadness, even if it's uncomfortable? Would that make you more willing to explore what's underlying the sadness and communicate it to your partner in a more honest way?

Patient: On a theoretical level, yes—naming and validating the sadness could reduce the need to immediately 'fix' it and actually open space to explore what's underneath and be more honest with my partner. In practice I'm skeptical: vulnerability feels risky, I worry it'll make me look weak or burden them, so I instinctively default to analysis and distraction. I want to try, but I don't know the first small thing to say without turning it into a lecture—could you help me with a concrete, low-risk way to start?

Therapist: Let's start with something simple: What if, instead of saying "I'm feeling really overwhelmed and stuck," you said "I'm feeling a bit stuck right now and I'm not sure how to move forward"? That phrase feels more straightforward and honest, without implying a need to "fix" the situation. Would that feel more like a small step towards vulnerability and openness?

Patient: Yeah, that phrasing feels more manageable—less catastrophic than “overwhelmed” and doesn’t automatically put pressure on someone to fix me. My metacognitive habit kicks in and I immediately pivot to rationalizing, so I’m worried I’ll tack on a 10‑minute causal lecture after saying it. Could you help me script a really short follow‑up line I can use if they ask for more, so I don’t derail into analysis?

Therapist: Let's craft a brief follow-up line that acknowledges their curiosity without inviting analysis. You could say: "That's a great question, and I'm happy to explore it further. But before we dive in, can I just take a deep breath and clarify that I'm still trying to figure some things out myself?" This phrase acknowledges their interest while refocusing the conversation on your own process and uncertainty.

Patient: That actually helps — it gives me permission to be uncertain instead of immediately solving. My fear is they'll ask "what's wrong?" and I'll default to a 10‑minute causal lecture — can you give me a super-short fallback (like 2–4 words) I can use in the moment to hold the space?

Therapist: Try using a simple "I'm not sure" in response to "what's wrong?" – just two words to create a pause and acknowledge their curiosity without feeling obligated to elaborate. This gives you a chance to stay focused on your own process and maintain the emotional intimacy.

Patient: Okay, "I'm not sure" is disarmingly simple — I can already see it creating the pause I need instead of triggering my analytic monologue. My meta-worry is that if they probe I'll default to a ten‑minute causal lecture; could I pair it with another tiny buffer like "Give me a sec" or "Not sure yet" to signal containment without inviting troubleshooting? I'm honestly a bit anxious about actually trying it — my impulse is to sprint into solutions.

Therapist: You could pair "I'm not sure" with "Can I check my thoughts real quick" – this adds a brief pause and conveys that you're taking a moment to gather your thoughts, rather than immediately launching into analysis. The phrase "Can I check my thoughts" implies that you're engaging in a private process, which may help contain your impulse to solve.

Patient: That actually helps — "Can I check my thoughts real quick" gives me a procedural boundary so I don't instantly pivot to solution-mode. My reflex is still to launch into a 10‑minute causal monologue, so can you give me a tiny emergency script (2–3 words) to use if they press "What's wrong?" I'm anxious about actually trying it because vulnerability feels risky, but I want to see if I can short‑circuit my cerebralizing habit.

Therapist: Try using the phrase "It's not now" – this simple phrase acknowledges their question without feeling obligated to elaborate or engage in analysis. It also leaves room for a potential pause or defusion, giving you a chance to collect your thoughts and maintain the emotional intimacy.

Patient: Okay — “It's not now” actually feels like a usable containment strategy; it gives me permission to not capitulate to my urge to narrate everything. I'm still anxious they'll probe, though, so can you give me three very short fallback lines (one for face-to-face, one for a text, one for if they insist) — each 1–3 words — that feel authentic for someone who usually intellectualizes? Also, can we roleplay a quick exchange so I can try them out without turning it into a lecture? I'm nervous about doing this for real.

Therapist: Here are three short fallback lines for different contexts:

* Face-to-face: "Not ready"
* Text: "Need some time"
* Insistent: "Not talking now"

Now, let's roleplay a quick exchange. I'll play the role of your partner, and we can try out these fallback lines in a low-stakes setting. We'll see how they feel in the moment.

Here's the starting point:

Partner: "Hey, what's going on? You seem a bit off. Is everything okay?"

Go ahead and respond using one of the fallback lines.

Patient: Not ready

Therapist: You could respond with: "I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed right now" – this acknowledges your partner's concern while keeping the conversation focused on your own emotional state, rather than diving into analysis.

Patient: I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Honestly, there's this recurring, stupid shame—like some past failure keeps coloring things—that makes me default to analyzing instead of actually sitting with it. Can I check my thoughts real quick?

Therapist: You could respond with: "Can I just take a deep breath and look at it like it's just a thought?" – this phrase acknowledges the shame as a thought, rather than a reflection of your true self, which might help you maintain a more detached stance.

Patient: Can I just take a deep breath and look at it like it's just a thought? Okay—I'm trying, but there's this stupid, gnawing shame that instantly lights up and pulls me into over-explaining, so I keep defaulting to analysis instead of actually feeling it. Give me a sec—I want to stay with it, but I don't really know how to not sprint into solutions.

Therapist: You could respond with: "What's the thought that shows up when I think of this shame?" – this phrase shifts the focus from trying to tackle the shame directly, to exploring it as a thought. By doing so, you're creating a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to analyze or resolve it.

Patient: It's this global meta-narrative—basically "I screwed up, therefore I'm incompetent"—that pops up and feels catastrophic. It immediately floods me with shame and frustration, and then my reflex is to intellectualize the hell out of it—generate hypotheses, over-explain, perform competence—instead of actually sitting with the embarrassment. I'm annoyed at myself for running that loop and I don't really know how to short‑circuit it.

Therapist: You could respond with: "What if, for just a moment, I let this thought be true, without judgment?" – this phrase encourages a sense of curiosity and experimentation, rather than trying to "fix" or "change" the thought. By asking yourself to let the thought be true, without judgment, you're creating a sense of openness and receptivity, rather than resistance.

Patient: Okay—if I actually let that thought be true for a moment, I can see how it might defuse the urgency, but emotionally it feels like I'm handing over the keys to this catastrophic self‑narrative and that hot shame lights up and I immediately want to over‑explain. I'm annoyed at myself because I understand it theoretically, yet my reflex is to perform competence instead of sitting with the feeling. Can we do a tiny, concrete experiment right now—exactly what would I say to my partner, and what do I do for the next 30 seconds so I don't cave into analysis?

Therapist: Let's do a tiny experiment. In this moment, you could say to your partner: "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." Then, for the next 30 seconds, you could take a few deep breaths, and gently focus on your physical sensations, noticing where in your body the shame or frustration is located, without trying to analyze or explain it. You could also try to say to yourself, out loud or silently, "I'm just sitting with this thought, and noticing it, without trying to change it."

Example:
You: "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment. Okay... *takes a deep breath* I'm noticing my heart is beating a bit faster... I can feel a lump in my throat... I'm just sitting with this thought, and noticing it, without trying to change it."

(Note: Remember, this is a tiny experiment, and it's okay if you don't feel like you're doing it "right". The goal is to develop a new skill, not to achieve some kind of idealized state.)

Patient: "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." Okay—taking a breath. My chest is tight, my heart's racing, there's this hot, embarrassing shame that feels like it's shrinking me, and already my brain is drafting a ten‑minute justification to outrun the feeling. I'm annoyed and frustrated at myself for doing that reflexively, but I can still feel the lump in my throat and the tension in my hands. If my brain starts lecturing, what do I actually do in the next 30 seconds to stay with the sensation instead of escaping into analysis?

Therapist: In the next 30 seconds, try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, such as the lump in your throat and the tension in your hands. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. You could say to yourself, "I'm just noticing these sensations, without trying to change them." If your brain starts to lecture, try to acknowledge the thought and then gently bring your attention back to the physical sensations. For example, "Ah, my brain is talking again... okay, I'm going to come back to these sensations... *takes a deep breath* I can feel the lump in my throat, and the tension in my hands..."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing the lump in my throat supposed to blunt the ten‑minute analytic lecture? It already feels like another thing my brain can analyze, and then I end up narrating the sensation instead of feeling it. My chest tightens with that same stupid shame and I'm annoyed at myself for being hijacked by it. Can you give me one tiny, exact micro‑step I can do in the next 30 seconds if the lecture starts — like a phrase to say or a breathing count — just one thing, not a concept? I'm anxious but willing to try.

Therapist: In the next 30 seconds, when your brain starts to lecture, say to yourself: "One."

(Note: This is a simple, non-conceptual action that requires you to pause and count to one. It's a tiny, manageable step that can help you break the cycle of analysis and create space for feeling.)

Patient: Okay... "One." It feels embarrassingly small, but I'll try it. That familiar shame tightens my throat and kicks off the lecture—so when it does I'll say "One" and take a slow breath. Can we try that together once more?

Therapist: Let's try it together. I'll start by saying "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." Then, when your brain starts to lecture, you say "One" and take a slow breath. I'll start:

"I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." *pauses* When I start lecturing (which I won't, since we're just practicing!), say "One" and take a slow breath with me. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

Patient: One.

I said "One" and took a slow breath — for a brief second my chest unclenched and there was a tiny gap before the lecture wanted to start again. I'm annoyed and kind of embarrassed that the shame is still nudging me to over‑explain; it feels like a reflex I can't fully stop. Can we do that again now, and what's the next tiny thing I should do if the lecture comes back right away?

Therapist: Let's try it again. I'll start by saying "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." Then, when your brain starts to lecture, say "One" and take a slow breath. When the lecture comes back, the next tiny thing you can do is to say "I'm still noticing this sensation, and it's still here." This acknowledges the thought and the physical sensations without getting caught up in analysis or explanation. Go ahead and start again with me.

Patient: "I'm going to try to let this thought be true for a moment, and just notice it, without judgment." One. (slow breath)

Okay—there was a tiny unclench, but the shame's already queuing the lecture. I'm still noticing this sensation, and it's still here. If the lecture comes back, what's the next micro‑step? I don't want to just narrate my way out of it.

Therapist: If the lecture comes back, the next tiny step is to say "This too." This simple phrase acknowledges that the thought is still present, without trying to change or analyze it further. It's a way to acknowledge the thought without getting caught up in the narrative. Go ahead and say "This too" if the lecture comes back.

Patient: This too. I'm saying it, but my attention's jittery and my brain's already drafting a tidy rationalization—I can feel the tension in my chest and it's hard to stay with the sensation instead of explaining it.

Therapist: Let's try to anchor your attention to the physical sensation. Look at the sensation in your chest, and notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you say "I'm feeling this sensation in my body" while you focus on one of these physical sensations?

Patient: I'm feeling this sensation in my body — a tightness in my chest, a lump in my throat, my feet heavy on the floor. I can say it, but my mind already wants to launch into a ten‑minute explanation, and I'm frustrated and kind of drained by the effort to just stay with it. Can you give me one single word to say if I start to drift so I don't spiral into analysis?

Therapist: If you start to drift, simply say "Again". This word can help you bring your attention back to the sensation without getting caught up in analysis or explanation. It's a very small step, but it can help you stay with the feeling.

Patient: Again.

Okay—saying "Again" gave me a tiny unclench, but my brain is already drafting a ten‑minute justification and my chest's still tight. Can you give me one more micro‑step (one word or tiny action) to do immediately after "Again" so I don't pivot into analysis? Also, can we roleplay one quick face‑to‑face exchange now so I can try both together?

Therapist: If you say "Again" and feel the justification starting to draft, try saying "Slow" - just say it quietly to yourself, and take a deep, slow breath. This tiny action can help you pause and refocus on the sensation.

Now, let's roleplay a quick face-to-face exchange. I'll play the role of your partner, and we can practice using the skills we've worked on together. Here's a scenario:

I'll start by saying: "Hey, I've noticed you seem a bit distant lately. Is everything okay?"

(Note: Go ahead and respond as if you were in a real conversation. Remember to say "Again" if your brain starts to drift into analysis, and "Slow" if you feel the justification starting to draft.)

Patient: Uh—I'm not sure. I'm not ready to unpack it fully, but I'll try: I'm going to let the thought be true for a moment and just notice it. One. Slow. 

My chest's tight and my brain's already queuing a ten‑minute lecture—I'm annoyed at myself and honestly kind of jittery and drained, so I might need a beat if you press.

Therapist: Partner: "Okay, I'm here for you. Take your time, and we'll figure it out together."

(I'll respond in a calm and non-judgmental tone, without pressing for more information or analysis.)

You did great! You stayed with the sensation, acknowledged the tightness in your chest, and used the skills we practiced. Remember, the goal is not to provide a solution or explanation, but to simply acknowledge the feeling and create space for it. You're taking small steps towards psychological flexibility, and that's something to be proud of.

Let's take a moment to reflect on what worked well and what might need more practice. What did you notice about yourself during this exercise?

Patient: Okay — quick reflection: the tiny anchors actually worked; saying "One," "This too," and "Slow" gave me a sliver of space and let me notice the tightness in my chest instead of instantly narrating it. What still needs work is the reflexive shove into a ten‑minute causal lecture — shame still lights up and I get drained trying to hold the pause, so staying with the sensation past a couple breaths is hard. I'm annoyed and kind of wiped out by how effortful this is; can we practice one short, out‑loud phrase I can use if my partner keeps pressing so I don't cave into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try the phrase "I'm still noticing the physical sensations". This phrase acknowledges your partner's curiosity while refocusing your attention on the physical sensations in your body. It's a simple, straightforward statement that can help you stay with the feeling and avoid analysis.

Remember, the goal is not to provide a solution or explanation, but to create space for the feeling. Repeat the phrase to yourself, and see if it helps you stay with the sensation.

Also, take a deep breath and be kind to yourself. Recognizing the effort and difficulty you're facing is already a huge step.

Patient: Okay — "I'm still noticing the physical sensations" feels usable; it actually reframes curiosity back into the body instead of an essay. Still, that reflexive intellectualizing is loud—shame cues a ten‑minute monologue and I get drained trying to hold the pause. Can you give me one ultra‑short out‑loud line (1–2 words) to use if they press, and can we roleplay that once? I'm kind of wiped and anxious but willing to try.

Therapist: Let's try the phrase "Not now". This phrase is extremely brief, and can be used to pause and refocus your attention without getting into analysis.

Now, let's roleplay a quick exchange. I'll play the role of your partner, and we'll see how "Not now" works in a real conversation.

Here's a scenario:

Partner: "Hey, I've noticed you seem a bit distant lately. Can we talk about what's going on?"

Go ahead and respond using "Not now", and see how it goes. Remember, the goal is to pause and refocus your attention, without getting caught up in analysis or explanation.

Patient: Not now. I'm still noticing this tightness in my chest and need to slow my breathing—One. Slow. I'm kind of wiped and anxious about spilling into a lecture, so I need this pause before I try to explain.

Therapist: Partner: "Okay, take your time. We'll talk about it when you're ready."

(I'll respond in a calm and non-judgmental tone, without pressing for more information or analysis.)

You did great! You used the phrase "Not now" to pause and refocus your attention, and then stuck with the physical sensations in your body. Remember, the goal is not to provide a solution or explanation, but to create space for the feeling. You're taking small steps towards psychological flexibility, and that's something to be proud of.

Take a deep breath and be kind to yourself. You're doing the hard work, and it's okay to feel wiped and anxious. Keep going, and remember that it's okay to say "Not now" whenever you need a pause.

One more thing: I want to acknowledge that you've made tremendous progress in this session. You've learned how to use tiny anchors like "One" and "Slow" to pause and refocus your attention. You've also started to develop a sense of curiosity and openness, and you're beginning to see the value in simply noticing your physical sensations. Keep going, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Patient: I hear you — that recognition lands oddly reassuring but also leaves me a bit resistant. I'm still wiped and annoyed that it feels like such an uphill slog to not default to a ten‑minute lecture, and I'm anxious I'll slip back into that pattern around my partner. Can we roleplay one more time where my partner keeps pressing (maybe we're in public), so I can practice the ultra‑short lines and the "One/Slow" sequence under pressure?
