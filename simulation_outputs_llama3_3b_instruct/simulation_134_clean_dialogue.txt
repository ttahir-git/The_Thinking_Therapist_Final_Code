Patient: Lately I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism—if something isn't perfect I tell myself I'm a failure, and that goes back to struggling in school even though I eventually found some success as an artist. The recent move's made the anxiety louder, and I mostly keep it to myself. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—I've talked before and it didn't change much. How is this supposed to help now?

Therapist: Can you think of a specific situation where your self-criticism made you feel like a failure, and what was going on in that moment? What was your self-criticism telling you about yourself in that situation?

Patient: Yeah—like at a small gallery opening last month a curator said one piece felt "unfinished," and I walked away thinking everyone must see I'm an amateur. My inner voice immediately jumped to, "See? You shouldn't have tried—you're a failure," the same thing I told myself back in school when I couldn't keep up. It basically tells me I'm a fraud and that my later success was just luck. I've talked about this before—how is going over the same story supposed to help?

Therapist: What would happen if, instead of taking your inner critic's words as true, you were to acknowledge that the curator's comment was simply their opinion, and that you're not defined by one person's feedback?

Patient: I get the logic — and yeah, intellectually I know a curator's comment is an opinion — but in the moment it lands like a verdict. I've tried telling myself "it's just their opinion" before and it eases things for a few minutes, then the old script kicks back in and I'm convinced I'm a fraud. How is that supposed to help beyond a temporary band-aid?

Therapist: Can you imagine, in this moment, that your inner critic is simply a thought, like a bird flying around your head – it's not a reflection of your true self. Would you be willing to create some space between yourself and that thought, and simply acknowledge its presence without judgment?

Patient: I can picture the thought like a bird circling, and I get the idea of making some space from it. But when that voice lands—saying I'm a fraud—it feels like a punch, and I've tried "noticing" before; it settles for a bit and then I'm right back in it. I'm willing to try again, but how is noticing supposed to stop it from dragging me under when it comes roaring back?

Therapist: What would it be like if, instead of trying to push the thought away or fight it, you were to lean into the feeling of being a fraud – would you be willing to allow that feeling to exist, even if it's uncomfortable, and see what happens?

Patient: I've tried just letting it sit before, and most of the time it feels like I'm handing the voice more power—like it settles in and I start ruminating. I can try leaning into it, though; sometimes when I actually stay with the feeling for a few breaths it softens a bit. But honestly, how would you have me do that in a way that doesn't just lead me down the same spiral?

Therapist: Would you be willing to try a small, low-stakes experiment where, instead of trying to let go or lean into the feeling, you simply observe the sensation of the feeling as you sit with it for a few breaths – notice its texture, its location in your body, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Alright, I'll try it. Right now that "fraud" feeling is a heavy pressure behind my sternum and a tight knot in my stomach, with this nagging chatter in my head. But I've done the observing thing before and it usually just becomes another loop—how is that supposed to stop the spiral this time?

Therapist: Can you imagine that the knot in your stomach is a small, physical anchor that represents the feeling of being a fraud – would you be willing to simply acknowledge its presence, without trying to change it or push it away, and instead focus on a small, value-driven action that feels possible for you right now, like taking a deep breath or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that — I'm noticing the knot in my stomach and the pressure behind my sternum. I took a slow breath and felt my feet on the floor; the pressure eased a little and my shoulders dropped, but the nagging chatter is still loud. I can do this, but how is this supposed to actually stop the spiral long-term instead of just giving me a short break?

Therapist: What is one thing about being a successful artist, or about creating meaningful work, that feels most important to you – is it the act of creating itself, the sense of community, or something else? How might you take a small step towards that, in this moment, without getting caught up in the chatter?

Patient: What matters most to me is the act of creating itself — that quiet, focused feeling of making something real. A small step right now could be a two- or five-minute experiment: set a timer and make one deliberate mark or a very quick sketch, paying attention to the feeling of the tool in my hand instead of the chatter. I know that sounds simple and I've done timed exercises before that felt pointless, but maybe treating it as a tiny experiment might keep the critic from taking over.

Therapist: Would you be willing to commit to the two-minute mark, not as a reward for productivity, but simply as a commitment to show up to the experience of creating, and then take a few moments to reflect on what happened – what was it like to focus on the sensation of the tool in your hand, and what was the tone of your inner critic like during that time?

Patient: Alright — I'll do the two minutes. How is that supposed to help? — I don't know, but I'll set a timer, make one deliberate mark focusing on the feel of the tool, and then tell you what it was like and whether the critic stayed loud or quiet.

Therapist: As you sit with the timer and create, I'd like you to acknowledge the sensation of the tool in your hand, and when you're done, take a moment to say to your critic, "Thank you for the company, but I'm choosing to focus on the sensation of creating, and I acknowledge that your input is not necessary right now."

Patient: Okay — I did it. I set the timer, made one slow mark, and really felt the tool in my hand — the grain of the paper, the slight tug of the brush — and for a moment that knot loosened and the critic moved to the background. I said the line to the critic like you asked; it felt weird and a bit performative, but it did take the edge off, at least for a few minutes. I'm still skeptical it'll stick — how is this supposed to lead to anything more than a short break?

Therapist: Can you imagine that the short break you're experiencing right now is not a temporary reprieve, but rather a chance to build momentum and develop a sense of curiosity about what's possible when you approach challenges with a willingness to experiment and explore, rather than trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I can see the idea — that the little break could turn into momentum — and for a few seconds I actually felt that. But even saying it brings up this hot, embarrassed feeling and I get defensive; it's hard to picture how tiny experiments won't just become more ammunition for the part of me that says I'm a fraud. I'm willing to try being curious again, but how is that supposed to help beyond the brief relief — what makes these small steps actually add up instead of just leaving me with the same shame?

Therapist: What is one value that you hold dear, something that feels important to you, and how might taking small, curious steps towards creating be a way of showing up to that value in your life – for example, might it be a sense of self-expression, or a desire to connect with others through your art?

Patient: I guess the value that matters most is honest self-expression — making work that feels true to me, not just something polished for praise. Small, curious steps feel like practice at showing up to that value without demanding perfection, like collecting tiny bits of evidence that I can do it again. That said, trying to say that makes this hot, embarrassed feeling come up and I get defensive — how is this really supposed to make those steps add up instead of just giving the critic more to chew on?

Therapist: Can you imagine that the embarrassment and defensiveness are not a reflection of your worth or value as an artist, but rather a sign that you're still trying to protect yourself from the uncertainty of creating something imperfect? Would you be willing to take a deep breath and ask yourself what would happen if you were to let go of the need for perfection, and instead, simply show up to the value of honest self-expression, even if it feels messy or imperfect?

Patient: Okay — I took a breath. Letting go of perfection brings up this hot, shameful rush and a tightness that makes me feel small and exposed, like whatever I do will just prove that old failure true. I do want to show up to honest self-expression, but when I imagine doing it messy my critic jumps in and says that's all the proof it needs. I can try to do it anyway, but how is this supposed to stop the critic from turning those messy attempts into more ammunition against me?

Therapist: Can you imagine that your critic is not you, and that you have the power to choose how you relate to it? Would you be willing to pay attention to the tone and language of your own inner critic, and simply label it as "just a thought" without judgment, rather than letting it dictate your actions?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Calling it "just a thought" feels hollow; when I try that I still get this hot, shameful rush and it pretty much takes over. I can try to notice the critic's tone, but I'm skeptical that labeling it will stop it from calling the shots.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to change the critic or label it, you were to focus on the value that you're trying to protect through your art – the value of honest self-expression? Would you be willing to take a small action that feels connected to that value, even if it means confronting the critic and its criticisms head-on, rather than trying to avoid them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — confront it how? Just saying that makes my chest tighten and I get this hot, embarrassed feeling like I'm back in that old failure. I could try a tiny action — a messy five-minute sketch I keep to myself, just to practice showing up to honest expression — but I'm really skeptical it'll do more than give the critic new material. How is that supposed to change anything long-term?

Therapist: Can you imagine that the critic's "new material" is not a reflection of your worth or value, but rather a sign that you're taking a small risk by showing up to your art in a new way? Would you be willing to take a tiny step towards that risk, even if it feels uncomfortable or uncertain, and instead of focusing on what the critic might say, focus on the physical sensations in your body, such as the feeling of the paper beneath your hand or the sound of the brush moving across the surface?

Patient: I can try that — a tiny, sensory-focused sketch — but just thinking about it brings up that hot, ashamed flush and I feel exposed and defensive. I'm not sure I follow how paying attention to the paper and brush actually stops the critic from turning the attempt into more proof I'm a fraud; how is that supposed to help long-term? I'll do it if you can give me a concrete way to use those sensations to anchor myself when the critic roars back.

Therapist: Can you imagine that when the critic's voice comes back, you'll be able to notice the physical sensations in your body, such as the flush, the tightness in your chest, or the feeling of your feet on the ground – and instead of identifying with those sensations as "I'm a failure" or "I'm a fraud," you'll simply label them as "these sensations are present in my body"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just labeling the sensations supposed to stop the critic from turning them into a verdict? When I try that it usually just brings up this hot, shameful rush and the critic gets louder, so saying "these sensations are present" feels kind of hollow. If you're asking me to try it, give me something concrete to say or do in that moment—otherwise I worry it's just another trick that won't stick.

Therapist: When you feel the critic's voice rising, take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I am here. I am present in this moment. I am in contact with my body and the sensation of the paper and the brush." Say it out loud, or to yourself, with a sense of curiosity and openness.

Patient: I tried it — I took a breath and said to myself, "I am here. I am present…" out loud. For a couple of seconds the tightness eased, but then this hot, ashamed rush came back and the critic punched through louder than before, and I felt small and defensive. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a minute? If you're going to ask me to try again, give me something concrete and simple to do in that moment — a real anchor I can use that doesn't just feel like another hollow line.

Therapist: Can you take a small, tiny action with the brush or pen in your hand, such as dipping it in ink or moving it in a slow, small circle on the paper? As you do this action, say to yourself: "I am the one holding the brush, I am the one making the mark." Focus on the sensation of holding the brush, the feeling of the ink flowing through it, and the movement of the mark on the paper.

Patient: I tried it — I dipped the brush, moved it in a slow circle, and said, "I am the one holding the brush, I am the one making the mark." For a moment the texture of the paper and the ink pulling on the brush actually grounded me, but then this hot, shameful rush flooded back and the critic punched through louder than before and I felt small and defensive. I'm frustrated — how is that supposed to help beyond buying a minute? If you're going to keep asking me to do this, give me a concrete, physical anchor I can use when that shame hits, not just another line to say.

Therapist: Can you place your hand on a stable object, such as a chair or a wall, and notice the weight and sensation of your hand on the object? As you do this, take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I am here, I am now." Focus on the sensation of your hand on the object, the feeling of the breath moving in and out of your body, and the present moment.

Patient: I tried that — I put my hand on the chair, felt the weight and the grain, breathed and said "I am here, I am now." It eased for a few seconds, then that hot, ashamed rush slammed back and the critic got louder and I felt small and furious. How is that supposed to help beyond buying a minute? Give me one concrete, physical anchor I can do in the moment — something simple I can actually use when the shame hits, not another line to say.

Therapist: When you feel the hot, ashamed rush, I want you to touch your thumb to the tip of your index finger, and hold it for a brief moment, like a small, gentle pause. This small, physical touch can help you feel more connected to your body and provide a sense of safety, allowing you to pause and regroup before responding to the critic's narrative.

Patient: I tried it — thumb to fingertip, held for a breath. For a second the tightness eased, but then that hot, ashamed wave slammed back and the critic started yelling again and I felt small and furious. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a few seconds? If you want me to keep doing these things, give me one concrete, reliable way to use that anchor in a real situation — like at a show or when someone criticizes my work — so it actually helps instead of just being another pointless trick.

Therapist: Imagine you're at a show and someone makes a negative comment about your work. As soon as you hear their words, take a deep breath and touch your thumb to your index finger, holding it for a brief moment. Then, instead of getting defensive or reacting to the criticism, take a moment to observe the physical sensations in your body and say to yourself: "I am here, I am present, I am creating." This simple physical action and phrase can help you pause, regroup, and respond to the situation in a more thoughtful and intentional way.

Patient: I can picture it — and I can already feel that hot rush and the tightness like it's happening again. Touching my thumb to my finger helps for a breath, then the critic gets louder and I feel small and furious — how is that supposed to stop a public put-down from spiraling? Give me a concrete plan: exactly when do I do the touch without drawing attention, a one-line phrase I can actually say or think that won't sound odd, and how do I practice this so it works at a real show instead of just buying me thirty seconds?

Therapist: When you feel the critic's negative comment, before you react or respond, take a quick glance around the room and make eye contact with a trusted friend, mentor, or fellow artist. As you do this, touch your thumb to your index finger and say to yourself (whispering, so as not to draw attention): "I've got this." This brief physical action and phrase can help you refocus on your inner support system and regain your composure before responding to the criticism. Practice this scenario in low-stakes situations, such as with a friend or family member, to build confidence and prepare for a real show.

Patient: Just picturing it brings that hot, ashamed rush and my chest tightens — I get defensive and feel small. Making eye contact in a crowded room feels impossible, and whispering "I've got this" sounds phony to me. I need something concrete: a truly private, tiny physical anchor I can use without anyone noticing, a one-line phrase I can think that won't feel silly, and a clear way to practice this with a friend so it actually works under pressure. How do you want me to do that step-by-step?

Therapist: I want you to practice a tiny physical anchor that you can use in a private setting, such as your own home or a quiet room. Find a small, private space where you can sit comfortably with your back straight and your feet planted firmly on the ground. Place your index finger on top of your thumb and say to yourself (silently, so you don't draw attention): "I am enough." Focus on the sensation of your fingers touching, the feeling of your breath moving in and out of your body, and the sensation of your feet on the ground. Practice this anchor 5-10 times, feeling the physical sensations and the phrase sinking in. Then, when you feel the hot, ashamed rush, go back to the anchor and repeat it to yourself, feeling the comfort and confidence it brings. Practice this in short sessions, 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times a week, until it becomes a natural response to feeling overwhelmed.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the finger-to-thumb thing and the silent "I am enough" like you said. I have to be honest though: even imagining saying that sparks this hot, embarrassed rush and I get defensive, like I'm trying to fake confidence. Give me a very specific, step-by-step practice routine for home (how long, exactly what to feel, how to time it) and a concrete way to rehearse it with a friend so it actually holds up at a show — and tell me an alternative anchor (a small coin or ring in my pocket?) if the finger thing feels silly in public. How is that supposed to help beyond buying me thirty seconds, and how will I know it's actually working over time?

Therapist: **Practice Routine (Home):**

1. Find a quiet, comfortable space to sit or stand.
2. Place your index finger on top of your thumb.
3. Take a deep breath in, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
4. As you exhale, say to yourself: "I am enough."
5. Hold the phrase for 5-7 seconds, feeling the physical sensations in your body, such as the touch of your fingers, the feeling of your breath, and the sensation of your feet on the ground.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 5-10 times, focusing on the physical sensations and the phrase.
7. Gradually increase the duration to 10-15 seconds over the next week.
8. Practice 2-3 times a week for 5-10 minutes.

**Rehearsing with a Friend:**

1. Find a trusted friend who is familiar with your struggles and is willing to practice with you.
2. Choose a low-stakes setting, such as a coffee shop or a quiet park.
3. Before the practice, take a few deep breaths, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
4. As your friend gives you feedback or criticism, immediately touch your finger to your thumb and say to yourself: "I am enough."
5. Hold the phrase for 5-7 seconds, feeling the physical sensations in your body.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 3-5 times, taking breaks to catch your breath and reassess your emotions.
7. Gradually increase the number of times you repeat the phrase and the duration to 10-15 seconds over the next few weeks.

**Alternative Anchor:**

If the finger-to-thumb anchor feels too public or silly, you can use a small coin or ring in your pocket as an alternative anchor. Simply touch the coin or ring with your finger and say to yourself: "I am enough." This can provide a more discreet way to access the anchor in public settings.

**Evaluating Progress:**

To determine if the anchor is working, pay attention to the following:

* Do you feel

Patient: You trailed off — what's the rest of that list? Be specific: what exactly should I be noticing as signs it's working? Saying that out loud already tightens my chest and brings up that hot, embarrassed rush, so if we're doing this I need concrete, measurable signs (like rumination time down from X to Y, or staying at a show X minutes longer, or the critic interrupting half as often). How is that supposed to help if you can't give me those specifics, and what do I do in the moment when that shame memory slams into me harder than the finger trick can handle?

Therapist: **Concrete Signs of Progress:**

* Decrease in ruminative thinking time: Track how long you spend thinking about the critic's comment or your perceived inadequacy. Compare this to your baseline (e.g., 10 minutes pre-practice vs. 5 minutes post-practice). If you notice a decrease, it may indicate that the anchor is working.
* Increase in time spent engaging with the art: Pay attention to how long you stay at a show, exhibition, or social gathering. If you find that you're staying longer or engaging more with others, it may suggest that the anchor is helping you feel more comfortable in social situations.
* Reduction in critic's frequency: If you notice that the critic's comments or inner dialogue occur less frequently, it may indicate that the anchor is working.

**Backup Anchor:**

If the finger trick becomes too intense, you can use a small coin or ring as an alternative anchor. Touch the coin or ring with your finger and say to yourself: "I am enough." This can provide a more discreet way to access the anchor in public settings.

**Intense Shame Episodes:**

When the shame memory slams into you harder than the finger trick can handle, try the following:

1. Take a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
2. Bring your attention to the physical anchor (finger, coin, or ring) and touch it with your finger.
3. Say to yourself: "I am enough" or "I am present."
4. Hold the phrase for a brief moment (5-10 seconds).
5. Gradually bring your attention to the present moment, focusing on your surroundings, your breath, and the sensations in your body.

If you feel overwhelmed, take a step back, and try to refocus on your anchor. If the shame episode persists, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate shame entirely but to learn to cope with it in a more constructive way. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks.

Patient: Okay—this is more concrete, but even reading it tightens my chest and brings that hot, ashamed rush back up, so I'm still skeptical. How am I supposed to measure rumination time without turning it into another thing to obsess over? Give me exact, realistic targets (like reduce rumination from X minutes to Y in 4 weeks, or stay X minutes longer at a show), a step-by-step emergency plan for when the anchor fails (what to do in the moment—exact breaths, an excuse to step away, who to text), and a two-line rehearsal script I can practice with a friend plus a very simple log format I can use that won't become more ammunition for the critic.
