Patient: I've been stuck in this loop where interactions with my family trigger intense anger and frustration, and then I immediately go into this analytical mode—dissecting attachment patterns and historical grievances—rather than actually sitting with the emotion. As an artist, I default to narrative-making and grandiloquent explanations, which feels safer than the rawness underneath. It's bleeding into my work and self-confidence, and I want to figure out why I keep reacting instead of responding.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're about to blow up in anger during family interactions? What's the first thing that goes through your mind when you feel that way?

Patient: The first thing is a mental scaffolding—I start cataloguing past slights, mapping motives, and rehearsing retorts, so the angry sensation gets translated into an explanatory narrative. I do notice heat in my chest and my jaw clenching, but rather than say "I'm angry" I immediately frame it as attachment wounds and boundary violations. I guess making it into a theory feels safer than admitting the underlying hurt or fear.

Therapist: Can you think of a moment when you've started to experience that anger sensation without immediately jumping into narrative-making? What would it feel like if you were to pause for a moment, acknowledge the heat in your chest, and simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling really angry right now"?

Patient: I can only think of one small moment in my studio when a text from my sister hit me and I actually paused instead of immediately composing a rebuttal. Physically it was obvious—heat in my chest, jaw clenching, breath shallow—but my first mental move was still to start cataloguing grievances so it felt safer. Saying out loud, "I'm feeling really angry right now," would feel like dropping my defenses; my voice would probably catch and I'd instantly want to qualify it with reasons so I didn't feel so exposed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about sounding weak or exposed when acknowledging your anger. What would it mean to you if, instead of trying to qualify or minimize your anger, you simply stated it as a physical sensation, like "I'm feeling really angry right now"?

Patient: I think it would mean relinquishing a kind of epistemic control—I’d be naming a raw, bodily signal instead of translating it into a tidy narrative, and that scares me. Practically, it would feel disarming and exposed, like I'd immediately become smaller in other people's eyes, so I'd instinctively slap on qualifiers to avoid being judged as petty or weak.

Therapist: Qualifying your anger can be a way to maintain a sense of self-protection, but it also reinforces a narrative that you're not allowed to feel angry or strong. What would happen if, instead of qualifying your anger, you were to look at the physical sensations in your body, like the heat in your chest, without trying to label them or fit them into a narrative?

Patient: I think if I actually concentrated on the raw sensations—heat in my chest, jaw tight, breath shallow—I might notice they ebb instead of erupting, like a wave that rises and falls. But when I try that, my mind immediately goes into grand narratives and case-studies to explain it away, so I don't have to feel small or vulnerable. It's uncomfortable and makes me want to qualify or retaliate instead. How do I stay with the bodily stuff without my brain turning it into an analysis?

Therapist: Can you try noticing the physical sensations again, but this time, before your mind starts to create a narrative, say to yourself, "I'm going to allow myself to feel this physical sensation, no matter what it is, without judgment or explanation"?

Patient: I tried it — I repeated the line to myself and immediately noticed the heat in my chest and my jaw clenching, but almost as fast my brain began cataloguing past transgressions and constructing a defensive narrative. For a beat the sensation softened a little, like a tide receding, but then I felt this visceral urge to reassert epistemic control by explaining the feeling away. How do I actually keep that pause from collapsing into analysis — any concrete, simple moves I can use in the moment?

Therapist: Can you try something small to help you stay with the pause? Instead of repeating a phrase to yourself, try making a tiny physical movement, like taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, without labeling it or thinking about what it means?

Patient: I tried it — slow inhale through my nose, long exhale, and for a beat the heat in my chest eased and my jaw unclenched a little. But almost immediately my mind translated the breath into another data point to be analyzed, and I found myself rehearsing retorts again. The breath helps for a second but doesn't stick; I think I need something more tactile or interruptive to break the automatic narrative—like pressing my feet into the floor or clenching and releasing my fists. Can we try a concrete grounding move next?

Therapist: Let's try a simple, tactile exercise: can you bring your attention to your feet on the ground, noticing the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils?

Patient: I did — when I tuned into my feet I felt pressure under my heels and the soles, and a coolness at my nostrils; the heat in my chest eased a notch. Immediately, though, my mind translated those sensations into another data point and started narrativizing—cataloguing motives and rehearsing defenses—so the pause didn't hold. Can we try something more tactile next, like pressing my heels into the floor for ten seconds or holding a small object in my hand so there's less space for my brain to turn it into a story?

Therapist: Let's try holding a small, heavy object, like a pen or a small rock, in your hand. Can you hold it without thinking about it, just notice the weight of it, the feel of it in your hand, and the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it?

Patient: I held a small rock in my hand — felt its weight settle into my palm, the roughness under my fingers, and for a beat the heat in my chest eased and my jaw loosened. Predictably, though, my mind quickly narrativized the sensation, turning the rock into another data point in the ongoing dossier of grievances, so the grounding felt transient. Can we try something a bit more interruptive next, like pressing my heels into the floor or clenching and releasing my fists for a count, to see if that buys me a longer pause?

Therapist: Let's try clenching and releasing your fists for a count of 5, focusing on the sensation of the muscles contracting and releasing, without thinking about what it means or where it's leading. Can you start now, and simply focus on the physical sensation of clenching and releasing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is clenching supposed to help with the narrative impulse? Okay, I'll try it anyway: clench—1, 2, 3, 4, 5—release. I notice the muscles in my forearms tightening, my knuckles whitening, then a dull warmth and slight tremor as they let go. Immediately my head starts annotating it—“see, relaxation response engaged, note efficacy”—so it becomes data instead of experience; can we try a longer hold or adding a grounding stomp, because the pause dissolves too quickly for me.

Therapist: Let's try holding the clenched fist for a slightly longer period, 7 or 8, and as you release, try adding a small, deliberate grounding sensation to your feet, such as placing the weight of your body onto the balls of your feet, or noticing the sensation of the floor beneath you. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is shifting weight to the balls of my feet supposed to outmaneuver the narrative reflex? Okay, I'll try it: clench—1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8—hold—release, and I deliberately roll my weight forward onto the balls of my feet and notice the little burn in my calves and the floor under my toes. For a second the chest-heat drops a notch and my jaw loosens, but my mind immediately annotates it—“effective somatic intervention, note duration”—so it still gets co-opted into analysis; can we try adding something more abrupt, like a single loud exhale or a stomp, to see if that breaks the loop longer?

Therapist: Let's try adding a loud, deliberate exhale, and as you exhale, try stomping your right foot on the ground, making a clear, sharp sound. Can you try this?

Patient: Alright—I'll try it: big inhale, clench, then a loud exhale and stomp my right foot. The sound was shockingly clarifying for a second—the heat in my chest dropped, my jaw unclenched, and my breath felt less jagged—but within maybe three breaths my mind was already annotating it—“effective punctate somatic reset”—and turning it into data again. I think the stomp helps, but it doesn't hold; can we try doing three rounds guided by you, and maybe add a very simple phrase I have to say out loud each time, like "I'm angry," so there's less room for my brain to narrativize?

Therapist: Let's try three rounds. I'll guide you through it. On the count of three, you'll inhale, clench your fist, stomp your right foot, and say out loud, "I am angry." On the exhale, you'll pause for a moment, and then we'll start again. Ready to begin? 1...

Patient: Okay—I'm ready. 2...3... Big inhale, clench, stomp my right foot, and I say out loud, "I am angry." Exhale. For a second the heat in my chest drops, my voice wavers and it feels exposed, and then my head immediately starts annotating the whole thing—turning it into another clinical data point.

Round two: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry." Exhale. This time the chest-heat eases a bit more and my jaw loosens; I can feel the sensation without an immediate rebuttal, but within a few breaths the narrator is back, wanting to explain why I'm angry so I don't seem petty.

Round three: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry." Exhale. There's a slightly longer pause of just being angry—it's raw and uncomfortable and kind of clarifying—but then I find myself prepping qualifications and rationales. I can keep doing this, or we can try adding a short grounding phrase after the stomp like "this is only a feeling," because the pause dissolves too fast for me otherwise.

Therapist: Let's try adding the phrase "this is only a feeling" immediately after the stomp, so it sounds like: "I am angry, this is only a feeling." Can you try this and see if it helps sustain the pause?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—'only' sounds a little minimizing, but I'll try it anyway. I did three rounds: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is only a feeling." The first time it created a small buffer—the chest heat eased and my voice cracked—but by the second and third rounds my brain kept appending rationalizations and turning it into another case study. It helps a bit, but it gets co-opted; can we try a variant like "this is a feeling, not a fact," or do another set with a longer pause, because I'm frustrated the effect doesn't stick?

Therapist: Let's try a revised phrase, "this is a feeling, not a fact," and see if it helps. Remember, the goal is to simply acknowledge the feeling without evaluating or justifying it. Try inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is a feeling, not a fact." See if this creates a more lasting pause.

Patient: I did three rounds: big inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is a feeling, not a fact." Physically it helped—the chest-heat dropped and my jaw loosened—and the phrase felt less minimizing than "only," so the pause lasted a hair longer. Of course my narrator still hijacked it within a minute, annotating efficacy and rehearsing justifications, which is frustrating; I don't know if we need a longer hold, a different phrase, or a more abrupt tactile cue to keep the loop from collapsing. Can we try another variation now?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of using a phrase, let's try a more physical anchor. I'd like you to try holding a small, heavy object, like a heavy pen or a small weight, and then deliberately dropping it to the ground, making a clear, sharp sound. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is dropping an object supposed to disrupt the narrative? I'll try it anyway. I held the heavy pen in my palm, felt the weight sink into my hand and the muscles tense, then dropped it; the sound was sharp and for a second the chest-heat eased and my jaw unclenched. But my attention is fraying—already my mind's annotating it as a "punctate somatic reset" and I'm more jittery and distracted than I'd like; can we try three rounds and then a brief guided pause to notice what sticks?

Therapist: Let's try three rounds with the physical anchor, and then take a brief pause to reflect on what sticks. Remember to focus on your breath and the physical sensations in your body, without thinking about the narrative or analysis. On the count of three, you'll inhale, clench, stomp, and drop the pen, and then we'll pause for a moment. Ready? 1...

Patient: Okay—2...3. 

Round one: big inhale, clench, stomp, drop the pen — the click was sharp, the chest-heat dipped and my jaw unclenched, but my inner narrator immediately relabeled it as a procedural "reset." Round two and three gave slightly longer windows of just-noticing, but I'm getting jittery and distracted, and a wash of shame about some past screw-up keeps nudging me into self-critique so I start explaining instead of feeling. I'm frustrated that I can't hold the pause—can we do another set or a longer guided pause, because my attention keeps fracturing and I want to keep going.

Therapist: Let's take a longer pause to explore the shame and self-criticism. I want you to find a comfortable and quiet space where you can sit or lie down without distractions. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm noticing the shame and self-criticism that's arising, and I'm willing to allow it to be present without judgment." Then, take a few more deep breaths, and ask yourself, "What would it be like if I allowed myself to feel this shame and self-criticism, without trying to change or fix it?"

Patient: Okay — I'm trying that: breathing in and out and already there's this hot, constricting shame in my chest and a chorus of self-accusatory sentences bubbling up. Theoretically, letting it be would reduce the secondary narrative—the relentless "you messed up" commentary—and make space for the feeling to pass, but in practice it immediately activates every old verdict I've ever made about myself so I retract into analysis to avoid feeling small. I'm feeling anxious and frustrated because my attention keeps splintering; I can try to sit with it, but I think I need either a longer guided pause or a simple anchor phrase to repeat, otherwise I just start explaining everything instead of actually feeling it.

Therapist: Let's try a simple anchor phrase. Instead of repeating a phrase like "I am angry" or "I am feeling," try repeating the phrase "I'm here with this feeling" as you sit with the shame and self-criticism. Repeat it to yourself, simply and without judgment, and see if this helps you stay with the feeling without getting caught up in analysis. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm trying it—saying "I'm here with this feeling" out loud—and for a beat the chest constriction loosens and my voice cracks, but almost immediately my brain starts cataloguing antecedents and rehearsing defenses so it becomes another analytic datum. I'm anxious and distracted now; the shame keeps bubbling up and I find myself explaining why I deserve it instead of letting it be. Can you stay with me through a guided minute of silence or give a very simple tactile anchor to hold while I repeat the phrase, because I can't seem to keep the pause from collapsing on my own?

Therapist: Let's try a guided minute of silence. I want you to sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here with this feeling." Now, I'd like you to hold a small, heavy object, like a heavy pen or a small weight, in your hand. As you hold it, focus on the weight and the sensation of it in your hand. I'll guide you through the next minute, and we'll explore the shame and self-criticism together. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm already jittery and distracted; I have the pen in my hand and can feel its weight, my chest is tight, and there's this shame-tinged buzz that wants to turn this into another rehearsed explanation. I'll try to sit with "I'm here with this feeling," but my mind will probably start cataloguing failures, so please gently bring me back to the breath if I drift.

Therapist: Remember to breathe in and out slowly and deeply, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As we sit with the shame and self-criticism, I'll gently remind you to bring your attention back to the breath whenever you feel yourself getting caught up in narrative or analysis. Take a deep breath in... and out... and when you're ready, let's explore the shame and self-criticism together. Can you acknowledge the shame and self-criticism in your body, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. I can feel a hot, heavy knot in my chest, like my ribs are tight; my jaw is clenched and my throat feels raw, and there's this hollow, sinking pressure in my stomach. There's also a running internal commentary—"you messed up, you should fix it"—but I'm trying to just note the sensations without arguing with them. It's uncomfortable and my mind wants to explain, so please keep bringing me back to the breath if I drift.

Therapist: Remember to breathe in and out slowly and deeply, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As we sit with the shame and self-criticism, I'll gently remind you to bring your attention back to the breath whenever you feel yourself getting caught up in narrative or analysis. Take a deep breath in... and out... and when you're ready, let's notice the sensation of your chest tightening. What do you notice about the sensation in your chest? Is it heavy, tight, or...?

Patient: It's like a tight band across my chest — heavy, compressing, breath shallow and quick — and there's a little prickly heat under my sternum. Almost instantly my brain wants to translate it into theory — "attachment-triggered autonomic arousal," patterns, antecedents — which is frustrating because it keeps me from actually inhabiting the sensation. There's also this shamey, self-critical edge, like noticing it makes me look pathetic, and that just tightens everything more. I can try to follow the breath into that tight place if you guide me with a slow count or another anchor, because I'm already distracting myself.

Therapist: Let's try a slow and gentle anchor. I'll guide you through a slow, 4-7-8 breathing pattern. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 7, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 8. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and as you hold your breath, focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." Let's start with the inhale... 1...

Patient: Inhale—1, 2, 3, 4. Hold—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Exhale—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8—and as I exhale I say, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment."

Physically it loosened the band in my chest a notch and my jaw unclenched, but my head immediately started annotating—cataloguing failures and rehearsing defenses—so the shame flickered back in and the pause didn't hold; can we do a few more rounds or add a simple tactile anchor because I'm jittery and need help staying present.

Therapist: Let's try a tactile anchor. I'd like you to hold the heavy pen or weight in your hand, and as you breathe in and out, bring your attention to the sensation of the object in your hand. Feel the weight, the texture, the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it. As you inhale, focus on the sensation in your hand, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." Let's start again, and we'll take it slow.

Patient: Okay — I'm holding the pen now, feeling its weight and the slight grit under my fingers. I breathe in, focus on the object, and on the exhale I say, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." For a beat the tight band in my chest loosens, but my internal narrator immediately relabels it—cataloguing errors and rehearsing defenses—and a hot wash of shame and self-reproach floods back, which makes me jittery and fragmented. I can keep doing this, but I need either a timed guided window (like hold focus for 60 seconds) or a sharper interruptive cue, because my attention splinters too fast.

Therapist: Let's try a 90-second timed window. I'll guide you through the process, and we'll take it one minute at a time. We'll start with the sensation in your hand and the phrase "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." On the count of 10, we'll take a deep breath in and focus on the sensation. On the count of 20, we'll exhale and say the phrase. We'll repeat this process for 90 seconds, and then we'll take a brief pause to check in and see how you're feeling. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready to try the 90-second window, but I'm already jittery and my attention feels fractured. I'll hold the pen and try to repeat "I am here with this sensation, without judgment," though my brain will likely start narrativizing; please gently cue me back if I drift. Go ahead with your counts and I'll follow.
