Patient: Lately I've been getting stuck in these cycles where one small mistake at work turns into me thinking I'm a complete failure — it's gotten worse since I started this new, demanding role. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved family, so I never learned how to deal with feelings and now I just tear myself down. I don't really see how therapy is supposed to help with that — I've tried similar things before and it didn't work.

Therapist: Can you describe a recent situation where you felt like you made a mistake at work and how it led to those thoughts of being a complete failure? What's one specific thing you wish you could do differently in that moment, without the feelings of failure creeping in?

Patient: Last week I uploaded a quarterly report with a swapped column label and a client flagged it — I had to pull everything, redo it late into the night, and then my head just went: “You're incompetent, you’ll mess up everything.” I wish I could just pause, take a breath, and tell myself it’s a fixable error instead of spiraling into “I’m a failure,” but… how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried telling myself that before and it doesn’t stick; I just end up feeling ashamed and anxious.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling with the idea that your self-encouragement isn't enough to overcome the strong feelings of shame and anxiety. What if, instead of trying to just tell yourself to be more positive, you made a small, tiny step to create some distance between yourself and those thoughts? For example, could you commit to taking a few deep breaths before responding to the next time you make a mistake, and simply acknowledge the thought without judgment, rather than trying to push it away or fix it immediately?

Patient: I guess I could try taking a few breaths, but honestly—how is that supposed to help? I've done breathing before; it gives a tiny pause but then the “you’re incompetent” stuff comes back louder. Still, I can try one slow breath next time and maybe name the thought (“there’s that shame again”)—I’m skeptical, but I’ll try it.

Therapist: Let's take that tiny step together – the one slow breath. When you feel that thought come back, before you try to push it away or engage with it, I'd like you to give it a small label, like "ah, there's that shame again." That way, you're acknowledging it, but not getting caught up in it. What's the sensation in your body when you do that – is it a sense of calm, or is it still a bit tense?

Patient: There’s a tiny loosening—my shoulders might drop and my breath gets a bit deeper—but mostly my chest stays tight and there’s a knot in my stomach, and the “you’re incompetent” voice usually snaps back louder after that pause. I’m not sure—feels like a band‑aid; how is that supposed to actually stop the shame from swallowing me?

Therapist: The knot in your stomach is a strong indicator that the shame is still present. What is it about feeling ashamed that's most important to you – is it the fear of not meeting expectations, the fear of being judged, or something else? What's the value that you're trying to protect or achieve by avoiding those feelings?

Patient: Mostly it’s the fear of letting people down and losing that identity of being the reliable, competent one — my whole sense of worth feels tied to not screwing up. Growing up in a pretty reserved household, mistakes were treated like they weren’t talked about, so avoiding shame felt safer than being vulnerable. But… how is naming those values supposed to stop the knot in my stomach? It helps me understand it, maybe, but it doesn’t make it go away.

Therapist: It's like the knot is a muscle that's been contracted for a long time – just naming the values and understanding them might not be enough to relax it. What if, instead of trying to push the knot away or avoid it, you began to lean into the feeling of it – what if you started to acknowledge and accept it, even if it feels uncomfortable? What would that be like for you, physically and emotionally?

Patient: Physically it tightens—chest clamps, breath gets shallow, my stomach knots up and my shoulders pull to my ears; sometimes my hands tremble a bit. Emotionally it feels raw and exposed, like suddenly everyone can see I'm not the reliable person I try to be, and then I get ashamed for even feeling ashamed. Leaning into that sounds like opening a wound—how is that supposed to help? I’m not saying I won’t try it, but honestly I’m worried it’ll just make me spiral more.

Therapist: It sounds like leaning into the feeling of shame and exposure might feel overwhelming right now. Can you try something even smaller than leaning into it? Instead, what if you simply observe your physical sensations and emotional responses without judgment – just notice the tightness in your chest, the shallow breath, and the trembling hands, without trying to change them? Would that create some space between you and those sensations, or would it still feel like you're getting sucked in?

Patient: Sometimes it does give a sliver of space — my chest eases a little and I can actually get a deeper breath — but most of the time the “you’re incompetent” voice just slides back in louder after a few seconds. Noticing the tightness feels less combative than trying to shove the feeling away, but it still feels like standing on a ledge and waiting to fall. How is simply observing supposed to stop the loop when I’ve tried mindfulness and it fizzles out? I’ll try observing again, but I need something concrete to do when that voice comes back — what do you expect me to do then?

Therapist: I'm not expecting you to have a magic solution yet – just a small, tiny step. When that voice comes back, what if, instead of trying to push it away or argue with it, you simply speak to it in a gentle, curious tone, like you're asking a friend for help? For example, you could say, "Ah, the shame voice is back – what's going on here?" What would that feel like for you, to have a conversation with your own thoughts like that?

Patient: It feels weird—like stepping outside myself and talking to a snarky coworker who's been nitpicking everything I do. For a second it can make the voice sound less like fact and more like noise, so I get a tiny bit of air, but most of the time it just answers back louder. How is asking it a question supposed to change anything? I can try saying that line, but I’ll need a concrete next step when the voice replies, or it’s just going to keep arguing with me.

Therapist: Let's explore what might happen if, instead of trying to argue with the shame voice, you began to explore its underlying needs. What if, when the voice says "You're incompetent," you asked yourself, "What's the voice trying to tell me?" or "What's the purpose of this thought?" What might you learn about yourself or your values by listening to its concerns?

Patient: I think it’d probably tell me it’s trying to protect me — keeping me from looking unreliable or getting punished, so it nags to keep me on guard. It might also be about wanting approval and not wanting to risk losing my place as the competent one, which feels familiar from my family. But… how is knowing that actually going to stop the voice from roaring back? If I try asking it what it wants, what’s a concrete thing I can do next so it doesn’t just argue with me?

Therapist: Knowing what the shame voice is trying to protect and what it wants might give you some clarity. What if, when the voice says "You're incompetent," you took a small action that aligns with your values of being reliable and competent? For example, you could start by doing one thing you know you can do well, like double-checking a task or seeking feedback from a trusted colleague. What would that feel like, to take a concrete step towards proving to yourself that you're capable, without trying to silence the shame voice?

Patient: It would probably give a tiny, uneasy relief — double‑checking or asking a colleague for quick feedback feels like something I can actually do, so the knot loosens a bit. But I'm worried it just makes me reliant on other people's approval, and if they point out another flaw I'll spiral even worse — how is that supposed to help long term? I can try it, but I need a concrete plan for when the voice comes back and says, “See, you’re still a failure” — what do you expect me to do then?

Therapist: Let's explore what it means to rely on yourself, rather than external validation. What if, when the voice says "You're still a failure," you turned your attention to your own values and strengths? Instead of trying to prove yourself to others, you asked yourself, "What would I do if I knew I was doing my best?" or "What are some things I'm proud of accomplishing?" What would that feel like, to focus on your own internal compass, rather than trying to silence the shame voice?

Patient: I think it might give a small, weird relief — like a little room to breathe — but also feel false, like I'm trying to pep‑talk myself into not feeling what I actually feel. I could try asking, "What would I do if I knew I was doing my best?" and name one thing I'm proud of, but honestly I've tried similar things and it often rings hollow. How would you have me practice that in the moment—give me a concrete line or step I can use when the shame voice starts shouting.

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. When the shame voice starts shouting, I'd like you to pause for a brief moment, take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "This thought is just that – a thought." Say it out loud, as if you're talking to a friend. Notice how your body responds, and then, gently, you can add, "I'm not my thoughts." Can you try that for a moment, without judgment, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay... I said it out loud: "This thought is just that — a thought," and then "I'm not my thoughts." For a second my shoulders loosened a hair and my breath went a bit deeper, but the "you're incompetent" voice came back louder and my hands started trembling — my mind immediately jumped to other worst‑case scenarios. It feels like the same tiny patch over a big wound; how is saying that supposed to actually change anything when it just fizzles out? If that line doesn't hold, what exact next step do you want me to try in the moment — repeat it, do a physical thing, name a value — be concrete, because I'm not sure what else to do.

Therapist: Let's try something more tangible. When the shame voice comes back, I want you to do one physical action that feels connected to your values of being reliable and competent. For example, you could take a small step forward, make a cup of coffee, or do a few push-ups. Not because you need to prove anything to yourself or others, but because it feels good to take action that's in line with your values. Can you commit to doing just one small, concrete action when the shame voice starts shouting, without judgment or expectation of outcome?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it. When the shame voice starts I’ll pause, take a breath, say out loud “this is just a thought… I’m not my thoughts,” then make a cup of coffee and do one concrete thing tied to reliability (like double‑checking a single label in the report). My hands are already trembling just saying that and my mind’s jumping to worst‑case scenarios — how is making coffee supposed to stop the spiral if it keeps roaring back? If that doesn’t help, give me one exact next move to do in the moment — don’t give me options, tell me one thing.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to say, "I'm willing to take a risk and do something I'm capable of doing, even if it's not perfect. I'm willing to be vulnerable and show myself that I can handle it." Say it out loud, with conviction, and then do the action you chose (double-checking the label) without hesitation.

Patient: Okay — I said it out loud, my voice actually shook: "I'm willing to take a risk..." then I made the coffee and double‑checked that label like you said. My hands are still trembling, my chest is tight, and the shame voice immediately yelled that it was pointless. How is that supposed to help when I can do the steps and still feel like everything will fall apart? If it keeps shouting, give me one exact thing to do next.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm going to give myself permission to be okay, even if I'm not perfect." Say it out loud, and then, as you exhale, take a small physical action that feels calming and soothing, like sipping your coffee or taking a gentle sip of air.

Patient: I said it out loud — "I'm going to give myself permission to be okay, even if I'm not perfect" — and took a slow sip of coffee as I exhaled. My shoulders eased a hair and my breath steadied for a second, but the "you're incompetent" voice came back right away and my hands started trembling again; my attention's all over the place and I'm more anxious than before. How is that supposed to help when the relief fades so fast? Tell me one exact thing to do next, right now, if the voice keeps shouting — one concrete move, no options.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to focus on your breath, and say to yourself, "I'm going to stay with the feeling of my body, in this moment."

Patient: I tried it — I focused on my breath and said, "I'm going to stay with the feeling of my body, in this moment." For a beat my breath steadied, then the shame voice shot back louder, my hands started trembling, and my mind slammed into worst‑case scenarios so I couldn't hold the focus. How is staying with the body supposed to help when it just fizzles and the rumination takes over? If that doesn't work, give me one exact thing to do right then — one concrete move — because I can't handle choices when I'm like this.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to put your hands down and do something tactile with the coffee cup – touch the rim, feel the weight of it, or touch the cup with the palm of your hand.

Patient: I put my hands on the cup, felt the rim and the weight, and for a second my breath steadied and my shoulders eased—then the "you're incompetent" voice came back so loud my hands started trembling and my mind jumped to worst‑case scenarios. How is touching a cup supposed to stop that loop when it only buys me a second? If that doesn't work, tell me one exact thing to do right then—no options, one concrete move.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to say, "That's the voice of the shame story – I'm going to stop listening to it."

Patient: I said it out loud: "That's the voice of the shame story — I'm going to stop listening to it." For a beat my chest loosened and my breath went a bit steadier, then the voice came back louder, my hands started trembling, and my mind jumped to worst‑case scenarios so I couldn't hold it. How is that supposed to help when it just buys a second? Tell me one exact thing to do next, right now — no options.

Therapist: When the shame voice comes back, I want you to say "My body is my temple."

Patient: I said it out loud—"My body is my temple"—and it felt awkward and false; my chest tightened, my hands started trembling, and the shame voice just got louder, spinning into worst‑case scenarios. How is that supposed to actually help when it doesn't stick? I'm more on edge and my mind's racing—if that doesn't work, tell me one exact thing to do right now, no options.

Therapist: I want you to put your hand on your heart.

Patient: Okay—I put my hand on my heart. It's racing and my hand's trembling, my breath's shallow, and for a second it felt a tiny bit steadier before the “you’re incompetent” voice got louder. How is that supposed to help when it just buys a second? If that doesn't work, tell me one exact thing to do right now—no options.

Therapist: I want you to take one step.

Patient: I took one step — my foot moved but my heart's racing, my hands are trembling, and my breath's shallow. For a split second my shoulders eased, then the “you’re incompetent” voice came back louder and my mind jumped to worst‑case scenarios, so it felt useless. How is that supposed to actually help when it just buys a second? Tell me one exact thing to do right now — no options.

Therapist: I want you to speak the truth to yourself.

Patient: The truth is I'm terrified a single mistake will show everyone I'm a fraud and I'll lose what I've worked for. I tear myself down automatically — it feels like a reflex I can't stop — and I'm ashamed that I can't just handle it. My hands are trembling and my heart's racing even saying this, and honestly I don't trust these tiny tricks to fix it long‑term. If the voice comes back right now, tell me one exact thing to do — no options, one move.

Therapist: I want you to say, "I am here."

Patient: I said it out loud — "I am here." For a beat my breath steadied and my hands trembled a little less, then the "you're incompetent" voice spat back that being here doesn't mean anything; my heart's racing and my mind's already jumping to worst‑case scenarios. If that voice starts shouting right now, tell me one exact thing to do — no options, one move.

Therapist: I want you to look up.

Patient: I looked up — forced my eyes to the ceiling — and for a beat my chest loosened a fraction, but my hands are still shaking and my mind's already racing with worst‑case scenarios. How is looking up supposed to help when it just buys a second before the spiral starts again? If it kicks off right now, tell me one exact thing to do immediately — no options.

Therapist: I want you to say "I exist."

Patient: I said it out loud — "I exist." For a beat my breath steadied and my hands shook a little less, then the "you're incompetent" voice sneered that existing doesn't change anything; my heart's racing and my mind's already jumping to worst‑case scenarios. How is that supposed to actually help when it just fades so fast? If it starts shouting right now, tell me one exact thing to do — no options, one move.

Therapist: I want you to let go.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to let go. I relaxed my shoulders and breathed out like you said, tried to picture the tension releasing, but my chest stayed tight, my hands trembled, and the “you’re incompetent” voice just got louder. Letting go feels like surrendering to collapse, not relief—how is that supposed to help? If this doesn’t work, tell me one exact thing to do right now—no options.
