Patient: I'm a middle-aged construction worker and since the breakup I've been having a lot of trouble managing my anger and frustration — it comes out at work and anytime something reminds me of her. I snap at people, say things I regret, and then sink into a low mood, and nothing I've tried so far really helps. Honestly, I don't see how this is supposed to help, but I'm here.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right before you snap at someone or say something you regret at work? What's the immediate trigger that sets off that reaction?

Patient: Usually it's something small — a guy at the site jokes about relationships, someone tosses me a sarcastic comment, or my phone lights up with her name. My chest goes tight, my face gets hot, and my mind jumps straight to all the ways she left me, like I'm back in that moment, and before I know it I blow up. Then I feel stupid and flat and try to shove it down, but the same old cycle keeps happening. I've tried breathing and walking away — it doesn't stick — so... how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to "shove it down" – a common way people deal with uncomfortable emotions. Can you imagine, for a moment, that you're having a hot cup of coffee and it's too hot for you – what would you do to make the experience more comfortable, or perhaps even enjoyable?

Patient: I'd let it cool — set it down, blow on it, stir in some milk, take small sips instead of gulping it. Problem is, when I get that tight chest at work I don't wait or sip, I just lash out because it feels like letting it sit makes it pile up and I look weak. So yeah, I get the metaphor, but how is that supposed to help when I'm already about to explode?

Therapist: I understand that feeling like taking a step back might feel like showing weakness. Can I ask, what if instead of trying to suppress the feeling, you tried to acknowledge it, like taking a deep breath, and say to yourself, "This tightness is here, and I can tolerate it for just a moment"?

Patient: I've tried that—taking a breath, telling myself to wait—but it's like the anger's a hammer and breathing's a toothpick. I get the idea, but in the moment it doesn't buy me time; I still snap and then feel like an idiot. Maybe saying it out loud could help, but I'm not convinced—how is that supposed to actually stop the heat from taking over?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to manage the anger with a response, what if we create space for the anger itself? Can you imagine, just for a moment, allowing the tightness in your chest to be exactly as it is – without judgment, without trying to change it, without trying to respond to it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. The tightness's like a weight in my chest and my hands clench — it feels angry and ready to explode. Letting it be feels weird and useless; how is just noticing that supposed to stop me from snapping when the urge's so strong?

Therapist: It's not about stopping the anger entirely, but about what you do with it. What would you do if you were to take a moment to acknowledge that anger, without acting on it? What's one action you value, like taking a walk or calling a friend, that would help you feel more connected to yourself and less reactive to the situation?

Patient: Maybe stepping away for a quick walk and calling a buddy would help — just getting some air and saying something out loud that ain't about the job. The problem is I can't always duck off the site, and I've tried walking or calling and half the time it doesn't do jack when I'm already boiling. So yeah, I can name it, but how's that supposed to actually stop me in the heat of it?

Therapist: Let's try to take it a step back further. When you're feeling that tightness, what if, instead of trying to change it or escape from it, you allowed yourself to just be with it – exactly as it is – and then wondered, "What would I do with this feeling, if it meant I could take a break, even if it's just a deep breath, or step away for a minute"?

Patient: I guess I'd try to step off the line for a minute — go to the trailer, splash cold water on my face, take a few breaths, maybe call Mike or send a quick text. But on a busy day I can't always duck off, and when it's already boiling those breaths feel useless — the anger just bulldozes right through. I get the idea of "being with it," but I'm not convinced wondering about it will make me actually do any of that when I'm livid. Honestly, I'm getting tired of trying things that don't stick and it's starting to feel pointless.

Therapist: Can I ask, what's one thing that's important to you, something that you value, that might give you the motivation to take a different approach, even when you're feeling angry and overwhelmed?

Patient: My kids — I don't want them thinking I'm some yelling, out-of-control dad, and I want to be around for them without everyone tiptoeing. I also care about keeping my job and not being the guy everyone avoids at the site. But I gotta be honest: knowing that doesn't stop the heat when it hits, and I've tried a bunch of stuff already — how's talking about values actually supposed to make me stop snapping?

Therapist: Let's try to connect the dots. If being a positive father figure and keeping your job is important to you, what would you do right now, in this moment, to demonstrate those values to yourself and others?

Patient: I guess right now I'd try to make a deliberate choice—tell myself "not for them," step off the line to the trailer, splash some cold water on my face, and hold my tongue until I can say something less heated. But honestly, when I'm boiling I barely remember to do that—how's picturing my kid or taking a walk supposed to stop my mouth in the moment? I'm getting tired of trying stuff that doesn't stick, so can we slow down and actually figure out what might work when I'm already at that point?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. What if, in the moment you feel that anger rising up, you were to take a small, immediate action that reflects your value of being a positive father figure, something like taking a few deep breaths, counting to 10, or saying to yourself, "I'm choosing to respond, not react"?

Patient: Okay…my chest’s tight and I'm kind of jittery right now, hard to focus — counting to ten or taking breaths feels like bullshit when I’m already five steps past boiling. I’ve tried the “I’m choosing to respond” line and it doesn’t stick; how’s saying that supposed to stop my fists from clenching? Maybe something immediate and physical would actually buy me a second — clench-and-release, duck to the trailer, splash water — but I’m anxious that even that won’t work when it’s full-on. I’m getting tired of trying things that don’t sink in, so how do we make one of these actually work in the heat of it?

Therapist: Can you imagine, in the midst of the intense physical sensations, that you're standing in a moment where your hands are clenched, your chest is tight, and your mind is racing – what would it take for you to simply acknowledge those sensations, without judgment, without trying to change them?

Patient: I mean, right now my chest's tight and my head's jumping all over — it's hard to imagine actually slowing down. Maybe it’d take a real, physical anchor I can do without asking anyone, like digging my heels into the ground and feeling it, a quick clench-and-release with my fist, or a tiny thing in my pocket to fiddle with so my hands have something else to do. Or a super-short line I can mutter under my breath — “not for them” or “for the kids” — something that actually snaps me back for two seconds. But I'm doubtful it’ll work when I'm full-on; I've tried breathing and mantras and they just slip away, and I'm getting anxious and tired of trying stuff that doesn't stick — how do we make one of those actually happen in the heat of it?

Therapist: Let's focus on one of these physical anchors, just for a moment – can you choose one, right now, to start with, and practice it while we're talking? For example, take a deep breath, and then dig your heels into the ground, feeling the sensation of your feet connecting with the ground, and hold it for a second. What happens in your body when you do that?

Patient: Alright — I did it: took a breath, dug my heels in, and for a second my shoulders loosened and my chest didn't feel like it was going to explode. My hands freed up a bit and I could actually think one clear thought, but my heart's still racing and the head-jumping didn't stop. It feels like it buys me maybe two seconds — which could be enough to hold my tongue — but I'm nervous it'll vanish the next time I'm full-on furious. How do I make that two-second move happen automatically when I'm already past the point of thinking?

Therapist: Let's build on what we've done so far. Can you think of another physical anchor, one that you can do without thinking about it – something that you can do on autopilot, like a tiny movement with your fingers or a subtle shift in your posture? The idea is to create a response that's not just a conscious decision, but something that happens automatically when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try something I can do without thinking: keep my tape measure in my pocket and quietly roll the metal clip with my thumb, or press my thumb and forefinger together under my work glove. Right now my hands are jittery and I feel kind of on edge, so I'm skeptical it'll kick in when I'm full-on, but if it gives me two seconds to shut my mouth it's worth a shot — how do I make that actually happen automatically?

Therapist: Let's think about what would happen if, every time you felt that anger rising up, you automatically did the clip or finger press without thinking about it – not even thinking about it. It's not about trying to will yourself to do it, but about creating a connection between the physical response and the desire to manage your anger. Can you imagine that happening, without exception, every time you feel that anger start to rise?

Patient: Honestly, with how jittery and scattered I feel right now, I can't picture it happening every single time. I can see myself doing the clip or the thumb-press when I'm only mildly pissed, but when I'm full-on boiling it just goes past me. So how do you actually make that tiny move become automatic when my head's racing — what's the real trick that makes it a reflex?

Therapist: Let's explore the idea that you don't just need to change your behavior, but also the thoughts that drive it. What would you need to believe about yourself, about your relationship with anger, in order to feel more confident that you can manage it? In other words, what's the underlying story that says, "I'm a person who can handle my anger"?

Patient: I guess I'd have to start believing a few things: that the anger isn't who I am, it's just a feeling that comes and goes; that I can tolerate the discomfort long enough for a tiny move to work; and that messing up once doesn't mean I'm back at square one. I also need to believe those little anchors can become automatic — that I can train myself to do them when I don't even think. But I'm jittery and skeptical right now — how am I supposed to start believing that when every trick I've tried so far just slips away?

Therapist: Can you imagine, in this very moment, that you're already committed to creating a new relationship with your anger – one that sees it as a challenge to be managed, not a definition of who you are? What would it take, just for a second, to feel like you're already on this path, like you're already starting to build a new way of being with your anger?

Patient: Honestly, to feel like I'm already on that path I'd need a tiny, real win — like doing the clip or thumb-press and actually stopping myself in a heated moment, and someone I respect saying, “you kept your cool today.” I'm jittery and distracted right now, so picturing it feels thin; I'd want a simple plan that ties a clear cue to a physical anchor, practiced a bunch in calm moments, plus someone like Mike checking in so it’s not just me talking to myself. But I've tried practice and check-ins before — how is this one supposed to stick when I'm already full-on furious?

Therapist: Let's create a simple, concrete plan for the next time you feel angry and overwhelmed. What's one specific situation that you anticipate might trigger a strong reaction, and what's one physical anchor that you can do in that moment (e.g., rolling the clip, pressing fingers)? And who would you like to have check in with you, so you can get that external validation you mentioned?

Patient: Alright — pick one real situation: when a guy on the site cracks a joke about relationships and everyone laughs and I feel my chest tighten. My anchor: keep my tape measure in my pocket and quietly roll the metal clip with my thumb while muttering under my breath “for the kids,” and dig my heels into the ground for a second to steady myself. I'll practice that on breaks and ask Mike to text me after lunch or check in if he notices me getting snappy — I'm jittery and skeptical it’ll work when I’m full-on, but I’ll try it if Mike helps keep me honest.

Therapist: I like where we are. Now, let's make a small commitment to you, right now, in this moment. I'd like you to take a deep breath, and when you feel that anger start to rise up, I want you to reach into your pocket and roll the metal clip with your thumb, without thinking about it, without waiting for the anger to pass. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I did it: took a deep breath, reached into my pocket and rolled the clip. It bought me maybe two seconds — my shoulders eased a bit but my heart's still racing and I'm jittery. I'll try to do that when it starts up, but I'm worried I'll forget or it won't register when I'm full-on furious — what do I do if that happens?

Therapist: Let's think about what would happen if you did forget to roll the clip, or if it didn't register when you needed it most. What would you do in that moment? Would you panic, or would you take a step back, and then try again?

Patient: If I forget, I usually panic — my chest spikes, my jaw tightens, and my mouth just fires off whatever. Afterward I'm mad at myself and it spirals into shame, which makes everything worse. I'd try to force a pause — step to the trailer, mutter "for the kids," roll the clip, or text Mike to check in and then practice again, but I'm anxious that by the time I remember it'll already be too late.

Therapist: Let's challenge that pattern of self-criticism for a moment. Can you see that your inner critic is not just commenting on your behavior, but also perpetuating the cycle of shame and self-criticism? What would happen if, instead of beating yourself up, you simply acknowledged that you forgot the anchor and allowed yourself to feel the emotions that arose, without judgment?

Patient: Maybe if I didn't beat myself up I wouldn't flip from angry to ashamed and wreck the rest of the day — I'd be more likely to try the anchor again instead of giving up on it. Right now I'm jittery and my chest's tight and it's hard not to panic; I worry that "being kinder to myself" is just another thing I say when I'm calm and then forget when I'm full-on. So how do I actually practice letting the feeling be without judgment in the moment — what's a real, doable step I can use when I'm already boiling?

Therapist: Let's label the emotions that are arising in this moment, without judgment. Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling angry, my heart is racing, my chest is tight"? That's it, just the statement, without adding any evaluation or judgment. What would happen if, in that moment, you simply acknowledged the emotions, without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: Alright — I'm feeling angry, my heart's racing, my chest is tight. Saying that out loud kind of loosens it a fraction, maybe gives me a hair of space, but my head's already jumping and my mouth still wants to fire. I'm anxious and tired of stuff that only helps a little — how does just naming it actually stop me when I'm already full-on, and what do I do if that tiny space disappears?

Therapist: Let's try to anchor the emotions in the present moment, rather than just labeling them. Can you find a physical sensation in your body, something small, like the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? What would happen if, in that moment, you focused on that sensation, without trying to change or react to the emotions?

Patient: Alright — I can feel my feet on the ground, weight through my heels, a bit of grit under my boots, and my shoulders loosen a fraction and my breath gets a hair steadier. It gives me maybe a second of space, but my hands are jittery and my head's still racing — when I'm full-on furious that tiny focus just evaporates. So how's that supposed to stop me in the heat of it, and what's the next, stupid-simple move I can do without thinking if that focus disappears?

Therapist: Let's think about what would happen if, even when the focus on your breath or physical sensations disappeared, you could still do something simple, without thinking, that would help you stay present and calm. What if, instead of trying to focus on your breath, you could do something else with your hands, like making a fist and then releasing it, or tapping your feet on the ground?

Patient: Alright — I'll try the clench-and-release, done quick under my glove so it ain't obvious. Doing it now makes my shoulders drop a bit and my jaw loosen, but I'm anxious it won't register when I'm already boiling. How do I make that happen automatically so I don't have to remember it in the moment?

Therapist: Let's think about what would happen if, every time you felt that anger rising up, you would automatically do the clench-and-release, without thinking about it. We can use something like classical conditioning to help you associate this behavior with a more calm state. Imagine, in a calm moment, that you're sitting in a comfortable chair, feeling relaxed and at ease, and you're doing the clench-and-release. What would happen in that moment?

Patient: Okay — I picture it: sitting relaxed, clench-and-release a few times, and my shoulders drop, my breathing slows, and I actually feel a tiny bit of control — like for a second I’m not at the mercy of that hammer. But I’m jittery and my head’s all over the place right now, so it still feels thin — I don’t trust that’ll carry over when I’m full-on furious. How many times do I gotta do it for it to become automatic, and what’s the backup if the conditioning doesn’t kick in when it matters?

Therapist: Let's think about the process of making this behavior automatic. How about we set a goal to practice the clench-and-release 5-10 times a day, 2-3 times a week, for the next 2 weeks. And, if you find yourself in a situation where you feel the anger rising up, and you're not sure if you'll remember to do the clench-and-release, what's the one thing you can do in that moment to help you stay on track?

Patient: I'll make the tape measure my go-to: when I feel that heat, I'll shove my hand in my pocket and roll the metal clip with my thumb — quick, quiet, and something I can do without anyone noticing. I'm jittery and don't trust it'll work every time, but that's the one thing I can try first. If it doesn't kick in, I'll step back to the trailer and text Mike — but honestly, I'm worried this still won't hold up when I'm full-on furious.

Therapist: I like where we are. It sounds like you have a clear plan in place. Can you take a moment to acknowledge that, even if the clench-and-release doesn't work 100% of the time, you're still taking steps to manage your anger and take care of yourself? That's a huge step. What would you say to yourself if you found yourself in a situation where you felt like giving up, or if the clench-and-release didn't work?

Patient: Right now I'm jittery and my chest's tight — if I felt like giving up or the clench didn't work I'd hear the critic go straight to shame, and I'd try to talk back to it: "Okay, you screwed up, so what — try the clip again, step to the trailer, text Mike. You're doing this for the kids, not to prove anything to anyone." I’d try to be practical and not beat myself up, but honestly that sounds thin when I'm full-on furious — how do I actually make that self-talk and the clip happen when my head's racing?
