Patient: Hi, it's good to meet you — lately what's been on my mind is how I've been using mindfulness and meditation almost like an affective anesthetic to dampen the grief. I can talk about it in meta-terms—emotional regulation strategies and cognitive reframing—and as a data scientist that intellectualization comes naturally, but I suspect I'm avoiding actually feeling the sadness. On top of that, the ongoing financial stress makes everything feel more urgent and distractible, so I'm not sure if my "practice" is helping or just delaying things.

Therapist: Can you think of a specific moment when you've practiced mindfulness or meditation while feeling overwhelmed by financial stress, and what did you focus on during that moment?

Patient: Yeah — one clear time was a few weeks ago when I opened a late-notice email about my mortgage and felt that tight, jumpy panic. I sat on the kitchen chair and did a 10‑minute breath-counting meditation, deliberately anchoring on the inhale at my nostrils and labeling thoughts as “transient” to avoid spiraling, while mentally rehearsing contingency plans like a cost–benefit analysis. What I noticed was that the practice mostly functioned as a down-regulation tool — I felt calmer but also strangely numb, because I kept translating the somatic sensation into theories instead of describing the actual ache in my chest. I'm not sure if that was adaptive in the moment or just postponing the grief and fear.

Therapist: Can you try labeling the physical sensations in your chest, like "I'm feeling a dull ache" or "my chest feels heavy," without immediately translating them into thoughts or stories? Just observe the sensations, allowing them to exist on their own, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: Okay—my chest feels like a dull, constricting pressure right behind the breastbone, and my breaths are a bit shallow and quick. As soon as I notice that, my brain wants to turn it into "that's anxiety from the mortgage issue" and start mapping out scenarios instead of just letting the pressure be, so I'm trying to sit with it but it's hard—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a pause from labeling and analyzing the sensations, and instead, simply observe the feeling of your breath as it is, without trying to do anything with it. Just focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, allowing it to be whatever it is, without judgment or commentary.

Patient: I'm trying—there's a coolness at my nostrils and a shallow lift in the upper chest when I inhale, then a slight release on the exhale, and that tightness behind my sternum softens a hair. But my brain is already tabulating breath metrics and narrating it as "regulated" or "not regulated," which pulls me away from just feeling it. Can we slow down a bit? I'm finding it hard to stay with the breath without turning it into data.

Therapist: Let's try something simple: Instead of focusing on the breath or the sensations, notice the sensation of your body sitting there, on the chair, feeling the weight of your body on the seat, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of the breath without trying to do anything with it. Just acknowledge the presence of your body and the air around you, without labeling or thinking about it.

Patient: Okay — I'm feeling the chair under my thighs and lower back, the soles of my feet flat on the floor, a cool draft along my forearms, and a slight buzzing tension in my shoulders. Of course my mind immediately wants to translate that into "postural strain" or "mild sympathetic arousal" instead of just being with it, which pulls me out of the moment. Can we stay here a bit longer? I'm finding it oddly hard not to narrate.

Therapist: Let's pause for just a moment longer, and try to notice the sensations as they are, without any judgment, not even a "not judgment." Just allow them to be, without trying to attach a meaning to them. Can you try to feel the sensations as they are, in the present moment, without trying to change them, without trying to be anything with them?

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to stay with it: a dull pressure under my sternum, a slight buzzing in my shoulders, and my feet feeling heavy on the floor. But the second I notice, my brain turns it into "that's anxiety about the mortgage" and starts making contingency lists instead of just being with the sensations, which is really frustrating. Can we slow down—help me stay with the sensations a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's try a very small, tiny step: whenever you notice your mind starting to label or analyze the sensations, simply say to yourself, "Okay, my mind is trying to label this." That's it. Just acknowledge that your mind is trying to do its thing, and then gently bring your attention back to the sensations, without trying to change them or label them. Can you try that tiny step, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried it: I said to myself, "My mind is trying to label this," then brought attention back to the dull pressure behind my sternum and the cool at my nostrils. It did help quiet the immediate ruminative pull, but my reflex to intellectualize kicked in almost right away and that frustration bubbled up — can we stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's try to notice the sensation of the dull pressure behind your sternum, not as "anxiety about the mortgage" or "stress," but simply as a sensation. Can you try to feel the texture, the location, the size, and the weight of that sensation, without trying to add any thoughts or meanings to it? Just be with it, as it is, in the present moment.

Patient: Okay—it's a dull, persistent pressure right behind my sternum, broad and flattened like a coin maybe three inches across, weighty but diffuse, more of a low throb than a sharp pain. But already my brain wants to reframe it as an "embodied memory" of loss and run statistical analogies and contingency plans instead of staying with the sensation. Can we linger here a bit? I'm impatient and keep wanting to problem-solve, but I want to try staying with it.

Therapist: Let's try to stay with the sensation of the pressure, not as a "memory of loss" or as a "problem to solve," but simply as the sensation. Can you try to notice the sensation of the pressure as it is, right now, without trying to change it or label it? Let's try to imagine you're holding a small, soft cushion on your sternum, and the pressure is just that cushion, without trying to do anything with it. Just be with it.

Patient: Okay — imagining that small, soft cushion on my sternum makes the pressure feel blunted, like a warm, pillowy weight spread out under my breastbone, edges diffused and a little comforting when I breathe into it. But predictably my brain immediately starts re-labeling it as "grief residue" and runs through contingency schematics, so I'm split between observing and narrating. I'm also more anxious than a moment ago and my attention keeps pinging to lists and next steps, which is pulling me out — can we slow down and sit with the cushion a bit longer? I'm finding it really hard not to start problem‑solving.

Therapist: Let's try to anchor ourselves to the cushion, not as a way to solve the problem, but as a way to stay present. Can you try to focus on the sensation of the cushion on your sternum, not as "grief residue" or "problem to solve," but simply as the sensation of something soft and comforting? Let's try to cultivate a sense of curiosity about the sensation, not to change it or label it, but just to observe it. Can you breathe into the sensation of the cushion, and notice how it feels to be present with it, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Okay — I breathed into the cushion image and it does soften the pressure a bit; there's a warm, spread-out weight under my sternum and my inhale grazes it before the exhale releases slightly. But now I'm more anxious, my breath feels shallower and my mind is accelerating into contingency-planning and these ruminative loops — cognitive elaboration kicks in and I start narrating instead of feeling. Can we slow down and stay with this for a minute? Maybe give me very small prompts (like "notice three sensations" or "count one breath") because if you don't, I will immediately start listing next steps.

Therapist: Notice three sensations in your body right now, without thinking about them or trying to change them. Just notice them as they are, without judgment. Let's start with your breath. Can you count one breath, slowly, without thinking about the pressure or the cushion? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: Okay. In—cool at the nostrils—out—slight release. That's one. My attention's already skittering to lists and that tightness; can we do two more slow breaths together?

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. In... cool at the nostrils... out... slight release. Just notice the sensation of the release, without thinking about it or labeling it. Now, let's focus on your shoulders. Notice the sensation of your shoulders, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Just a gentle awareness of the sensation.

Patient: They're heavy and a bit hollow-tired across the tops, like a low-level tightness that feels thicker on the left. My attention keeps pinging to the mortgage and a dozen little lists, and it's getting hard to keep this simple—can we stay with the shoulders for another moment?

Therapist: Let's stay with the shoulders for just a moment. Notice the sensation of the heaviness, the feeling of thickness, and the location of the tightness on the left shoulder. Just notice it as it is, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Now, let's take one word, "left", and just say it to yourself, without thinking about it or doing anything with it. Can you do that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying "left" supposed to help with the shoulder sensation? Okay… left. Saying it feels oddly like a label, like I'm coding a variable for my chest of symptoms, and my attention's already skittering off into lists. My energy's low and I'm struggling to stay present—can we just sit with the shoulder for a moment before the next step?

Therapist: Let's just stay with the shoulder for a moment. Just be with the sensation of the heaviness, the feeling of thickness, and the location of the tightness. Don't think about it, don't try to change it, just be with it. Allow the sensation to simply exist, without trying to do anything with it. Take one deep breath, and just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, right where it is, in the present moment.

Patient: (in—out) My inhale barely fills the upper chest and the exhale feels thin. The left shoulder is still heavy, a dull, localized thickness, but my attentional telemetry spikes into contingency-planning about the mortgage the moment I notice it. I'm not sure I follow how this helps—can you give a very small, concrete prompt (like "count one breath with me" or "notice the cool at your nostrils") so I can actually stay here?

Therapist: Let's try a very simple prompt: notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Just notice the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Can you do that? Just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and try to let go of anything else.

Patient: Okay—my feet are flat on the floor, I can feel pressure under the heels and a faint warmth across the balls of my feet, toes resting but a little splayed. My mind's already drafting expense spreadsheets and that tightness in my chest ratchets up when I notice it, so staying with the feet feels oddly effortful and foreign—can we do one tiny thing together, like count one slow breath out loud?

Therapist: Let's count one slow breath out loud together. Inhale... exhale... and let's count the exhalation: one. Just say the number out loud, without thinking about the sensation or the tightness in your chest. Let the sound of your voice be the anchor, and try to let go of everything else.

Patient: One.

That actually helped for a beat — the vocal anchor shifted me into the present, but my attention immediately ricocheted back to mortgage scenarios and the chest tightened again; the count feels necessary but insufficient. Can we try one more very small step together — maybe count a second breath out loud or notice the cool at the nostrils? I need something micro and concrete to stay here.

Therapist: Let's notice the cool at your nostrils out loud. "Cool at the nostrils." Just say it, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Let the words be the anchor, and see if we can stay with the sensation of the coolness for a brief moment.

Patient: "Cool at the nostrils."

That actually pulled me in for a moment — I felt the cool, but then my chest tightened and my mind sprinted back to mortgage lists. Can we do one more tiny anchor together, like one slow counted exhale?

Therapist: Let's take one slow, very quiet exhale. *exhale* Just the sound of the exhalation, without thinking about it or trying to change it. Let the tiny sound be the anchor, and see if we can stay with the sensation of the exhale for a brief, imperceptible moment.

Patient: out— That tiny exhale softened the pressure for a beat and the cool at my nostrils felt a touch clearer, but my attention's already pinging back to mortgage math and the chest tightens again. I'm running low on bandwidth and it's getting hard to hold this—can we do one very small thing together, like count one slow exhale out loud?

Therapist: *exhale*

Patient: out—

That exhale eased things briefly, then a wash of shame and self-reproach snapped up — I found myself thinking "I should be better at this," which just tightens my chest and fragments my attention. Can we do one micro-anchor together — count one slow exhale out loud with me, just say "one" on the out-breath?

Therapist: *exhale* one

Patient: One.

Saying it out loud gave me a tiny anchor, then this rush of shame — the voice saying "you should be better" — tightened my chest and my attention scattered into lists and self-criticism. My energy's sagging; can we do another micro-anchor, like two slow counted exhales together? I need something very small and concrete to stay here.

Therapist: *exhale* one *exhale* one

Patient: one... one.

That anchored me for a split second, then that internal "you should be better" voice slammed back in and my chest tightened and thoughts scattered. I'm kind of wiped—can we do two slow counted exhales together? Just say "two" with me on each out-breath.

Therapist: *exhale* two *exhale* two

Patient: two... two.

That loosened things a fraction, then that old shame voice—"you should be better"—snapped my chest tight and my attention splintered into to‑do lists. I'm... low on bandwidth and it's hard to stay here; can we do one very small thing next, like one slow counted exhale together—say "one" on the out-breath?

Therapist: *exhale* one

Patient: One.

That actually calmed me for a beat, then that old "you should be better" voice slammed back in and tightened my chest — I'm kind of exhausted; can we do one more tiny counted exhale together, just say "two" with me?

Therapist: *exhale* two

Patient: two...

That opened a little space, then the "you should be better" voice slammed back and my chest tightened. I'm pretty wiped—can we do one tiny thing together: one slow counted exhale, say "one" on the out-breath? I need something micro and concrete to hold onto.

Therapist: *exhale* one

Patient: One.

That actually eased it for a beat, then the "you should be better" voice slammed back and my chest tightened again — I feel kind of flattened. Can we do one more tiny anchor together, like say "one" on the next slow out‑breath?

Therapist: *exhale*

Patient: One.

That eased for a beat, then that old "you should be better" voice crashed back in and my chest clenched — I feel kind of flattened and my mind's skittering to lists instead of staying here. Can we do one more tiny anchor together, another slow exhale where we both say "one" on the out‑breath?
