Patient: I've been worrying a lot about the business — losing clients and the instability lately has left me on edge a lot. I catch myself intellectualizing my feelings, turning them into plans or analyses instead of actually feeling them, because that seems safer, I guess. I don't know, it's awkward to say out loud.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using your mind to cope with the uncertainty, which can feel like a temporary escape. What would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed yourself to feel the edge or unease without trying to analyze or intellectualize it?

Patient: I don't know — when I actually try to sit with it there's this tightness in my chest and my head starts listing all the worst-case scenarios, and then I shut it down by planning or analyzing. I guess I'd just feel overwhelmed and kind of useless, like I'm not doing anything to fix things, and that scares me with the business hanging over me. Sorry, it's really hard for me to stay with that.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios can be really painful to confront. Can you imagine, for a moment, that the tightness in your chest wasn't just about the business, but was instead a signal that your body is simply feeling scared – a completely normal response to uncertainty?

Patient: I guess that makes sense — part of me can see it as my body being scared, but another part worries that calling it "just fear" is me dodging real problems with the business. I don't know, when I try to sit with the tightness my chest gets worse and my brain immediately flips into listing fixes and worst-case scenarios and then I shut it down. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of overwhelmed and keep wanting to jump to solutions instead of staying with it.

Therapist: Let's slow down together. What if, instead of jumping to solutions, we simply observed the sensation of your chest tightness, and the thoughts that come up, without judgment or trying to fix them? Would that allow you to feel more connected to what's happening in this moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try, but it's really hard. When I try to observe the tightness my brain immediately starts listing fixes and worst-case scenarios and it feels like I'll get stuck in it, so can we go really slowly? I'm already feeling kind of pinned and want to jump away.

Therapist: It can feel like your brain is trying to pull you back in, can't it? Let's pause with that thought for a moment: what would happen if, right now, you simply let go of the need to fix or escape? What if you allowed the feeling of being stuck, with all the thoughts and worries, to simply be present, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — if I actually sit with it the tightness gets louder and my head fills with worst-case scenarios until I feel frozen, and then I start rushing into plans to make it go away. I guess I'm scared that if I don't do something I'll look useless and the business will collapse, so avoiding it feels safer. Can we slow down? Maybe help me name one small thing I can notice right now without fixing it.

Therapist: Let's focus on a tiny, tiny thing. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground right now, without trying to change it or fix anything. Just acknowledge that your feet are touching the floor, and that's it. No thoughts, no worries, no plans. Can you stay with that simple observation for a very short while?

Patient: Okay, I can try. I guess my feet feel kind of planted—a bit of pressure under the heels and a slight warmth, which feels weird to pay attention to. My mind's already sliding into a to-do list and I'm getting antsy; can we stay with this for a bit? I don't know, it's uncomfortable to sit with.

Therapist: It's okay that your mind is slipping away – that's a natural response to discomfort. Let's acknowledge that feeling, too. Instead of pushing against it, what if, for just a moment, you made room for the weirdness of your feet feeling weird? Can you imagine, without judgment, that this sensation is simply present, and that's enough?

Patient: I don't know — I'm trying, and when I focus on my feet it softens the panic a little, but my chest is still loud and my brain's already lining up fixes. I guess it helps a bit to know the feeling can just be there, but it's really uncomfortable and I keep wanting to run away. Can we stay slow? Maybe help me name one more tiny thing to notice besides my feet.

Therapist: It's interesting that the feeling of discomfort doesn't seem to disappear, but your ability to observe it does. Let's try another tiny thing. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body right now, without trying to control it or change it. Can you feel the sensation of your breath moving in and out?

Patient: I don't know — I can try. I notice the inhale feels a little cool and the exhale warmer, and it's kinda shallow, but my chest's still tight and my head's already making lists. Can we keep it really slow? I'm starting to feel pinned and want to jump to solutions.

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to wander – that's a normal part of the process. Let's try to stay with the sensation of the breath, even if your mind starts to drift. What if, instead of trying to control the breath or fix your chest, you simply allowed it to be as it is, with all its weirdness and discomfort? Can you imagine that for just a moment?

Patient: I guess I can try, but I don't know — when I pay attention to my breath this shame sort of wells up and my chest tightens and then my head starts replaying all the things I messed up and I feel like I should be fixing it. Can we keep it super slow and pick one tiny, non-fixing thing to notice next? I'm starting to feel pinned and want to jump away.

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to use your shame as a reason to fix everything. Can we slow down even further? Let's notice the sensation of your sitting in this space, without trying to change it or fix anything. Just the sensation of sitting. Can you feel the sensation of your body on the chair, or the floor, or the air around you?

Patient: I can feel the chair—my back against it, the weight on my sit-bones, a little heat where it presses. But when I notice that, shame kind of spikes and my chest tightens and my head starts replaying all the stuff I screwed up and wants to leap into fixes. I don't know—can we slow down? Maybe help me name one tiny, non-fixing thing to notice next.

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to use the shame as a reason to jump into action. Let's take it one tiny step back. Can you notice the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or fix anything? Not the shame, not the thoughts, not the feelings. Just the sensation of the breath moving in and out. Can you stay with that for just a moment?

Patient: I don't know — I can try to stay with the breath for a moment, but as I focus the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying all the stuff I screwed up, so I get this urgent need to fix it. Can we slow down? Maybe help me name one tiny, non-fixing thing to notice next, because I'm starting to feel pinned and want to jump away.

Therapist: Let's take another tiny step back. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to change it or fix anything? Not the shame, not the thoughts, not the feelings. Just the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you stay with that for just a tiny bit?

Patient: I guess I can—my feet feel grounded, heels pressed and a bit warm—but as soon as I notice it the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying everything I messed up, and then I want to leap into fixes. I don't know, can we keep it really slow? Maybe point out one more tiny, non-fixing thing to notice.

Therapist: Let's slow down to a tiny, tiny step. Can you notice the sensation of the air around you, just on the skin of your face, without trying to change it or fix anything? Not the shame, not the thoughts, not the feelings. Just the sensation of the air.

Patient: I can feel the air—cool on my cheeks and a faint tickle near my nose, I guess. But as soon as I notice it the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying everything I messed up, so I get this urge to leap into fixes. I don't know—can we keep it really slow? Maybe point out one more tiny, non-fixing thing to notice because I'm starting to feel pinned.

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. Can you notice the sensation of your mouth, just sitting there, without trying to change it or fix anything? Not the shame, not the thoughts, not the feelings. Just the sensation of your mouth, as it is, in this moment.

Patient: My mouth feels kind of heavy—lips a bit parted and slightly dry. When I pay attention the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying all the stuff I messed up so I want to jump into fixes. I don't know, I guess noticing it helps a little but it's getting hard to keep focusing—can we stay really slow?

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to wander – it's normal. Let's acknowledge that it's hard to stay with the slow pace, and that's okay. Would you be willing to take just one tiny step forward, even if it feels like a small one? Let's pause for a moment before we move forward.

Patient: Okay... I guess one tiny step. My chest feels like a tight band under my ribs. Saying that brings this shame up and my brain already wants to list fixes. I don't know—can we just stay with the tightness for a minute? Keep it really slow.

Therapist: Let's stay with the tightness in your chest, just as it is. No trying to fix it, no trying to change it, no trying to get rid of it. Just the sensation of the tightness, in this moment. Can you simply acknowledge it, without judgment?

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice it. The tight band under my ribs gets louder and shame spikes and my head immediately starts listing fixes and all the things I screwed up, and I don't know—I feel pinned and kind of numb. Can we stay with it really slow for a bit?

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to feel numb or like you're pinned – that's a natural response to feeling overwhelmed. Can you, just for a moment, acknowledge the overwhelm, without trying to change it or fix it? No judgment, no trying to push away, just a simple acknowledgment of the feeling.

Patient: Okay... I guess I'm overwhelmed. There's this heavy tightness under my ribs and a hot shame that makes me feel stupid and like I messed up, and my brain immediately wants to start fixing things. I don't know—can we just stay here slowly for a bit and maybe point out one tiny thing I can notice while I hold this?

Therapist: Let's find something tiny to notice while you hold this feeling of overwhelm. Can you notice the sensation of your left hand on the armrest, or the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Just notice that sensation, without trying to change it or fix anything. Hold it for just a second, and then we can come back to it.

Patient: I don't know... my left hand on the armrest feels heavy, a little warm where it rests, fingers loose against the fabric. Shame spikes when I notice it and my chest tightens and my head starts replaying everything I messed up, so can we just stay really slow with this for a bit? Maybe point out one more tiny thing to notice after this—something simple.

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to wander – let's pause. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils right now? Just the sensation of the air, without trying to change it or fix anything. Hold it for just a second.

Patient: I can feel it—cool on the inhale, warmer on the exhale, a faint tickle just inside my nostrils. Shame spikes when I pay attention, my chest tightens and my head starts listing fixes. I don't know—can we keep this really slow? Maybe point out one more tiny thing to notice.

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. Can you notice the sensation of the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth right now? Just the sensation of the tongue, without trying to change it or fix anything.

Patient: It's kind of resting there—a little dry, a faint pressure on the roof. As soon as I notice it the shame spikes and my chest tightens and my brain starts listing fixes—I don't know, it's getting hard to keep focusing; can we stay really slow?

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to wander – let's pause. Can you simply acknowledge the fact that you're trying to notice the sensation of your tongue, without judgment or trying to fix it? That in itself is an act of kindness and courage. Allow yourself to be with that, even if it feels hard.

Patient: Okay... I notice I'm actually trying to pay attention to my tongue, and that feels kind of small and weird. Shame still spikes and my chest tightens and my head wants to start fixing things. I don't know—can we keep it really slow? Maybe name one more tiny, non-fixing thing to notice.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that trying to pay attention feels small and weird. Can you notice the sensation of your fingers on the armrest, without trying to change it or fix anything? Just the sensation of your fingers, as they rest on the armrest.

Patient: My fingers feel kind of warm and a little numb, fingertips resting against the fabric. As soon as I notice, shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying mistakes and lining up fixes so I want to bolt. I don't know—can we stay really slow? Maybe point out one more tiny, non-fixing thing to notice.

Therapist: It's okay if your mind starts to wander – let's pause. Can you simply acknowledge the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or fix anything? Just the sensation of the breath, as it is.

Patient: Okay... I notice the breath — it's shallow, a little cool on the inhale and warmer on the exhale. As soon as I focus the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts lining up fixes, so I get this urge to bolt. I don't know, can we keep it really slow and maybe name one tiny thing to notice next?

Therapist: Let's stay with the breath, and I'd like you to notice the sensation of your face, without trying to change it or fix anything. Just the sensation of your face, as it is. Notice the sensation of your skin, the shape of your face, the sensation of your eyes on the wall.

Patient: My face feels kind of tight — jaw a bit clenched, cheeks warm, eyes a bit dry when I look at the wall. As soon as I notice that shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts replaying mistakes so I want to bolt and start fixing things. I don't know, it's getting heavy to keep doing this — can we stay really slow and pick one tiny thing to notice next?

Therapist: It's okay if it feels heavy – let's acknowledge that. Can you notice the sensation of your body sitting in this space, without trying to change it or fix anything? Just the sensation of being in this body, as it is, in this moment. Notice the sensation of your body on the chair, the sensation of the air around you.

Patient: I can feel my weight sinking into the chair, my back pressed against it, my shoulders a bit tight and this dull ache across my lower back. As soon as I notice it the shame spikes, my chest tightens, and my head starts lining up fixes so I want to bolt. I don't know—can we stay really slow and maybe name one tiny, breath-related thing to notice next?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you notice the sensation of your breath entering your nostrils, just as it's entering? Notice the sensation of the air entering your body, without trying to change it or fix anything.

Patient: I can try. The air feels cool at the tip of my nose on the in-breath, a little warmer on the out — but as soon as I notice the shame spikes, my chest clamps down and my head starts listing fixes, so I feel kind of pinned. I don't know... can we do one really slow inhale and exhale together and just name them—"in," "out"—so I don't bolt?
