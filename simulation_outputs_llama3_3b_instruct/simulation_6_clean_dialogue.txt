Patient: I'm a construction guy in my mid-fifties, and since the move I've been having a real hard time with my temper—snapping at people and getting angry over small stuff. I’ve had PTSD for a while and all the change seems to make it worse. I don't know, I guess I just don't like talking about this, but it's been on my mind.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what triggers your anger when you snap at people or get upset over small things? What's the first thing that comes to mind when you feel yourself getting angry?

Patient: Usually it's little things — someone moves a box I labeled, or tells me a way to do something I already planned. First thing I notice is my jaw and fists clench, my heart starts pounding, and I get this rush like I need to set it straight. I don't know, I guess it feels like I'm losing control and that pisses me off. I don't really like going into this stuff.

Therapist: It sounds like when you feel like you're losing control, it feels really threatening. What would be one thing that would help you feel more grounded and in control in those moments, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I don't know, I guess if I had to pick one thing it'd be stepping away for a minute—get out of the room or into the yard and take a few slow breaths while I count to ten. It kinda resets me enough so I don't blow up.

Therapist: Stepping away and taking a few deep breaths seems to help you regain control, but do you think that approach also means you're avoiding dealing with whatever was causing the anger in the first place? What would happen if, instead of leaving the situation, you tried to address the issue that's triggering your anger while still taking a few deep breaths to calm down?

Patient: I don't know, I guess if I stayed I'd try to keep it short—take a breath, say something calm like, "Hey, that’s labeled, can you leave it?" But I'm afraid it'll turn into an argument or they’ll push back and I’ll lose it. Walking away feels safer, even if it means I'm dodging the real issue.

Therapist: It sounds like staying to address the issue is scary for you, and it's not just about avoiding an argument, but also about feeling safe and protected. What is it about feeling safe that's so important to you, and is there a value or part of yourself that's being threatened if you don't leave the situation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess feeling safe means not getting exposed or put on the spot — like my work, my stuff, and my way of doing things are respected. If I don't leave it feels like they're taking that away, like I'm weak or somebody's questioning my competence, and that rubs me wrong. I'm not great at digging into this stuff, it makes me uncomfortable, but that's kind of what I feel.

Therapist: It sounds like your sense of safety is tied up in not being seen as vulnerable or questioning. Can you imagine a moment where you're vulnerable, like when you're in a difficult situation, but you're not reacting like you do when you feel threatened, like taking a moment to pause, breathe, and think before responding?

Patient: I guess I can picture it. Like last week when a guy moved my ladder and I felt that heat, I stepped back, counted to ten, took a couple deep breaths, and said, "Hey, that's labeled—can you leave it?" It helped that time, but I don't know, it's tough to keep it together when I'm already wound up.

Therapist: It's great that you were able to stay calm in that moment, but it sounds like it's still a struggle for you to do so in everyday situations. What would it mean to you to be willing to take a moment to pause and breathe, even when you're already feeling angry or frustrated, rather than trying to keep up a calm exterior?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it would mean I'm not faking calm just to keep the peace — like I'm actually handling it instead of pretending. It scares me a bit because I'm worried folks will see me as weak or step on me, but maybe it would cut down on the big angry blowups and the crap I feel after.

Therapist: Being authentic and taking a moment to breathe, even when it's hard, might actually be a way to show respect to yourself and others by being honest and direct, rather than trying to maintain a facade. What would it mean to you to be able to show up in a situation with honesty and vulnerability, even if it means being perceived as imperfect or different?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I'm not putting on a front all the time — that I'm actually fixing stuff instead of pretending everything's fine. It freaks me out 'cause I worry folks'll step on me or think I'm soft, but maybe it'd mean less shame and fewer nights replaying it in my head. I'm getting uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's slow down and take a step back. When you catch yourself replaying a situation in your head and feeling shame or regret, what's the first thing that shows up for you? Can you simply acknowledge it as a thought, without judgment, and say to yourself, "That's just a thought, I'm not my thoughts"?

Patient: When I replay it, the first thing is that voice saying, "You're an idiot" or "You blew it," and my chest tightens and I feel sick. I can, I don't know, I guess try saying to myself, "That's just a thought," but it usually just bounces off and I still feel like crap. I'm getting uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's slow down further. What's one thing that you value about yourself, something that makes you feel proud or confident, and how can you try to connect with that in the midst of replaying a difficult thought?

Patient: I guess one thing I value is being reliable — I show up, finish the job, and take care of things. When I'm replaying stuff, I can try saying something simple like, "I did what I could today," or run through one quick win I had so it drowns out that mean voice. Maybe even touch my ring or my toolbox and take a few breaths to ground myself. I don't know, I guess that might help, but I'm getting kinda uncomfortable—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and bring our attention to your physical body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the sensation of your hands touching the surface you're sitting on. When you're ready, can you try to stay with this sensation for just one more minute, without trying to think or do anything else?

Patient: Okay — I take a breath. My feet feel solid on the floor, like the concrete at the site, the air's cooler going in and warmer going out, and my hands feel rough against the chair. I can stay with that for a bit, but I don't know, my chest is tightening and it's getting uncomfortable. Can we slow down? Maybe tell me a quick, practical thing I can do on site when it hits.

Therapist: Let's take a quick look at your toolbox. What's one small, tangible thing you can do in that moment to remind yourself of your competence and reliability? Maybe it's taking a deep breath, putting on your hard hat, or making a quick phone call to confirm a task. What's one small action that you can take that feels connected to your values and makes you feel more grounded?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the easiest thing is to put my hand on my toolbox or my ring, step back a few feet, and take three slow, steady breaths. Saying to myself, "I did what I could," while I do it reminds me I'm reliable and helps stop the heat from rising. I'm getting kind of uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a look at your toolbox again. Can you imagine yourself taking a few deep breaths, putting your hand on the toolbox, and stepping back a few feet, even when you're not feeling overwhelmed or anxious? What would it mean to you to do this action on a daily basis, even when you're not feeling triggered?

Patient: I don't know, I guess doing it every day would make it feel normal — like building a habit so I reach for the toolbox instead of snapping. Maybe it'd mean I'm actually looking out for myself instead of just grinding through. I'm getting uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it takes courage to slow down and take care of yourself, especially in a profession where you might feel like you need to be "on" all the time. What would it mean to you to prioritize your own well-being and make self-care a non-negotiable part of your daily routine?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it'd mean I stop wearing myself out so quick and I can keep doing the job without snapping at people. It'd be about treating my head and body like they matter — fewer nights replaying stuff, less tension on site, and maybe not feeling like I'm always on edge. I'm getting uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to celebrate the small steps you've already taken today. What's one tiny thing you can commit to doing tomorrow to take care of yourself, just a small step towards prioritizing your well-being? Maybe it's drinking a glass of water before your shift, or taking a quick break to stretch. Can you agree to do one tiny thing that feels manageable and connected to your values?

Patient: I guess I can do that — I'll drink a glass of water before my shift and, if I feel heat coming up, I'll step back, put my hand on my toolbox, and take three slow breaths. I'm getting kinda uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to start making small changes towards taking care of yourself. I'm proud of you for committing to drinking water and taking a few deep breaths when you feel overwhelmed. That's a start, and it's a step towards creating a more compassionate and reliable version of yourself.

Patient: I don't know, I guess thanks, but praise makes me uneasy — feels a bit like I'm being put on the spot. Can you give me a short, practical line I can use on site when someone's pushing me and I can't step away, something I can say that won't start a fight? I'm getting uncomfortable—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's focus on your breath for a moment. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I can handle this." Repeat it to yourself silently, and then when you're ready, use it as a word that can help you pause and respond to a difficult situation, like, "Excuse me, I need a moment."

Patient: I can try that — "Excuse me, I need a moment" feels doable. I don't know, I guess it sounds a bit soft for the crew; on site I'd probably end up saying, "That's mine, don't touch it," in a steady voice instead of yelling. I'm getting uncomfortable going deeper—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a look at your toolbox again. When you say "That's mine, don't touch it," what's the underlying value that's driving that statement? Is it about feeling respected, being in control, or protecting your property?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it's mostly about respect — like them messing with my stuff feels like they're questioning me or not taking my work seriously. It also feels like keeping control over my space and stuff, and when that's threatened my chest tightens and I get jumpy. I'm kind of on edge and distracted right now—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Notice your chest and shoulders relaxing as you exhale. As you inhale, imagine fresh air filling your lungs, and as you exhale, imagine any tension or worry leaving your body. When you're ready, we can take a moment to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: Okay. I take a breath. My shoulders drop a little but my chest's still tight and breaths feel shallow. I don't know, I guess I can stay with it a minute, but I'm on edge and it's hard to focus—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's acknowledge that your chest is still feeling tight, and that's okay. It's a signal that you're still feeling a bit anxious. What would it mean to you to allow yourself to feel that tightness, even if it's uncomfortable, and to recognize that it's a natural response to a difficult situation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess letting the tightness be would mean I'm not fighting myself all the time — maybe it would take some of the heat out so I don't snap. It feels weird and kinda heavy to sit with though, and I'm worn out—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to offer yourself some kindness. Notice your chest, and say to yourself, "I can feel this tightness, and that's okay. I'm doing the best I can in this moment." Can you repeat that to yourself, gently and with kindness?

Patient: Okay... I can try. "I can feel this tightness, and that's okay. I'm doing the best I can in this moment." I don't know, I guess saying it helps a little, but my chest's still tight and my head's already jumping to stuff I gotta finish—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving into your body. As you exhale, notice the sensation of any tension or discomfort leaving your body. Take one more breath, and when you're ready, I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: Okay... I take a breath. My feet feel solid, but my chest's still tight and breaths are shallow, and my head's already jumping to things I gotta finish. I don't know, I guess I can try to stay with it, but it's hard—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's acknowledge that you've done your best, and that's enough for this moment. You've taken a few deep breaths, noticed your feet, and acknowledged your chest tension. What would it mean to you to let go of the need to finish everything right now, and simply allow yourself to be where you are?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I don't have to fix everything this minute — that it's okay to let stuff sit and not beat myself up. But my chest's tight and my head's already on the list of things I gotta finish, so it's hard to actually let go — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's look at the task list. What's one thing on the list that's truly urgent and needs your attention right now? Can you commit to focusing on just that one thing for the next 5-10 minutes, without worrying about everything else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the urgent thing is getting the site locked down — tie down that ladder and call the foreman to confirm the delivery. I can try to focus on that for the next 10 minutes, but my chest's tight and I'm kinda jittery — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. As you focus on getting the site locked down, notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the task at hand, without judgment. Remember, your goal is to get the site locked down, and every focused moment brings you closer to that goal.

Patient: Okay... I'll focus on locking the site down. I'll tie the ladder and call the foreman now. My chest's still tight and I'm pretty jumpy — I don't know, I guess I can try to stay on it for ten minutes. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: As you work on locking down the site, notice how you're doing, and give yourself a sense of pride and accomplishment for taking care of this task. Remember, being able to stay calm and focused on a task is a valuable skill that shows you're reliable and competent. Can you remind yourself of that sense of pride and confidence as you tie down the ladder and make that call to the foreman?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I keep telling myself, "I do my job, I'm reliable," while I tie the ladder and call the foreman. It helps a little—gives me a small, dull bit of pride—but my chest's tight and my head's already bouncing around so it's hard to keep it steady. Can we slow down a bit?
