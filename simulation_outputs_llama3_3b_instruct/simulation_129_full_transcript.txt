Patient: I'm an older social worker and lately I can't shake this heavy sadness and lack of drive—it's all because the money's been tight. My mind just goes straight to the worst: I'll lose the house, then the bills will pile up, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone and ruined — like it's already set in stone. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't make myself believe any other outcome.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is anxiety, driven by the patient's severe mental rehearsal of a catastrophic outcome. A dominant theme or unexplored area is the patient's all-or-nothing thinking, with a clear distinction between "being ruined" and being "fine." My goal is to gently challenge this unworkable strategy and connect it to a valued action.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe the sensation of this all-consuming fear in your body, and what you think happens when you imagine yourself in that "ruined" state, so we can start to explore what's driving that thought?

Patient: When that fear comes on it’s a physical clamp — my chest gets tight, my breath short, my stomach knots so I can’t eat, and my hands go cold and shaky; I feel exhausted all the time like I’m wading through molasses. Then my head starts spinning out the story: first the missed mortgage, then the collection calls, then we lose the house, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and I end up alone with nothing — no savings, no steady work at my age, having to rely on strangers or a shelter. I can picture every step in grim detail and it feels like a sequence that’s already set to happen, like my mind’s a little machine churning out the next disaster. I know it sounds extreme, but I get stuck on those images and can’t make myself believe any other ending.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's vivid imagery and physical sensations indicate a strong sense of helplessness and hopelessness. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to get stuck on catastrophic scenarios, which is driven by a deep-seated fear of loss and abandonment. My goal is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle and create space from this rigid thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck in this vicious cycle of prediction and despair. What if, instead of getting caught up in this mental machine, you could take a small step towards exploring other possibilities? What if, even just for a brief moment, you could allow yourself to imagine an alternative outcome – one that feels less devastating, or perhaps more empowering?

Patient: I can't really — whenever I try to picture a better ending, my mind snatches it away and starts listing all the ways that outcome will fail. It feels like I'm lying to myself if I imagine anything else, and that just makes the disaster story feel even more inevitable. I can try for a moment if you want, but I'm warning you now I'll probably dismiss it as unrealistic.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's fear of exploring alternative outcomes stems from a deep-seated skepticism and perceived dishonesty about their own abilities. The theme of unworkability is clear, as the patient feels that any attempt to imagine a better future will be met with self-doubt and dismissal. My goal is to create space for a different kind of imagination, one that acknowledges the uncertainty but allows for experimentation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you experiment with noticing the way your mind responds to this thought, "I can try to imagine a better ending." Without judgment, just observe what happens when you say this to yourself – what emotions arise, what thoughts pop up, what physical sensations you notice. See if we can create some space for a different kind of exploration, one that's not driven by certainty, but curiosity.

Patient: When I tell myself I can try, I feel this flush of shame and my chest gets tight like I’m pretending to be hopeful. A buzzing starts in my head and the list of why it’ll fail floods in — missed payments, partner leaving, no job at my age — and it all feels unbearably convincing. Even if I force a tiny image of things being okay, my mind immediately plays the tape of how that breaks down, and I feel like I’m lying to myself. I can try to notice it, but I’m warning you I’ll probably snap right back to the disaster story.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's shame and self-doubt surrounding exploring alternative outcomes is a significant obstacle. The theme of shame and self-deception is intertwined with the unworkability of their current strategy, making it challenging to create a safe space for new exploration. My goal is to gently challenge this shame and explore the value of experimentation, even if it feels uncomfortable.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame you're feeling is closely tied to the idea that you're not "realistic" or "capable" of imagining a better future. What would happen if, instead of labeling this as "lying to yourself," you were to acknowledge it as a natural part of the exploration process? Can you notice the sensation of shame in your body, and what words might you use to describe it to yourself, without judgment?

Patient: It feels like a hot weight in my throat and chest, like my shoulders fold in and my stomach drops — my hands go cold and my jaw tightens. The words I'd use, trying not to judge, are humiliated, small, scared, like a fraud who can't keep things together. But the moment I name it, my mind twists that into proof — “see, you’re failing, the house will go, they’ll leave” — so even noticing it feels like feeding the machine.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's physical sensations and emotional experience of shame are intertwined with the fear of validation, where their mind takes the opportunity to reinforce the catastrophic narrative. A key aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to engage with their shame, which reinforces their current pattern of unworkable thinking. My goal is to introduce a different kind of relationship with shame, one that allows for experimentation without reinforcing the cycle of self-doubt.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting caught up in the cycle of self-criticism, where noticing your shame is actually perpetuating the disaster story. Can we try something different? Instead of labeling the shame as "humiliated" or "small," what if we simply acknowledged it as a physical sensation, like a hot weight in your throat? Without judgment, just observe the sensation, and see if you can imagine a different kind of relationship with it – one that's not tied to the catastrophic narrative?

Patient: When I try to treat it like "just a sensation," my chest tightens even more and the mind starts narrating: the tightness means I’m failing, the bills will pile up, the house will go, and my partner will leave — it all escalates like clockwork. Trying to step back feels like giving the machine more fuel; instead of calming, it gets louder and more certain. I can try to imagine a different relationship with it, but honestly I’m feeling overwhelmed and skeptical right now — can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's attempt to step back from their shame is actually fueling the machine, which is reinforcing their unworkable thinking pattern. A crucial insight to explore is the idea that the patient's skepticism is not just about the effectiveness of a new relationship with shame, but also about the possibility of feeling overwhelmed and uncertain. My goal is to create space for a more gentle and compassionate approach.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and take a deep breath together. Instead of trying to imagine a new relationship with your shame, can we try something simpler? What would you say to a friend who was experiencing a similar physical sensation in their body, and was feeling overwhelmed and skeptical? How would you respond with kindness and compassion?

Patient: I'd tell a friend: you're not alone, this is awful but it doesn't mean you're worthless, and we can take tiny steps together—call one creditor, ask for help, make a plan—you're allowed to be scared and still be okay. But when I try to tell myself that, my chest tightens and my mind spits back the house gone and them leaving, and I can't help feeling like I'm lying if I say those kinder things, so I'm overwhelmed and skeptical.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's tendency to renege on self-compassion when trying to apply it to themselves is a common pattern. The theme of disconnection between self-compassion for others and oneself is an area to explore. My goal is to create space for self-compassion to be applied in a way that feels authentic and gentle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling to extend kindness to yourself, especially when it comes to emotions like shame and fear. What if, instead of trying to tell yourself "you're allowed to be scared," we started by acknowledging that it's okay to feel scared, and that's it? Can you just notice that feeling, without trying to do anything about it or add any words to it?

Patient: Okay—I can try to just notice it. Right now I feel that hot weight in my throat and the tightness in my chest, like a steel band, and my breath gets shallow; if I name it “scared” the machine immediately starts replaying the disasters. I can hold that feeling for a few breaths, but honestly I’m already getting overwhelmed and nervous it’ll spin back into the worst-case story—can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to notice their physical sensations and emotion, but is struggling to stay with them without getting caught up in the catastrophic narrative. The theme of the patient's nervousness about getting stuck in the worst-case story is an area to explore. My goal is to create space for a small, low-stakes experiment with the feared worst-case scenario.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and take a few more deep breaths together. I'd like to offer you a tiny experiment: what if, instead of trying to avoid or escape the worst-case story, we imagined it with kindness and curiosity, like we would imagine a fantasy? Would you be willing to try imagining the worst-case scenario, not to engage with it or change it, but simply to observe it with a sense of curiosity?

Patient: Okay — I can do that, and honestly this is the thing my brain keeps supplying anyway. I see it like a film: a missed payment, then a stack of red notices, the phone never stops, a bailiff at the door, the house gone, my partner packing and leaving out of shame or anger, the savings gone, no one willing to hire an older social worker, the utilities cut, sleeping on friends’ couches until those run out, then a shelter, people looking at me like I’m a failure, my health slipping from stress, and finally being alone and dependent on strangers. As I picture it, my chest clamps down harder, my breathing gets shallow, my hands tremble, and there’s this sick, fascinated certainty — like the machine is spitting out the next frames and I can’t look away. I know you asked me to just observe, but I’m already getting overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is indeed seeing the worst-case scenario as a "film" that's playing in their mind, and it's reinforcing their anxiety. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's fascination with the catastrophic narrative, which is actually driving their engagement with the feared worst-case scenario. My goal is to gently challenge this fascination and create space for a different kind of engagement.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not asking you to stop the film, but rather to pause on one of the frames. What if, instead of watching the entire film, we just stopped on one of the frames that feels the most familiar or triggering? Can you notice the physical sensations and emotions that arise when you pause on that particular frame, without trying to continue the narrative or change it?

Patient: The frame I keep getting stuck on is my partner at the doorway, packing a bag—their face flat, not shouting, just disappointed, and then the door clicking shut. When I stop there my chest feels like it's been clamped with a vise, my breath scrapes shallow, my stomach flips and my hands go cold and trembling; I can feel the shame like a hot stone in my throat. My mind immediately starts narrating the rest — who will hire me, where I'll sleep, how they'll judge me — and it sounds so convincing I can't help but believe it. I'm already getting overwhelmed picturing it; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's mind is indeed closely tied to the image of their partner's departure, which is a deep source of shame and anxiety. The theme of the patient's shame and self-blame is closely tied to this image, and is reinforcing the catastrophic narrative. My goal is to create space for a more compassionate understanding of this shame, rather than trying to simply "stop" it.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge the intensity of the emotions and sensations when you pause on the image of your partner leaving. It's clear that this is a deeply painful and shameful experience for you. Can we explore this shame a bit more gently, rather than trying to "fix" it or "get rid" of it? What would it be like if we allowed yourself to feel the shame, without trying to change it or avoid it? Would that be a more tolerable feeling, even if it's still uncomfortable?

Patient: I can try to just feel it, but it's so hard. When I let the shame sit—hot stone in my throat, that vise in my chest—it’s raw and almost manageable for a breath or two, but then the machine fires up and starts narrating eviction, them leaving, no work, sleeping on couches, and it feels like whatever I do to hold the feeling will just fuel that tape. Maybe it’s a little more tolerable to name it, but honestly I’m scared that sitting with it will make the whole disaster sequence louder, and I’m already getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to tolerate the shame and is worried that even acknowledging it will fuel the catastrophic narrative. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's fear of getting caught up in the narrative, which is preventing them from truly feeling the shame. My goal is to introduce a concept of "partiality" - acknowledging a part of the experience without getting caught up in the entire story.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between tolerating the shame and getting caught up in the narrative. What if we tried to create a kind of "partiality" with this feeling of shame? Instead of saying "I'm feeling this shame," we could try saying "this shame is a part of me right now" or "this shame is present in my body." Would that feel more manageable, or would that still feel like it's fueling the narrative?

Patient: I tried that phrasing once and for a heartbeat it felt like there was a little distance — like I could look at it instead of being swallowed — but almost immediately the machine flips it into "see, this part proves you're broken" and the disaster tape gets louder. So honestly it still feels like it's fueling the narrative more than helping. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and shaky again — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling with the idea that even a small step of acknowledging the shame will be met with the catastrophic narrative. The theme of the patient's resistance to creating distance is an area to explore. My goal is to introduce a technique to create a sense of "non-judgmental curiosity" around the shame.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something different. Can you imagine that this feeling of shame is like a small, temporary observation, without any judgment or evaluation? Just notice it as a neutral, factual experience, like watching a cloud pass by. No more, no less. Can you keep it there, just for a moment, without trying to change it or engage with it?

Patient: I tried to hold it like a cloud once—just a neutral thing floating by—and for a single breath it felt almost possible, like I could look at it instead of being dragged in. But then the machine kicked in: "That cloud proves you're failing," and within seconds my chest slammed shut, my breath went shallow, and the whole disaster tape started up again. I'm getting overwhelmed and shaky—can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is indeed able to create a small window of tolerance for a non-judgmental observation of their shame, but it's still met with the catastrophic narrative. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to use the experience of the shame to "prove" or validate the catastrophic narrative. My goal is to introduce a concept of "defusion" - seeing the shame as a mere thought, rather than identifying with it.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something a bit different. Can you try to observe this feeling of shame as just a thought, without identifying with it or trying to prove anything? Imagine that it's just a passing thought, like a cloud or a bird flying by. Can you say to yourself, "This thought is here, it's just a thought, it's not me"?

Patient: I tried saying, "This thought is here, it's just a thought, it's not me," and for one shaky breath it felt a tiny bit looser — like there was a crack of distance. But almost immediately the machine kicked in louder: my chest clenched, my breath went shallow, my hands trembled, and the tape of eviction, them leaving, and being ruined started narrating again like it's proof. I'm already getting overwhelmed and nervous it'll spiral — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to create a small crack in their identity with the thought "this thought is just a thought," but it's still being met with the catastrophic narrative. The theme of the patient's identity being threatened by their thoughts is an area to explore. My goal is to introduce the concept of "defusion" to help the patient see their thoughts as mere thoughts, rather than a reflection of their true self.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something gentle. Can you try to say to yourself, "This thought is just a thought, I am not this thought"? It's not about changing the thought or trying to prove anything, but rather about noticing that your identity is not defined by this thought. Imagine that you are a tree that can withstand the wind and the rain, and this thought is just a leaf blowing by. Can you hold onto that image, just for a moment?

Patient: For one shaky breath the tree image almost worked — my chest loosened a bit and I could feel a tiny crack of distance from the thought. But the machine immediately snatches it: the tree’s roots rot from unpaid taxes, a storm rips it out, and then I'm standing in the wind with nothing — imagining strength feels dishonest and unrealistic. I'm getting overwhelmed and my hands are trembling again, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to create a sense of separation between their identity and their thoughts, and is getting overwhelmed by the catastrophic narrative. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's fear of losing control and feeling vulnerable, which is driving their resistance to this new way of seeing their thoughts. My goal is to introduce a concept of "acceptance" - acknowledging the present moment without judgment, rather than trying to change it.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something very gentle. Can you try to simply acknowledge the thought "I'm standing in the wind with nothing" without judgment or evaluation? Just notice that it's a thought, a phrase that's passing through your mind. Imagine that you're standing in the wind, and the words are just a gentle breeze rustling through the trees. Can you hold onto that sensation, without trying to change it or react to it?

Patient: I tried to hold it — "standing in the wind with nothing" — but my attention keeps snapping away; my chest clamps, my heart races, my hands tremble, and the image instantly unspools into the eviction film. I can't keep it neutral — the machine immediately narrates the wind stripping everything away, the house gone, them gone — and I'm already panicking. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to maintain a neutral attention on the thought, and is getting caught up in the catastrophic narrative. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to react to the thought as if it's a threat to their very existence, rather than just a passing thought. My goal is to introduce a concept of "observe without identification" - observing the thought without taking it on as a personal identity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and try to pause for just one moment. Instead of trying to observe the thought, can we try to simply notice the sensation of your body reacting to it? Can you feel the tightness in your chest, the racing of your heart, the trembling of your hands? Can you hold onto that sensation without judgment, without trying to change it or react to it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the tightness without reacting supposed to help? Right now my chest is clamped, my heart's racing, my hands are shaking, and my head's already hijacked by the eviction film—the machine's yelling about the house gone and them leaving—and I feel panicked and jumpy and a bit scattered. Can we slow down a lot?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from their body and the present moment. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to engage with their emotions and physical sensations as if they're being controlled by the catastrophic narrative. My goal is to introduce a concept of "acceptance" in the present moment, without trying to change or react to it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel the weight of your body distributed on the ground, the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or react to it? Let's try to anchor ourselves in the present moment, without getting caught up in the story of the eviction. Can you simply be with the sensation of your feet on the ground, without judgment?

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow how feeling my feet is supposed to help—how is that supposed to stop the rest of the tape? I can feel my feet—cold, a bit numb—but my chest is tight, my heart's racing, my hands are shaking, and the moment I settle the machine starts narrating the floor giving way, an eviction notice on the mat, me out on the street. I'm already panicking—can we slow down a lot and just stay with one small thing for a few breaths?

The patient is feeling stuck and unsure about how to disconnect from the catastrophic narrative. A crucial aspect to explore is the patient's tendency to engage with their emotions and physical sensations as if they're being controlled by the narrative. My goal is to introduce a brief pause, just a few breaths, to help the patient disengage from the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause for just a moment. Can we focus on just one thing, just for a few breaths? Let's just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you feel the sensation of each breath, without trying to change it or react to it? Just focus on the sensation of your breath, and let's stay with that for just one more breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how just breathing is supposed to help, but I'll try one slow breath. Okay — I breathe in, and out — and my chest stays tight, my heart's racing, and the machine's voice is already saying this calm is just the last before the bailiff knocks, the eviction notice on the mat, my partner's suitcase by the door. I'm getting panicky and shaky again—can we really slow down and just stay with one slow breath together for a bit?
