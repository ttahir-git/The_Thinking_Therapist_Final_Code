Patient: I've been feeling flat and unmotivated ever since I started this demanding program at work — it's like a heaviness I can't shake, and it's starting to mess with my relationship. My PTSD's flared up again with the new demands, and nothing I've tried so far has helped much. I'm skeptical this will do anything, but here we are.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what the heaviness feels like in your body and mind when you're at work? Is it a physical sensation, a mental rumination, or an emotional tone that's present when you're trying to focus on tasks?

Patient: Physically it’s like a weight on my chest and my shoulders — my energy just drains so everything feels slow and heavy. Mentally there’s this fog and the same loop of “I can’t do this” and old memories bubbling up; emotionally it’s mostly flat sadness with sudden spikes of irritability or panic when deadlines hit. I’m telling you this, but honestly — how is describing it supposed to help me actually get through the day?

Therapist: I understand your skepticism, but I'm not looking for a quick fix or a way to "get through the day" without addressing the underlying issues. Instead, I'd like to explore whether there's a sense of what you value most in your life that's being threatened by this feeling of overwhelm. What's one thing that, when you feel this heavy, is important to you, like a source of meaning, connection, or personal growth?

Patient: When this heaviness hits, what's most important to me is keeping my relationship with my partner intact — being reliable and emotionally present for them. Also doing meaningful work and actually helping clients matters a lot, but right now I feel like I'm failing at both. Okay, but how is naming those values supposed to help when I've already tried to hold onto them and still end up exhausted and snapping? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: I sense that you're feeling stuck in a cycle of burnout and feeling like you're failing. Instead of trying to force more willpower, what if we explored a different approach? What would it mean to you to take care of yourself and your relationships in a way that feels sustainable and nourishing, even when the heaviness hits?

Patient: I guess sustainable care would look like clear, enforced boundaries at work so I’m not constantly on the hook, and a simpler routine that doesn’t demand so much decision-making when I’m drained. Nourishing would be honest check-ins with my partner instead of pretending I’m fine, and pockets of real rest that aren’t framed as productivity. But I’ve tried boundaries and tiny self-care before and it didn’t stick — how is that supposed to help now? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: I'm not suggesting that these actions won't help, but rather that they might be a way to make small, incremental changes that could help you feel more grounded. What if, instead of trying to force these changes, we explored what's really at stake for you when you don't establish these boundaries and prioritize rest? What would happen to your relationship, your sense of self, and your overall well-being if you were to let go of the expectation that you need to be "on" all the time?

Patient: I think my partner might breathe a little easier if I stopped pretending I’m fine, but I’m afraid they’d end up carrying more and then resent me. Letting go could blunt the shame and constant self-judgment, but it also threatens the part of me that defines myself by competence—I don’t know who I am if I’m not always performing. It might actually help my anxiety and sleep, but I’ve tried pulling back before and it turned into guilt and more chaos at work—how is that supposed to help me keep my job and my relationships long-term?

Therapist: I understand the fear of being perceived as incompetent, but what if the idea of competence was more nuanced than just performing well? What if it was about being present, showing up, and being willing to ask for help, even when you're struggling? Would that change the way you perceive yourself and your relationships?

Patient: Maybe — on paper that sounds kinder, and I can see how asking for help could be part of competence. But I've tried reframing before and nothing really changed; asking for help at work just felt like handing people more stuff to judge me on or getting stuck with the extra load. How would I actually practice “showing up” like that without risking my job or making my partner resent me — and how is that supposed to help me right now when I'm already stretched thin?

Therapist: Let's start with a tiny experiment: what if, in a low-stakes situation, you simply acknowledge to your partner that you're feeling overwhelmed, without feeling like you need to have all the answers? You could say something like, "Hey, I'm feeling really drained today and I'm not sure how I'm going to make it through the day. Can we figure it out together?" What would happen if you took that small risk and just shared your vulnerability with your partner?

Patient: I get the idea, but I’ve tried saying things like that before and it either got brushed off or my partner ended up doing more and then resenting me. How is that supposed to help here? If we’re actually going to try it, I’d want a concrete script and a plan for if they react badly — can we role-play that so it doesn’t just become another vague exercise?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll play the role of your partner, and you can practice sharing your vulnerability. We can start with a scenario that feels familiar to you. When I respond, I'll try to react in a way that might be similar to what you've experienced in the past. Are you ready to try this?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it, but only if you do it like they actually do: brush me off, get annoyed, and maybe offer to take over then get resentful. Start as my partner with a simple, "How are you?" and after each of my lines pause so we can unpack what happened and what I'd do next. And be honest — no sugarcoating or gentle therapist voice; push back like a real annoyed partner so this isn't just another useless exercise.

Therapist: "Hey, how are you?" (pause) Okay, go ahead and respond as you would. I'll respond as your partner might, and we'll work through it together.

(Note: I'll do my best to respond in a way that's consistent with a potentially annoyed or dismissive partner. Let's get started.)

Patient: I'm not doing well — this new program's flattened me and I'm exhausted, irritable, and not the partner I want to be. I don't expect you to fix it, but I need you to know I'm struggling and to maybe help with small practical things right now. I don't know if saying this will change anything, but I'm trying to be honest.

Therapist: Partner: (sighing) "Look, I know you're struggling, but can you not just say that all the time? It's like you're always on edge, and it's exhausting to deal with. I don't know if you're just not cut out for this job or if there's something more going on, but I'm already doing too much to help you. Can you just figure it out on your own for once?"

(pause) Your turn.

Patient: I hear you — that sounds really tired and fed up, and I get why you'd snap. I'm not asking you to be my therapist or carry everything, but I do need something concrete and temporary: could you handle dinner and dishes twice this week and let me have Sunday morning to sleep without interruptions? If that's too much, tell me what you actually can do instead — I'm scared of being a burden and of losing my job, and honestly, how is me saying this supposed to help if all it does is add to your load?

Therapist: Partner: (irritated) "Dinner and dishes? That's it? You think I'm made of nothing? You're still not getting the message, are you? I'm already doing more than my fair share, and you're expecting me to take on even more? And Sunday morning? Forget it. I need that time for myself too, not just to sleep, but to recharge. You're not listening to me. You're just expecting me to solve all your problems again. It's like you think I'm your personal backup plan or something. You need to get a grip, not dump everything on me."

(pause)

Patient: I hear you — you're fed up, and that stings because it echoes a bunch of old failures I keep replaying, which makes me feel ashamed and like I'm asking too much. I'm not trying to dump everything on you or make you my safety net, but if Sunday morning's off the table can we at least agree on one concrete swap — you take dinner and dishes Wednesday, I'll take breakfasts Saturday and handle the laundry — something fair and time-limited so it doesn't feel indefinite. And be honest with me: how is this small ask supposed to help us long-term, because I'm worried I'm just adding more resentment and making my job insecurity worse.

Therapist: Partner: (hesitant) "I...I don't know, okay? I just feel like I'm always the one giving in to your requests, and it's like you're not even trying to do your part. But... (pausing, taking a deep breath) Fine. One swap. Wednesday dinner, okay? But don't think this means you get off scot-free. And don't expect me to keep doing more than that, got it? (firmly) And as for how it's supposed to help...I don't know. Maybe it's just a way to make me feel like you're trying to make some compromises. (skeptical) But it's not like I'm going to start doing all the household chores or anything. You're still going to have to figure out your own stuff."

(pause) Your turn.

Patient: Okay — Wednesday dinners is a start. Let’s make it concrete: we try it for two weeks and have a ten-minute check‑in Sunday night to see if it’s helping or making you resentful, and if so we tweak it. I’m feeling really anxious and my brain’s racing, so tell me plainly what you’d need from me in return so I’m not inventing worst‑case scenarios. And seriously — how is this supposed to reduce the shame I carry and actually help me at work, because that’s the part I can’t see being fixed by swapping chores.

Therapist: Partner: (sighs) "Okay, two weeks it is. Ten minutes a week sounds reasonable, I guess. And yeah, I'd need you to commit to not overdoing it and not expecting me to bail you out all the time. If it's not working, we'll re-evaluate. But (firmly) don't expect me to be all smiles and rainbows just because you're doing a few small favors. That's not how it works.

As for the shame, (pauses, looking away) I don't know if this will fix it completely, but...it's a start, I guess. You've been carrying this around for so long, and it's not just about you. It's about us, our relationship, our life together. If you're not taking care of yourself, you're not going to be able to take care of me, or us. (looks back at you) And at work...I don't know, maybe it's not just about the shame. Maybe it's about feeling like you're not good enough, like you're not doing enough. But what if that's not true? What if you're doing enough, and it's just not good enough for you? (shrugs) I don't know. All I know is that we need to work on this together."

Patient: Okay — two weeks and the check‑in sounds like a start, but hearing you make that bargain makes me shrink back; it drags up this old shame and I already feel like I'm failing again. My chest's tight and my head's racing, so I need more than chore swaps — I need concrete scripts for work (what to say when I can't keep up) and a backup plan so asking for help doesn't just mean extra work for everyone. I've tried boundaries and scripts before and they didn't stick — how is this actually going to be different, and can we map out exact language and steps for the job side right now?

Therapist: Let's break down what you can say and do when you're feeling overwhelmed at work. We can create a script for when you need to ask for help or slow down. For example, you could say, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. I'm not sure if I can meet the deadline. Can we discuss possible alternatives or adjust the priorities?" What if, instead of just asking for help, you ask for "buy-in" from your manager, rather than just a temporary solution?

Patient: "Buy-in" sounds fine on paper, but I've asked for that before and it just turned into more meetings and everyone dumping work on me. How is that supposed to help when my manager nods and then the pile grows? My chest's tight and my head's already racing — give me exact lines to say that shift priorities without sounding like I'm incompetent, and a concrete fallback if they push back (like what to document or who to loop in). I need something I can actually use in the moment, not another vague strategy.

Therapist: Let's create a script for when you need to adjust priorities. You can say: "I'm concerned that we're taking on too much and I want to make sure we're delivering the best possible work. Can we prioritize the most critical tasks and focus on those first?" If your manager pushes back, you can say: "I understand the urgency, but I'm worried that we're risking quality by trying to do too much. Can we break down the tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and get buy-in from the team on the top priorities?" What if you document your concerns and proposed solutions, so you have a paper trail and a clear plan to fall back on? Would that help you feel more confident in the moment?

Patient: Maybe — documenting could help, but I’m worried it just becomes another thing people use to judge me. How is that supposed to help with the immediate panic when a deadline’s on top of me? My chest’s tight and my head’s already racing, so I need something I can actually read and say in the moment.

Give me a short, usable template I can send or say. Something like:

- Quick email subject: “Request to Reprioritize — [Project]”
- Body (short): “Hi [Name], I’m currently balancing [A], [B], [C]. I’m concerned we can’t deliver all of these well by [date]. Can we meet for 15 minutes to confirm the top priorities? My recommendation: 1) [Critical task] — focus, 2) [Lower priority] — delay, 3) [Delegateable task] — reassign. Please confirm which items you want me to prioritize so I can adjust my plan. Thanks, [You].”

And a 1–2 line real-time script if they press you: “I hear the urgency, but I’m worried quality will suffer if we keep all of these. Which one of these three should I deprioritize so I can focus on what matters most?”

Fallback steps if they push back:
- Send an immediate follow-up email summarizing the convo and your recommended priorities so there’s a record.
- Ask for a short written decision or confirmation (so it’s not just verbal pressure).
- If workload still isn’t adjusted, loop in your lead/manager’s manager with the documented plan and request direction on reassigning or extending deadlines.
- Start a weekly one-paragraph status update to the team to create a clear paper trail of capacity and progress.

That feels practical, but I’m still skeptical — I’ve tried emails and it turned into more meetings. My shame’s flaring and I’m anxious right now; can we role‑play the manager pushing back so I can practice the exact lines and the follow-up email right now?

Therapist: Let's role-play the scenario. I'll play the role of your manager, and we'll go through the conversation. Remember, the goal is to stay calm, assertive, and focused on finding a solution. You're already prepared with the script and follow-up steps. Go ahead and start by sending the email with the subject and body text, and we'll see how it plays out.

Patient: All right — I'm doing it, though my chest's tight and my head's already racing. I feel a bit ashamed doing this, like I'm setting myself up to be judged, but here goes.

Subject: Request to Reprioritize — [Project Name]

Hi [Manager Name],

I'm currently balancing [A], [B], and [C]. I'm concerned we can't deliver all of these well by [date]. Could we meet for 15 minutes to confirm the top priorities? My recommendation:
1) [Critical task] — focus
2) [Lower priority] — delay
3) [Delegable task] — reassign

Please confirm which items you want me to prioritize so I can adjust my plan and timelines.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]

If they press back in the moment, I'll say: "I hear the urgency, but I'm worried quality will suffer if we keep all of these. Which one of these three should I deprioritize so I can focus on what matters most?"

I sent it. Okay — push back like a manager who doubts me; let’s role‑play that.

Therapist: Manager: (skeptical) "Hold up, [Your Name]. I'm not sure I agree with your priorities. [Critical task] is a critical part of this project, and we can't delay it. And [Delegable task] is something that can be handled by someone else. I think we should focus on [Lower priority] first and then tackle [Critical task] afterwards. You're not thinking big enough, [Your Name]."

(pauses, looking critical)

Manager: "What makes you think you can prioritize effectively when you're already struggling to keep up with the current workload? We can't afford to have you overcommitting and burning out. You need to step up your game, not slow down."

(pauses again, waiting for your response)

Your turn.

Patient: I hear you — I get that [Critical task] is non‑negotiable. I'm worried quality will suffer if we try to do all three at once, so I need one concrete instruction from you: which of the other two should I deprioritize or reassign so I can focus on delivering the thing that matters most? I can't guess at that without getting it wrong.

If you don't have time to decide right now, I'll send a quick follow‑up email summarizing the three options and ask you to confirm which to deprioritize by end of day. If I don't get a decision, I'll pause on the lowest‑impact item and loop in [Team Lead] for direction so we don't quietly let quality slip.  

Honestly, this tight spot makes my chest clamp up and I feel that old shame of failing all over again — I need that clear call from you, not more vague pressure. How do you want me to proceed?

Therapist: Manager: (sighs, slightly softened) "Alright, alright. I understand your concerns. I think [Lower priority] is the one we should focus on first. It's not ideal, but it's the least critical of the three. I want you to prioritize that and get it done as soon as possible. Can you confirm that and let me know when you have an update on the status?"

(pauses, looks at you with a hint of concern) "And [Your Name], I want to remind you that I'm not just concerned about the project's success, but also about your well-being. We need to find a way to make this work for you, not against you. You're a valuable member of this team, and I don't want to see you burn out."

(pauses again, seems to consider) "You know, I think it's a good idea for you to send that follow-up email to confirm the priorities and get my official okay. That way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and keep everyone on the same page."

Manager: (smiling slightly) "And hey, let's not forget that we're not just talking about this in isolation. We'll make sure to keep you supported and check in regularly to ensure you're not overwhelmed."

(pauses, looks at you with a hint of empathy) "You're not alone in this, [Your Name]. We're in this together."

Patient: Okay — hearing him say he'll confirm and offer support is a slight relief, but my chest’s tight and that old shame is washing over me like I already screwed this up. I need concrete stuff I can use right now, not pep talks.

Can you help me with a short follow-up email I can actually send immediately — something like one or two lines that documents the agreed priority and asks for written confirmation? And give me a 1–2 line in‑person/pause script I can say when my chest clamps and my head starts racing so I don't fumble: I've tried “I need a minute” before and it didn't help — how is this supposed to be different? Also, can we role‑play the reply from my manager confirming priorities and then do a quick role‑play of the Sunday 10‑minute check‑in with my partner (including a bad reaction) so I can practice staying calm and specific? I’m anxious and skeptical — don’t let this turn into another vague exercise.

Therapist: Follow-up email:
"Hi [Manager's Name], just to confirm, we've agreed to prioritize [Lower priority] first. Can you please confirm in writing by end of day so I can adjust my plan accordingly? Thanks, [Your Name]"

In-person/pause script:
"Hi [Manager's Name], I appreciate your understanding, but I need to take a moment to collect my thoughts. Can we reconvene in 10 minutes and review the revised priorities?"

Role-play with manager confirmation:
(I'll respond as your manager, confirming the priorities)

Manager: "Confirmed. We'll prioritize [Lower priority] first, and I'll send you an email with the detailed plan and timeline. Let's touch base in 10 minutes to review."

Role-play with partner:
(I'll respond as your partner, reacting negatively)

Partner: "Ugh, really? You're already getting defensive? I thought we agreed to focus on [Critical task] first. Now you're changing the priorities again? What's going on with you?"

Now it's your turn. Take a deep breath, stay calm, and respond with your prepared script: "I appreciate your concern, but I need to take a moment to collect my thoughts. Can we reconvene in 10 minutes and review the revised priorities?"

Patient: "I appreciate your concern, but I need to take a moment to collect my thoughts. Can we reconvene in 10 minutes and review the revised priorities?"

I need that time to jot down the three options and a one‑line recommendation so my head stops racing — otherwise my chest clamps up and I start replaying every past screw‑up. I'm skeptical this will actually calm me, but I'll try it. Okay, let's keep going: do the manager confirmation reply next, then run the two‑week check‑in role‑play with my partner (including a bad reaction) so I can practice staying specific and not apologizing away the plan.

Therapist: Manager Response:
"Alright, take your time. I'll wait for your email with the revised plan and timeline. We'll touch base in 10 minutes. Try to keep your priorities in order, [Your Name]."

(I'll respond as your partner, reacting negatively)

Partner: "Great, just what I needed. You're taking a 10-minute break to think about how to screw things up even more. Don't bother sending me an email, I just want to talk to you about this now. What's going on with you, [Your Name]? You're always finding ways to mess things up, and I'm starting to feel like I'm the only one who cares about getting this project done."

Now it's your turn. Remember to stay calm, specific, and assertive. Take a deep breath, and respond with your prepared statement.

(Note: Try to resist the urge to apologize or get defensive. Instead, focus on reiterating the agreed-upon priorities and your plan to deliver quality work.)

Patient: I appreciate your concern, but I need to take a moment to collect my thoughts. Can we reconvene in 10 minutes and review the revised priorities?

My chest is tight and my head's racing — I need that time to write down the three options and one clear recommendation so I don't start replaying old mistakes. I don't know if this will actually calm me, but I'll use the ten minutes and then send the follow‑up email and we can do the two‑week check‑in role‑play next.

Therapist: You handled the situation well, staying calm and assertive while also being clear and specific about your priorities. Remember that it's okay to take a moment to collect your thoughts and that it's not about being "foundering" or "losing control". The goal is to be present, focused, and assertive.

Next steps: You can use the follow-up email template and send it to your manager, and then schedule the two-week check-in with your partner. You can also take some time to reflect on what worked well and what didn't, and think about how to apply these skills in other situations.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the email and the two‑week check‑in, but I’m still anxious and skeptical — how is a swap and a ten‑minute check actually going to shift this shame I keep replaying? Can we do that two‑week check‑in role‑play now (give me the worst‑case negative reaction from my partner) and then write a one‑line script I can use if they lash out? Also, help me map a tiny weekly work monitoring plan (what one sentence to log each week) so this doesn’t just turn into more stuff for people to judge me on.

Therapist: Two-week check-in role-play:
(I'll respond as your partner, reacting negatively)

Partner: "You're just checking in to see if I'm still okay with the priorities we established two weeks ago? You're not even bothering to check in about your own progress or how you're feeling. This is just a superficial exercise to make yourself feel better, isn't it? You're not really interested in making any real changes or taking responsibility for your own actions."

One-line script:
"I understand that we're making progress, and I appreciate the efforts we're making. I'm committed to delivering quality work and maintaining our priorities."

Weekly work monitoring plan:
Here's a simple plan to help you stay on track:

* Monday: "Completed tasks: [list tasks completed], challenges: [list challenges faced]"
* Wednesday: "Checked in with [Manager's Name] on project status and discussed any concerns or adjustments needed"
* Friday: "Updated task list and prioritized for the upcoming week, considering [new tasks] and [ upcoming deadlines]"

This plan helps you focus on the present moment, track your progress, and stay accountable to your priorities. Remember to be kind to yourself and adjust the plan as needed.

Remember, this is not a magic solution, but a starting point to help you build more self-compassion and structure.

Patient: Okay — I can feel that old shame settling in already, my chest tight and my head racing, so forgive me if I'm blunt: I don't want more stuff that just becomes proof I failed. How is this actually going to chip away at that shame?

Give me one single-sentence weekly log I can actually do without overthinking. My vote: "This week I prioritized [top task], asked for help on [specific item], and outcome was [done / postponed / need direction]." Short, factual, no extras. Is that usable?

Also give me one-line wording I can say if my partner lashes out worst-case (no apologizing, no hemming): something like, "I hear you're angry — I want to talk, but I can't do this well right now; let's take 10 minutes and then have a focused check‑in." That okay?

Now let's role‑play the worst-case partner blowup you gave earlier — have them go full-on accusatory, and I'll practice that one line until it doesn't make me crumble. Do it now.

Therapist: Weekly log:
Yes, your suggested log is a great example of a simple and factual way to track your progress without overthinking. It focuses on the action, the outcome, and the result.

One-line wording for the worst-case partner blowup:
"I'm not going to tolerate your whining. I need you to stop making excuses and take responsibility for your own actions."

Role-play:
(I'll respond as your partner, reacting full-on accusatorily)

Partner: "You're always so flaky and unreliable! You can't even follow through on your own promises, and now you're expecting me to bail you out again? You're not even trying, are you? You're just taking up space and making me look bad!"

Now it's your turn. Remember to stay calm, assertive, and focused on the conversation. Take a deep breath, and respond with the one-line script:

"I hear you're angry — I want to talk, but I can't do this well right now; let's take 10 minutes and then have a focused check-in."

Repeat this line until you feel more comfortable with it.

Patient: "I hear you're angry — I want to talk, but I can't do this well right now; let's take 10 minutes and then have a focused check‑in."

Okay — I said it. My chest's tight, my mouth's dry, and that old voice in my head's already saying I'm pathetic for needing a pause. Saying the line didn't make the shame vanish; it just gave me ten minutes to stew. How is that supposed to help when the yelling keeps coming?

Do it again but this time have them interrupt or refuse — I need to practice what to say if they snap, "No, we can't wait." And give me a one-line follow-up for that moment that doesn't sound like an apology but still sets the boundary. Let's keep going.

Therapist: Role-play:
(I'll respond as your partner, interrupting and refusing)

Partner: "No, we can't wait! I don't have time for this! You're always making excuses and finding ways to procrastinate. We need to get back to work, not waste more time."

Now it's your turn. Remember to stay calm and assertive. You've already practiced saying "I hear you're angry — I want to talk, but I can't do this well right now; let's take 10 minutes and then have a focused check-in." Now, respond to the interruption:

"I understand you're upset, but I need to take a moment to collect myself. Can we find a way to take a break that works for both of us?"

One-line follow-up for the interruption:
"I'm not going to engage in a conversation that's going to escalate the situation. Can we agree to take a break and reconvene when we're both calm?"

This line sets a boundary and refocuses the conversation on finding a solution,

Patient: Alright — I'll try saying that line, but honestly it already feels like a band‑aid on the same old wound. Saying, "I'm not going to engage in a conversation that's going to escalate the situation. Can we agree to take a break and reconvene when we're both calm?" gives me a little space, but my shame's still loud.

If they refuse or keep attacking, is this one okay to use next? — "If you keep yelling I can't listen right now; we'll talk at [specific time]." Now push back like you did before: refuse the break and keep going full‑on accusatory so I can practice the follow‑up and not crumble.
