Patient: My mind's a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I'm obsessing about how I'll perform in any future job — I picture bombing the interview, getting hired, immediately screwing up, getting fired, and then never being able to find work again. It paralyses me into procrastinating because starting anything feels like signing up for that chain of doom.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's different about starting something new versus imagining this chain of disasters? What is it about starting a job search or other new opportunities that makes you think it's equivalent to those worst-case scenarios?

Patient: Starting feels like the moment I flip the switch that makes the disaster movie start playing for real — in my head, I can already see the interview going badly, somehow getting hired anyway, then immediately screwing up, getting fired, missing rent, and everything collapsing. Imagining it is "safe" because it's just thoughts, but actually starting feels like I'm signing the ticket to that whole chain. When someone says it could go well, I just can't buy it — that feels like denial, not a realistic outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of irreconcilable opposites between starting and having a successful outcome. Would it be possible to explore what's holding you back from considering the possibility of having a positive outcome, even if it's just a small chance?

Patient: I can't accept a positive outcome because hope feels like a setup — if I let myself believe it, the fall will be worse when the disaster I predict actually happens. Little mistakes in the past got blown up in my head into proof that the whole chain will follow, so imagining doom somehow feels more honest and safer. Telling me there's a small chance just sounds like sugarcoating; I can't buy it, it feels like denial.

Therapist: It seems like your thoughts about hope and disaster are stuck in a pattern. Can you observe those thoughts as thoughts, like "My mind is trying to predict doom" or "I'm holding onto a story about being unprepared"? What would it be like to create some space between those thoughts, just for a moment, without immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I can't really create space — the moment I try to step back I start narrating the disaster in more detail. Observing it feels like I'm rehearsing the worst-case, like I'm giving it oxygen and making it more real. I know that's probably not logical, but it also feels inevitable, and then I freeze and procrastinate. Honestly, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed trying to do this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in a loop where you try to break free, but the narrative is getting louder. Can we try something simpler? Instead of observing your thoughts, I'd like you to focus on your physical sensations in this moment – where do you feel the anxiety or overwhelm in your body?

Patient: Mostly in my chest — a heavy tightness — and a knot in my stomach. My hands get tingly, I breathe shallow, my throat feels tight, and as soon as that starts I swear it's proof the whole disaster movie is rolling and I shut down. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed just saying this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are a strong indicator that you're on the verge of shutting down. Would it be possible to take a tiny step back from the thought of disaster and focus on the sensation in your chest? Instead of trying to name the thought or analyze it, let's see if we can simply allow the sensation to be what it is – the physical feeling of being overwhelmed?

Patient: Okay, I'll try, but it's hard — when I focus on my chest it feels like a heavy brick pressing down, my breaths get tiny and fast, and my throat clamps up. The second I notice it my brain starts narrating the whole disaster timeline again, which just makes the pressure worse. I'm getting really overwhelmed doing this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like your body is already trying to respond to the anxiety, and now you're amplifying it with awareness. Let's try something gentle and small. Would you be willing to pause for just one breath, and then take one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth, without trying to change or analyze anything?

Patient: Okay — I did one slow breath in and out, and it kind of softened the brick in my chest a notch and my breaths slowed a little. But even as I breathed, my brain started scripting the next disaster: what if I choke when I speak in the interview, they notice I'm nervous, I fumble an answer, and that confirms I'm a failure — so I can't seem to settle. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed again; can we slow down?

Therapist: It seems like your brain is already responding to the relaxed body with more catastrophic thinking. Let's try something even simpler. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or analyze it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without adding any thoughts or stories to it.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying — I can feel the air cool in my nostrils and my chest rising and falling for a moment. But the second I notice it my brain flips to the disaster channel: my voice trembling in an interview, blanking on answers, them judging me, getting hired anyway then screwing up and getting fired and losing everything. It tightens my breath up again and I can't keep the focus — I'm getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is having trouble staying with the simple sensation of the breath. Let's try a tiny experiment. As you notice your thoughts about disaster starting to come in, can you allow them to pass through your mind without judgment, like a cloud passing across the sky? Don't try to grab onto them or change them, just observe them as they come and go.

Patient: I try, but the moment a thought pops up it grabs me and turns into the whole movie — like I'll stumble over a question, they'll hire me out of pity, I'll screw up a task the first week, get fired, miss rent, and everything collapses. Letting it "pass" feels impossible; the details just glue themselves to me and my chest tightens and I freeze. I'm getting really overwhelmed doing this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're losing the battle with your thoughts. Let's take a break from trying to change or control them. Instead, can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice the weight and feeling of your feet, without trying to think or analyze anything.

Patient: I tried — I could feel the weight of my feet and the floor, and for a second the chest eased a little. But then my brain immediately raced: I trip walking into the interview, everyone laughs, they think I'm incompetent, they hire me out of pity and I still mess up and lose everything. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep my attention there.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to maintain focus, and the thoughts are getting the better of you. Let's try a tiny, tiny step. Instead of trying to control your attention, can you simply acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed, and then let it be okay that you can't control your thoughts right now? No judgment, no trying to change anything. Just acknowledge the feeling, and then pause.

Patient: Okay — I'm really overwhelmed right now, my chest's tight and I can't stop my brain from scripting the whole disaster. I'm trying to let it be okay that I can't control the thoughts, but the minute I do that my mind says "great, you admitted it, now the collapse is inevitable" — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trapped in this cycle. I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to not have control over your thoughts right now. What would it be like if, instead of trying to control your thoughts, you simply allowed yourself to exist with them, without judgment or trying to change them? No pressure, no expectations. Just existing with them, like a cloud passing through your mind.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to just exist with the thoughts, but my stupid fortune-telling machine immediately turns that into proof the disaster will happen — admitting it feels like signing the ticket. Letting them "be" doesn't calm them; it just makes the whole collapse feel more inevitable. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're being pulled into the narrative again. Can we try something even smaller? Instead of trying to exist with the thoughts, can you simply notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to think or label anything? No judgment, no trying to change anything. Just the sensation of the breath.

Patient: I tried to notice the breath — for a second it felt cool in my nose and my chest eased — but as soon as I focused my mind started the disaster script: choking on a word in the interview, everyone judging me, hired out of pity and then screwing up and losing everything. It's tightening up again and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It seems like you're getting stuck in a loop. Let's try to shift the frame of reference. Instead of thinking about what's going to happen in the future (the disaster scenario), can you consider what's happening right now, in this moment? What do you see, hear, and feel in your body right now, without trying to think about what might happen later?

Patient: Okay — right now I see the chair I'm sitting in, the window with dull light, and my phone sitting face-up on the table; I hear your voice and distant traffic. In my body there's that heavy brick in my chest, a tight knot in my stomach, my breath's shallow, and my hands feel tingly. The second I name those things my brain yanks me back into the disaster script — I can't seem to stay with the moment. I'm getting really overwhelmed doing this; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're getting pulled back into the thoughts again. Can we try something even smaller? Instead of noticing the sensations, can you simply say them out loud, without trying to think about them or label them as "my brain" or "disaster thoughts"? Just say the words, "I have a heavy brick in my chest," or "I feel a knot in my stomach."

Patient: I have a heavy brick in my chest. I feel a knot in my stomach. My hands are tingly, my breaths are shallow, and my throat's tight — it's getting hard to keep going, can we slow down?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your physical sensations. I want to invite you to notice one more thing. What would it be like if, instead of focusing on the sensations themselves, you simply allowed yourself to be in this space of awareness, without trying to change anything? Not even try to relax, or avoid the sensations, just be present with what is, exactly as it is.

Patient: I try to just be with it, but as soon as I settle the fortune-telling machine kicks in and starts playing the collapse scene — my chest tightens, my breathing shortens, and everything feels heavier. It's wearing me out and I'm getting really overwhelmed doing this, can we slow down?

Therapist: It's exhausting to keep going, and I'm here to support you. Let's take a deep breath together, and when you're ready, I'll ask you to do one more tiny thing. When you feel the thoughts starting to come in, instead of trying to push them away or focus on them, can you simply let them drift by like clouds in the sky, without trying to grasp or engage with them?

Patient: I tried that, but the second a thought floats by it grabs me and unfolds into the whole collapse — tripping over words in an interview, hired out of pity, screwing up, getting fired, losing everything. It's really draining me to keep fighting it like this, and I can't make the cloud trick work right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to give you a break. It's okay to take a step back and acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed. Instead of trying to continue, I'd like to offer you a pause. Let's take a break from this exercise for now, and come back to it when you feel more grounded. We can also explore other strategies that might be more helpful for you in the meantime.

Patient: I... I can't really take a break — pausing feels like admitting defeat and then the disaster script just gets louder. I'm worn out and it's hard to keep going, but I don't want to stop; can we slow down and try something even smaller, like one tiny, concrete step I could attempt tomorrow that doesn't feel like signing up for the whole collapse?

Therapist: I understand that pausing feels like a defeat to you. Let's try something small and concrete instead. What is one tiny, everyday task that you could do tomorrow that feels manageable and doesn't feel like a threat to your survival? Something small, like making a cup of coffee or taking a short walk. What would it take for you to feel like you could attempt that task without the disaster script taking over?

Patient: Maybe making a cup of tea — it's tiny. To even try it I'd have to break it into micro-steps (stand up, fill kettle, set a 5‑minute timer) and give myself permission to stop after the kettle clicks, but even picturing that my brain says I'll spill it, burn myself, look ridiculous, and that this tiny thing will somehow prove the whole collapse is real. I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it — can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to consider doing something as small as making a cup of tea. Can you tell me what's underlying your desire to do something small like that? What is it about making a cup of tea that feels important to you, even if your brain is trying to sabotage it?

Patient: Maybe because it's something ordinary and tiny — a little proof I can finish a thing without it detonating into doom. But of course my fortune-telling machine immediately edits that into: I’ll spill it, look clumsy, that proves I’m incompetent, and the collapse starts anyway. I'm kind of wiped out just saying that — can we figure out an even smaller, less risky first step I could try?

Therapist: I think I understand what's going on. You're using making a cup of tea as a way to test your limits, to see if you can handle it without the worst-case scenario playing out. Can we try something even smaller than that? What about simply getting out of your chair and taking one tiny step towards the kitchen? Not to make a cup of tea, but just to get up and move towards the kitchen. What would it take for you to take that one small step?

Patient: Maybe I could do it if it stayed super tiny — like plant my feet on the floor, count to three, stand up one step toward the kitchen, and set a 30‑second timer that lets me come right back if it feels wrong. But my brain already scripts me tripping on that one step, everyone thinking I'm clumsy, and that one step becoming the first domino in the collapse — I'm kind of wiped out just thinking about it, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck. Let's try to focus on the small win of simply getting out of your chair and standing up. Can you take that one small step, even if you don't plan to go all the way to the kitchen? Just get up and stand up, without thinking about the rest of the task. Take one deep breath, and when you're ready, we can try the next tiny step.

Patient: Okay...I push up from the chair slowly and my legs are wobbling. My chest tightens as soon as I move and my brain's already filming me tripping on that one step, everyone laughing, and that being the start of the collapse. I'm pretty drained and it's getting hard to keep going—can we slow down?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to take that step. I want to acknowledge that your brain is still trying to sabotage it, but let's not give it the energy. Can we focus on the physical sensation of your body right now, without trying to think about the thoughts or the outcome? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the feeling of your legs wobbling, and the sensation of your chest tightness. Just observe it, without judgment or trying to change it.

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor, my legs are wobbling, and my chest is still tight. The second I notice it my brain starts the movie — me collapsing on that step, everyone laughing, and that proving the whole collapse — and it's just wearing me out. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're running on empty. Let's take a pause and come back to this when you feel more grounded. We can take a break and revisit this exercise when you're feeling more centered. Before we go, can I just say that I'm proud of you for taking that small step, even if it was a tiny one?

Patient: Hearing that makes my head jump to, "Great — now they'll notice I'm pretending and when I mess up later the collapse will be worse" — praise feels like a setup. I don't want to stop; pausing feels like admitting defeat, and I'm worn out so it takes effort to keep talking, but can we slow down and do one tiny thing — two slow breaths together, then a 30‑second sit-back where I just stay in the chair and breathe? If that sounds okay, I'll try; I'm not ready to end this yet.

Therapist: I think that sounds like a great idea. Let's take two slow breaths together, and then I'll guide you into a 30-second sit-back. We'll just sit in the chair together, and I'll support you in being present with your breath. No expectations, no goals, no trying to achieve anything. Just two slow breaths, and then we'll take it from there.

Patient: Okay. I take a slow breath in through my nose and let it out through my mouth. I do it again, then lean back in the chair, hands on my lap, and try to sit with my breath for thirty seconds — it eases the brick a touch but the fortune-telling voice is already whispering that they'll notice I'm faking it and that'll be the start of the collapse. I'm pretty worn out — can we slow down and just stay here a bit longer?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel worn out. Let's stay right here, in this moment, with your breath. No need to rush or push yourself. We can just be with the sensation of your breath, without trying to think about the thoughts or the outcome. Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or trying to change it.

Patient: Okay...I'm breathing with you — it eases the brick a tiny bit, my chest loosens a notch. But the fortune-teller's already whispering the collapse: I'll tremble in the interview, get hired out of pity, mess up, and everything falls apart. I'm wiped; can we stay here quietly for a bit longer and keep it slow?
