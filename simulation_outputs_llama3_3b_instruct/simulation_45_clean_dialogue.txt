Patient: I've been feeling totally burned out from construction and I've been drinking and using stuff at a mild-to-moderate level to numb it, which I know is stupid but I can't stop. My head's like a fortune-telling machine that only spits out disasters — I can already see it: one mistake at work, then getting fired, losing my place, my few friends leaving, and me totally screwed — so I'm stuck replaying that nonstop. I feel ashamed and alone, and whenever someone suggests other outcomes I just think that's unrealistic, so I reach for a drink to shut it up.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it's like when you start thinking about the worst-case scenarios? What's the first thought that comes to mind when you think about the potential disasters you're worried about?

Patient: The first thing that pops in my head is me screwing up something on site — like dropping a beam or missing a cut — and someone getting hurt because of me. Then it immediately turns into this chain: I'm sued or fired, can't pay rent, my few friends bail because I'm a mess, and I'm homeless and ruined — it's like a movie that keeps replaying and I can't stop it. I know it sounds over the top and maybe not rational, but when that loop starts I get so wired and ashamed I just drink to make it shut up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trapped in this nightmare scenario. Can you imagine, for a moment, that you're willing to try a different approach to deal with the anxiety and shame that comes with it? What would it be like to take a small step towards facing your fears, rather than avoiding them with substances?

Patient: Maybe a small step would be trying to delay using — like waiting an extra hour after work and doing something else, or calling one of the few people I trust, or just breathing through it. But my brain immediately hijacks that idea: if I wait I’ll be so on edge I’ll mess up a job, someone will get hurt, I’ll be blamed and fired, and then everything collapses — so it feels pointless. I want it to work, but I’m stuck thinking disaster is the only realistic outcome, so I usually just drink to shut that machine up.

Therapist: So it sounds like your mind is really good at predicting disasters, even when you're trying to do something positive. Can you try to give your thoughts a little more space, without judgment? Instead of thinking "I'll mess up," what if you simply acknowledged it as a thought, without judgment? You could say to yourself, "That's a thought, it's happening now, and it's okay."

Patient: I tried saying that once — for a split second it quieted the noise, but then the machine just kicks back in with the next scene: someone hurt, me blamed, fired, out on the street — like the phrase doesn't matter. It makes me feel hopeless and kind of stupid, and I end up reaching for a beer to make it stop. I want it to help, but honestly my brain's disaster-movie always wins, and that leaves me pissed off and stuck.

Therapist: I can see that you feel really stuck and hopeless, and it's hard to find ways to make it stop. What's one thing that you value more than feeling numb or avoiding this emotional pain? Is there something that feels important to you, something that you'd be willing to fight for?

Patient: I guess I care about being reliable — not screwing over the crew, paying rent, and keeping my place so I don't end up a burden on my folks. But the second I think about doing anything other than numbing, the fortune-teller brain screams that it'll backfire: I'll be so on edge I'll mess up at work, get canned, and then all that I care about is gone — so it feels pointless to try. I'm mad at myself for feeling that way and stuck, like I want to fight for it but my head already decided I'm doomed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of responsibility to be reliable and take care of yourself and others. Can you try to imagine, for a moment, that it's okay to not be perfect? What if, instead of trying to avoid the possibility of messing up, you were to focus on doing your best, and learning from any mistakes that happen?

Patient: I want that to be true — I want to do my best and learn — but the minute I try, the machine fires off the worst chain: one slip, someone hurt, I'm blamed and canned, can't pay rent, and I'm homeless. So trying to accept "not perfect" feels like I'm deliberately stepping into that trap, and it makes me trapped and furious, and I just drink to shut it up. I don't know how to actually keep the "do your best" thought in my head without my brain hijacking it and turning it into a disaster movie.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really stuck and frustrated. Can you imagine, for a moment, that it's okay to try something new – like taking a small step towards doing your best, without expecting to be perfect? What would it be like to take a tiny step towards that, even if your brain is already predicting disaster?

Patient: Maybe I could try waiting an extra hour after work before I drink — go for a short walk, call one of the few people I trust, or just sit and breathe until the urge passes. But the second I do that, the fortune-teller kicks in: I’ll be so on edge I’ll mess something up on site, someone’ll notice I’m off, I’ll get blamed and fired, lose my place — so it feels pointless and I usually cave. I want to try, though; I’m just stuck, pissed off, and I don’t know how to not give up when that disaster story starts.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try some small steps towards changing your behavior, but your brain is still hijacking those efforts with worst-case scenarios. Can you try to focus on the fact that you're taking the first step, even if it feels small – like taking a few deep breaths or calling a friend? What would it be like to take that first step, without expecting the worst?

Patient: I can try to take that first step — say a few deep breaths or call my buddy — but as soon as I do the fortune-teller kicks in harder: the breath barely helps and then I’m picturing myself messing up the next day because I “didn’t deal with it properly,” or my friend thinking I’m a mess and cutting me off. I want to try it, I really do, but I keep thinking it’s pointless and then I reach for a drink; how do I keep that disaster-movie from taking over when I’m literally trying to do the right thing?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're constantly trying to shut down the disaster movie in your head, but it keeps coming back. Can you try to see your thoughts as a temporary experience, like a storm that will pass? Can you take a moment to acknowledge your breath, your body, and your desire to take care of yourself, without judging or labeling those thoughts as "true" or "false"?

Patient: I try that — I’ll take deep breaths and notice my chest or whatever — but it feels like putting a wet blanket on a grease fire. For a second it calms down, then the fortune-teller starts louder: someone gets hurt, I get blamed and fired, I lose everything — it doesn’t feel temporary to me, it feels like a countdown. It makes me furious and ashamed, and I usually end up drinking just to shut that thing up because I can’t stand living inside that movie.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trapped in this cycle of catastrophic thinking. Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, right now? What's the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Can you allow yourself to be with that sensation, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I try, but as soon as I focus on my feet it feels like they're glued to the ground — heavy, like I'm carrying the whole job on me — and my breath is shallow, my chest tight, stomach all knotted. For a second the air on my skin calms me, then the fortune-teller kicks in: heart starts racing, hands shake, and I’m picturing the worst again so loud I can’t stay with the breath. I get pissed off and ashamed and the urge to drink spikes — how do I keep that machine from hijacking me when I’m literally trying to be present?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're trying to control your thoughts with your mind, but it's like trying to stop a runaway train. Can you try to see your thoughts as a separate entity from your actual experience? What if you allowed yourself to be with the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or control it?

Patient: I try to do that — sit with my breath and treat the thoughts like a separate thing — but the fortune-teller just keeps running the worst movie: someone gets hurt, I'm blamed and fired, and I'm on the street. For a few breaths it calms a bit, then the panic spikes, I get furious and ashamed, and the urge to drink feels unbearable. I want it to help, but it feels pointless, and honestly when that machine won't shut up I don't know what else to do.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're running out of options and feeling hopeless. Can I offer you something? Can you try to treat yourself with kindness and understanding, even if the thoughts are still there? What if you allowed yourself to feel the discomfort of those thoughts, without trying to escape or control them?

Patient: I try to be kinder to myself, I really do, but the fortune-teller just twists it — when I tell myself "it's okay" it answers back, "you're weak, you'll slack off, you'll mess up and everything collapses." So trying to be kind ends up feeling like I'm lying to myself or giving in, which just makes me angrier and reaches for a drink. Can you give me something concrete to say or do in that moment that doesn't feel like pretending or setting me up to fail?

Therapist: I'd like to offer you a small, concrete action you can take in the moment. When you feel the self-criticism kicking in, I want you to take a pause and say to yourself, "I am exactly as I am, in this moment." That's it. Just say those words to yourself, without judgment or expectation. Can you try that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's saying "I am exactly as I am" supposed to help? I feel like if I say that, my fortune-teller just fires back, "you're weak, you'll slack off, you'll mess up and lose everything," and then it feels like lying to myself and I get angrier and reach for a drink. If you want me to try it, tell me exactly what to do in the moment — say it out loud? Repeat it three times? Do something with my hands? Vague stuff doesn't work for me.

Therapist: I'll give you a more concrete suggestion. When you feel the self-criticism kicking in, I want you to take a deep breath in, and then say out loud, "I am here." Just say those two words, "I am here." No judgment, no expectation, just those two words. Try it.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it now. (Takes a breath) I am here.

For a beat it kind of quieted the noise, then the fortune-teller immediately screamed the next scene — someone hurt, I get blamed and fired, I’m on the street — and my heart jumped and I wanted a drink. I’m not sure how that’s supposed to help long-term — do I say it out loud, whisper, or just think it? How many times? And what do I do if I’m on site and the movie gets louder—do I keep repeating it until it stops or is there something else I should do with my body or hands?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try the exercise. In the moment when the catastrophic thinking kicks in, I want you to take a small, committed action that aligns with your values. What's one small, specific thing you can do, right now, that would move you closer to being reliable, paying rent, and keeping your place? For example, could it be as simple as sending a text to a friend, or taking a few more deep breaths, or doing a small physical task like stretching your arms overhead? Can you identify something like that for yourself?

Patient: Okay—I'll try to be concrete: I can log into my bank app right now and transfer, say, $100 into a “rent” spot and set a calendar reminder so I don't forget. But my brain's already screaming that if I pull out my phone on break I'll be distracted, mess up a cut, get fired, lose everything—so it feels pointless and my hands are shaking just thinking about it. I can try to do it, but I don't know how to keep that disaster-movie from hijacking me while I'm actually trying.

Therapist: I'd like to suggest a simple technique to help you stay focused on the task at hand. As you log into your bank app and transfer the money, I want you to pay attention to the physical sensations in your body. Notice the feeling of your fingers on the screen, the sensation of your hands moving on the keyboard, the sound of your own voice saying the numbers. Can you bring your attention to those sensations, without judgment or distraction, as you complete the task?

Patient: Okay — I can try. I’ll open my bank app and move $100 into a rent spot and try to notice my fingers on the screen, the little clicks, the numbers I type. But my hands are already shaking and my chest is tight, and the fortune-teller’s yelling that pulling out my phone means I’ll be distracted later, mess up a cut, and everything collapses — so I’m anxious and keep wanting a drink. I want to do it, but if that movie gets louder while I’m transferring, what do I actually do in the moment?

Therapist: I want you to try a simple thing. When the fortune-teller's voice gets louder, I want you to take a pause, and say to yourself, "Okay, my body is experiencing anxiety." That's it. Just those two words: "My body is experiencing anxiety." No judgment, no trying to change it, just acknowledging it. Can you do that for me, right now?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try it now. My body is experiencing anxiety.

For a second it sort of lands, then the fortune-teller blasts the next scene — someone gets hurt, I’m blamed and fired — and my hands are shaking so bad I can’t finish the transfer. How long am I supposed to say that? Out loud? At work? Right now it just buys me a second before the urge for a drink kicks back in.

Therapist: You don't have to say it out loud, and you don't have to say it for a long time. Just say it to yourself for a second or two, and then pause. When you feel the catastrophic thinking kicking in again, you can take a moment to pause and acknowledge your anxiety. Try to maintain that pause for as short of a time as it takes to transfer the $100 into the rent spot.

Patient: I tried — I opened the app, started the transfer, and told myself “my body is experiencing anxiety.” For a beat it calmed, then the fortune-teller went nuts: I pictured messing up, getting fired, losing my place, and my hands were shaking so bad I couldn’t finish. If I can’t even move $100, it feels like proof the disaster’s real, so the urge to drink spikes. How long am I supposed to pause? And what am I actually supposed to do if I’m on site and my hands won’t stop shaking — just keep saying that until it stops? I don’t see how that prevents the next catastrophe.

Therapist: You don't need to keep saying "my body is experiencing anxiety" to stop the shaking or prevent the next catastrophe. Instead, try to defuse the catastrophic thinking by acknowledging it as a thought. When you feel the fortune-teller's voice kicking in, you can say to yourself, "Ah, there's that thought again." Just acknowledge it, don't engage with it, and then gently bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body.

Patient: Okay…I can try saying “Ah, there’s that thought again,” but I don’t see how that actually stops the movie — it just feels like giving the fortune-teller a breathing room to scream the next scene. My hands are still shaking and my chest’s tight, and if I pause on site to do that I’m terrified I’ll get distracted and mess something up anyway. How long am I supposed to pause before getting back to the task, and what do I do if the thought just layers on louder after I say it? I want this to work but right now it just feels pointless and makes me want a drink.

Therapist: I want to try something different. Instead of trying to stop the catastrophic thinking pattern, let's focus on the fact that you're taking small steps towards your values, like transferring the $100 and doing your best on the job. Can you try to focus on the fact that you're taking care of yourself and your responsibilities, even if the catastrophic thinking is loud? For now, just focus on the task at hand, and try to do one small, specific thing that moves you closer to your goal.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to do that and open the app to move the $100, but my hands are already shaking and my head’s blasting that pulling out my phone means I’ll be distracted, mess up a cut later, get fired, and lose everything, so I’m frozen. I want to do the thing that shows I’m trying, but I don’t know how to keep that movie from taking over mid-action without wanting a drink. Tell me exactly what to do in the moment if my hands won’t stop shaking — step by step — because vague stuff just makes me cave.

Therapist: If your hands are shaking and the catastrophic thinking pattern is taking over, I want you to try a very small, concrete action that you can do with one hand. Can you take one small step to the left, just one small movement with one hand? That's it. Just move one hand. Then, take a very deep breath in, and say to yourself, "I am doing one small step towards taking care of myself." Immediately after that, bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I tried it just now. I moved one hand, took a deep breath, and said, "I am doing one small step towards taking care of myself." For a split second it quieted the noise, but then the fortune-teller blasted the next scene — someone gets hurt, I get blamed and fired, and my hands started shaking worse so I couldn't finish the transfer. My chest's tight and I really want a drink to shut it up. 

I don't know how long I'm supposed to do that or what to do if I'm actually on site and mid-cut — tell me exactly step-by-step what to do there, because vague stuff just isn't working and I'm getting pissed off and overwhelmed. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down. I want you to take a moment to breathe and notice your physical sensations in your body. Can you find a comfortable position where you're sitting or standing, and bring your attention to your feet on the ground? Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Now, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here, I am safe, and I can do this one small step." As you say those words, bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to do anything else, just focus on the sensation of your breath. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay…I tried it — I sat down, felt my feet, took a deep breath, and on the exhale I said, "I am here, I am safe, and I can do this one small step." For a second it settled my chest, then the fortune-teller screamed the next scene and my heart started racing and my hands went numb. 

I don’t get how long I’m supposed to do that or what to actually do if I’m on site and mid-cut and my hands won’t stop shaking — give me a step-by-step script I can use that won’t feel like pretending. Can we slow down? I’m getting anxious and distracted and I need something concrete right now.

Therapist: I'm going to give you a step-by-step script that you can use in the moment. When you feel the catastrophic thinking pattern taking over, I want you to do this:

"5... I notice five things I can see around me. 4... I notice four things I can touch or feel. 3... I notice three things I can hear. 2... I notice two things I can smell. 1... I notice one thing I can taste. That's it. Just notice those five things, without judgment or trying to change them. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, 'I am here, I am safe, and I can do this one small step.'"

Patient: I tried that 5-4-3-2-1 thing just now — it quieted the movie for like two breaths, then the fortune-teller screamed the next scene and my hands went nuts again and I couldn't finish the transfer. My chest's tight, I feel shaky and stupid, and the urge to drink spikes every time it gets loud. 

Tell me exactly what to do if I'm on site and mid-cut and my hands start shaking — step-by-step, like you're giving me safety instructions, because vague stuff just makes me cave. Can we slow down and walk through that now?

Therapist: Let's go through a step-by-step script for what to do on site and mid-cut. When your hands start shaking, I want you to follow these steps:

1. **Step back**: Take a small step back from the task, literally, by taking 3-4 steps away from the work surface.
2. **Breathe**: Take 5 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.
3. **Notice**: Notice 5 things you can see around you, including your hands (even if they're shaking). Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground.
4. **Say it**: Say to yourself, "I am doing one small step towards being reliable and taking care of myself."
5. **Wait**: Wait for 30 seconds to 1 minute before returning to the task. Use this time to gather your thoughts and calm down.
6. **Re-engage**: Gradually return to the task, starting with one small, manageable task, such as checking your phone or taking a sip of water.

Repeat this process as needed, and remember that it's okay to take small steps and make mistakes.

Patient: I can see how that could help on paper, but I'm not sure I follow how it works in real life on site — if I'm mid-cut I can't just take 3–4 steps back without someone yelling or another guy stepping in and then the fortune-teller's already screaming that they'll blame me later and I'll be fired. My hands are so shaky I don't trust myself to set the tool down safely, and the 30–60 seconds feels like forever — the urge to drink spikes just thinking about it.  

Give me exact, word-for-word lines I can say that won't sound like I'm slacking: what do I tell the foreman (and how do I say it) if I need a break right now? Tell me step-by-step what to do with the tool mid-cut so I don't hurt anyone (like "kill switch, set on flat surface, hand to X"), and what to do if the boss snaps at me — one or two short replies I can actually use. Also — after an episode, when I'm home and the urge to drink is crushing — give me one concrete thing I can do instead that actually works for me in the moment, not vague breathing stuff. Can we slow down and walk through each of those scripts one at a time?

Therapist: Let's break down the scripts into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Script 1: Asking for a break**

If you need a break, you can say to the foreman:

"I need to take a quick break, can I step outside for a minute to collect myself?"

This phrase acknowledges your need for a break, while also showing that you're committed to your work.

**Script 2: Handling a foreman's snap**

If the foreman snaps at you, you can respond with:

"I understand the urgency, but I need to make sure I complete this section safely. Can I take a moment to regroup and get back to it?"

This response acknowledges the foreman's concern, while also setting boundaries and prioritizing your own safety.

**Script 3: Mid-cut**

If your hands are shaking, you can use the following steps to set the tool down safely:

1. "Kill switch": Set the tool down on a flat surface, such as a toolbox or a block of wood.
2. "Hand to X": Place your hand on a stable object, such as a nearby pipe or a piece of equipment, to steady yourself.
3. Take a deep breath in, and say to yourself, "I am doing one small step towards being reliable and taking care of myself."

**Script 4: Managing the urge to drink after an episode**

If you're feeling overwhelmed and the urge to drink is strong, try this:

"Get moving": Get up from the couch or chair, and start doing some light physical activity, such as stretching or taking a short walk.

Patient: Okay — I tried those scripts and they help for like two breaths then the fortune-teller screams the next scene and I’m back frozen and wanting a drink. I need you to give me exact, word-for-word lines I can actually say — not vague — and then we roleplay them so I can practice. 

Start with Script 1: give me two versions — one short line to say to the foreman that won’t sound like I’m slacking, and one short line if he snaps back at me. Then for mid-cut: give me an exact, safety-first step-by-step script I can do with the tool (every little action, in order — e.g., “press X, set blade facing Y, lay on Z, hand to coworker saying A”), and two one-sentence replies if a coworker or boss rushes me. Finally, after an episode at home when the urge to drink is crushing, give me one single, concrete thing I can do right then (no breathing or vague “move” stuff) that I can actually do in my kitchen so the urge drops. Can we slow down and walk through the first one now, with you playing the foreman so I can try saying it?

Therapist: Let's do Script 1: "I need to take a quick break, can I step outside for a minute to collect myself?"

**Version 1: Short line to say to the foreman**

"Foreman: "Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with the pace of this project. Can I take a quick break to regroup?"

**Version 2: Short line if the foreman snaps back**

"Foreman: "What's wrong, can't handle the workload?"

You can respond with:

"Hey, I'm just feeling a bit anxious about making a mistake. Can I take a minute to collect myself before getting back to work?"

Let's roleplay the scenario:

You're on site, and the foreman is watching you work. You're feeling overwhelmed and need a break. You approach the foreman and say:

"I need to take a quick break, can I step outside for a minute to collect myself?"

Foreman: "What's wrong, can't handle the workload?"

How would you respond?

Patient: "I'm not trying to dodge work — my hands are shaking and I'm really anxious. If I keep going like this I'm going to mess up, someone could get hurt, and it'll be on me and I'll lose my job, so I need to step outside for a minute to collect myself."
