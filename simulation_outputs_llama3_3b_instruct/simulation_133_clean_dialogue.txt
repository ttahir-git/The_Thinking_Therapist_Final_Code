Patient: I'm a software developer with generalized anxiety and a recent rough breakup, and my mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I get stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism — one bug or missed call becomes proof I'll get fired, lose everything, and end up alone, and I can't seem to picture any other outcome. Coming from a high-achieving family makes the pressure worse; failure feels like it will definitely spiral into ruin.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens right after you notice a "bug" or a missed call? What specifically triggers this catastrophic thinking, and what's the first thought that pops up in your mind?

Patient: The second I notice a bug or a missed call my chest tightens and the thought that pops up is, "This proves I'm useless" — and immediately I see the whole chain: I get fired, I can't find another job, my savings vanish, my ex moves on and everyone finds out I'm a failure. It feels like a movie that plays on loop and I can't imagine any other ending, so I just spiral into shame and start ruminating about every little mistake. Even if someone suggests a calmer possibility, I can't believe it; the disaster story feels way more real.

Therapist: It sounds like the "This proves I'm useless" thought is like a self-fulfilling prophecy, where you're already assuming the worst-case scenario. What if we explored the possibility that this "uselessness" thought is more like a temporary narrative, rather than an absolute truth? Can you imagine if we tried to add some space between this thought and your current identity, like creating a small buffer zone?

Patient: I'm trying, but I can't really picture that buffer — it just feels like pretending to calm myself. The minute I notice a bug or a missed call my brain launches the whole disaster movie: boss finds out -> I'm fired -> I can't get another job -> savings drain -> I'm on the street and my ex and my family think I'm a fraud. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Before we proceed, I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to slow down when your mind is racing. Can I gently suggest we start with a small, 10-second pause whenever you notice that "disaster movie" playing in your head? Just pause, take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "I'm observing this thought, and it's not true."

Patient: Okay, I'll try that — taking a breath now — but even in the pause my brain's already running the movie: boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone. It feels like a trick that doesn't stick and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: Let's try something different. I want you to bring your attention to your breath, and as you breathe in, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm safe, I'm present." As you breathe out, say "I'm not my thoughts." Repeat that a few times, focusing on the sensation of the breath and the words, without trying to change your thoughts. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I tried breathing and saying the phrases, but it just feels like a trick — my chest loosens a little for a second and then the movie's back: boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone, everyone sees I'm a fraud. Saying "I'm not my thoughts" feels false, like putting a band-aid over a sink that's still flooding, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: I'm noticing that you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated with the exercise. Can we take a step back and focus on the sensation of your body? Where do you feel the overwhelm in your body right now? Is it in your chest, your stomach, or somewhere else? Let's bring some kindness and curiosity to that area, and see if we can create a tiny bit of space for kindness and compassion to emerge.

Patient: It's mostly in my chest — a tight, heavy pressure — with this hollow sinking in my stomach and my shoulders knotting up. When I try to be kind to it, it feels fake, like a band-aid, and the disaster movie's already rewinding — boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't find another job, I'm broke and everyone thinks I'm a fraud. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try a different way to do this?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like you're making progress. Can I ask, what would you do if you could create a safe, small space for yourself right now, just for a few minutes, where you're not worried about the "disaster movie" or the future? Where would you go, and what would you do in that space?

Patient: If I could make a safe space, I'd go to the small park by my apartment, sit on the bench with my sketchbook and headphones, and just watch clouds while doodling—something quiet and low-stakes. But my brain immediately ruins it: someone will see me, my boss will call about the bug, I'll get called into a meeting, then fired, then the whole spiral happens, so even that calm scene feels pointless. I'm getting really overwhelmed saying that out loud—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and acknowledge the story you're telling yourself. You said you'd go to the park and watch clouds, but your brain immediately jumped to all the worst-case scenarios. Can I ask, what if, for just a moment, you let go of the idea that this safe space needs to be perfect? What if it's okay if you don't feel completely calm or in control while you're there? What if you just allow yourself to be in the moment, without trying to create some sort of mental escape?

Patient: I want that park to work, but the minute I picture it my brain overwrites it with the movie: someone sees me, my boss calls about the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings vanish, and everyone thinks I'm a fraud. Imagining just being there without trying to escape feels dishonest — like pretending the spiral won't happen — and I can't make that feel realistic. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to imagine a safe space that feels realistic, given the overwhelming nature of your worries. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to control the outcome of the "disaster movie," we focused on the experience of sitting on that bench, doodling, and watching the clouds? What if we just allowed yourself to be with the physical sensations, the sensation of the breeze, the sound of the wind, and the sensation of the ground beneath your feet, without trying to fit it into a specific narrative or outcome?

Patient: I tried that — I can feel the breeze and the bench under me for a second, my shoulders loosen a tiny bit — but two breaths later the movie's back: boss calls about the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, everyone sees I'm a fraud. It makes "being present" feel like pretending, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and look at what's happening when you try to imagine being present. What is it about being present that feels like "pretending" to you? Is it the idea that you're not really letting go of the worries, or is it something else entirely?

Patient: It's both, but mostly it feels like denial — like I'm lying to myself that nothing bad will happen. The second I try to "be present" the movie starts up again — boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job — so staying present feels dangerous, like I'm ignoring the one thing that will ruin me. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like being present is somehow "ignoring" the potential risks. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to be present in a way that feels safe or risk-free, we explored the idea of being present in a way that's more honest with yourself? What if, rather than trying to avoid the thoughts, we tried to acknowledge them, but not engage with them, not react to them?

Patient: I get the point, but that doesn't work for me — acknowledging the thought just feels like handing it more fuel. The second "I'm useless" pops up I see the whole chain play out: boss finds the bug -> meeting -> fired -> can't get another job -> savings gone -> everyone thinks I'm a fraud. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can I ask, what would happen if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or avoid them, we simply looked at the chain of thoughts that's playing out in your mind, without judgment or engagement? What if we just observed the sequence of thoughts, like a movie playing in the background, without trying to alter it, or try to change it?

Patient: I try to watch it like a movie, but the second I look the camera zooms in and I'm living it — boss finds the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired on the spot, can't get another job, savings evaporate, I'm evicted, my ex and family see I'm a fraud and everyone laughs. Observing feels like rehearsing the ending instead of stepping back, and I start shaking and can't focus. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like you're just watching a movie, and not actually experiencing the worst-case scenario. Can I ask, what would happen if we brought the sensation of shaking and overwhelm into our awareness, rather than trying to push it away or engage with it? What if we just allowed ourselves to feel the physical sensations, and see if we can find a sense of connection to our body, rather than getting lost in the thoughts?

Patient: When I try to bring the shaking and overwhelm into awareness it just feels like proof the movie is already happening — my hands tremble, my chest tightens, my vision narrows — and as I focus the whole chain zooms in: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud. I get more scattered and start hyperventilating, like focusing on the body just makes the disaster feel inevitable. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on the physical sensations of overwhelm, but this time, can we try to approach them with kindness and curiosity? Instead of trying to stop or change the thoughts, can we simply observe the physical sensations in the present moment, without judgment or trying to engage with them? Can you bring your attention to your breath, and as you inhale, say to yourself, "I'm feeling this sensation in my body, and it's okay to feel it"?

Patient: I tried the breath and saying, "I'm feeling this sensation in my body, and it's okay to feel it," but as soon as I name it my heart starts racing and the movie turns up louder: boss calls about the bug, meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud. Naming it doesn't calm me — it just makes it feel more real and I get dizzy and unfocused. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: Let's take a break from trying to change or manage your thoughts and feelings. Can I ask, what would happen if we simply sat in silence, without trying to do anything, and just focused on the sensation of your body being in the present moment? No thoughts, no feelings, no trying to change anything. Just the sensation of being here, in this moment, without judgment or expectation. Can you try that for just a few breaths?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is sitting in silence supposed to help? The second I try, my brain goes full movie: boss finds the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud. I can't actually be quiet without my chest tightening and my hands trembling; I'm feeling really scattered and overwhelmed—can we slow down and try something else?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can I ask, what's the physical sensation in your body right now, as we're talking? Where do you feel the tension or the trembling most? Can you bring your attention to that area, and simply observe it without trying to change it or engage with it?

Patient: My chest is this tight, heavy pressure and my hands are trembling—my stomach feels hollow and my shoulders are all knotted up. I try to focus on the chest, like you said, but as soon as I notice it my brain turns it into proof the movie's happening: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone. I'm not sure I follow how just observing that helps—it just makes me more panicked and scattered. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something completely different. Can I ask, what would happen if I were to speak to you in a very gentle, calm, and kind tone, without trying to offer any advice or solutions? Would that help you feel more calm, or would it just make things worse?

Patient: A calm, gentle tone might let me breathe easier for a few seconds—my shoulders might unclench—but almost immediately it feels like being pacified, and the movie ratchets up louder: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings gone. I know that sounds irrational, but I can't make the disaster story stop, and I'm getting really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can I ask, what's the sensation of feeling like the "disaster story" is always "on" and can't be stopped? What is it like to feel like you're trapped in this narrative, and that you can't escape?

Patient: It feels like a switch that's jammed on — my chest goes tight, my hands start trembling, my vision narrows, and time stretches so every second is full of that movie playing faster and louder. Emotionally it's shame and dread all rolled together, like I'm collapsing inward and can't breathe, and cognitively it feels immutable — the thought isn't just a thought, it's a timeline: boss finds the bug -> meeting -> fired -> can't get another job -> savings gone -> evicted -> everyone sees I'm a fraud. Trying to observe it just zooms the camera in and makes it more real, like rehearsing the worst ending instead of stepping back. I'm getting really overwhelmed and distracted by all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment and acknowledge that you're feeling completely overwhelmed. Can I ask, what would happen if we were to consider the possibility that this feeling of being stuck is not about the thoughts or the emotions, but about your physical body being in a state of high alert? Can you imagine if your body could relax, just a tiny bit, just enough to feel a little more grounded?

Patient: Maybe my body could relax a tiny bit, but I can't actually imagine letting my guard down — the moment I do my brain says I'll miss a call, my boss will find the bug, they'll call me into a meeting and I'm fired. I'm feeling drained and fuzzy trying to picture grounding; even that seems like a setup for the same disaster. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on your physical body. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your heartbeat? Sometimes, when we focus on our physical sensations, it can help us feel more connected to our body and more grounded. Can you try to bring your attention to one of these sensations, just for a brief moment?

Patient: I can kind of feel my feet on the floor, but it's faint and my heart's still racing and my chest is tight. The moment I try to focus it pulls right back into the movie—boss calls, meeting, fired—and I can't keep my attention there; it's exhausting and fuzzy. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. I'm going to speak to you in a very gentle, calm tone, and I want you to focus on my voice. Can you just listen to my voice, without trying to think about anything else? Can you hear the sound of my voice, the rhythm of my breathing, and the sensation of my words being spoken?

Patient: I can hear your voice—it's calmer and it loosens my shoulders for a beat—but it only holds for a couple breaths before the movie jerks back on: boss finds the bug, meeting, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone. I'm feeling really fuzzy and distracted and I can't seem to stay with your voice—can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not trying to fix or change anything. I'm just here, speaking to you in a calm tone. Can you simply notice how your body is feeling right now, without trying to change anything? Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your body, without judgment or engagement with the catastrophic thoughts?

Patient: I can barely notice it — a heavy tightness in my chest, a hollow in my stomach, my shoulders all knotted — but the second I focus the movie blares back: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings gone. Trying to observe just pulls me into the spiral and I get more panicked and scattered. I'm feeling really drained and overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not trying to fix you or change you. I'm just here, listening to your words. Can I offer you a small kindness? Can I say that it's okay to feel this way, to be overwhelmed and panicked? Can you allow yourself to feel this way, without judgment or self-criticism?

Patient: I hear you saying it's okay, and part of me wants to believe that, but the second I try to "allow" it I feel like I'm handing the movie more evidence. I can tell myself it's okay for a second and my shoulders loosen, then the whole chain cranks back up louder and I feel like I'm making it real. I'm really drained and fuzzy right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not going to try to offer you a new thought or a new way of thinking. I'm just going to sit with you in silence, without trying to change anything. Can I ask, what would happen if I simply ceased to exist, or at least, ceased to speak, in this moment?

Patient: If you stopped talking my brain would freak out — it would read your silence as proof I’m already failing and everyone’s walking away. I’d see you gone, then the boss calls, the meeting, I’m fired, can’t find another job, savings gone, evicted, and everyone thinks I’m a fraud. It makes me feel abandoned and my chest tightens so much I can’t breathe; I’m really overwhelmed — can we slow down and can you keep talking so I don’t spiral?

Therapist: I'm not going to stop talking. I'm going to keep speaking, and I want you to focus on my voice. Can you listen to my voice, without trying to think about anything else? Can you just hear the sound of my words, and allow yourself to feel the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them?

Patient: I can hear your voice and it loosens me for a beat, but it's only a couple breaths before the movie crashes back in: boss calls, meeting, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone. I'm feeling jittery and scattered and I can't hold on to your words — can we slow down and can you keep talking so I don't spiral?

Therapist: I'm going to keep speaking, and I want you to focus on my voice. Can I ask, what would happen if I said to you, "You are safe"? Not because I believe that you're safe, but because that's a word that's already true. You are safe right now, in this moment, regardless of what's happening in your life. Can you hold onto that feeling, just for a moment?

Patient: Saying "You are safe" loosens me for a single breath, but I can't keep it — the moment I try to hold that I hear the movie: boss calls, meeting, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone. I don't really follow how "you're safe" is supposed to help; I'm feeling fuzzy and overwhelmed — can we slow down and keep talking?
