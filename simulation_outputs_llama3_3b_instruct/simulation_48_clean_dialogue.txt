Patient: I'm a chef, middle-aged, and since the move I've been hit with this heavy sadness and zero motivation — it's leaking into my relationship and I'm more short with my partner. My OCD's flaring too; routines that used to help now feel pointless and then I get stuck. I don't really see how talking will fix it, but I figured I'd try.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to discuss your feelings with your partner? What's the experience like, and what do you think would need to be true for you to feel like the conversation would be helpful?

Patient: Usually it goes sideways — either they get defensive or start trying to fix everything and I shut down, which just makes me feel more like a nuisance and then I snap. My OCD turns the talk into this nitpicky list of problems and they tune out, so the whole thing just derails. It would help if they could just listen without fixing or judging and ask what I actually need — but honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle where conversations are becoming increasingly frustrating for both of you. Can you tell me what you think is the main function of your OCD in these situations – is it trying to avoid feeling overwhelmed, or is there something else driving it?

Patient: I think my OCD is basically a control/avoidance thing — when I get overwhelmed by the move and the sadness, the rituals give me something concrete to do so I don’t have to sit with the feelings. It also turns conversations into checklists so I don’t have to get close or risk being judged, and that just makes me snap later. But… how is that supposed to help? I've noticed this before and saying it out loud didn't make it stop.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the function of your OCD in this way. What's one small, concrete thing you could do this week, without relying on your OCD, that aligns with a value that's important to you, like spending quality time with your partner or pursuing a hobby?

Patient: Maybe I could schedule one night this week to cook a simple meal with my partner — no heavy talks, just follow a recipe together for an hour and actually try to stay present. But how is that supposed to help? I've done "quality time" before and my OCD still turns it into a checklist, so I'm worried I'll just get impatient or start policing everything.

Therapist: Before cooking with your partner, let's try something simple. Instead of focusing on following a recipe, can you agree to just be present in the moment, without judgment, for 5 minutes at the start of your cooking session? Just notice the sensations in your body, the sounds, the smells – no goals, no expectations, just being. What do you think that might feel like?

Patient: I don't know — at first it would probably feel weird, like I'm wasting time, my stomach gets jumpy and my hands want to be doing something. If I could actually stay with it, maybe I'd notice the heat of the pan, the smell of garlic, my breathing slowing, and that might make me less snappy later. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried sitting with stuff before and my OCD just hijacks it into a checklist, so I'm skeptical it won't just turn into me policing the recipe.

Therapist: I'm not asking you to believe that mindfulness will fix everything or that you'll magically become a better cook. I'm asking you to be willing to try something new, even if you don't think it will work. Can you say to yourself, without judgment, "I'm willing to try this, even if I don't know if it will work"?

Patient: "I'm willing to try this, even if I don't know if it will work." Okay, I'm saying it — but honestly, I don't know if it'll change anything; I'm worried it'll just turn into another checklist and I'll get impatient.

Therapist: Can you think of a time when you felt fully engaged and present, even in a moment that didn't go exactly as planned? What was that like, and what value did you feel was being met in that moment?

Patient: Yeah — once during a busy dinner service the sauce for a special went south and everything could've blown up, but I just zeroed in: the heat on my face, the shh of the burners, the way the spoon felt in my hand. I stayed calm, improvised a fix with a sous, and afterward I felt useful and connected — like I mattered and could handle the chaos. How is that supposed to help now? I get what that felt like, but remembering it doesn't stop the OCD or the slump from creeping back in when things get personal; I've tried leaning on that memory before and it doesn't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to tap into that sense of calm and resourcefulness when things feel overwhelming. What if, instead of trying to recall that moment, we focused on creating a small, tangible action that would allow you to feel useful and connected in the present moment, even if it's just for a few minutes? For example, what would it take to start with a simple task, like chopping vegetables for the recipe, and see where your senses take you?

Patient: Yeah, I can picture that — the knife rhythm, the smell of onions, the little trance you get in service. I could try chopping for five minutes and just notice the sensations, but how is that supposed to help? My OCD will probably turn it into perfect slices or a timed thing and then I’ll start criticizing myself, and I don’t want my partner to think I’m checking out.

Therapist: Instead of focusing on chopping or any specific outcome, let's focus on the process of chopping itself. What if, for the next 5 minutes, you simply acknowledged to yourself whenever your mind starts to wander or you notice a distraction? You could say something like, "Ah, my mind is noticing the onion fumes. Okay, I'm here. Can I let it be?" What would that feel like?

Patient: It would probably feel awkward — like I'm wasting time and my hands want to be doing something “useful.” Maybe naming the wandering thoughts could make the urge to perfect things less loud, but honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try the five minutes, but I'm worried I'll just start policing the slices and look checked out to my partner.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the outcome or your thoughts, we explored the value of being present with your partner during this time? What if, for the next 5 minutes, you focused on being available for your partner, and letting them know that you're here, even if you're not perfect? You could say something like, "Hey, I'm here with you, and I'm not thinking about the meal right now. Can you talk to me about how you're feeling?"

Patient: I could try saying, "Hey, I'm here with you," for five minutes, but honestly I know how this goes — they usually jump straight to fixing stuff. How is that supposed to help? I've tried being present before and it just turns into them fixing or me getting impatient, but I'll give the five minutes a shot.

Therapist: Can you think of what happens in the moment when your partner starts fixing or trying to help? What's the underlying value or need that they're trying to meet? Is it a desire to help, to be useful, or to feel in control? By understanding this underlying value, we might be able to find a way to meet it in a way that feels more collaborative and less confrontational.

Patient: I think they're trying to be useful — to fix things so they don't feel helpless or scared. When they jump in it feels like I'm being judged or like they don't trust me, and that just makes me clamp up and my OCD goes into overdrive. How is that supposed to help? If they could just ask, "Do you want advice or do you want me to listen?" that might feel safer, but I'm skeptical it'd actually play out that way.

Therapist: It's interesting that you mention the phrase "Do you want advice or do you want me to listen?" What if, instead of waiting for your partner to ask, you took the initiative to ask them that question yourself? You could say, "Hey, before we talk about what's going on, can we check in with each other about what we need from this conversation? Do you want me to offer suggestions or just listen?"

Patient: I can try asking that — “Do you want advice or do you want me to listen?” — but how is that supposed to help? I've tried something like that before and it didn't stick; they either get defensive or immediately start fixing things, so I'm skeptical it'll change much, but I can say it and then, if they still jump in, tell them straight up, “I just need you to listen for five minutes.”

Therapist: Let's explore what might happen if your partner says "I need you to listen." What would that mean for you? How would you feel, and what would you do next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If they actually said, "I need you to listen," I'd feel a weird mix of relief like, finally, and panicked like I'm on stage and about to screw it up; my OCD would immediately make rules about how to listen. I'd probably try to breathe, set a five-minute boundary, and ask them to tell me more so I can reflect back, but I'm skeptical it'll change anything — they'll still jump in or I'll start policing my reactions.

Therapist: Let's focus on the value that's driving your desire to be heard and understood. What is it about feeling truly seen and understood that matters to you? Is it a desire for connection, for feeling less alone, or for feeling like your partner trusts and values you? Can we explore what would need to be true for you to feel like your partner is really listening, without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — what exactly do you mean by "without trying to control the outcome"? How is that supposed to help? That said, feeling truly seen matters because I don't want to be treated like a problem to fix; I want connection, to feel less alone, and like my partner trusts me instead of judging me. For me to feel they're really listening they'd need to hold off on giving advice for a few minutes, reflect back what I say or ask what I actually need, and show a little patience — even a simple "I hear you" would help — but I'm skeptical they'd stick to that.

Therapist: Let's explore what might happen if your partner were to simply acknowledge your request to be heard, without trying to fix or offer advice. What would that feel like for you, and what would you do next?

Patient: If they just acknowledged it, I'd feel oddly relieved — like someone finally put down the lid on the pot and let it simmer instead of poking at it. I might actually be able to say what's been bugging me or even get teary, and then ask for a few minutes of just being heard. But how is that supposed to help? I'm still skeptical they'd really hold off, and even if they did, my OCD would probably turn the whole thing into rules about "how to listen" and I'd end up stuck policing it.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the listening process, we explored a small, experiential exercise to help you tap into the feeling of being heard? Let's try something simple: Can you take a deep breath, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm open to hearing you"? Then, without changing a thing, simply observe what happens in your body and mind as you say this phrase.

Patient: Okay... I did it — took a breath and on the exhale said, "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm open to hearing you." Right away my chest tightened, my heart sped up, and my hands fidgeted; there was this tiny flicker of relief, then my brain snapped to, "Was that real?" and started policing whether I said it right. I feel shaky and distracted, like my OCD turned it into another task instead of actually calming me. How is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try, but I'm anxious it just creates more rules in my head.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and acknowledge the feelings of anxiety and self-doubt that just arose. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome or police your own experience, we simply acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way? Can you say to yourself, "I'm feeling anxious and uncertain right now, and that's okay"?

Patient: Okay — "I'm feeling anxious and uncertain right now, and that's okay." Saying it made my shoulders drop a hair and there was a tiny loosening in my chest, but my heart's still racing and my brain's already listing whether I said it right. How is that supposed to help? I'm trying to let the feeling be, but it just keeps nagging at me to do something about it.

Therapist: Let's try to create some space from the constant thinking. What if, for the next few minutes, we focus on noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Can you simply observe the sensation of each breath without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: I'll try, but I'm all over the place — chest tight, heart racing, and my head's already cataloging whether I'm doing it right. When I actually try to notice the breath I feel the cool air at my nostrils and my belly lifting a bit, then falling, but my brain immediately turns it into a checklist. How is that supposed to help? I'm trying to stay with it, but I'm distracted and fidgety.

Therapist: Let's explore what might happen if, instead of focusing on the breath or the sensations in your body, we connect with the value of simply being present in this moment. What if, for the sake of your relationship and your own well-being, it's enough to simply be with your partner, even if it's imperfect? Can you think of a value or a memory that might make this feeling of being present more meaningful to you?

Patient: I guess the value is connection — not feeling alone. I keep coming back to this memory of cooking with my old crew/partner back home: we were laughing, someone botched a sauce and it turned into a joke, and I felt like I mattered and belonged. But how is that supposed to help now? I'm jittery and distracted thinking about it, and I'm worried it'll just turn into another thing I have to get perfect instead of actually feeling anything.

Therapist: Let's take a small step towards creating a concrete way to practice being present and connected with your partner. What if, for the next 5-10 minutes, we focus on simply being with your partner, without any expectations or goals? You can start by saying, "I'm here with you, and I'm trying to be present" - no need to add anything else. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay... I can try saying, "I'm here with you, and I'm trying to be present." Saying it already makes my chest tighten and my brain starts policing whether I'm doing it 'right' — I get anxious they'll still jump in or I'll turn it into a checklist. I'll try to stay quiet for 5–10 minutes, but honestly, how is that supposed to help if they don't actually hold back?

Therapist: Let's explore what might happen if your partner didn't jump in or offer advice, and you were able to stay present for a longer period. What would that feel like for you, and what might you need to feel like your partner is really listening and valuing you?

Patient: If they actually held back, I'd feel this weird immediate relief — my chest would loosen a bit and I might finally say the thing I keep shoving down instead of snapping. What I'd really need is concrete: them to reflect back what I say (even just "I hear you"), ask "what do you need right now?" and agree to five minutes of no advice, maybe a hand on my arm so I know they're not judging. I'm anxious just saying that — my heart's racing — and honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried this and my OCD just turns the whole thing into rules or makes me think they're faking it, so I'm skeptical it'll stick.

Therapist: Let's connect your desire for concrete support and understanding to the value of feeling heard and valued. What if, instead of focusing on the specific actions your partner needs to take, we explored what would need to be true for you to feel like you're being seen and heard? What would be the underlying value or feeling that would make you feel like your partner is really listening and valuing you?

Patient: I think the core thing is safety — feeling trusted and not judged, like I'm seen as a person not a project to fix. If that was there I wouldn't feel so defensive or driven to control everything, and I might actually say the stuff I'm keeping inside. But... how is that supposed to help? I'm anxious it'll just sound good on paper and then my OCD or my partner's instinct to fix things will kick in and it'll feel fake.

Therapist: Let's focus on creating a concrete action that embodies the value of safety and trust. What if, instead of trying to achieve a specific outcome or expect a certain response from your partner, we simply focused on taking a small action that feels safe and comfortable for you? For example, what if, for the next 5 minutes, you took a few deep breaths and said "I'm here" to your partner, without adding anything else?

Patient: I can try that — take a few deep breaths and just say, "I'm here." But my chest's already tight, my hands are fidgeting, and my brain will start policing whether I said it right. How is that supposed to help if they still jump in or I start running the whole thing like a checklist? What do I do next if it goes sideways?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay if things don't go as planned. What if, instead of focusing on the outcome or trying to control your partner's response, we simply focused on being present with the sensation of your breath? Can you try to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or attachment to any specific outcome?

Patient: Okay... I'll try — but I'm really wound up: chest tight, heart racing, hands fidgety. When I tune in I feel the air at my nostrils and my belly rise and fall, but my brain immediately starts saying I'm doing it wrong or this is pointless. How is that supposed to help? If my mind wanders or the OCD kicks in, what am I actually supposed to do next so I don't just spiral into checking and critiquing the whole thing?

Therapist: Let's explore what happens when you get caught up in self-criticism. What would need to be true for you to feel like you can gently acknowledge and accept your thoughts, rather than getting caught up in the critique?

Patient: I guess for that to work, a few things would need to be true: someone (me or my partner) has to give me explicit permission to be messy and imperfect in the moment, there needs to be a tiny time limit so my brain can’t turn it into a checklist (like 2 minutes), and a simple concrete cue to bring me back — a phrase (“that’s just my brain”), a hand on my arm, or one breathing count. Also, I’d need a plan for when the critic shows up — name the thought quickly and return to the cue instead of trying to argue with it. How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried labeling thoughts before and it just became another thing to do, but maybe with strict limits and my partner actually agreeing to the rules, it might not blow up into more checking.

Therapist: Let's connect the value of being able to be present and accepting of your thoughts to the value of feeling seen and valued in your relationship. What would need to be true for you to feel like your partner is truly supporting and trusting you, even when you're not perfect or getting caught up in self-criticism?

Patient: I think a few concrete things would need to be true: my partner actually holds off on fixing for a set window (like 5 minutes), reflects back what I say or asks “what do you need?”, gives a short reassuring phrase (“I hear you”), and we have a pre-agreed cue or touch to bring me back when my brain starts policing. I'd need consistency over time so it doesn’t feel performative, plus a short plan for when the critic shows up — name the thought, use the cue, and return to whatever we agreed. But I'm anxious about this and skeptical — how is that supposed to help when my OCD and past patterns always seem to hijack it?
