Patient: I'm an older software developer, and lately I've been avoiding get-togethers with my few close friends because my mind turns into a fortune-telling machine — I can already see it: I'll walk in, fumble a joke, everyone will stare, they'll think I'm pathetic, they'll stop inviting me, and it'll definitely happen. I keep replaying that chain of events until I can't bring myself to go. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake the feeling that that's the only outcome.

Therapist: That scenario sounds like a very vivid and distressing mental rehearsal. Can you describe what happens right before you decide not to attend a social gathering – is there a specific moment or trigger that signals to you that you need to avoid it?

Patient: Usually it's when the invite pops up or I picture walking through the door — right then my head fills with one of those disaster stories. I see myself blurting something dumb, everyone freezing, people whispering and never inviting me again, and that spiral into total loneliness feels inevitable, so I cancel before I even try. My chest tightens and I tell myself other outcomes are unrealistic, so why risk it?

Therapist: Those mental rehearsal scenarios sound incredibly vivid and potentially debilitating. Would you be willing to try a small experiment with your mental rehearsal, where you simply imagine attending a social gathering without the catastrophic outcome? Let's say you walk into the room, and instead of "total loneliness," what might you notice or experience if you just let go of the "what-ifs" for a minute?

Patient: I tried picturing it going well, but my mind instantly threads the fallout: someone laughs politely now, then later they'll whisper about me, stop inviting me, and I'll end up alone — that's the obvious follow-through, so the pleasant scene feels like a setup for later failure. It doesn't feel like letting go, it feels like lying to myself, and the disaster story drags me right back every time. I don't see how imagining a pleasant version would change anything; it just doesn't feel realistic.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is quite good at predicting a negative outcome, and that's creating a sense of disconnection between imagining a positive experience. Can you try something different? Instead of imagining a pleasant scenario, what if you simply observe your thoughts as thoughts, without judgment or attachment? Notice the story that's running through your mind, and gently acknowledge it without acting on it.

Patient: I tried that—when I try to observe the thought it still feels like a forecast I can't ignore; acknowledging it doesn't make the picture any less real. My chest tightens the same way and the whole disaster script keeps playing, so "not acting on it" feels impossible. I can attempt to notice it, but honestly it just feels like waiting for the inevitable to happen.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your thoughts is still closely tied to the emotional experience of anxiety. Can you think of a specific reason, a value, why you want to attend social gatherings, even if you don't feel like you can avoid the "disaster" scenario? Is there something about connecting with others, sharing ideas, or feeling part of a community that's important to you?

Patient: I do value staying connected — I don't want to end up completely alone like after my partner died, and I miss the small, sensible conversations with the few friends I have. But the fortune-teller in my head says even if I force myself to go, I'll fumble something, they'll see how fragile I am, start avoiding me, and before long I'm isolated again, so it feels like the risk just guarantees the outcome I'm trying to avoid.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being seen as vulnerable is a strong one. What would it take for you to feel like you were able to show up at a social gathering, without the fear of being rejected or judged, and still maintain your connection with others?

Patient: I guess I'd need guarantees — like someone halfway through the night texting me that I'm doing fine, or a rigid script to follow so I can't fumble, or absolute proof they'd still want me even if I messed up. But even that feels pointless because my mind immediately rehearses how one tiny slip will make them pull away and then I'll be back where I started. I don't know what would actually convince me it wouldn't end badly.

Therapist: Let's take a step back – what would be valuable to you if you were able to attend a social gathering without the fear of disaster? Is there something small, like a kind word or a shared laugh, that would make you feel like you're still connected to others?

Patient: I guess what I’d want is something small and real — a genuine laugh at something I say, or one friend pulling me aside to say they were glad I came. But my fortune-teller immediately runs it forward: they laugh now, later they notice I’m awkward, they start drifting away, and the invites dry up until I’m back to being alone. I know that sounds grim, but imagining the little good thing just feels like the setup for the inevitable fallout, so I can't make myself believe it's enough.

Therapist: Can you imagine yourself in the midst of a social gathering, and instead of trying to imagine a future scenario, what if you focused on the sensations in your body right now, as you imagine yourself being genuinely connected with others, and receiving a genuine laugh or a kind word? What would that feel like in your body, and what would you notice?

Patient: When I try to feel that—like someone genuinely laughing or saying something kind—my chest loosens a bit, my throat feels warm, and I almost smile. But the fortune-teller immediately takes over: that little warmth becomes proof I'm fragile, they'll laugh now and later whisper, I'll panic, my hands will tremble, my heart will race, and they'll definitely stop inviting me. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed imagining it—can we slow down? I don't know how to hold the small good feeling without my mind turning it into the next disaster.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and come back to that feeling of warmth in your body. Can you notice it right now, without trying to imagine what happens next? Just allow yourself to be with that feeling, like a gentle warmth, and see what's happening with your thoughts when you're in this state.

Patient: I can feel a little warmth — my chest eases and my throat softens — but it feels so fragile I can't hang on to it. The fortune-teller immediately yanks it forward: they'll laugh now, later they'll whisper, I'll panic, they'll stop inviting me, and I'll be alone again, and now I'm jittery and can't focus. I don't know how to stay with the feeling — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take another deep breath and come back to that feeling of warmth. Imagine you are a gentle, comforting presence in the midst of your own thoughts – a warm, stable island in a storm. What would it be like to be this presence, to be the one who holds onto the warmth, even when the thoughts come and go?

Patient: I'm trying to be that presence, but it's like the fortune-teller slaps my hand away — I get the warmth for a beat, then I'm flooded with the same film: people laughing now, whispering later, me panicking, invites stopping. My chest's tight, my hands are shaky, and I can't hold the calm; it scrambles my focus. Can we slow down? I don't know how to keep the warmth from becoming proof they'll leave.

Therapist: Can you try to focus on one tiny step you could take, right now, in this moment, that feels connected to the warmth and calm you're trying to hold onto? It doesn't need to be grand or ambitious – just something small, like taking a deep breath, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. What would it take for you to feel like taking that step?

Patient: I guess I could try one slow breath and feel my feet on the floor, but as soon as I do the fortune-teller starts yelling that my hands will tremble, I'll fumble a word, people will notice I'm rattled, and that'll be the moment they start avoiding me. I'm really jittery and distracted right now and can't seem to hold the breath long enough — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a pause and bring your attention to your body. Notice the sensations in your body right now, without trying to change them or act on them. Feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your breath in your body. Just observe, without judgment, without trying to do anything. What do you notice?

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor but a bit numb, like pins and needles. My breath's shallow, my chest is tight and my heart's racing, my hands are tingling — and the moment I notice that, the fortune-teller screams that people will see me shake, think I'm fragile, whisper, and I'll be left out. I can't keep my mind from running that film, so I'm jittery and can't focus right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take another pause and focus on the sensations in your body. Notice the numbness in your feet, the tightness in your chest, and the tingling in your hands. As you notice these sensations, say to yourself: "These are just sensations in my body. They are not my thoughts. They are not my reality. They are just physical sensations."

Patient: I say it to myself — "These are just sensations..." — and for a beat my chest eases and my feet feel a little more solid. Then the fortune-teller yells that it's a fake calm before the fall: they'll notice my hands tremble, whisper about me, stop inviting me, and I'm back to being alone. I'm really jittery and can't hold on to the calm — can we go slower, maybe guide me through one slow breath?

Therapist: Let's focus on one slow breath, together. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am calm and safe." As you inhale, imagine fresh air filling your lungs, and as you exhale, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body. Take another slow breath in, and again, say to yourself: "I am calm and safe." Notice how your body feels as you breathe.

Patient: I tried to breath with you — the inhale loosened my chest for a beat, but the fortune-teller immediately yanks me back: I tell myself “I am calm and safe” now, then later they'll notice my hands shaking, whisper, stop inviting me, and I'm alone again. It feels like a lie and now I'm way more jittery and can't hold the breath long enough — can we slow down and do one very slow, guided breath together?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As we breathe in, imagine you're inhaling a calm, soothing light that fills your entire body. As you exhale, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body, like leaves falling off a tree. Now, as you pause at the top of your breath, before we exhale, I want you to say to yourself: "This moment, exactly as it is, without judgment or change." Can you try that with me?

Patient: I try to say it — "this moment exactly as it is..." — and for a beat things ease, but the fortune-teller immediately screams that it's just the calm before the fall: they'll see me calm now, later notice my hands trembling, whisper, stop inviting me, and I'm alone again. My chest's racing and my head's scrambled; I can't hold that phrase or focus. Can we go much slower — like you count one very slow breath for me and tell me each step? I'm really overwhelmed and need the pace to slow.

Therapist: Let's take a very slow, deep breath in together. I'll count it for you: "One...". As you inhale, feel the air fill your lungs, and your body relax a bit. Hold for a moment... Two... Feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the weight of your body in your chair. Hold again... Three... Notice the sensation of your chest, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Hold... Four... Imagine a gentle, calming light filling your body, and any tension or anxiety leaving. Hold... Five... And as we pause at the top of the breath, I want you to say to yourself: "I am calm and safe." Say it with me: "I am calm and safe."

Patient: I tried to say it with you — "I am calm and safe" — but my voice shook and the fortune-teller immediately screamed that it's just a lull before the fall: later they'll see my hands trembling, they'll whisper, stop inviting me, and I'll be alone. I'm really jittery and can't hold the breath; can you slow way down and lead me through one very slow breath step-by-step, telling me exactly when to inhale, hold, and exhale?

Therapist: Let's take a very, very slow breath together. I'll count it for you, and I want you to follow my lead. Breathe in slowly through your nose, counting to four: "Inhale... one... two... three... four..." As you inhale, feel the air fill your lungs, and your body relax a bit. Hold your breath for a moment... Count to five: "Hold... one... two... three... four... five..." Now, slowly exhale through your mouth, counting to four: "Exhale... one... two... three... four..." As you exhale, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body. Hold for another moment... Count to five: "Hold... one... two... three... four... five..." Now, pause for a moment... Take a deep breath in again, counting to four: "Inhale... one... two... three... four..."

Patient: I breathed in like you said — felt it loosen my chest for a beat, then the fortune-teller slammed the door: they'll notice my hands trembling later, whisper about me, stop inviting me, and I'll be back alone. I can't hold the calm; I'm jittery and scattered — can you slow way down and tell me exactly when to exhale, counting each second as you guide me through it?

Therapist: Let's take another very, very slow breath together. I'll count each second for you, and I want you to follow my lead. Breathe in slowly through your nose... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause for a moment) Exhale slowly through your mouth... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause for a moment) Hold your breath... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause for a moment) Take another slow breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause for a moment) Now, exhale slowly... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause for a moment) As you exhale, say to yourself: "I am calm and safe." Say it with me: "I am calm and safe."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is counting to ten supposed to help? I'm trying to breathe but I'm jittery and distracted; the fortune-teller in my head immediately yells that this is a fake calm and later they'll notice my hands trembling, whisper, and I'll be left out. I feel flustered—can you slow right down and walk me through one tiny inhale and exhale step-by-step?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny, tiny breath together. First, breathe in slowly through your nose, just for one second. Inhale... 1... (pause) Now, hold your breath for just one second... 1... (pause) Now, exhale slowly through your mouth, just for one second... 1... (pause) Now, hold your breath again for just one second... 1... (pause) Now, exhale again, just for one second... 1... (pause) Can you focus on just this tiny inhale and exhale, without thinking about the thoughts or the outcome? Just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you try that with me?

Patient: I can try, but I keep getting this hot shame and frustration—like I'm back at some failure—and it makes the breath feel pointless. The fortune-teller immediately screams that even this tiny breath won't stop the chain: they'll notice my shaking later, whisper, and I'll be left out. I'm really distracted—please walk me through one single one-second inhale and exhale very slowly, telling me exactly when to start and stop.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny, tiny breath together. First, start by closing your eyes and taking a deep breath in, just for one second. As you inhale, start counting: 1... (pause) Now, hold your breath for just one second... 1... (pause) Now, exhale slowly through your mouth, and say to yourself: "I am okay" as you exhale. (exhale) 1... (pause) Now, hold your breath again for just one second... 1... (pause) Now, exhale again, and say to yourself: "I am okay" as you exhale. (exhale) 1... (pause) Remember, just focus on the sensation of the breath, and the words "I am okay". Don't think about the thoughts or the outcome, just the physical sensation of the breath. Can you try that with me?

Patient: I tried to say "I am okay" — it loosens me for a beat, then a hot shame floods in and the fortune-teller screams that it’s pointless: later they'll see my trembling hands, whisper, and I'll be excluded. My voice's shaking and I can't keep the breath; can you very slowly tell me exactly when to inhale and exhale, one second at a time, and stay with me through it?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny, tiny breath together. First, start by taking a deep breath in... (pause) inhale... 1... (pause) Hold your breath for just one second... 1... (pause) Now, slowly exhale... (exhale) 1... (pause) As you exhale, notice the sensation of your breath leaving your body... 1... (pause) Now, hold your breath again for just one second... 1... (pause) As you hold, notice the sensation of your body... 1... (pause) Now, slowly inhale again... (inhalation) 1... (pause) Hold your breath for just one second... 1... (pause) As you hold, notice the sensation of your body... 1... (pause) Now, slowly exhale again... (exhalation) 1... (pause) As you exhale, notice the sensation of your breath leaving your body... 1... (pause) We'll keep going, one second at a time.

Patient: I'm trying but I'm really confused and ashamed — that one-second breathing drags up this hot failure-feeling and the fortune-teller screams it's all fake and later they'll notice my trembling and stop inviting me. My hands are shaking and I can't keep the rhythm on my own; please count each second out loud and tell me exactly when to inhale and exhale, and stay with me through the whole breath. I'm overwhelmed — can you slow way down and guide me through one tiny breath step-by-step?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny, tiny breath together. First, start by taking a deep breath in... (pause) I'm going to count for you: inhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... 4... (pause) Now, hold your breath for just one second... 5... (pause) Hold... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Now, slowly exhale... (exhalation) I'm going to count for you: exhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... 5... (pause) Now, hold your breath again for just one second... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Hold... 8... (pause) As you hold, notice the sensation of your body... 9... (pause) Now, slowly inhale again... (inhalation) I'm going to count for you: inhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... 4... (pause) Your body is relaxing... 5... (pause) Now, slowly exhale again... (exhalation) I'm going to count for you: exhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... 5... (pause) And we'll keep going, one second at a time. Are you ready to try again?

Patient: I don't know — I'm confused and a hot shame just popped up, so I don't feel ready. When I try, the fortune-teller starts yelling that it's all fake calm and later people will notice my hands shaking and stop inviting me, and that makes me jittery and unable to follow. If we're doing it again, please go very, very slowly and count each second out loud, telling me exactly when to inhale, hold, and exhale, and stay with me through the whole one tiny breath.

Therapist: Let's start again, and I'll go very, very slowly. We'll take one tiny breath together. I'm going to count for you, and I want you to follow my lead. Here we go... inhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... 4... (pause) Now, hold your breath... 5... (pause) Hold... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Now, slowly exhale... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... 5... (pause) Now, hold your breath again... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Hold... 8... (pause) As you hold, notice the sensation of your body... 9... (pause) Now, slowly inhale again... (inhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... 4... (pause) Your body is relaxing... 5... (pause) Now, slowly exhale again... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... 5... (pause) We're going to pause for just a moment... and when we start again, I'll count for you. Ready?

Patient: I... I'm not sure I'm ready — I'm confused and that hot shame just flashed up and my hands are already shaking. The fortune-teller's yelling that this is all fake calm and later they'll notice and stop inviting me. If we're doing it, please go painfully slow and count each second out loud and tell me exactly when to inhale, hold, and exhale, and stay with me through the whole breath.

Therapist: I want to support you in taking this tiny breath. Let's take it one second at a time. I'm going to count for you, and I want you to follow my lead. Here we go... (pause) inhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... (pause) 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... (pause) 4... (pause) hold... 5... (pause) Hold... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Now, slowly exhale... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... (pause) 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... (pause) 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... (pause) 5... (pause) Now, hold your breath again... (pause) 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Hold... 8... (pause) As you hold, notice the sensation of your body... (pause) 9... (pause) Now, slowly inhale again... (inhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... (pause) 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... (pause) 4... (pause) Your body is relaxing... (pause) 5... (pause) Now, slowly exhale again... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... (pause) 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... (pause) 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... (pause) 5... We'll pause for just a moment... (pause) I want you to take a deep breath in... (pause) and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself: "I am enough

Patient: I tried to say "I am enough" as I exhaled, but a hot shame slammed into me—like that time I froze in front of people—and the fortune-teller immediately yells that it's fake calm and later they'll notice my trembling hands, whisper, and stop inviting me. My voice is shaking and I can't hold the breath; can you please go even slower and count me through one breath while saying the phrase with me, step by step?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny breath together. I'm going to count for you, and I want you to follow my lead. Here we go... (pause) inhale... 1... (pause) Your breath is moving into your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your lungs are filling with air... (pause) 3... (pause) Your chest is expanding... (pause) 4... hold... 5... (pause) Hold... 6... (pause) Hold... 7... (pause) Now, slowly exhale... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... (pause) 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... (pause) 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... (pause) 5... Now, I want you to say to yourself: "I am" 1... (pause) You can say it with me: "I am" 2... (pause) One word, one syllable... 3... (pause) "en" 4... (pause) You're saying the word "en" with me... 5... (pause) "ough" 6... (pause) You're saying the word "ough" with me... 7... (pause) Now, slowly exhale again... (exhalation) 1... (pause) Your breath is leaving your body... (pause) 2... (pause) Your chest is relaxing... (pause) 3... (pause) Your lungs are emptying... (pause) 4... (pause) Your body is releasing... (pause) 5...

Patient: I tried to say "I am enough" with you, but a hot shame slammed into me and I couldn't finish — I'm not sure I follow how this helps right now. The fortune-teller screamed that it's fake calm and later they'll notice my trembling hands, whisper, and stop inviting me, so my voice shook and I froze. Can we go painfully slow, one tiny syllable at a time, and can you stay with me while I try again?
