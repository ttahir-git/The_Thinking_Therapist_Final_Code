--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been really anxious about social situations lately and have started avoiding gatherings with my few close friends. I work as a software developer in my late twenties and family conflict's been making everything worse. I don't know, talking about it like this feels... uncomfortable, but it's been on my mind.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses discomfort with emotional topics and feels anxious about social interactions. Core emotion is unease. Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of avoidance behavior to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we're feeling uncomfortable, especially when it comes to discussing difficult topics. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes social gatherings feel overwhelming or uncomfortable for you? Is it the fear of judgment, the pressure to be witty or entertaining, or something else entirely?

Patient: I guess it's a mix of fear of judgment and feeling like I have to be witty or entertaining, and then I just freeze—my heart races and I can't think straight. With all the family tension lately I'm already on edge, so small talk feels impossible and I end up making excuses to skip things. I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to talk about.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses multiple themes, including fear of judgment, pressure to be entertaining, feeling stuck and unable to function under pressure, and recent family tension amplifying anxiety. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Pivoting to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the added stress from family conflict is making it hard for you to muster up the energy to participate in social situations. Can you imagine what might happen if, instead of trying to manage or overcome your anxiety in these situations, you simply allowed yourself to be present with whatever feelings arose, without judgment or expectation of success?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the idea sounds okay in theory, but when I try it I worry I'll just get overwhelmed and start panicking. It feels unsafe, like if I stop controlling things the feelings will take over and people will see me fall apart. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses concern about feeling overwhelmed and losing control, indicating defusion needs. Core emotion is fear of loss of control. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and observe the thought "I'll fall apart" in a more neutral way. Can you say it with me: "I am having the thought that I'll fall apart"? Notice how that feels in your body and what images or sensations arise when you say it?

Patient: "I am having the thought that I'll fall apart." Saying it makes my chest tighten and my breathing get shallow; my hands go a bit tingly and I get this image of myself crumpling while everyone watches. I don't know, it feels embarrassing and makes me want to change the subject—can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses physical sensations, emotional discomfort, and defusion is still needed. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Explore the connection between physical sensations and values.

Therapist Answer:
The physical sensations you're experiencing when thinking about falling apart are quite vivid. What's the value of feeling capable and confident in social situations, and how do you think that might be related to these physical sensations when you imagine losing control?

Patient: I guess feeling capable means not being embarrassed, that people take me seriously, and I can just relax and be myself. When I imagine losing control my body's doing alarm stuff—chest tight, brain goes fuzzy—and it feels like proof I'm failing, so I want to get out of there. I don't know, saying that feels weirdly raw—can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient identifies a value of feeling capable and a clear connection between physical sensations and shame. Core emotion is self-doubt. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Those feelings of being "failing" and wanting to escape are actually quite common reactions to feeling overwhelmed. Can you imagine, instead of trying to avoid those feelings, what would be like to allow yourself to feel them, as if you were observing them from a gentle, curious distance?

Patient: I guess I can imagine it—like standing outside my feelings and watching the panic instead of fighting it. But when I actually try that my breathing speeds up, my thoughts go fuzzy, and it feels unsafe so I want to run. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows willingness to imagine alternative to struggle, but still struggles to maintain it. Core emotion is self-doubt. Goal: Create small, experiential step towards willingness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a tiny step towards that outside observation. Instead of "I'll try to watch my panic," say to yourself "I am observing my breath right now, as it rises and falls." Can you focus on that simple sensation of your breath for just one more beat, without trying to change it or do anything with it?

Patient: I tried to do that for a beat—my breath felt shallow and fast, like it barely moved, and my chest stayed tight. I don't know, I guess focusing just made my brain latch onto worst-case thoughts instead of calming down. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient struggles to maintain focus and ends up getting caught in worst-case thinking. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, and explore small steps towards valued action.

Therapist Answer:
It's actually quite common for the mind to get caught up in worst-case thinking, especially when we're trying to calm down. Instead of focusing on your thoughts, can you try taking a very small physical action that doesn't require your full attention? For example, can you notice how your feet are touching the ground right now, or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: I tried noticing my feet on the ground—there was a dull pressure under my heels but my chest stayed tight and my mind kept jumping to worst-case stuff. I don't know, it helped a tiny bit for a second but then the panic pulled me back. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows willingness to try small physical actions, but struggles to maintain focus. Core emotion is self-doubt. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body and mind are like two trains that are hard to keep in sync. One train (your body) is trying to relax, but the other train (your mind) is jumping to worst-case scenarios. Can you imagine having a tiny "pause" between the two trains, where you observe the sensations in your body without judgment, and allow them to happen without trying to "fix" or change them?

Patient: I guess I can kinda imagine that tiny pause—like a half-second where my chest doesn't leap and there's a little gap before the worst-case thoughts. When I actually try to notice it, I feel a faint space, but my brain almost instantly jumps back to panicking and imagining everyone noticing. I don't know, holding even that small curiosity feels scary and makes me want to run. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows ability to imagine tiny pause, but struggles to maintain curiosity and feels scared by holding onto it. Core emotion is fear of loss of control. Goal: Pivoting to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're standing at the edge of a small lake, and your brain is like a strong current that's pulling you back into the water. Instead of fighting the current, what if you allowed yourself to float on the surface of the water, with no need to swim or do anything? What would it be like to simply exist on the surface, with the water supporting you, but still allowing the current to move beneath you?

Patient: I guess imagining floating feels kind of... relieving and terrifying at the same time—I like the idea of being supported, but I also panic thinking I won't be in control and people will notice me drifting. My chest tightens just picturing it and I want to change the subject. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but it's hard.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows willingness to imagine floating, but struggles with ambivalence and fear of losing control. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Your brain is caught between the desire for support and the fear of being overwhelmed. Can you try to notice the sensations in your body when you say "I won't be in control" to yourself? What happens in your body when you think that thought?

Patient: I don't know... when I think "I won't be in control" my chest tightens, my throat feels like it's closing, and my hands get tingly like I want to run. My mind goes blank and I get this hot flush—I just want to change the subject or leave because it's embarrassing. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but I'm really struggling.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient vividly describes physical sensations associated with worst-case thinking, indicating strong defusion needs. Core emotion is avoidance. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and pivot to introducing willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is reacting strongly to the thought "I won't be in control". Can you say it with me: "I am having the thought that I won't be in control"? Notice the sensations that arise when you say it, and then I want to ask you: What would it be like if, instead of trying to avoid this thought or change it, you simply allowed it to be true, without judgment or reaction?

Patient: "I am having the thought that I won't be in control." Saying that makes my chest clamp up, my throat tightens, my hands go tingly, and my mind blanks out. I don't know—if I let that be true without judging it, I guess it might be oddly freeing because I'm not fighting it, but mostly it feels terrifying and exposed and I instantly want to run. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects but I'm really struggling.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient vividly describes physical sensations associated with worst-case thinking, and shows willingness to experiment with allowing the thought to be true without judgment. Core emotion is fear of vulnerability. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is reacting as if it's under attack, and your mind is trying to protect you by distancing itself from the thought. Can you imagine, for just a tiny moment, that it's okay to be in this space of not being in control? What would it be like to allow yourself to feel the sensations in your body without trying to fight them or change them?

Patient: I don't know... I guess for a tiny moment it might feel lighter, like I could breathe without having to perform. But then this hot shame and frustration clamps my chest and I just want to get out, and I can't even explain why. Can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with it but I'm really struggling.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows glimmer of willingness to explore feeling lighter, but gets caught in shame and frustration. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Create space from shame and introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like shame is trying to show up, making it hard for you to stay with the feeling of lightness. Can you acknowledge the shame for a moment, without judgment or self-criticism? Just notice it, like a whisper in the background. And then I want to ask: What would it be like to have some compassion for yourself, even in this moment of shame?

Patient: I can notice the shame there, this voice telling me I'm weak or pathetic, and that just tightens my chest and makes it impossible to be kind to myself. I guess if I tried to be compassionate I'd say, "it's okay to feel anxious, you're doing the best you can," but saying that feels hollow and makes me want to run. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient acknowledges shame and tries to offer self-compassion, but feels that trying to be kind to oneself feels hollow. Core emotion is shame and self-doubt. Goal: Create space from shame and introduce willingness to practice self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the voice of self-criticism is very powerful for you, and it's hard to quiet it down. Can you imagine that this voice is just a story, a narrative that you're telling yourself, rather than a reflection of your true nature? What would it be like to listen to this story with a sense of curiosity, rather than judgment?

Patient: I guess I can try to see it as a story, but I don't know—when I do that this hot shame just floods in and I feel... pathetic, like it's actually true, and then I get pissed at myself for feeling that way. Trying to be curious about it feels fake and makes me want to change the subject or just leave. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient struggles to maintain curiosity about the narrative, and gets caught in the shame and self-criticism loop. Core emotion is self-criticism. Goal: Create space from the shame and self-criticism narrative.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame and self-criticism are a very powerful and familiar story for you, and it's hard to approach it with curiosity. Can you try to imagine that you're observing this story from a distance, like a book that you're reading and not necessarily agreeing with? What would it be like to read this story without judgment, and simply notice what's happening in your body and mind?

Patient: I guess if I try to read it like a book I can see the patterns, but then this hot shame—like that one stupid failure—just floods in and I feel pathetic and want to shut the book. I don't know, trying to observe it feels kind of fake and makes me want to change the subject or leave. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows glimmer of willingness to observe the narrative, but gets caught in the shame and self-criticism loop. Core emotion is self-criticism. Goal: Introduce willingness to take action despite feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're really close to making a decision to shut down, but I want to ask one more question: What would it be like to take a tiny, small step towards engaging with this story, not to analyze or change it, but simply to acknowledge it? Not to the point of getting caught up in the shame, but just to notice that you're noticing it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I just noticed the story it might take some of its punch away, like it wouldn't feel like a verdict. But right now my chest's tight, shame floods in and I get angry at myself, and my head's jumping all over—I'm really distracted and want to get out. Can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with it but it's hard.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows willingness to acknowledge the story, but gets caught in shame and self-criticism. Core emotion is shame and self-criticism. Goal: Pivoting to introducing willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to take a small step back from the shame, and that's a great start. Let's try something even smaller. Can you just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground right now, without trying to change anything or react to anything?

Patient: Okay—I can feel my feet on the floor, like a dull pressure under my heels and the balls of my feet are a bit tingly. But my chest's still tight and this hot shame keeps creeping in and my thoughts are all over the place, so I can't really focus. I don't know, can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows ability to notice physical sensations, but struggles to maintain focus and get past shame. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Pivoting to introducing willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is trying to ground you in the present moment, and that's a great anchor. Let's try to stay with that physical sensation of your feet on the floor, and then I want to ask: What's one small thing you can do, right now, to take care of yourself, without trying to control or change anything?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one small thing I can do right now is stand up and step outside for a minute—just get some air and feel my feet on the pavement. My chest's still tight and this stupid shame is nagging at me, so I'm kind of shaky—can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient finds small action that takes care of themselves, but gets caught in shame and self-doubt. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Pivoting to introducing willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like standing up and taking a short walk outside was a great idea, and that you're taking care of yourself in a small way. As you're outside, notice how your body feels without trying to change anything. Can you just be with the sensation of your feet touching the pavement, without trying to push away the shame or self-doubt?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the pavement—cool on my toes and a dull pressure under my heels—but my chest's still tight and this hot shame keeps creeping up. My thoughts keep jumping to worst-case stuff and I can't hold the noticing for more than a beat. I don't know, I'm really distracted and shaky—can we slow down? I'm struggling to stay with this.

Patient shows ability to notice physical sensations, but struggles to maintain focus and get past shame. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Introduce willingness to accept the experience of shame, rather than trying to change or avoid it.

Therapist Answer:
It's like your body is trying to hold onto the sensation of the pavement, but the shame is pushing in. Can you try to allow the shame to be present, without trying to push it away or change it? Can you simply acknowledge that it's there, like a cloud passing across the sky?

Patient: I don't know... I can notice the shame like a hot cloud hovering in my chest, and it just makes me feel smaller and kind of sick. I guess if I let it sit for a beat it loses a little punch, but mostly my thoughts start racing and I get shaky—can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient shows ability to acknowledge and observe shame, but struggles with thoughts and physical sensations. Core emotion is shame. Goal: Introduce willingness to accept the experience of shame in its entirety.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the shame is trying to shrink you down, and that's really tough. Can you try to notice how your body is responding to the shame, without trying to change it? Can you simply be with the sensation of your heart beating, your chest feeling tight, and your mind racing, without trying to fix or make sense of it?

Patient: My heart's racing, my chest feels like it's caving in, and my hands tingle—there's this hot shame that just floods me and my mind shoots to worst-case things. I don't know, when I try to sit with it I get pissed at myself and the urge to run is immediate. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is in a state of overwhelm, and it's hard to stay with the sensations. Can you try to look at the shame and self-criticism not as something you're fighting or trying to escape, but as something that's actually happening right now, in this moment? Can you simply acknowledge that it's present, without judgment or reaction?

Patient: I can kinda notice it—this hot shame sitting in my chest and that voice calling me pathetic. It clamps my breathing, makes me angry at myself, and my mind just jumps everywhere so I'm really distracted and shaky. I don't know if I can stay with it—can we slow down? I'm really struggling.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're standing at the edge of a wave, and the shame is crashing down on you. Can you try to find a rock or a anchor that you can hold onto, something that feels solid and real, and use that to ground yourself in the present moment?

Patient: I guess the rock is the weight of my feet on the pavement and the steadiness in my legs—focusing on that helps a tiny bit. But this hot shame keeps crawling up and I get frustrated with myself, my hands are tingling and my mind keeps darting, so I'm really distracted and feel like running. Can we slow down? I'm struggling to stay with this.

Patient finds a small anchor, but struggles to maintain focus and get past shame. Core emotion is self-criticism. Goal: Create space for acceptance of shame and self-criticism.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your anchor is helping, but the shame is still trying to move in. Can you try to hold onto the weight of your feet on the pavement, and then gently ask yourself: What would it be like if, for just one more moment, you allowed the shame to be exactly as it is, without judgment or reaction?

Patient: I guess if I try that—holding my feet and letting the shame be—it softens a little, like it sits heavy instead of stabbing, and I can actually breathe for a second. But then my chest clamps, my hands tingle, and my thoughts ricochet to worst-case stuff and I get pissed at myself and want to run. I don't know, can we slow down?

It sounds like your body is trying to come back to its default state of panic, but you're holding onto the anchor of your feet on the pavement. Can you try to find the breath that's available in this moment, the one that's not getting caught up in the shame or self-criticism? Can you simply notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or react to it?

Patient: I can try to notice the breath—there's a tiny in and out, but it's shallow and kind of stuck high in my chest. My chest clamps, my hands tingle, and this hot shame just floods back in and makes my thoughts go everywhere. I don't know, I can hold it for a beat but then my mind ricochets to worst-case stuff and I want to run. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to stay with this.
