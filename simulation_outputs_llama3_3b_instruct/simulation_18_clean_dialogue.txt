Patient: Hi. I'm an accountant and lately what's been on my mind is how angry and frustrated I get, mostly around money and the ongoing financial stress. I don't know, even small financial interactions—bills, calls, budgeting—set me off and it feels like my OCD makes it worse. I guess I'm just... overwhelmed and don't always know how to stop myself.

Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like your OCD is definitely contributing to your feelings of overwhelm. When you feel like you're losing control around money, what's one small, immediate action you could take to make room for some calmness and clarity, such as taking a few deep breaths or going for a short walk, to help you regain your footing?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try stepping away for a few minutes, like going outside or just sitting down and taking a few deep breaths. It feels kind of pointless sometimes, though, because when a bill or a call is happening it's hard to justify stopping.

Therapist: Can you think of a situation where you value being in control and productive, and how that feeling relates to your current experience with bills and calls? What would it mean to you to be able to navigate these situations in a way that feels more aligned with that value?

Patient: I really value being in control and productive when I'm closing the books at work—having everything reconciled and on time makes me feel competent. With bills and calls I feel the opposite—like everything's messy and I get tense and snap, which just makes it harder to actually sort things out. I don't know, I guess being able to handle them calmly would mean not feeling like I'm failing and maybe feeling less on edge all the time.

Therapist: Those thoughts can be really painful. Can you imagine having the opportunity to work with those feelings, to examine the thought "I'm failing" as a thought, rather than a reflection of reality, and treat it with kindness and curiosity, as if it's just a thought passing through, rather than a label you're clinging to?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to think of "I'm failing" as just a thought, but it feels really abstract and kind of fake when I'm in the moment. When a bill or a call hits, my chest tightens and being kind to myself just doesn't register — I end up snapping or freezing. How would I even start doing that when I'm right in the middle of it?

Therapist: Can you try simply noticing the physical sensations in your chest when you think "I'm failing" right now, without any attempt to change or label them? Just observe them as they are, without judgment, and see what happens.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try. My chest feels really tight, like a heavy band, and my breathing is shallow; my shoulders are tense and my stomach's flipped. It feels kind of pointless to just notice it though — I keep wanting to jump up and do something about the bill instead. Uh, how long am I supposed to stay with this before I have to actually handle the thing?

Therapist: What would it be like for you to pause for just 30 seconds, or 1 minute, before responding to the bill or call, without immediately taking action? Would that create some space for a different kind of response, or a sense of calmness, that might help you handle the situation more skillfully?

Patient: I don't know... maybe pausing for 30 seconds could stop me from blowing up, but it feels really hard when my adrenaline's already up. I guess I could try telling myself to wait or put the call on hold, but I'm worried I'll look stupid or miss something important. It just feels pointless sometimes—like if I don't do something right away the problem gets worse—so I don't know how to trust that a pause would actually help.

Therapist: Can you explore the idea that taking control of the situation, by responding immediately, might actually be driven by a desire to avoid feeling vulnerable or uncertain? What would it mean to you to be able to handle these situations in a way that feels more aligned with your values of competence and control, even if it means taking a pause?

Patient: I don't know... I guess jumping in feels like a way to hide the vulnerability—like if I act fast I don't have to admit I'm unsure or scared. Being able to pause would probably mean I'm actually in control and not just reacting, which sounds... freeing, but also kind of terrifying. I don't know how to trust that a pause won't just make me look incompetent or let things fall apart.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the value of being in control is not necessarily about being able to respond immediately, but about being able to respond in a way that feels authentic and kind to yourself? What would it mean to you to be able to respond in a way that honors your values, even if it means taking a pause or seeking support?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I'm actually choosing how to act instead of just reacting, and maybe I'd feel less ashamed afterward. But it's really scary — pausing feels like admitting I might not know what to do, and I don't know how to trust that it won't screw things up. How would I even start practicing that without everything collapsing?

Therapist: Would you be willing to create a small signal, just for today, to remind yourself that it's okay to pause and seek help? Perhaps we could start with a simple phrase, like "I've got this" or "I'll take a moment," and use it whenever you feel the urge to jump in without a pause.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try saying "I'll take a moment" when I feel the urge to jump in. I'm nervous I'll forget or it'll feel dumb, but I'll try to use it today if a bill or call comes up.

Therapist: Can you imagine that using the phrase "I'll take a moment" is not about being clever or confident, but about taking care of yourself and showing up for the situation in a more mindful way?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that makes sense — it's less about being clever and more about being gentle with myself. It still feels awkward and vulnerable, like admitting weakness, but I'll try saying it when I feel the urge to jump in. How do I actually make myself remember to use it when the adrenaline hits?

Therapist: Can you think of a small physical sensation, like the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sensation of your breath at the base of your nose, that you can use to signal to yourself to pause and take a moment?

Patient: I don't know... maybe noticing my feet on the floor — like the weight in my heels — or the small cool spot where air hits the base of my nose. I guess I'll try the feet; it feels easier to find than my breath when I'm panicked, but I'm worried I'll still forget when it matters.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to respond to a bill or call in a way that feels true to your values of competence and kindness, even if it's not the first response that comes to mind?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would mean I could handle things without spiraling and then hating myself afterward. But when I think about that I get this hot shame and frustration—like I'm already showing I'm a mess—so it's hard to trust that pausing won't just prove me wrong. I want that calm response, I just don't know how to get from here to there without freaking out.

Therapist: Can you explore the idea that the shame and frustration you're feeling right now might be motivated by a desire to protect yourself from feeling like a failure, rather than a genuine fear of making a mistake? What would it be like to approach yourself with kindness and compassion, rather than judgment, when you're in a situation like this?

Patient: I don't know... I guess being kind to myself sounds right, but in the moment I get this hot shame and I just start tearing myself down. I can't even picture what a compassionate response would actually sound like when a bill or call is happening—it feels fake. Could you give a concrete example of something I could say or do in that exact moment? I'm worried it'll just make me look weak or let things fall apart.

Therapist: Can you try saying to yourself, in the exact moment you feel the urge to react, "I'm doing the best I can in this moment" or "I'm here for this situation, and I'll take a moment to respond thoughtfully"? This is not meant to be a grand or inspiring phrase, but rather a simple acknowledgment of your current situation.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try saying "I'm doing the best I can," but when that shame spikes it just feels fake and I get really angry at myself instead. It makes me want to snap or hang up, so I'm worried it'll just make things worse. Can you give me a really short, concrete phrase or tiny action I could actually do on a call that won't make me sound weak or make me hate myself afterward?

Therapist: Can you try placing your hand on your heart or the center of your chest when you feel the urge to react, and just staying there for a moment without doing anything else? This small physical gesture can help you create a tiny pause without feeling like you're doing something obvious or dramatic.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try putting my hand on my chest. That hot shame spikes when you say that and I worry I'll just want to snap or hang up, but maybe holding it for a few breaths could help—how long should I try doing it?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of your hand on your chest, rather than the length of the pause. Can you simply notice the sensation of your hand touching your chest, the feeling of your fingers on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to do anything else or push the pause away?

Patient: I don't know... when I put my hand there I can feel the warmth and my breath feels tight, but this hot shame spikes and I immediately want to do something—snap or hang up. I guess I can try to just notice it for a few breaths, but it feels fragile and I'm really worried it'll make things worse.

Therapist: Can you try asking yourself, in a very gentle and kind voice, "Is my hand on my chest helping me feel more calm and centered, or am I feeling anxious or reactive?" This simple check-in can help you stay present and focused on the physical sensation, rather than getting caught up in shame or impulsive thoughts.

Patient: I don't know... I guess asking that makes my hand feel a little grounding at first, like my breath gets a tiny bit steadier. But then that hot shame spikes and I get pissed at myself and want to snap or hang up, and the grounding just slips away. I don't know how long I'm supposed to check in like that or if it'll actually help on a real call — it all feels kind of fragile.

Therapist: Can you try giving yourself permission to let go of the idea that you need to be perfectly calm or composed in this moment, and instead simply allowing yourself to be as you are, with all your imperfections and impermanence? This might help you feel more grounded and accepting of the present moment, rather than fighting against it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to let go of needing to be perfect, but just thinking about that makes this hot shame flare up and I get really mad at myself. Maybe I could practice at home—saying something like "it's okay" and putting my hand on my chest for a few breaths—but I'm terrified it'll make me look weak on a real call. How do I actually practice this so it becomes automatic and doesn't just fall apart when I'm stressed?

Therapist: Why not try practicing the phrase "it's okay" and putting your hand on your chest in a low-stakes situation, like when you're waiting in line, taking a break at work, or during a quiet moment at home? You could even start small, like saying the phrase to yourself while putting your hand on your chest for just a few seconds, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the process.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try saying "it's okay" and putting my hand on my chest when I'm in line or on a quick break, just for a few seconds. But when that hot shame spikes I get really pissed at myself and it feels like it won't stick — I worry I'll just feel stupid and the grounding will disappear. Can you help me pick something concrete I can actually remember to do, like a 5-second practice or a phone reminder, without it feeling dumb?

Therapist: Let's try setting a phone reminder to take 3-5 deep breaths, right now, as you're finishing this session. As you take those breaths, say to yourself "I'm doing the best I can" and place your hand on your chest. This small, concrete action can help you develop a sense of self-compassion and grounding, and can be a gentle reminder to approach yourself with kindness, even in the midst of stress.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can set a phone reminder right now to take 3 breaths, put my hand on my chest, and say "I'm doing the best I can." When that hot shame spikes I worry it'll feel fake and I'll just get pissed at myself, but maybe starting with one or two reminders today could help it stick. I'd prefer a low‑risk time—maybe my lunch break and mid‑afternoon—because I don't want it going off in meetings and making me feel stupid. Can you help me pick which times are likely to work, or should I just try those two and see how it goes?

Therapist: Why not try setting reminders for your morning coffee break and your lunch break, when you're likely to have some downtime and can focus on the practice? Starting with just one or two reminders and seeing how it goes can help you build momentum and confidence, and you can always adjust as needed.

Patient: I don't know... I guess morning coffee and lunch could work. But just thinking about scheduling it makes that hot shame spike and I get pissed at myself—I'm worried it'll feel fake or I'll ignore it. Can we make them super discreet, like vibration-only with a tiny label ("breath"), and maybe just start with the lunch one to see if I actually do it?

Therapist: Let's keep the reminders vibration-only with a tiny label ("breath") to minimize visual cues and potential triggers. Starting with just the lunch break reminder and keeping it brief and simple can help you build confidence and get a feel for the practice. Remember, the goal is not to add more complexity or pressure, but to take small steps towards developing a more compassionate and mindful response.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try the lunch vibration-only "breath" reminder. Just thinking about setting it makes that hot shame spike and I get really pissed at myself, so I'm worried I'll ignore it or resent it when it goes off. Could we pick a specific time—like 12:30 when I'm usually on break—and a simple, concrete thing to do when it buzzes (3 breaths, hand on chest, say "I'm doing the best I can")? I don't want to mess it up and then just spiral.

Therapist: Let's set the reminder for 12:30 PM, exactly when you're on your scheduled break. When the vibration goes off, take 3 slow, deep breaths, place your hand on your chest, and simply say "I'm doing the best I can" to yourself. That's it. No need to do anything else, just acknowledge the phrase and the physical sensations. This small, concrete action can help you build a sense of trust and confidence in the practice.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try the 12:30 vibration reminder and do the 3 breaths, hand on chest, and say "I'm doing the best I can." Just thinking about it makes that hot shame spike and I can feel myself bracing to ignore it or beat myself up if I mess up. Can we also pick a tiny backup—like a second, discreet reminder at 12:35—so I don't spiral if I miss the first one?

Therapist: Let's set a second reminder for 12:35 PM, vibration-only with the same simple phrase "I'm doing the best I can". When the second reminder goes off, try saying it again, without judgment, and simply acknowledge the fact that you missed the first one. You can even say something like "oops, I missed the first one, but I'm going to try again". This gentle, non-judgmental response can help you develop a sense of kindness and compassion towards yourself, even when you make mistakes.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try the two reminders at 12:30 and 12:35. But just saying that makes this hot shame spike and I get really pissed at myself—I can already see myself silencing them and then spiraling. Could we make the backup even dumber-simple, like just saying out loud “okay, next time” if I miss them, so it doesn’t feel like admitting some huge failure?

Therapist: Let's set the second reminder for 12:35 PM, and when it goes off, simply say "okay" out loud, without any elaboration or judgment. This tiny response can help you acknowledge the fact that you missed the first reminder without triggering shame or self-criticism. The goal is not to achieve some kind of grand response, but to take small, gentle steps towards developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll try the two reminders—12:30 for the 3 breaths/hand on chest/"I'm doing the best I can" and 12:35 to just say "okay" out loud. But just planning it makes that hot shame spike and I can already see myself silencing them and getting pissed at myself. How do I say "okay" without sounding like an idiot around coworkers, or what’s a super low‑risk way to do the backup if I miss the first one?

Therapist: Let's try using a barely audible whisper to say "okay" to yourself, so it's not audible to anyone else. This way, you can acknowledge the missed reminder without drawing attention to yourself or sounding silly. Alternatively, you could try subtly wiggling your fingers or tapping your hand on the desk, without making a sound, to signal to yourself that the reminder went off. This small, private action can help you stay connected to the practice without risking embarrassment or judgment.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the finger‑wiggle feels less risky than whispering—I already get that hot shame spike and a whisper might make me cringe. Maybe I'll try subtly wiggling my thumb against my palm or tapping my foot under the desk so no one notices. Can you help me decide which one is the least likely to make me feel exposed when that shame kicks in?
