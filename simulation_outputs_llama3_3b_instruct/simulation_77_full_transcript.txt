--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling stuck for a long time — like my identity's just tied to being an accountant and I don't know what matters to me beyond that. Family conflict's been making it worse, and I keep feeling directionless, anxious about small decisions. I'm skeptical this will change much, but that's what's been on my mind.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is a sense of hopelessness and skepticism. I identify one specific theme as the feeling of being "directionless" and uncertain about your identity beyond being an accountant. 

Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of feeling "directionless" to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you as an accountant? Is there anything that you enjoy or look forward to, even if it's just for a few minutes, that helps you feel more connected to your work or to yourself?

Patient: My typical day's pretty routine — up early, commute, then it's back-to-back spreadsheets, reconciliations, a couple of meetings, and usually eating lunch at my desk to catch up. The only tiny things I notice are my morning coffee and that brief, weirdly satisfying moment when a report finally balances, but it doesn't really stick; it just feels like a momentary glitch. I've tried paying attention to those small things before — how is that supposed to help with the bigger problem of feeling directionless?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your skepticism about paying attention to small things for a bigger impact is understandable, but it's worth exploring how those small moments can be a starting point for increasing values-based meaning. I also notice your core emotion is still hopelessness, but it's being somewhat mitigated by a hint of curiosity.

Goal: Explore the value and potential of paying attention to small, everyday moments as a means to introduce values-based meaning.

Therapist Answer:
Those small moments, like your morning coffee or the satisfaction of balancing a report, might seem insignificant, but they can be seen as tiny sparks that could be fanned into a flame. What if we took one of those moments and asked: What would it be like to savor that feeling for just a minute longer, without the need to get back to work?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? If I pause for a minute, my inbox blows up and I just feel guilty for not working. I've tried mindfulness and small pauses before — they feel okay for a moment, then the same stuck, directionless feeling comes back; so what would you actually have me do that won't just make me more anxious about falling behind?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your concern about feeling guilty and anxious about not working is understandable, and it's clear that the mindfulness exercises haven't been sustainable for you so far. I notice you're still trying to find ways to make the small moments more substantial, which suggests you're motivated to find a solution.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you create space from the feeling of guilt and anxiety associated with your work.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. What if, instead of focusing on work, we took that one-minute pause to simply notice your body and breath? Not to achieve a specific outcome or to get more done, but just to be present with what's already here, without judgment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I've done breathing stuff before and it just makes me feel guilty, like I'm procrastinating while the inbox piles up. If we're going to try it, how long would it be — and what if my mind just snaps back to work or to feeling stuck, like it always does?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your experience with breathing exercises has led to feelings of guilt and doesn't seem to be helping, which suggests that the problem might not be the exercise itself but rather the underlying expectations around it. I notice your skepticism about the potential effectiveness of this approach.

Goal: Create space for defusion and willingness to experiment with a different approach.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tiny, low-stakes experiment: I'll guide you through a 5-second pause, and we'll see what happens. No effort to breathe, no expectation of achieving anything. Just 5 seconds. Can you commit to that?

Patient: Alright — fine, I can try five seconds, but I'm skeptical it’ll do anything. How is that supposed to help when my inbox and everything else are just waiting, and my mind will probably snap right back anyway?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your skepticism is understandable, given the context of your situation. I notice you're still stuck in a cycle of concern about the immediate outcome and the potential for your mind to snap back.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you create a sense of willingness to take a small step towards defusion, despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
What if, after the 5-second pause, we didn't try to "change" anything or achieve a specific outcome? We could simply acknowledge the experience, without judgment, and say something like, "The 5 seconds are over, and you're back here now. What do you notice about your body and breath, right now?"

Patient: I did the five seconds. My shoulders are tight, my breath is shallow, and my mind's already listing emails and chores — I can feel the guilt like a weight. How is that supposed to help when noticing just makes the to-do list louder? It felt a tiny bit calmer for a second, but then I just went right back to thinking about what's next, so I'm still skeptical this actually changes the stuck, directionless thing.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your physical sensations and the feeling of guilt didn't seem to dissipate, and you're still stuck in the cycle of thinking about what's next. I notice that your skepticism is still present, and it's not clear if the exercise had a lasting impact.

Goal: Create space for a more nuanced exploration of the relationship between noticing and your experience of being stuck.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at what's happening when you notice your physical sensations and thoughts. Can you explore the experience of guilt and the feeling of being stuck in a sentence, without judgment? For example, "The guilt is here, and I can feel it as a weight. The feeling of being stuck is also present, and it's like a background hum."

Patient: The guilt is a heavy knot in my chest that tightens whenever I think about the inbox, and the stuckness feels like pacing in a hallway with no doors — I don't know if saying that helps, but that's what it is.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've given a vivid description of your experience, which suggests that you're beginning to access and describe your internal world in more detail. The use of metaphors like the knot in your chest and the pacing in a hallway indicates that you're developing a more nuanced understanding of your emotional state.

Goal: Use the language you've used to describe your experience to create a sense of connection to your values and explore what might be driving your feelings of guilt and stuckness.

Therapist Answer:
The feeling of being stuck in the hallway and the knot in your chest seems to be connected to your concern about the inbox. Can you explore what's valued in that moment? What would it mean to you to feel like you're moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step, and what would be the consequences of not moving forward?

Patient: I guess the things that feel important are being competent and dependable — not screwing up the numbers, keeping things orderly, and not letting my family down. Moving forward, even a tiny step, would mean having a bit of space to make choices that aren't just about work — like actually trying something I might enjoy or saying no to something without spiraling — and feeling less like my whole identity is a job. If I don't, I just get more resentful, drained, and stuck, and I worry the family tension will only get worse. But I don't know — I've tried this values stuff before; how is that supposed to change the stuck feeling when everything else keeps piling up?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified values that are important to you, such as competence, dependability, and not letting others down. These values seem to be driving your feelings of guilt and stuckness, particularly around work. I notice that you're still concerned about the practical consequences of not being able to keep up with work and worry about how it will affect your family.

Goal: Explore the relationship between your values, the practical consequences of not meeting those values, and the sense of stuckness.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the pressure to maintain your current role and meet expectations is creating a sense of tension. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to let go of the need to be perfect in your work, even if it means taking a tiny step back? What would be the worst-case scenario, and how would it differ from the current situation?

Patient: If I let go of needing to be perfect, worst-case is I miss something important — a reconciliation error, my boss notices, maybe a formal reprimand or even losing the job, and my family treats that as proof I'm failing them. That would mean short-term chaos, money stress, and a lot of shame and criticism I don't know how to handle. Right now it's steady pressure but predictable; loosening up might feel terrifying at first but could also stop the constant burnout and give me room to try things that aren't just work. I'm not convinced though — how is risking that supposed to help when the fallout could be so real?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've articulated the potential risks of letting go of the need for perfection, including the fear of losing your job, family criticism, and shame. This fear is understandable, given the potential consequences. I notice that you're still grappling with the tension between the desire to take a break and the potential risks.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you develop a sense of willingness to take a small step towards letting go of the need for perfection, despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine what would be the smallest, most tiny step you could take towards letting go of the need for perfection in your work? It could be as simple as taking a 5-minute break to stretch, or responding to an email with a slightly delayed tone. What would be the smallest action that would feel like a tiny surrender to not needing to be perfect?

Patient: Maybe the smallest thing is to pick one non-urgent email and deliberately not reply until the next morning — let it sit overnight. I can almost hear myself saying it'll just gnaw at me, so how is that supposed to help when I'll just feel guilty and ruminate? Still, I could try that once and see if the guilt actually drops at all.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential small step, but you're still concerned about the guilt and rumination. You're hesitant to take action, as it feels like it won't address the underlying issues. I notice that you're willing to try this small step, despite your reservations.

Goal: Help you develop a sense of willingness to take action despite the uncertainty of the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Let's make a small wager with yourself. If you try this one non-urgent email, and you do feel the guilt and rumination, we can acknowledge those feelings together and say, "Ah, it looks like the same pattern is showing up again." But if, instead, you're able to let that email sit overnight without checking it, what might that mean for your sense of control and agency in your work?

Patient: I guess I could try leaving one non-urgent email overnight, but I'm not convinced — how is that supposed to help when I'll just ruminate and probably check it at 2 a.m.? If I actually manage to let it sit, maybe it'd feel like a tiny reclaiming of control, proof that I don't have to react to every ping, and that could slowly loosen this automatic panic-to-react thing. If I can't, it'll just show how stuck I am and probably make me feel worse, but fine — we'll at least know the pattern. So I'll try it once, but what do you want me to do if the guilt gets so bad I end up replying anyway?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still concerned about the potential for rumination and the possibility of failing to stick to your plan. I notice that you're willing to try the small step, despite your reservations, and that you're thinking about the potential benefits of reclaiming control.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you develop a sense of self-compassion and understanding when you don't meet your own expectations.

Therapist Answer:
If you find that the guilt becomes overwhelming and you end up replying to the email anyway, I want you to acknowledge that it's okay. Say to yourself, "I'm feeling really stuck and struggling with this. It's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. I'm doing the best I can, and that's all I can do."

Patient: Alright — I'll try leaving one non-urgent email overnight. If I cave and reply, I'll try saying to myself, "I'm feeling really stuck and struggling with this. It's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. I'm doing the best I can, and that's all I can do." But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I doubt a little script will stop the panic, though I'll do it once and tell you what happens — and what should I do in the moment if the guilt gets unbearable?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still concerned about the underlying panic and feeling overwhelmed, but you're willing to try the small step and acknowledge your limitations. I notice that you're looking for a way to cope with the unbearable guilt in the moment.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you develop a sense of defusion and self-compassion when the guilt becomes unbearable.

Therapist Answer:
If the guilt becomes too much to bear, I want you to take a pause and say to yourself, "This feeling is just a thought, not a reflection of your worth." Take a deep breath and imagine the thought as a cloud passing by, without judgment. You can also say to yourself, "I'm having a hard time right now, and that's okay. I'll get through this."

Patient: Okay — I'll try the "cloud" line and a quick pause if the guilt spikes, but honestly how is that supposed to help when the panic feels so physical? Sometimes pausing just makes me more anxious — I get lightheaded or start ruminating. If that happens, what’s a concrete thing I can do at my desk that feels less like avoidance and actually helps me keep going?

Therapist Thinking:
You're finding that the mental strategies aren't enough to manage the physical sensations of panic, and you're looking for a more concrete way to cope. I notice that you're still looking for a way to stay present and focused despite the physical symptoms.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you stay grounded and focused in the moment, despite the physical sensations of panic.

Therapist Answer:
If you feel lightheaded or start ruminating, try taking a few deep breaths and placing your feet firmly on the ground. Place one hand on your desk and the other on your knee or thigh, and gently press down. This can help you feel more connected to your body and reduce the sense of floating or disconnection. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here, I am safe, I am present."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is putting my hands on the desk and saying "I am here" supposed to stop the lightheaded, panicked feeling? I've tried grounding and breathing before and it usually just makes me more anxious or sends me straight back to ruminating, so I'm skeptical this will help. If that doesn't work, what's a concrete, practical thing I can do at my desk that actually helps me keep going without feeling like I'm just avoiding the work?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're skeptical about the previous suggestions and looking for a more practical solution. I notice that you're still trying to find a way to cope with the physical sensations of panic without feeling like you're avoiding work.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you find a concrete, work-oriented way to cope with physical sensations of panic while still working.

Therapist Answer:
Try the "3-4-5 exercise". Every time you feel lightheaded or panicked, look down at your feet and notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Then, bring your attention to the sensation of your chair or desk, and notice the feeling of your body sitting in it. Finally, bring your attention to the 3-4-5 count: inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 3, and exhale for a count of 5. This can help you ground yourself in the present moment without feeling like you're avoiding work.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is the 3-4-5 supposed to help when holding my breath literally makes me lightheaded? I've tried breathing and grounding and it usually just ramps the panic, so I'm skeptical; give me a concrete, desk-based fallback that doesn't feel like avoidance. Like step-by-step: stand for 30 seconds, sip water, press feet into the floor — what exactly should I do and for how long when the guilt spikes?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete, desk-based strategy that doesn't involve breathing or grounding, and you're skeptical about the previous suggestions. I notice that you're still trying to find a way to cope with the physical sensations of panic while still working.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you take a small, work-oriented break when the guilt spikes.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the guilt spike, get up from your chair and stand up for 30 seconds. Take a sip of water, and then press your feet into the floor, feeling the weight of your body on the ground. As you stand there, say to yourself, "I can do one task at a time, one email at a time." Focus on the task in front of you, and take a small action on it, even if it's just a tiny one.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is standing up for 30 seconds and sipping water supposed to help when I get lightheaded or when I'm in the middle of a meeting and can't just leave? Sometimes standing makes me dizzy, and I don't always have water handy, so that feels impractical. Also, when you say "take a small action," what exactly do you mean at my desk that won't feel like avoidance but actually moves something forward? I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical it won't just make me more anxious.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned about the practicality of the previous suggestions and worried that they might make you feel more anxious. I notice that you're looking for a way to cope with the physical sensations of panic while still working at your desk.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you find a small, work-oriented task to focus on when the guilt spikes, without feeling like you're avoiding work.

Therapist Answer:
Try taking a brief pause to organize your workspace. When you feel the guilt spike, get up and tidy up your desk, put away any unnecessary papers, or reorganize your notes. This can help you feel more in control and focused on the present moment. Alternatively, if you're in a meeting, you can try taking a brief moment to jot down a key point or idea that you want to remember. This can help you feel like you're making progress and moving forward, without feeling like you're avoiding work.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is tidying my desk supposed to help with the deeper stuck feeling and guilt? It just feels like a way to procrastinate, and half the time the panic comes back harder when I remember the actual work I didn't do. If I'm in a meeting and have to jot something down, what exactly should I write so it actually counts as progress and doesn't just feel like busywork?

Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that tidying your desk or jotting down notes might not address the underlying feelings of guilt and stuckness. I notice that you're looking for a way to make progress on your work, but not just busywork.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you find a small, meaningful task to focus on when the guilt spikes, while still making progress on your work.

Therapist Answer:
Try this: when you feel the guilt spike, take a minute to ask yourself, "What's the smallest, most important task I can do right now that will move this project forward, even if it's just a tiny bit?" Write it down on a sticky note or in an email, and commit to doing it for just 5-10 minutes. This can help you focus on making progress, rather than getting bogged down in feelings of guilt and stuckness.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — can you give me a concrete example of that "smallest, most important task" for my job? Do you mean something like reconciling one account line, drafting a one-sentence clarification email, or updating a single spreadsheet cell? If the guilt spikes during the 5–10 minutes and I start ruminating or checking my inbox, what do I actually do in that moment so it doesn't just spiral? I can try a 5-minute timer and put my phone face-down, but honestly, how is that supposed to make the stuck feeling any less permanent?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a specific, concrete example of a task to focus on, and you're concerned that the 5-10 minute timer might not be enough to prevent a relapse into rumination.

Goal: Introduce a process to help you stay focused on a specific, meaningful task during the 5-10 minute window, and find ways to prevent relapse into rumination.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a concrete example: if you're stuck on a specific report, the smallest, most important task might be to update one single number in the spreadsheet, like a specific account balance. Commit to doing that one update for 5-10 minutes, without checking your email or getting sidetracked. When you feel the guilt spike during that time, remind yourself, "I'm just updating one number, one account balance. I can do that." If you start to feel lightheaded or anxious, take a few deep breaths and focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor. If you find yourself getting sidetracked, acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to the task at hand.

Patient: Okay — I can try the 5‑minute update, but I'm feeling really scattered and anxious right now and I'm not convinced this'll change the stuckness. Quick questions so I don't just flail: if I'm interrupted or worried I'll get dinged for a mistake, should I make the change and add a short note like "TBC — saving work" and save, or leave it as a comment instead? If breathing makes me lightheaded, give me a step‑by‑step desk grounding I can do in place (no standing, no water) — like exactly what to press, count, or say when the guilt spikes so it actually calms me instead of making me ruminate. And finally, what exactly counts as "progress" here — is updating one cell and adding a comment really enough, or will that just feel like busywork?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling anxious and skeptical about the effectiveness of the strategy, and you're looking for more concrete guidance on how to navigate specific situations and define what counts as progress.

Goal: Provide more detailed guidance on handling interruptions, maintaining focus, and defining progress during the 5-minute window.

Therapist Answer:
**Interrupted or worried about mistakes:**
If you're interrupted or concerned about making a mistake, it's usually better to leave the update as a comment on the spreadsheet, with a brief note like "TBC — saving work". This way, you're acknowledging the potential issue and saving your work, while also being honest with your colleagues about the temporary pause.

**Desk grounding (no standing, no water):**
If breathing makes you lightheaded, try this simple exercise:
1. Press your feet firmly on the floor, with your weight evenly distributed between both feet.
2. Say to yourself, "Five" while pressing your toes down into the floor (counting down from 5).
3. As you exhale, say "Zero" while pressing your heels into the floor.
4. Repeat the process, focusing on the sensation of your feet on the floor and the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

**Defining progress:**
Updating one cell and adding a comment might feel like busywork if it doesn't address the underlying stuckness. Consider this: the goal is not to "get it done" or "check off" a task, but to make progress on a specific, meaningful task that moves you closer to your values and goals. Ask yourself, "What's the smallest, most important task I can do right now that will move this project forward, even if it's just a tiny bit?" If updating one cell and adding a comment feels too small, try to identify the next smallest, most meaningful step you can take.

Patient: Okay — I can try the "TBC — saving work" comment if I'm worried, but I'm not sure I follow how that won't just get me pinged by my manager the moment they see it and spike the panic. How is that supposed to help when someone asks about it right then?

Also, the feet-pressing thing — do I say "five" and "zero" out loud or just in my head? Saying numbers out loud at my desk would make me feel more exposed and anxious. I'm jittery and kind of distracted right now, and I keep thinking about family stuff on top of work — if I cave and check the email at 2 a.m., what do I actually do in that moment so I don't spiral even more? I'll try the 5‑minute cell update and the grounding, but I'm skeptical this will change the stuck feeling.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned about how the "TBC — saving work" comment might not be effective in preventing interruptions and potential criticism, and you're questioning the effectiveness of the grounding exercise. I notice that you're still struggling with your emotions and feeling overwhelmed by family concerns.

Goal: Provide more guidance on how to handle potential interruptions and family concerns, and offer an additional strategy for managing those feelings when you cave and check the email.

Therapist Answer:
**Handling interruptions:**
If you're worried about being pinged by your manager, consider having a pre-emptive conversation with them about your work schedule and boundaries. You can say something like, "Hey, I'm going to be working on this task for the next 5 minutes, and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm done." This can help set clear expectations and minimize interruptions.

**Grounding (saying numbers out loud or in your head):**
You're right to be concerned about saying numbers out loud at your desk, which might make you feel more anxious. Instead, try saying the numbers in your head, silently. You can also try repeating a simple phrase, like "I've got this" or "I can do this," to help calm yourself down.

**Managing family concerns when you cave:**
When you feel the urge to check the email at 2 a.m., take a moment to acknowledge the thought, and then ask yourself, "What would I say to a friend in a similar situation?" Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. Say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and I need to take a deep breath and focus on my work. I can check the email later, but for now, I'll just focus on this one task."

Regarding your skepticism about the effectiveness of these strategies, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to be uncertain. The goal is not to "fix" the stuck feeling immediately, but to develop new habits and coping mechanisms that can help you navigate similar situations in the future.

Patient: Okay, I hear you saying this is about building habits, not an instant fix, but I'm still not convinced it actually changes the stuckness. Can you give me an exact, short script to say to my manager so it doesn't sound weak or like an excuse? And if I do cave at 2 a.m. and freak out, what are three exact things I should do in that moment that don't feel like more therapy breathing nonsense — something concrete I can do with my phone at the bedside? I'm exhausted and frustrated that these feel like tiny band‑aids; how long before any of this actually feels different, and what if none of it works?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a more concrete script to share with your manager and a set of immediate actions to take when you feel overwhelmed, despite your skepticism about the long-term effectiveness of the strategies. I notice that you're feeling exhausted and frustrated with the process.

Goal: Provide a concise script and immediate actions to help you communicate with your manager and manage your emotions in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
**Script for your manager:**
Here's a script you can use: "Hey [Manager's Name], I'm feeling overwhelmed with work and taking a short break to recharge. I'll be back to [Specific Task or Project] in 30 minutes. If anything urgent comes up, I'll prioritize it then. Thanks for understanding."

**Immediate actions when you cave at 2 a.m.:**
If you find yourself checking the email at 2 a.m., try the following three concrete actions:

1. Open a new tab or window on your phone and write a single, brief message: "I'm checking email" or "Just checking in." This can help you acknowledge the thought without getting sucked into the email.
2. Take a photo of your phone screen with the email open, and save it to a folder with a label like "Overwhelmed" or "2 a.m. Email Check." This can help you acknowledge the thought without engaging with it further.
3. Set a 5-minute timer on your phone and use the time to do something unrelated to work, like stretching, looking out the window, or doing a quick drawing. This can help you create a small break from the email and give you a brief moment to recharge.

Regarding the effectiveness of these strategies, it's true that it may take time to see results. Building new habits and coping mechanisms can take weeks or even months. Be patient and kind to yourself, and remember that it's okay to take it one step at a time.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I'm feeling jittery and distracted right now and I keep circling back to the same doubts that this will actually change the stuckness. Can you give me a more professional-sounding one-line script for my manager (something that doesn't sound like I'm collapsing), and three alternative bedside phone actions that aren't weird (no photos, no strange folders) — like concrete settings or steps I can take at 2 a.m. to stop myself from replying? Also, when you say "weeks or months," can you be more specific: what should I realistically expect to notice after, say, 4 weeks if this is working?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling jittery and distracted, and the conversation has become more urgent. I notice that you're looking for more concrete support and specific outcomes.

Goal: Provide a one-line script for your manager and three alternative bedside phone actions that can help you manage your emotions in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
**Script for your manager:**
Here's a revised script: "I'm struggling with my workload and need to take a short break to recharge. I'll be back to [Specific Task or Project] as soon as I can."

**Bedside phone actions:**
Here are three alternative actions you can take at 2 a.m. to manage your emotions:

1. Turn off your phone's notifications for the next hour to minimize distractions.
2. Change the lock screen to a calming image or a motivational quote to help shift your focus.
3. Set an alarm for 15-20 minutes in the future to check the email, rather than checking it immediately.

Regarding the expected outcomes, here's a more specific estimate: within 4 weeks of consistent effort, you may start to notice:

* A decrease in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks or feelings of overwhelm
* Improved ability to prioritize tasks and focus on meaningful work
* Increased sense of control and agency over your work and personal life
* Reduced rumination and increased self-compassion when you make mistakes or encounter setbacks

Keep in mind that everyone's progress is unique, and it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself throughout the process.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm jittery and my mind keeps racing and honestly skeptical this will change the stuckness. The manager line reads okay, but can you give me two exact, professional phrasings: one I can send as a one‑line Slack/chat message and one I could send as a short email that doesn't sound weak? For the 2 a.m. fallback, give me one concrete bedside script I can actually do on my phone (step‑by‑step, no weird photo tricks) — like exactly which settings to hit and what to type into Notes. And about the 4‑week timeline: be specific — what exact behaviors or numbers should I track so I can tell if this is working (e.g., panic episodes per week, minutes of focused work)? Also — how is any of this supposed to help if I try it and nothing changes; when do I escalate to something else?

**Slack/chat message:**
"Hey [Manager's Name], need a brief break to recharge. Will check in with you in 30 minutes."

**Short email:**
"Hi [Manager's Name], I'm experiencing a moment of overwhelm and need to step back for a bit. I'll be back to work on [Specific Task or Project] shortly. Thank you for your understanding."

**Bedside script:**
Here's a concrete script you can follow:

1. Open your phone's Lock Screen settings.
2. Turn off Notifications for 30 minutes by tapping on "Do Not Disturb" or "Silent Mode".
3. Open the Notes app and type "2 a.m. check" followed by a brief message, such as "Checking email, but taking a break from work".
4. Tap "Save" to save the note.

Regarding the 4-week timeline, here are some specific behaviors and numbers you can track to measure progress:

* Panic episodes per week: Track the number of times you experience a panic episode per week, using a spreadsheet or a habit-tracking app.
* Minutes of focused work: Track the total number of minutes you spend working on meaningful tasks per day, using a habit-tracking app or a spreadsheet.
* Time spent on distractions: Track the time spent on non-work-related activities, such as social media or email, using a habit-tracking app or a spreadsheet.

When you try these strategies and don't see immediate results, it's essential to:

* Be patient and remember that progress takes time.
* Continue to track your progress and adjust your approach as needed.
* Consider escalating to a more intensive therapy session or seeking support from a mental health professional if you're not seeing significant improvement after 4-6 weeks.

Keep in mind that it's normal for therapy to not work for everyone, and it's okay to try different approaches until you find what works for you.

Patient: I'm jittery and not sure I follow — this still feels like tiny band‑aids. Can you give me one exact, no‑frills 2 a.m. phone routine (step‑by‑step) I can actually do in bed without weird photo stuff? Also be concrete about what to track and what counts as "not enough progress" — like exact numbers/thresholds after 4 weeks that would mean I should escalate — and then say plainly what "escalate" looks like (med eval, structured CBT, referral to something more intensive). How is any of that supposed to help if I do it and nothing changes?

Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling jittery and skeptical about the effectiveness of the strategies, and you're looking for a more concrete and immediate solution. I notice that you're looking for a clear plan for escalation and a clear definition of what constitutes "not enough progress".
