Patient: Honestly, I've been avoiding pretty much every social thing lately because my anxiety spikes—my mind gets stuck on obsessive thoughts and I bail or cancel. I'm an artist and mostly work alone, but it’s starting to cost me gigs and friendships, and I keep relying on myself to just "get over it." I don't really expect therapy to magically fix this, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you describe what happens in the moments leading up to when you feel like canceling or bailing on social plans? What's the immediate physical sensation or thought that makes you feel like you're about to bolt?

Patient: Usually it starts with my chest clenching and my heart speeding up, like I can’t get enough air, and my stomach drops. Then intrusive thoughts kick in—“They’ll notice I’m weird,” “I’ll say something awful,” or some image of me freezing and everyone staring—and I start replaying every possible disaster on loop. I get this almost physical urge to run, so I find any excuse to check my phone or cancel, and sometimes I do little mental rituals to try to quiet it. I can tell you all that, but… how is noticing that supposed to help? I've tried breathing and grounding before and it barely does anything.

Therapist: Those physical sensations and intrusive thoughts can be really distressing. I'm not here to tell you to try another technique, but rather to explore what might be driving your desire to avoid these situations. What's at stake for you in showing up to social events or connecting with others - is it fear of being judged, feeling like you don't measure up, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's fear of being judged — that they'll see me as weird, flaky, or not good enough, and that could actually cost me work or people. There's also this panic about losing control of the rituals or freezing up and making a fool of myself. But, honestly, how is just naming that supposed to help? I've tried framing things around values before and it doesn't really stick.

Therapist: I understand that simply naming your fears might not be enough to create lasting change. Can you imagine, for a moment, that the thoughts "I'll be judged" or "I'll freeze" are just thoughts - not necessarily reflective of reality? Can you give them some space, like a passing cloud, and see what happens to your body and emotions when you do?

Patient: I've tried the cloud thing before. For a few seconds I can notice the thought and my chest loosens a bit, but then the thought gets sticky and I start analyzing the noticing—like, "Am I doing this right?"—and the panic spikes again. My body mostly stays tense and I end up beating myself up for not making it go away. How is that supposed to help when the relief fizzles out and the worry comes back stronger?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to get rid of the thoughts or feelings, but rather to consider what's at stake when you let anxiety take over. What's the value of being able to show up and be yourself, even if that means feeling a little anxious? Can you imagine how that value might outweigh the temporary discomfort of being judged or feeling like you're not in control?

Patient: I get why you'd say that—having values like keeping friendships or getting gigs matters—but when the panic hits, abstract values feel useless; I'm just trying to not collapse in front of people. How is that supposed to help me in the moment when all I can think about is escaping? What do I actually do when noticing and breathing don't work and the urge to bail is louder than any long-term value?

Therapist: I hear that your values can feel far away when you're in the grip of panic. What's the thought that might come up when you're considering canceling or fleeing - is it that you don't want to let others down? Can you imagine how staying in the moment, even if it's uncomfortable, might actually show up in a way that respects and values those relationships?

Patient: Yeah, part of me does think, “I don’t want to let them down,” but right before I bolt it’s more like, “If I freeze or start doing rituals they’ll see I’m unreliable/weird and I’ll lose work or friends.” Imagining staying present sounds okay in theory, but when my chest is pounding and my brain is looping, values feel like a poster on the wall — useless. How is that supposed to help me in that exact moment? I need something concrete — like a tiny step-by-step or a script I can actually use when the urge to run hits, not another abstract reminder about values.

Therapist: Can you think of a tiny, small act that you could do in the immediate moment before canceling or bailing - something that would take just a few seconds, like sending a text to let someone know you're running late, or taking a few deep breaths before answering a question? What would happen if, instead of acting on the urge to flee, you did something small and gentle that still allowed you to care about the people involved?

Patient: I guess a tiny thing could be texting one line like, “Running five mins late, be there soon,” or when I get there saying, “Can I step outside for a sec? I need a minute,” then do a 30-second grounding (name 3 things I see, slow breath) or excuse myself to the bathroom. Those are concrete and take maybe 10–30 seconds, so they don’t feel like huge commitment. But I’ve tried stepping out or sending a text and it sometimes buys me a minute before the panic roars back—how is that supposed to help when the urge to run is louder than anything else?

Therapist: I'm not suggesting that your current approach won't work, but rather that we might be able to find a way to increase the window of time before the panic spikes. Can you think of a slightly longer-term commitment that might give you more time to recover, like taking a few more seconds to collect yourself before responding, or finding a way to subtly shift your body position to feel less tense?

Patient: Okay — a few concrete things I can actually see myself doing: 

- Do a 2–3 minute pre-event reset (sit in the car or outside, 4-4-6 breathing, name 5 things I see, and do a quick shoulder/neck roll) so I’m not walking in already wound up.  
- Arrive 10–15 minutes early or plan a deliberate buffer (coffee next door) so I can acclimate instead of jumping straight in.  
- Have two short scripts ready — one to buy time (“Hey, can I step outside a sec?”) and one to use if I need to leave early (“I’m sorry, I need to head out — let’s catch up soon.”).  
- Commit to a time-limited exposure: I’ll stay for 20 minutes and log what happened, then gradually add five minutes next time.  
- Use a tiny physical anchor (a ring or a bracelet to touch, or plant my feet and lower my shoulders) to interrupt the loop and steady my body.

They sound doable, but I’ve tried variations of these and the relief barely sticks — the panic still screams. How is stretching that window or having a script actually supposed to stop the urge when it hits full force?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to stop the panic entirely, but rather to consider what might happen if, instead of trying to avoid or escape, you chose to be with the physical sensations and emotions that arise when the panic hits. Can you imagine sitting with the feeling of tension in your body, the racing thoughts, and the urge to flee, without trying to push it away or get out of it?

Patient: I can imagine it, but when I try to sit with the feeling the anxiety just gets louder and I start analyzing the analyzing—then I either do rituals or bolt. Sitting with it feels like giving the panic more attention, not less, so it usually makes things worse. How is that supposed to help in the moment—what’s a concrete, step-by-step thing I can do then that doesn't just make me overthink or feed the panic?

Therapist: Let's try something different. When you feel the panic rising, instead of trying to analyze or sit with it, what if you simply focused on your breath for a very brief moment - just 1-2 seconds - before responding or taking action? Can you try that tiny act of focusing on your breath as a kind of "shutdown" button that interrupts the panic loop?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — 1–2 seconds of breath? How is that supposed to interrupt the panic loop when breathing stuff has barely helped before? When I try to focus it just turns into “Am I doing this right?” and the thought sticks or I go do a ritual. If you want me to try, tell me exactly what to do in that 1–2 seconds and what comes right after — inhale/exhale pattern, where to put attention, and what to do if I'm mid-sentence or someone calls my name.

Therapist: Let's try a very specific, tiny act of "defusion" in the moment. When you feel the panic rising and you're about to respond, look directly at the person speaking to you and say the following phrase: "Hello, I'm here." That's it - just those two words. Focus on the sensation of your voice saying them, and then immediately look back at the person. Then, respond to them as usual. What happens in the moment after saying those two words?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — say two words and then what? If I actually try it, my voice feels weird and thin, like everyone’s listening to how I sound, and then I instantly start questioning it: “Why did I say that? Did I sound stupid?” It might buy me a half-second of focus on my voice, but then the old loop kicks back in and my chest tightens again. How is that supposed to help when the follow-up is just more self-checking?

Therapist: Let's try a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to interrupt the panic with a phrase, what if you simply responded to the person speaking to you with a slightly slower, more deliberate pace, and focused on the sounds of your own voice? Can you try to respond in a slightly more measured tone, without adding more analysis or self-questioning, and see if that helps you stay in the moment a bit longer?

Patient: I can try that, but I'm not sure I follow—how is speaking slower supposed to stop the loop? When I slow my voice my brain just switches to monitoring the sound and thinking, “Do I sound weird?” and then the panic ramps up. If we're actually going to try it, tell me precisely how slow (counted breaths, syllables?), what to focus on in my body while I speak, and what to do if the panic spikes mid-sentence or someone calls my name. I'm skeptical it'll do much, but I can give it a shot if you give me exact steps or a tiny fallback script.

Therapist: Let's try a specific, slow-speech approach. Here's a tiny script:

When you feel the panic rising, take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 2, and then exhale for a count of 6. As you exhale, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then, in a slow, measured tone, say: "Hello, [name]."

If someone calls your name before you finish speaking, or if you feel the panic spike mid-sentence, pause for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds), and then take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale for 6, before continuing to speak. Focus on the sensation of your voice speaking, and the sounds around you, rather than your thoughts or physical sensations.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — counting like 4-2-6 in the middle of a panic feels impossible; my head goes fuzzy and time stretches, so I just lose the counts or start thinking about whether I'm doing it right. When I try it mentally, it sometimes buys me a second or two and the "hello [name]" lands, but then I immediately start analyzing my voice and the panic creeps back and the rituals itch. So what comes next — after that tiny pause, how am I supposed to stop the self-checking or the urge to do a ritual? How is this actually supposed to make the loop quieter rather than just giving it a new thing to latch onto?

Therapist: Let's go back to the original goal: to help you stay in the moment and respond to the situation. Instead of focusing on the counting or the script, try this: When you feel the panic rising, and you're about to respond, pause for just a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds) and look directly at the person speaking to you. Then, as you speak, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. This is it - just focus on the physical sensation of your feet on the ground, without trying to control your thoughts or analyze your speech.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — focus on my feet? How is that supposed to help when my brain's already screaming? I tried picturing my feet in my head just now and it gave me a tiny second of calm, then the thoughts immediately came back and the urge to do a ritual kicked in. If we're actually going to try this, give me a really concrete fallback: what exactly do I do if I'm mid-sentence and the panic spikes again, or if I start analyzing whether my feet-sensing is "working"?

Therapist: If you're mid-sentence and the panic spikes, or if you start analyzing the effectiveness of your feet-sensing, take a small, immediate action that disrupts your self-questioning. Look around the room and find something - a pen, a book, a chair leg - and touch it. That's it. Just touch something. This is a simple, concrete action that takes your attention away from your thoughts and onto your physical sensations.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—just touching something? How is that supposed to help when that usually gives me a half-second of relief and then the panic and the rituals come roaring back? If I'm mid‑sentence and I touch a pen or a chair, what exactly do I do next—finish the sentence, say a short line, or excuse myself? I need a tiny, step‑by‑step fallback I can actually use in the moment without turning it into another thing to obsess about.

Therapist: Let's try this: If you're mid-sentence and the panic spikes, touch the pen or chair as I mentioned earlier. As soon as you touch it, pause for a brief moment (about 1 second). Then, without thinking, just say: "Excuse me." That's it. Just the word "excuse me." Do not analyze, do not think about what you're saying, just say the word and take a small step back from the conversation. This can give you a brief moment of space to recover before continuing.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "Excuse me" and stepping back feels like it'll spotlight me more, not less. People usually ask if I'm okay and then I have to make something up, which just ramps the panic or turns into another ritual. If I do step away, what exactly am I supposed to do in that 30–60 second break so I don't just replay everything or compulsively check my phone? Also, how am I supposed to come back into the group without the whole loop starting again — I need exact words or steps for when someone follows or asks if I'm okay.

Therapist: Let's try this: If you're mid-sentence and the panic spikes, touch the pen or chair as before, pause for a brief moment, and say only: "I need a minute." That's it. Just the two words. When someone asks if you're okay, respond with: "I'm just going to grab a glass of water." That's a neutral, low-commitment response that gives you a brief moment to recover. You can then use the 30-60 seconds to take a few deep breaths, collect your thoughts, and decide how to re-engage with the conversation. When you return, you can say: "Sorry about that, where were we?" This approach aims to create a smooth transition and give you a brief moment to recharge.

Patient: I don't know — "I need a minute" sounds like it just flags me and invites questions, and "I'll grab a glass of water" sometimes just becomes me staring at a sink while the rituals kick in. I'm not sure I follow how those lines stop the loop — what exactly am I supposed to do in that 30–60 seconds so I don't just ruminate or do a ritual, and what do I say if someone follows me or asks if I'm okay? Give me a really concrete, second-by-second fallback for the break and a script for if someone comes with me.

Therapist: Let's try this: If you're mid-sentence and the panic spikes, touch the pen or chair, pause for a brief moment, and say: "I need a minute." Immediately after, as soon as you say "I need a minute," take a small, 4-6 second pause. During this pause, do not move or speak. Just rest. Take a moment to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. If someone asks if you're okay, respond with: "I need a minute."

If someone follows you or asks if you're okay while you're getting a glass of water, as you're walking, say: "I'm just going to grab a glass of water." Take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale for 6 as you reach the sink. Turn on the faucet and let the water run for a brief moment, then take another deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale for 6 as you turn off the water. This approach aims to create a brief moment of physical activity and distraction, followed by a neutral, low-commitment response.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like I'm putting a neon sign on myself. The problem is when I'm at the sink or outside, the rituals start: I check my hands, count, replay conversations, or scroll my phone until the panic spikes again. So give me exact, second-by-second steps for that 30–60 second break (what do I do the first 5s, next 10s, etc.), and a single, very short script for if someone follows me and asks if I'm okay that actually shuts down follow-up questions — not "I need a minute" again. How is this actually different from the grounding and breathing that haven't worked for me?

Therapist: Let's try this: If you're mid-sentence and the panic spikes, touch the pen or chair, pause for a brief moment. Immediately after, as soon as you say "I need a minute," take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale for 6. As you're exhaling, look around the room and focus on 5 things you can see that are not related to the conversation or situation (e.g., a chair, a book, a picture). Hold this focus for 10 seconds. Next, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground and the sensation of the air on your skin for 10 seconds. After that, take a quick glance at your hands and notice the sensation of your feet and hands touching the floor for 5 seconds. Then, slowly turn your attention back to the conversation and say: "I'm good." This approach aims to create a brief moment of physical activity, focus, and distraction, followed by a neutral response that shuts down follow-up questions. This is different from grounding and breathing exercises because it involves a more concrete, step-by-step process that can help interrupt the panic loop and provide a clear exit strategy.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — this still reads like a long checklist of breathing and looking-around stuff that I've already tried and which just gives me a few seconds before the loop comes back. The counts and 10‑second steps feel unrealistic when my head's already fogged and I'm mid‑sentence, and “I'm good” sounds like it'll just invite questions or make me lie to myself. Can you give me one ultra‑short script (2–3 words) that actually shuts down follow‑ups, plus a realistic micro‑move I can do in under 2 seconds when I'm mid‑sentence and the panic spikes? Honestly, I'm getting frustrated — it feels like we're circling the same techniques that don't stick.

Therapist: Let's try this: Mid-sentence, when the panic spikes, make a tiny, quick gesture with your hand (e.g., lift your hand off the keyboard, tap your pen, or make a small fist). Say to the person: "Sorry." This 2-3 word response can help shut down follow-up questions and give you a brief moment to recover.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "Sorry" feels like it just puts a spotlight on me and invites the "why?" question, which always makes the panic worse. How is that supposed to help when the follow‑ups happen instantly? 

Honestly, I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed; can we slow down and give me one ultra‑short script (2–3 words) that actually shuts down follow‑ups, a single micro‑move I can do in under 2 seconds that won’t look weird, and one sentence to use if someone follows me — nothing long, just exact words and actions I can actually use.

Therapist: * A 2-3 word script: "Pause"
* A single micro-move: Tap your phone's screen with your finger for 1 second
* A sentence: "Excuse me, I need a moment"

This is a brief, non-intrusive way to signal that you need a moment to collect yourself, without inviting further questioning or attention.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "Pause" feels awkward and tapping my phone just looks like I'm scrolling, which usually makes me ruminate. "Excuse me, I need a moment" still invites "Are you okay?" and I hate having to make something up. How is that supposed to help when someone follows me? Give me one exact two‑word line that actually shuts follow‑ups, and a realistic second‑by‑second micro‑plan for the first 10–20 seconds alone so I don't end up doing rituals.

Therapist: * A 2-word line: "It's done"
* Micro-plan for first 10-20 seconds:
	+ Take 1 second to look up from what you're doing and make eye contact with the person.
	+ Take 3-5 seconds to notice your feet touching the ground and the sensation of the air on your skin.
	+ Take 5-7 seconds to look away from the person and focus on something else in the room (e.g., a book, a chair, a picture).
	+ Take 1-2 seconds to take a deep breath in, and then out.

This plan aims to provide a brief moment of physical activity, distraction, and disconnection from the conversation, making it harder for the panic to escalate.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is "It's done" supposed to shut people up? That sounds weird or like I'm lying and they'll just ask "Done what?" Give me one exact two‑word reply someone will actually drop, and nothing else.

Also give me a realistic, second‑by‑second micro‑plan for the first 30 seconds: what I do in the first 1–3s, then 4–10s, 11–20s, 21–30s — exactly where my hands go, what my eyes do, one specific thing to hold or look at so I don't start counting or checking or doing rituals. And if that micro‑move fails and the loop keeps going, give me a single fallback (one word or one tiny action) I can use right then.

Honestly, I'm already getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and make this ultra‑simple?
