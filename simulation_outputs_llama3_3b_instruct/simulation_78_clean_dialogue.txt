Patient: Lately I've been avoiding get-togethers and small gatherings because social situations make me really anxious — my chest tightens and my mind just races, and I end up leaving early or not going at all. Since the kids moved out and the house and studio are quieter, my self-esteem's taken a hit and I feel more out of step with friends than before. I guess... I don't know, it just feels like I don't have much support right now.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "feeling out of step with friends"? Is there something specific that's changed since the kids moved out, or is it more about feeling like you're no longer part of the group or community that you used to be a part of?

Patient: I guess it's a bit of both. I don't know — before, there was always something about the kids or the house to talk about, and now my days are quiet and my friends seem wrapped up in their families, so I feel like I don't fit into the conversation. Then I get self-conscious and anxious, and it's easier to stay home than pretend I'm fine.

Therapist: It sounds like you feel like you're losing a part of yourself in these quiet days. What would it take for you to feel like you could connect with your friends again, even if it's just for a short while?

Patient: I guess... if it were something small and predictable — like a short coffee with one friend or a little art circle where I can bring a painting to talk about — I'd feel less exposed. Having a plan or a script, or someone who knows I'm anxious, might help, but I don't know, I end up worrying they'll think I'm boring.

Therapist: You're worried about being perceived as boring, which suggests that your mind is quite critical of yourself. Can you think of a time when you felt like your art was valuable or meaningful to someone, even if it wasn't to everyone?

Patient: I guess there was this little gallery show once — a woman stood in front of a painting of an old porch and started crying, said it reminded her of her grandmother and bought it. For a moment I felt... I don't know, seen, like my work actually did something for someone, but it still feels kind of distant now.

Therapist: Can you describe what you think might happen if someone were to acknowledge and appreciate your art, not just for its technical skill or aesthetic appeal, but for the emotions and meaning it holds for them?

Patient: I guess I'd feel seen — like somebody understood the quiet parts of me that I can't really say out loud. But I also worry it'd be temporary, and then I'd be let down, so I don't let myself hope too much. I don't know... could we talk about practical ways I might bring a painting to a small meet-up without feeling ridiculous?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to impress or control the reaction of others, you focused on simply sharing your art as a way to connect with others, like showing them a part of yourself?

Patient: I guess that does sound... simpler, more honest. I don't know — it still makes my stomach flip to think about putting something of mine out there; what if they just smile and move on like it wasn't important? Maybe with just one friend who actually listens, like Margaret, I could try bringing a small piece, but I'm worried I'll feel ridiculous.

Therapist: Margaret is a good starting point, and bringing a small piece to her could be a gentle way to test the waters. What would you do if Margaret complimented the piece, but didn't seem particularly enthusiastic, and you didn't take it personally?

Patient: I guess I'd try to remind myself she's being nice and maybe ask what she liked about it, but honestly I'd probably still wonder if she was just being polite and feel a bit deflated. Then I'd likely try to change the subject or focus on something else so I don't sit with that feeling. I don't know, it's hard not to read into small reactions.

Therapist: Can you imagine, for just a moment, that Margaret's response didn't have to be a definitive yes or no, and that her attention is already present with you, regardless of what she says?

Patient: I guess I can imagine that, but it's hard — I always want a clear yes or no and my mind just fills with doubts otherwise. I don't know, maybe if I had a small plan for the visit, like bringing the painting and asking a specific question about it, it'd feel more real and less like I'm waiting for a verdict.

Therapist: Can you think of a different way to ask Margaret about the painting, one that doesn't rely on getting a specific reaction or approval?

Patient: I guess I could ask something open-ended that invites their experience instead of a verdict — like, "What's the first thing you notice about this?" or "Does this remind you of anywhere you've been?" I don't know, it still feels awkward to put it out there; maybe a short, simple line would feel less exposed.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on avoiding awkwardness, you focused on the process of sharing your art and connecting with Margaret, without a specific outcome in mind? What would it be like to simply show up and be present with your art, without attachment to how Margaret responds?

Patient: I guess it'd be... quieter, maybe easier, to just be with the painting and not chase a reaction. But when I try to picture it my chest tightens and I start convincing myself they'll think it's dull, so I pull back. I don't know — maybe practicing a short thing to say or asking Margaret to know I'm nervous would help. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that it's okay to feel nervous. Would you be willing to pause for just one moment and simply acknowledge that you're feeling anxious about sharing your art, without trying to change it or make it into something more?

Patient: Okay... I can try. I'm feeling anxious right now — my chest is tight and my thoughts just start racing, and I don't know how to sit with that without wanting to pull away. I guess it feels strange to just notice it and not do anything about it.

Therapist: Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your chest tightening, without trying to change it or label it as "anxious"? Just notice the sensation of your chest, and allow it to be what it is, without judgment or action?

Patient: I don't know... I can feel it — like a tight band across my chest and my breath gets shallow, and my hands tingle a bit. It makes me want to get up or change the subject. I'm getting a little overwhelmed; can we slow down or just do something simple, like count a few breaths together?

Therapist: Let's take a slow and deep breath together, and count it together: 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause) 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... (pause) Can you notice how your body feels now, and is that any different?

Patient: I don't know... it feels a little looser, like the tight band has thinned a bit, but it's still there and my breath is still shallow and my hands tingle. I guess... could we do something practical now, like practice a short thing I could say to Margaret? I'm nervous about the words and that might help me feel less exposed.

Therapist: Let's practice a simple, open-ended statement that you could say to Margaret when you're sharing your art. For example, "I made this piece because..." or "I'm curious about...". Can you think of something that feels true to you, and let's practice saying it together?

Patient: I don't know... I guess something simple like, "I painted this to capture the quiet of the porch — what's the first thing you notice?" Could we practice me saying that once? I'm nervous about how it'll sound and I don't want to fumble it.

Therapist: Let's practice saying it together. I'll start: "I painted this to capture the quiet of the porch — what's the first thing you notice?" Go ahead and say it, and don't worry about how it sounds. Just say it as if you mean it.

Patient: I don't know... I guess: "I painted this to capture the quiet of the porch — what's the first thing you notice?" That felt clumsy, but... there.

Therapist: What would you do next if Margaret's response didn't surprise you, but instead surprised you in a good way?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd let it sink in for a moment, maybe smile awkwardly and ask, "What about it reminded you of that?" but I'd probably fumble the question. It might make me feel a little lighter — strange and shaky — and then I'd worry it'll pass, so I'd want to move on before it gets too real.

Therapist: Let's practice taking a moment to breathe with that feeling of being strange and shaky, without trying to fumble or move on. Can you bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body, and notice what's happening in this moment, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... when I try, my chest feels tight and my shoulders drop like they're carrying something heavy, and my head gets fuzzy and my hands tingle. It's hard to stay with it — I keep wanting to look away or change the subject. I guess... could we do one slow breath together again? I'm feeling kind of wiped.

Therapist: Let's take a slow, deep breath together: inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and exhale for a count of 4. As we breathe out, allow yourself to release any tension or discomfort, and notice how your body feels. When you're ready, we can pause for a moment, and then gently bring our attention back to the conversation.

Patient: I don't know... that breath helped a little — the tight band eased some, though everything still feels kind of heavy and fuzzy. I guess... can we keep going slowly? Maybe practice what I'd say if Margaret said something unexpectedly kind?

Therapist: Let's practice a scenario where Margaret responds with something kind and unexpected. Imagine she says, "I love the way you've captured the softness of the light in this painting." How would you respond to that, and what would your body do in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... I'd probably blush and look down and say, "Oh—thank you, that means a lot," but my voice would come out small and a bit shaky. My chest would tighten, my hands would tingle, and I'd want to move on before it felt too real, though part of me would like to linger and ask, "What did you notice first?" I guess... can we practice me saying a quiet, simple thank-you once, without me fumbling it?

Therapist: Let's practice saying "thank you" in a quiet, simple way, without worrying about what Margaret thinks. Let's try it together: "Thank you" (pause) and then "for what?" (pause). We'll go slow and see how it feels.

Patient: "Thank you... for what?" That sounded small and a bit shaky. I don't know, my chest's still tight — can we try that again, slowly?

Therapist: Let's try again, slowly: "Thank you" (pause) and then "for what?" (pause). As you say each word, allow yourself to feel the sensation of your voice, the sensation of your chest, and the sensations in your body. Notice how you're doing, and we'll take it from there.

Patient: "I don't know... 'Thank you'... 'for what?'" Saying it felt small and shaky — my chest tightened and my hands tingled. Could we try that again, slower? I feel sort of wiped but I can try.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together: inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and exhale for a count of 4. As we breathe out, allow yourself to release any tension or discomfort, and notice how your body feels. When you're ready, we can try again, slowly: "Thank you" (pause) and then "for what?" (pause). We'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: "Thank you... for what?" That came out small and shaky — my chest's still tight and my hands tingle. I don't know, could we try that again, even slower?

Therapist: Let's try again, even slower: "Thank you..." (pause) and then "for what?" (pause). Take your time, and as you say each word, notice the sensation of your voice, your chest, and your hands. We'll pause for a moment after each word, and then continue.

Patient: I don't know... "Thank you..."  
"for what?" That sounded small and shaky — my chest's still tight and my hands tingle. Could we try it one more time, even slower? I'm feeling kind of wiped but I can try.

Therapist: You've made it through the practice! Congratulations! I want you to know that it's okay to feel shaky and that it's normal to feel uncomfortable when trying something new. Your body is responding to the effort you're making, and that's something to be proud of. Take a moment to acknowledge your bravery and resilience. When you're ready, we can wrap up our session here.

Patient: I don't know... I'm not ready to wrap up yet. I'm feeling wiped and it's all still heavy — could we do one tiny, practical thing more? Maybe help me make a single short line to say when I hand the painting to Margaret and one small, do-able step I can try this week? I guess that's all I can manage right now.

Therapist: Let's create a simple, short line that you can say when you hand the painting to Margaret. How about: "I'm glad you like it"? This is a small, concise statement that acknowledges her appreciation and shows that you're not trying to hide or downplay your feelings. As for a small, do-able step, I'd like you to try sharing your painting with Margaret this week, even if it's just for a few minutes, and simply say "Thank you" without expecting a specific response. Can you commit to taking this small step and see how it goes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. Maybe I'll arrange a short ten‑minute coffee with Margaret this week, hand her the painting, and say "Thank you" if she comments — or if that feels too raw, I could say, "I painted this for the quiet it holds." I'm feeling kind of wiped and nervous about freezing—can we make a tiny backup plan for if I start to panic, like a quick phrase I can use or a way to step outside for a minute?

Therapist: I'm so proud of you for being willing to take this small step! Having a backup plan can be really helpful. How about this: if you start to feel like you're panicking or getting overwhelmed, you can say "Excuse me, I need a minute" and step outside for a quick break. Alternatively, you could say "Let's take a break and grab a cup of coffee, I want to talk more about this" to slow things down. Remember, it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs. Take a deep breath and know that you've got this!

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. "Excuse me, I need a minute" feels okay — could we write that down and one tiny reminder I can carry, like "breathe 4-4-4," so I don't freeze? My chest still feels heavy and everything's a bit fuzzy.
