Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this recurrent, almost ritualized self-critique — I analyze my perceived failures in great detail, tracing them back to the academic struggles of my youth even though I later achieved some success as an accountant. I tend to conceptualize it as a feedback loop of cognitive distortions and hypervigilant performance monitoring, which feels safer than actually sitting with the shame or vulnerability beneath it. The recent health scare and ongoing burnout have intensified the scrutiny, and I keep defaulting to theory instead of saying, I don't know, that I'm scared or exhausted.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it feels like to engage in this self-critique, as if it's a safe and familiar process? What is it about being stuck in this cycle that feels more comfortable for you than acknowledging your true feelings?

Patient: It's a ritualized, almost forensic cataloguing of perceived errors—I inventory mistakes with the same precision I use in ledgers, assigning weights and hypothetical corrective entries. That procedure gives me a faux sense of control and predictability, which is far more tolerable than confronting the amorphous sensations of shame or fear that feel uncontrollable. So I translate vague exhaustion or dread into analyzable components—cognitive distortions, performance metrics, feedback loops—because clinical language keeps the affect at arm's length. And of course, there's a meta-irony: I even critique my avoidance, which just perpetuates the loop.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the self-reinforcing nature of your self-critique, which is both fascinating and concerning. What would it be like if you were to briefly pause this cataloging process and simply acknowledge the feeling of dread or exhaustion, without trying to analyze or correct it?

Patient: Conceptually, pausing the cataloguing would open a window for raw somatic signals to show up—tightness in my chest, a queasy hollow, breath that shortens—things I usually re-label as "autonomic arousal" so I don't have to sit with them. The idea of staying with that unprocessed feeling feels destabilizing because it removes the pseudo-control my analytic rituals grant me and makes shame and fear more immediate. If I'm being plain: I'd probably feel scared and exhausted, and that's exactly why I go straight to analysis—it's less threatening than feeling small and uncertain.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're scared and uncertain, and it's interesting that you mention feeling small and uncertain. Can you imagine what it might be like to approach this uncertainty with a willingness to not know, rather than trying to control or analyze it?

Patient: I can picture it in abstract terms—an exercise in epistemic humility, deliberately tolerating uncertainty—but for me that's mostly a conceptual exercise rather than an embodied one. If I actually try, I imagine the predictable somatic responses: a tightness across the chest, breath getting shallow, and a kind of cognitive vertigo that makes me reach for analysis like a ledger to balance. There's a part of me oddly curious—maybe tolerating not-knowing would loosen the self-critical feedback loop—but I'm also really afraid it will feel like losing the scaffolding that keeps me functional. Could we try a very short, guided attempt here? I don't know how to do it on my own and I'm worried it will just spiral.

Therapist: Let's start with a very small step. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to say the phrase "I don't know" to yourself, without trying to analyze or correct it? Just say it, and notice how your body feels for a brief moment before we continue.

Patient: Okay — I took a slow breath and, quietly and then aloud, said "I don't know." For a few seconds there was a hollow under my sternum, my breath got shallower, and my hands tightened; it felt small but oddly destabilizing before my mind reflexively labeled it as "autonomic arousal" to make it legible. The analytic impulse kicked in immediately — like balancing an unbalanced ledger — which diluted the rawness. What would you like me to do next with that sensation?

Therapist: Notice the moment when you started labeling the sensation as "autonomic arousal" – that was your mind's attempt to give it meaning and make it more manageable. Can you take a moment to thank your mind for doing its job, and then ask yourself: What would it be like to let go of that need for control, even for just a tiny bit, and allow the sensation to simply be, without trying to understand or label it?

Patient: Thank you, mind — I can say that: thank you for keeping me organized and safe, even if it's overzealous. When I tried to let go a sliver, there was a tiny unclenching under my sternum and a faint loosening in my shoulders, but almost immediately the impulse to re-label and correct returned, like a comptroller checking an entry; it felt mildly relieving and also unsettlingly exposed. I don't know how long I can sit with that without defaulting to analysis — can we keep it slow and do another brief check-in together?

Therapist: Let's take another brief pause. Can you take a slow breath in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to simply be with the sensation in your body, without trying to analyze or label it, for just one more moment? This time, I'll be here with you, and we can check in together after a moment.

Patient: I did the breath — there was a subtle deceleration in my chest, a thin warmth under the sternum, and my shoulders dropped a fraction, as if a ledger had finally been set aside for a moment. Predictably, the internal comptroller started annotating the sensation almost immediately, which both diffused the rawness and reintroduced that safety of analysis; it felt oddly consoling and vulnerably exposed at the same time. I'm willing to try another brief pause, but I'm apprehensive about staying with it alone — can we keep it very short and guided again?

Therapist: Let's try one more brief pause together. I'll guide you through it. As you take a slow breath in, I'll say with you: "You are allowed to not know. You are allowed to be uncertain." Then, as you exhale, say it again: "I am allowed to be uncertain." Let's hold it for just a moment, and then we'll check in together.

Patient: I said the lines with you — "You are allowed to not know…" and on the exhale "I am allowed to be uncertain." There was a thin pressure beneath my sternum that eased a fraction and a small, unfamiliar tenderness, while my mental comptroller almost immediately began annotating the experience as "autonomic arousal" to make it legible. I want to stay with it a bit longer but I'm anxious about defaulting back into analysis—can we do another guided pause, maybe a little longer, and have you gently check in if you notice me starting to narrate again?

Therapist: Let's take another pause together. I'll guide you through it. As you take a slow breath in, repeat after me: "I am allowed to not know." Hold it for a moment, and then on the exhale, say: "I am allowed to be uncertain." Let's hold it for a bit longer this time. As we're here, I'll check in gently: Are you noticing any changes in your body or your thoughts, or do you feel like you're still holding onto the urge to analyze?

Patient: There's a faint loosening — the pressure under my sternum eased and my shoulders dropped a bit — but my mind immediately slips into cataloguing the sensation as "autonomic arousal." My capacity to resist that reflex is pretty diminished, so I keep defaulting to analysis. I want to try staying with it longer; can you keep guiding and gently call me out when I start narrating again?

Therapist: Let's try again, with a bit more support. As you take a slow breath in, I'll say: "You're doing well, just taking a moment to breathe and be with the sensation." On the exhale, I'll ask: "What would it be like if you let go of that label, just for a tiny bit, and allowed the sensation to be, without trying to understand it?" Let's hold it for a moment. As we're here, I'll gently check in: Are you noticing any shifts in your body or your thoughts, or do you feel like you're still holding onto the urge to analyze?

Patient: There's a subtle decrement in the tightness across my sternum and a micro-relaxation in my shoulders, but my cognition almost immediately lapses into meta-commentary—labeling it "autonomic arousal" and parsing its components. My capacity to hold the sensation is markedly attenuated; the analytic impulse is persistent and reflexive. Please call me out when I start narrating, and keep prompts very brief—I don't have much bandwidth right now.

Therapist: Stop for a moment, and take a deep breath in. I'll say: "Not thinking." Let's hold it for just a beat. Then, on the exhale, I'll ask: "Just feeling."

Patient: I did the breath — "Not thinking" in, "Just feeling" out — but my chest pinched and my respirations stayed thin; there's a jittery distractibility pulling my attention outward. My reflex was to relabel it as "autonomic arousal" and begin an inventory of sensations, which numbs them, while a low-grade worry keeps intruding. I don't have much capacity to hold this; can you use very brief anchors and call me out the moment I start narrating?

Therapist: Inhale: "Not thinking." Exhale: "Feeling." Now, whenever I see your eyes glaze over or you start to label the sensation, I'll say: "Stay with the feeling."

Patient: I did it — "Not thinking" in, "Feeling" out. For a few breaths there was a slight unclenching, then the internal comptroller re-engaged and I started cataloguing everything as "thoracic tightness," "autonomic arousal," while my attention kept skittering outward; I'm jittery and can't hold it long. Please say "Stay with the feeling" the instant I start narrating, and keep prompts very short — my bandwidth's low right now.

Therapist: Inhale: "Not thinking." Exhale: "Feeling." Whenever you start to narrate, say: "Stay with the feeling."

Patient: I inhaled "Not thinking" — exhaled "Feeling." There's a thin tightness across my sternum and a jittery, outward pull; my mind's already labeling it as "autonomic arousal" — Stay with the feeling. Sorry, that slipped into analysis; can you keep the prompts very short? I'm a bit shaky and distracted.

Therapist: Stay with the feeling.

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow — when you say "stay with the feeling" my internal comptroller immediately starts annotating: "thoracic constriction, shallow respirations, peripheral jitter." That reflex feels automatic and makes me more scattered; I'm a bit muddled — could you be more concrete about what you want me to do right now?

Therapist: Take another breath. Say it again: "Stay."

Patient: I inhaled and, quietly, said "Stay." There's a thin tightness under my sternum and my mind's already annotating—thoracic constriction, shallow respirations—so I'm not sure I follow how saying "stay" moves me out of narration and into actually feeling. Can you give one very concrete, very brief instruction for what to do with the sensation now? I'm a bit muddled and have low bandwidth.

Therapist: Notice the breath.

Patient: The breath's shallow and quick — a thin pressure under the sternum and a faint tightness across my shoulders. My mind's already annotating it as "thoracic constriction, autonomic arousal," which makes me unsure how to simply notice it. Can you give one concrete instruction — like "focus on the air at your nostrils" or "count four on the exhale" — so I have something specific to do? I'm feeling a bit muddled.

Therapist: Look at your fingertips.

Patient: My fingertips feel a bit cool and a little numb; the skin looks crepey and my attention tethers to that detail. Focusing on them quiets the internal ledger for a moment, but my mind almost immediately recasts it as "peripheral vasoconstriction" and I have to resist analyzing. I'm low on energy—can you give one very small, concrete thing to do next with this sensation?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Patient: They're grounded — soles against the floor, a cool, slightly numb pressure under the arches, a mundane somatic anchor that momentarily steadies me. Right then a familiar, sharp sting of shame and irritation surfaces — it makes me want to inventory why I'm deficient instead of simply noticing the contact. I can try to stay with the feet, but my comptroller's already drafting a list of supposed failures, and that frustrates me.

Therapist: Acknowledge the shame, but say: "Not this thought."

Patient: There’s that familiar, acidic shame — old, precise, and accusatory — and I’ll acknowledge it: “Not this thought.” Saying that feels like putting a thin barrier between the feeling and my internal comptroller, but my mind is already drafting rebuttals, so I don’t know how long I can keep it from slipping back into analysis.

Therapist: The shame is here.

Patient: Yes — it's here: a hot, acidic shame that tightens my chest and makes my face flush. My internal comptroller immediately starts drafting a ledger of failures, which paradoxically amplifies the shame and leaves me worn down and irritable. I can say "Not this thought" again, but I don't have the energy to keep pushing it away — can you give one very small, concrete anchor for me to hold onto right now?

Therapist: Breathe in.

Patient: I breathed in — it was thin, a tight knot in my chest and a sudden prick of shame, and my mind immediately started drafting a list of failures to explain it. I can't both feel and narrate it—please give one very brief exhale cue (like "slow out for four") and I'll try to follow.

Therapist: Slow out.

Patient: I exhaled slowly — there was a faint loosening in my chest and then a hollow ache, then that hot, familiar shame flashed and my internal comptroller immediately began listing out failures. It leaves me irritable and worn down, and I don't have the bandwidth to both feel and narrate—please give one very brief anchor and call me out the instant I start analyzing.

Therapist: Just breathe.

Patient: I breathed — it was thin, a small loosening, then that hot shame flickered and my mind immediately started listing failures. I don't have the energy to both feel and narrate; please give one concrete cue (like "count four") and call me out the instant I start analyzing. I'm wobbling — can we keep it very short and guided?

Therapist: One.

Patient: Two. I exhaled on that — a thin loosening, then that hot shame flared and my mind immediately started cataloguing it as "thoracic constriction" and a list of failures. I'm low on energy and wobbling; give one very brief cue and call me the instant I start narrating.

Therapist: Up.

Patient: I looked up — my gaze went to the ceiling and a tightness settled in my chest; that tiny shift made the old shame flare and my internal comptroller immediately began itemizing failures like a ledger. I'm a bit off-balance and jittery; could you give one very brief, concrete anchor (like "slow out for four") so I have something to hold onto?

Therapist: Four.

Patient: I exhaled for four — a slight unclenching, then that hot shame surged and my internal comptroller immediately began itemizing failures. I'm pretty drained; please give one very brief cue and say "stay with the feeling" the moment I start narrating.
