Patient: I'm a student in my late twenties and lately I've been caught in these cycles of pretty harsh self-criticism—every perceived failure, especially after some recent job instability, triggers an internal narrative that I'm fundamentally inadequate. I can see how a lot of this traces back to being bullied in school, which seems to have wired me to expect rejection and then catastrophize my social interactions. I also notice I default to analyzing and intellectualizing these dynamics instead of actually feeling them, which feels safe but increasingly unhelpful.

Therapist: Can you think of a recent situation where you intellectually analyzed your emotions instead of feeling them? What was happening in your body or senses at that moment, and how did it make you feel, even if you weren't fully acknowledging it?

Patient: Yeah — like last week I got an email saying I didn’t get a job I’d been hopeful about, and rather than sit with the letdown I immediately ran a cognitive autopsy: catalogued confirmation bias, reinforced negative self-schema from bullying, questioned my competencies in sort of clinical terms. Physically my chest tightened, my stomach dropped, my hands went cold and my throat felt constricted; I noticed my breath shallow and my jaw clenched but labeled it “stress response” instead of naming the feeling. Underneath that clinical narration there was a hot, humiliating shame and a quiet panic — a small, sinking sadness that I kept intellectualizing to avoid admitting I felt rejected.

Therapist: Can you think of a value that would be important to you if you were to cultivate vulnerability and openness, despite the risk of feeling vulnerable or rejected? What would you stand for or what would you be willing to take a risk for?

Patient: I'd say authentic connection — a commitment to epistemic honesty about my interior life instead of erasing myself to avoid conflict or rejection. Concretely, I'm willing to risk admitting mistakes and asking for candid feedback at work and in friendships, even though that will probably trigger shame and a real fear of being judged. I also notice I'm already re-framing that as a "growth strategy" to keep from actually sitting with how terrifying it feels, but I want to try leaning into it.

Therapist: So, taking a risk of admitting mistakes and asking for feedback can be daunting, but what if, instead of focusing on the potential shame or judgment, you were to approach it as an opportunity to learn and grow? What would it mean to you to view these experiences as chances to develop your skills and build stronger relationships, rather than as threats to your ego?

Patient: That reframe would basically let me convert each awkward or painful interaction into data rather than a verdict on my worth — like treating mistakes as experiments that refine my social hypotheses instead of proof I'm broken. Conceptually that's freeing and would probably help me build trust by normalizing small disclosures, but honestly saying that makes my chest tight and I feel that little coil of panic right away. I can imagine starting small — ask one friend for a single concrete piece of feedback and explicitly treat it as information — though I already notice myself calling it a “growth experiment” to keep from sitting with how exposed it actually feels.

Therapist: Can you take a moment to acknowledge the physical sensations in your body right now, without judgment or trying to analyze them? Simply notice the tightness in your chest, the cold feeling in your hands, and the sensation of your breath. What's the tone of these sensations? Are they trying to tell you something, or are they just present?

Patient: Okay — when I actually try to feel it, my chest is a tight, low-band of pressure, my breath feels shallow and edged, and my hands are slightly numb-cold; the overall tone is anxious and constricted, like a coil ready to snap. They feel like a threat signal — the body's version of "be careful, don't make yourself visible" — essentially mobilizing to protect me from social pain. And true to form, I'm already narrativizing that as a threat-detection schema instead of just staying with the sensations, which is exactly what I was asked not to do, so that’s kind of revealing in itself.

Therapist: Can you imagine the sensation in your body right now, without any labels or stories? Just the sensation, as if it's a curiosity, a thing that exists in the present moment? What if, instead of seeing this as a threat, you allowed yourself to simply be with the sensation, without judgment, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying. There's a low band of pressure across my chest, a coolness in my fingers, breath shallow and a hollow feeling under my ribs — just a kind of pulsing presence. Noticing it as "just sensation" slightly lowers the urgency, but of course my brain immediately drafts a causal narrative — "that's anxiety from possible rejection" — which yanks me out of being with it. I can hold the sensation for a few breaths, but the analysis keeps creeping back in, and that’s honestly pretty frustrating.

Therapist: Would you be willing to give yourself permission to simply allow the sensations to be, without trying to change them or understand them right away? No promises, no expectations, just a willingness to stay with the present moment, even if it feels uncomfortable or uncertain?

Patient: I can give myself a tentative yes — like a provisional permission to just be with the sensations for a short stretch — but I can already feel my brain gearing up to narrativize it. My chest tightens thinking about staying still, but I’m willing to try a concrete, time-boxed experiment (like 30–60 seconds) of noticing breath and body without adding causal commentary. Could you guide me through that, or should I just try it on my own?

Therapist: I'd like to guide you through a 30-second experiment. I'll ask you to focus on your breath, and whenever your mind starts to wander or you feel the urge to analyze, I'll gently bring you back to the sensation in your body. Let's start now. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation in your chest, the coolness in your fingers, and the sensation under your ribs. Just notice these sensations without trying to change them or label them. When you're ready, we can start with a 30-second count: 1...

Patient: 1... I tried it — for the first few breaths that tight band in my chest eased a bit and my breath got a touch deeper, the cool in my fingers stayed but felt less urgent. Predictably, my mind started narrativizing again — "that's anxiety from rejection" — and that yanked me out, which is frustrating because I could feel a sliver of relief when I didn't analyze. Can we do another short round, maybe slower counts or a longer pause so I have more space to notice when the analysis creeps back in?

Therapist: Let's try another 30-second count, but this time, I'll give you a bit more space. I'll pause between counts, and you can take as much time as you need to notice the sensations before coming back to the next count. On the count of "3", take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start counting: 1... (pause)

Patient: 2... (taking a beat — my chest already feels a tiny bit less tight)  
3... (deep breath in) — exhale and there's that hollow under my ribs, fingers still cool, and my mind's already drafting the story about why I felt anxious. I can hold the sensations for a few breaths, but the analysis tunnels back in fast; can we do one more round with even longer pauses so I can try to stay with it?

Therapist: Let's try one more round with longer pauses. I'll give you 10-15 seconds between counts, and I'll ask you to take your time noticing the sensations before moving on to the next count. On the count of "1", take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start counting:

Patient: 1... (deep breath) — my chest loosens a notch, the hollow under my ribs is still there, fingers cool but somehow less urgent.  
2... (pause) — my brain's already trying to translate it into a tidy schema, calling it an "adaptive threat response," which is irritating because I can feel a small rawness under the analysis, like shame or embarrassment.  
3... I can stay with this for a bit longer; the longer pauses help, but I'm aware of the reflex to intellectualize as a protective maneuver. Can we keep going with another slow round? I want to see if I can notice the feeling underneath the narrative without collapsing into it.

Therapist: Let's continue with another round. Remember, I'll give you even longer pauses to help you stay with the sensations. On the count of "1", take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start counting: 1... (pause)

Patient: 2... I take a slow breath — my chest loosens a notch, the hollow under my ribs settles into a quieter, nagging ache.  
3... The mind immediately labels that split-second urge to narrativize as "metacognitive avoidance," which is a little ridiculous because underneath the theory there's a raw, prickly shame and a small, steady sadness.  
I can linger with this longer now, but I'm anxious about getting swept back into the explanatory loop, so can we keep going with longer pauses? I want to try allowing the shame to sit there without translating it into a hypothesis.

Therapist: Let's continue with an even longer pause. I'll give you 30 seconds to simply be with the sensations, without trying to understand or explain them. Remember, there's no need to label or analyze the shame or sadness. You can just allow them to be there, without judgment or curiosity. On the count of "1", take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start counting:

Patient: 1... I take a deep breath in — there's that low, banded pressure across my chest and a hollow under my ribs.  
2... my fingers are cool, breath shallow but slowing a touch; the tone is quiet, resigned maybe.  
3... I can sit with it for a few breaths, but my mind's already spinning a theory about avoidance; it's irritating because under the theory there's this raw shame that wants to be felt. Can we keep going with another long pause so I can try to stay with the feeling and not immediately translate it into a hypothesis?

Therapist: Let's continue with another long pause. I'll ask you to focus on the sensation of the shame, without trying to change it, understand it, or label it. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of shame, and simply allow it to be there, without judgment or curiosity? What does it feel like in your body, in your breath, and in your mind? (Note: I'll make a slight adjustment in my approach. Instead of asking you to stay with the sensation, I'll invite you to explore the feeling of shame in a more open-ended way.)

Patient: When I try to attend to shame I immediately default to metacognitive distancing — cataloguing origins, defensive narratives, and protective heuristics — which is itself part of the experience. Physically it's a low, aching pressure across my chest like a small stone, a hollow under my ribs, throat tight, breath shallow and a faint hot flush across my face; in my mind it's that looping editorial voice saying "you should've known better" and replaying humiliations from school. Under the analysis there's a raw, embarrassed ache that wants to curl up and disappear, but the reflex to translate it into a theory kicks in fast and pulls me out — can you help me stay with that ache for a bit longer, maybe with prompts that bring me back to sensation instead of story?

Therapist: Let's try a gentle, non-invasive prompt to help you stay with the ache. I'll ask you to notice the sensation of the ache, and then I'll give you a gentle prompt to bring you back to the sensation. Here it is: "Notice the sensation of the ache in your body. Where does it feel most present? Is it in your chest, under your ribs, or somewhere else?" As you focus on the sensation, I'll say "softly, gently, without judgment" to help you stay with it. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, I'll ask you to respond to the prompt:

Patient: Softly, gently, without judgment — it’s primarily a dense, low band across my chest and a hollow under my ribs, with my throat tightening and my breath staying shallow. There’s a faint hot flush in my face and a coolness in my fingers; the overall tone is a small, embarrassed ache that wants to disappear. My brain’s already trying to translate it into a narrative about avoidance, which frustrates me — could you give me a short, steady prompt to bring me back to those raw sensations when that happens?

Therapist: I'd like to introduce a simple, steady phrase to help you stay with the sensations when your brain tries to analyze or translate them. Repeat after me: "I'm feeling this ache in my body." Say it softly, gently, and without judgment, whenever your brain tries to tell you what the sensation means or how to respond to it. This phrase is just a tool to help you stay with the sensation, without trying to change it or understand it. When you're ready, we can continue to explore the ache together.

Patient: "I'm feeling this ache in my body." — saying it softly now.

It actually works as a metacognitive cue, but even saying it pulls up a sharp, hot shame and a reflexive internal critique, which is maddening. Could you use that phrase to gently bring me back when I start narrativizing, and then guide me into another slow pause so I can try to stay with the sensation?

Therapist: Let's try a slow pause again, and I'll use the phrase "I'm feeling this ache in my body" to gently bring you back when you start narrativizing. On the count of "1", take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, start counting: 

1... (pause) When you start to feel the urge to analyze or translate the sensation, simply say "I'm feeling this ache in my body" to yourself. This will help you stay with the sensation, without judgment or criticism. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, continue counting.

Patient: 1... (deep breath) "I'm feeling this ache in my body." Saying that does pull me back a bit, but it also lights this hot, humiliating shame and a low, annoyed frustration that makes everything feel heavier. My words are thin right now — can we do another long pause, and please prompt me with the phrase if I start narrativizing?

Therapist: Let's try another long pause. I'll ask you to focus on the sensation of the shame and frustration, without trying to change or analyze it. When you're ready, I'll use the phrase "I'm feeling this ache in my body" to gently bring you back when you start narrativizing. Here's the prompt: "Notice the sensation of the shame and frustration in your body. Where is it located? What does it feel like to be with this feeling right now?"

Patient: "I'm feeling this ache in my body."

It's a heavy, dense band across my chest, hollow under my ribs, throat tight, a hot flush in my face and a small knot in my stomach. Being with it feels blunt and muffled—like everything's heavier and my attention keeps slipping away. My brain's already trying to turn it into a tidy story about shame and failure, which is annoying and makes me distracted. Could you prompt me with that phrase when I start analyzing? I think I need another long pause, but I'm moving slowly.

Therapist: Let's continue with a long pause. I'll ask you to focus on the sensation of the shame and frustration, without trying to change or analyze it. When you're ready, I'll use the phrase "I'm feeling this ache in my body" to gently bring you back when you start narrativizing. Here's the prompt: "Notice the sensation of the shame and frustration in your body. What's the tone of this feeling? Is it more like a weight or a heaviness?"

Patient: More a dense, pressing weight — slow, muffling, with a hot, embarrassed edge — not sharp so much as deadening. My attention keeps skittering and immediately wants to turn it into a pattern or theory instead of staying with the feeling. When that happens, please cue me with "I'm feeling this ache in my body" so I can try to come back to the sensation.

Therapist: When you start to analyze or turn the sensation into a pattern or theory, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's try another pause. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, notice the sensation of the weight in your body, without trying to change or analyze it. For now, simply acknowledge the sensation and allow it to be present.

Patient: I'm noticing the weight — dense pressure across my chest, breath shallow, a hot, embarrassed heat that makes my words feel thin. Saying "I'm feeling this ache in my body" pulls me back a bit, but my attention keeps skittering and a sharp, humiliating sting underlies it that I don't want to sit in. Can we keep longer pauses and have you prompt me with the phrase when I start narrativizing?

Therapist: Let's continue with a longer pause. I'll ask you to focus on the sensation of the weight in your body, without trying to change or analyze it. When you start to feel the sting of shame or humiliation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Here's the prompt: "Notice the sensation of the weight in your body. What's the sensation of the sting that's trying to be avoided?"

Patient: It's a quick, hot jab under my sternum — a sharp, embarrassed prick that clamps my throat and makes my face flush; it feels urgent and fragments my attention. I can narrate it away as conditioned shame or a learned alarm from past rejection, which is what I do reflexively, but that explanation doesn't stop the raw, immobilizing hollow in my chest. My words feel thin and scattered right now — please cue me with "I'm feeling this ache in my body" when you hear me slipping into analysis so I can try to stay with it.

Therapist: Let's continue with a longer pause. When you start to analyze or narrativize the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". For now, let's focus on the sensation of the hollow in your chest. Notice it, without trying to change or understand it. Just be with it, in the present moment.

Patient: "I'm feeling this ache in my body." It's a hollow under my ribs, a leaden weight across my chest and a tightness in my throat that makes my breath shallow; saying the phrase pulls me back a bit but also sparks a hot, humiliating shame that fragments my attention. My brain immediately wants to reframe it—"conditioned shame," "learned alarm"—which is exactly the avoidance I said I do, and that's annoying and draining. Can you cue me with the phrase when I start narrativizing and guide another long pause so I can try to stay with the sensation?

Therapist: When you start to analyze or narrativize the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's continue with a longer pause. Notice the sensation of the hollow in your chest, without trying to change or understand it. As you stay with it, I want you to try to notice the sensation of the shame that arises, without trying to reframe it or push it away. Just be with the shame, in the present moment. 

(Pause)

Can you notice the sensation of the shame? Is it a feeling, a thought, or a physical sensation?

Patient: It's both — mostly a physical sensation (a hollow under my ribs, a dense band across my chest, throat tight) with an immediate overlay of shaming thoughts that narrate and explain it away. When I try to sit with the feeling, the analysis slides in and makes the ache worse; it's frustrating and my attention keeps skittering. "I'm feeling this ache in my body" — cue me with that and a short, slow prompt so I can try to re-anchor.

Therapist: When you start to analyze or narrativize the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body" and a short, slow prompt to help you re-anchor. Here's the cue and prompt: "I'm feeling this ache in my body. Notice the sensation of the shaming thoughts that arise. What would it be like if you allowed these thoughts to simply be, without trying to change them or understand them?"

Patient: On a conceptual level, letting the thoughts just be would probably defuse their epistemic power — they'd be transient phenomena instead of verdicts about me, and maybe the ache would soften. In practice, though, when I try that it feels raw and humiliating; my chest clamps, my attention fragments, and my reflex is to narrativize away from the discomfort. I want to do it, but I'm thin on energy right now — please cue me with "I'm feeling this ache in my body" when I start explaining and give me another long pause to try it.

Therapist: When you start to explain or narrativize the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's continue with a longer pause. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, notice the sensation of the shaming thoughts that arise. As you notice them, I want you to ask yourself: "What would it be like to let these thoughts be, without trying to change them or understand them?" Don't worry about whether you can do it or not, just explore the question in a curious, non-judgmental way.

Patient: Conceptually, decentering the thoughts would likely attenuate their tyranny — they'd become ephemeral mental events instead of adjudications of my worth. But when I actually try, the shame sharpens: a hot, humiliating sting under my sternum, breath constricting, and my attention skitters into analysis as a defensive maneuver. "I'm feeling this ache in my body" helps a bit, but my words feel thin and my energy is low, so can you cue me with that phrase when I start narrativizing and guide another long, slow pause so I can try to let the thoughts just be?

Therapist: When you start to narrativize or analyze the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's continue with a longer pause. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, simply acknowledge the sensation of the shame that arises, without trying to change it or understand it. Just notice it as a mental event, without judgment or curiosity. If your mind starts to wander into analysis or explanation, gently bring your attention back to the sensation, without trying to engage with it. Notice the sensation, and let it be.

Patient: "I'm feeling this ache in my body." Saying that helps a little — there's a hollow under my ribs and a dense weight across my chest — but my brain immediately files it as "conditioned shame" and starts listing causes and patterns. It's exhausting and my energy is thin right now, so I can sit with it for a few breaths before the explanatory loop pulls me away; please cue me with the phrase when I start analyzing so I can try to re-anchor.

Therapist: When you start to analyze or narrativize the sensation, I'll cue you with "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's continue with a short pause. Notice the sensation of the shame that arises, and as you're about to start explaining or analyzing, I'll say "I'm feeling this ache in my body". Let's try to re-anchor the sensation, without trying to change it or understand it. Simply acknowledge the shame as a mental event, and let it be. Can you notice the sensation, without judgment or curiosity?

Patient: Okay—when I try to notice it without judgment there's a dense hollow under my ribs, a low band of pressure across my chest, breath shallow, throat tight, a hot flush in my face and a small knot in my stomach. My attention keeps flipping into analysis—"conditioned shame," "learned alarm"—which just sharpens the ache and makes me feel drained and distracted. Cue me with "I'm feeling this ache in my body" if I start narrativizing; I'm trying to stay with it but it's pretty hard right now.
