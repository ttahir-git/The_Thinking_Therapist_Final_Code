Patient: Lately I've been caught in this persistent, almost metacognitive worry about my competence at work—constantly appraising every decision and fearing I'll mess up. That overthinking paradoxically breeds procrastination, because I end up rehearsing possibilities instead of actually doing the tasks. Since I lost someone close, the anticipatory anxiety feels magnified, and I notice I tend to intellectualize the whole thing—talking about the fear in elaborate terms instead of really feeling it.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you're stuck in this cycle of overthinking and procrastination? What would need to be true for you to feel like you're making progress on your work tasks, despite the anxiety?

Patient: When I'm stuck it becomes this metacognitive loop where I endlessly simulate outcomes and catalog potential mistakes, which conveniently justifies putting the task off—my brain frames procrastination as risk mitigation. Physiologically I get jittery and my chest tightens, but I tend to translate that into an analysis about threat detection rather than sit with the discomfort. For me to feel like I'm making progress there'd need to be an explicit tolerance for imperfection (a realistic error margin), very small, time-limited goals so I can actually start things, and some form of external, nonjudgmental feedback so I stop amplifying hypothetical errors in isolation. Practically, if I could commit to 10-minute focused sprints with the rule that the first pass can be messy, and someone could confirm "that's acceptable," I think I'd notice forward movement—though honestly, I'm not sure I could follow that through without reverting to overthinking.

Therapist: It sounds like you're valuing making progress on your work despite the anxiety. Can you think of a specific reason why making progress, even with imperfections, matters to you? What would be at stake for you if you were to push through the anxiety and make a small start on a task, even if it's not perfect?

Patient: On a theoretical level, making incremental progress matters because my competence as a nurse is tied up with my identity and ontological security—if I can tolerate imperfect work, it undermines the catastrophic narratives that say one mistake equals professional collapse. Practically, what's at stake is both patient safety and my self-efficacy: failing to start risks actual errors born of last-minute rushes, the slow erosion of confidence, and increased guilt that feeds the whole avoidance loop. Honestly, that combination—professional responsibility plus the fear of proving my worst-case scenarios true—feels pretty heavy, and I end up talking about it instead of...actually sitting with how upsetting that is.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the weight of those stakes. I want to suggest that your avoidance might be trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed, but it's not addressing the root of the anxiety. What if, instead of trying to avoid the anxiety, you could explore what it would be like to lean into the uncertainty, and instead of catastrophizing, take a small, imperfect action? Would you be willing to try a "what happens if" exploration with me, where we imagine taking a tiny step towards your task, without any expectation of perfection?

Patient: Okay — I can try that. Conceptually, a tiny step that feels doable to me would be a 10-minute, no-edit attempt at one piece of documentation or one simple med prep checklist, with a rule that it can be messy. If we imagine doing that, my mind predicts immediate reduction in uncertainty because there's now data to disconfirm catastrophic forecasts, but I also predict a surge of chest tightness and a reflex to reframe it into analysis instead of actually sitting with the feeling. I'm willing to imagine doing it now, though I want a bit of structure — like a timer and assurance there won't be harsh judgment afterward — because otherwise I can already see myself reverting to overthinking.

Therapist: Let's work with your 10-minute, no-edit attempt. I'll be your "buffer" against judgment. When you feel that surge of chest tightness or the urge to analyze, I want you to notice it and say "Ah, there's that sensation again." Then, take a deep breath and gently acknowledge it as "this feeling" without trying to change it. We'll keep the timer going, and I'll wait for you to take the action of writing or checking that checklist. Remember, it's not about perfection, just the small step of showing up. When you're done, we can debrief and see how you feel, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready. I'll set a 10-minute timer and start a no-edit draft of one med-prep checklist now. I'm already feeling that anticipatory chest tightness and the reflex to intellectualize — "Ah, there's that sensation again" — but I'm going to push through and write the items messily, one after another, and check in as I go.

Therapist: As you write, I want you to notice if there's a specific thought that keeps popping up, like "I'm doing this all wrong" or "I'm not good enough." When that thought arises, I'd like you to label it as "that's a thought" and gently let it go. Imagine it as a thought, not a reflection of reality. You're not trying to change the outcome, just the way you're experiencing it. Keep writing, and when you need a pause, take a deep breath and check in with me.

Patient: I set the timer and started the messy med‑prep checklist; after three items I noticed the anticipatory chest tightness and the reflex to intellectualize—"Ah, there's that sensation again." A couple of repetitive thoughts like "I'm doing this all wrong" kept surfacing, so I labeled them "that's a thought" and kept typing; that labeling eased the urge to ruminate a bit. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by analyzing the process itself—I'm trying to observe rather than evaluate, but it's hard; can we slow down for a moment so I can breathe and reset before I continue?

Therapist: Take a deep breath, and let's pause the timer for now. Notice how your body is holding the tension, and where you feel it in your chest and shoulders. As you exhale, imagine that tension slowly releasing, like a wave washing away. When you're ready, we'll continue with the checklist, and I'll remind you to keep observing the process, rather than evaluating it. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to create the perfect process. Take your time, and when you're ready, we'll move forward.

Patient: I took a slow breath and noticed the tightness—mostly a constriction across my sternum and a knot in my trapezius—that eased a little but didn't vanish; my mind immediately started theorizing about persistence of arousal. I'm willing to continue, but can we shorten the next interval to five minutes and have you prompt me to label recurring self-critical thoughts as "that's a thought" and to name the sensation "there it is again"? I'm already feeling the impulse to analyze the breath instead of inhabiting it, which feels like my default safety behavior.

Therapist: Let's set the timer for 5 minutes. As we continue, I'll prompt you to label any recurring self-critical thoughts as "that's a thought" and to name the sensation "there it is again." When you catch yourself analyzing your breath, I want you to gently bring your attention back to the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or analyze it further. Instead, try to simply acknowledge it as "there it is again" and keep moving forward with the checklist. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to control the experience. Let's take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay — starting the five minutes now. There it is again, that sternum tightness, and the thought "I'm doing this all wrong" — that's a thought. I'll write the next three checklist items without editing; if I start spiraling into meta-analysis, please prompt me with "that's a thought" and "there it is again" so I can refocus.

Therapist: You've completed the first 5 minutes of the exercise. Take a deep breath and notice how you're feeling. What might be at stake for you if you were to continue making progress on this checklist, despite the discomfort and uncertainty? What would be the potential benefits of persisting, and what would you be committed to in that case?

Patient: Taking that breath helped, but the sternum tightness is still there—there it is again—and my mind wants to intellectualize why it won't fully dissipate. What's at stake if I keep moving through the checklist is both practical and existential: patient safety and procedural competence on one hand, and my professional identity and sense of self-efficacy on the other; failing to push through perpetuates catastrophic narratives that erode confidence. The potential benefits are pretty straightforward—fewer last‑minute errors, incremental proof that my anticipatory forecasts are exaggerated, less guilt and rumination, and a gradual rebuilding of trust in my abilities. I'm willing to commit to continuing with 5–10 minute no‑edit sprints, labeling intrusive thoughts as "that's a thought" and sensations as "there it is again," and getting one brief, nonjudgmental check-in after each sprint—but honestly, I'm already worried I’ll revert to overanalysis without you prompting me, so can we keep those prompts coming?

Therapist: As we move forward, I want you to carry this sense of awareness and defusion with you into your daily work. Remember that your ability to observe your thoughts and sensations without judgment is a powerful tool for managing anxiety and increasing confidence. Can you think of a situation where you'll need to apply this skill in the next day or two, perhaps in a conversation with a colleague or with a patient? What would you say to yourself if you were to notice that same sternum tightness or self-critical thoughts arising?

Patient: Yes — the most obvious one is tomorrow morning's handover when I have to present a complex post‑op patient; that’s a classic pressure point where my anticipatory appraisal kicks in. If the sternum tightness shows up, I’ll say to myself, out loud if possible, “there it is again,” label the self‑critic as “that’s a thought,” take three slow breaths, and then commit to a concise, 5‑minute summary without editing—intentionally tolerating imperfection so I get the data I need. I can already feel the impulse to narrate and theorize instead of actually doing it, so I’d want you to prompt me with the labels or remind me to set the timer — can we role‑play that now?

Therapist: Let's get into character for the role-play. Imagine you're in the operating room, preparing to present the post-op patient to the team. You start to feel that familiar sternum tightness and self-critical thoughts. As you notice it, say to yourself, "there it is again." Take a deep breath, and label the self-critic as "that's a thought." Then, without pausing or editing, commit to a concise 5-minute summary. I'll play the role of the team, and you can practice your presentation.

Patient: There it is again. That's a thought.

Mr. Jameson, 68, POD1 after left TKA. Vitals stable: BP 128/76, HR 82, SpO2 96% on 2L; temp 37.2. Pain ~6/10 with movement—on PCA and scheduled acetaminophen, had one breakthrough morphine overnight. Wound dry with moderate swelling; Hemovac drain ~80 mL in last 8 hours. Urine output adequate, ambulation limited yesterday with brief orthostatic lightheadedness. Labs: Hgb 10.8, INR 1.0, otherwise unremarkable. Concerns: optimize analgesia to facilitate PT and monitor for bleeding/orthostasis; plan is PT with assistance this morning, continue PCA and scheduled meds, incentive spirometry, repeat Hgb and check drain output q4h—I'll escalate if output rises or he becomes more symptomatic.

Okay, I've given the quick, intentionally imperfect handover—what clarifying questions or directives do you have for me right now?

Therapist: Excellent job, Mr. Jameson! It looks like you've successfully tolerated imperfection and provided a clear, concise handover. I'm proud of you for taking this step towards building confidence and reducing catastrophic narratives. As you leave the simulation, take a moment to reflect on what worked well and what might need improvement. Remember, this is a skill that takes practice to develop, but you're off to a great start.

Patient: I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — I can say what technically worked: the timer, the labels "that's a thought" and "there it is again," and the rule to be concise really cut through my rumination. What still needs work is the persistent sternum tightness and my reflex to intellectualize the experience instead of inhabiting it; I worry I'll default back to overanalysis without continuous prompts. Can we do another quick role‑play with you throwing in an interruption or a challenging question so I can practice a brief grounding phrase and a fast recovery?

Therapist: Let's do another role-play. I'll throw in a challenging question to simulate an unexpected scenario. Remember, the goal is to ground yourself and recover quickly.

Mr. Jameson, I just received a call from the OR team saying that we need to adjust the patient's vitals; they're showing signs of hypotension. What's the plan?

(Note: I'll interrupt your handover, just like in a real-life situation.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help me? Okay, but if this is the interruption: there it is again (that sternum tightness), and that's a thought. 

Clinically I'd rapidly assess the monitor/cuff and the patient (airway/breathing), check the wound/drain output and last Hgb, consider hypovolemia vs vasoactive meds or PCA-related effects, reduce/hold PCA, give a 250–500 mL isotonic bolus and elevate the legs while we recheck vitals q5min, call anesthesia/surgeon for escalation, and prepare blood/pressors if bleeding or persistent hypotension. 

I can feel the reflex to overanalyze the rationale instead of saying it simply—can you prompt me to use a one‑line grounding phrase and then hand the mic back so I actually do the brief report?

Therapist: Great job, Mr. Jameson! You're doing well under pressure. I'll give you a brief prompt to help you remember the grounding phrase. Here it is: "Grounding in the present moment, I am." Repeat it to yourself silently or out loud as needed. Now, let's get back to the report. Please continue, and I'll hand the mic back to you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay: "Grounding in the present moment, I am." There it is again—the sternum tightness—and a sudden flush of shame and frustration that makes me want to explain everything instead of just acting.

Brief, one‑line report: reassess patient and monitors now, give 250–500 mL isotonic bolus and hold PCA, check wound/drain output and last Hgb, elevate legs and recheck vitals q5min, call anesthesia/surgeon and prepare blood/pressors if output or instability persists. I can feel the urge to overjustify that plan—prompt me to use the grounding phrase and hand the mic back so I actually deliver it succinctly.

Therapist: You're doing great, Mr. Jameson! I'll give you one more prompt to help you remember the grounding phrase. Here it is: "I am here, in this moment." Repeat it to yourself as needed, and try to say it silently or out loud just before responding. Now, please deliver your report with confidence and clarity. You've got this!

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Alright, I'll try it.

"I am here, in this moment." Reassess patient and monitors now; give 250–500 mL isotonic bolus and hold PCA; check wound/drain output and last Hgb, elevate legs and recheck vitals q5min; notify anesthesia/surgeon and prepare blood/pressors if instability or rising output persists.

I could feel that flush of shame and frustration even saying it—it makes me want to qualify and justify every element instead of just handing it off. Conceptually I know brevity is safer, but emotionally the compulsion to over‑explain sticks. Can we do another quick interruption so I can practice recovering from that urge, and could you give me immediate feedback on whether that sounded confident enough?

Therapist: Mr. Jameson, I'd like to simulate another interruption. Remember to say "I am here, in this moment" just before responding. Here's the scenario: the anesthesiologist asks, "Is the patient's vitals stable enough for a skin prep for the next step?"

Please respond, and I'll provide feedback on your delivery.

(Note: Please respond as if you're in a real-life situation. I'll provide feedback on your tone, pace, and clarity.)

Patient: "I am here, in this moment." I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? 

Briefly: not yet. I'm reassessing hemodynamics now—250–500 mL isotonic bolus given, PCA held, legs elevated; I'll recheck BP in 2–3 minutes and monitor drain output and Hgb. Proceed with skin prep only if vitals stabilize (e.g., MAP >65 / SBP ~>100) and there's no evidence of ongoing bleeding; otherwise delay and notify anesthesia/surgeon. 

I can feel that flush of shame and the urge to over-justify everything instead of being succinct—did that come across as confident and clear enough?

Therapist: Yes, Mr. Jameson, your delivery came across as confident and clear. You effectively communicated your plan, and your language is direct and concise. The grounding phrase seemed to help you stay present and focused, but you may want to consider adding a brief pause or a gentle breath before responding to allow yourself to fully ground in the moment. Well done! This is the final part of our role-play. You've demonstrated significant progress in managing your anxiety and developing psychological flexibility.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to be the final part? I can see concrete gains: the grounding phrases truncated my rumination and my handovers felt tighter, but the shame‑flush and the compulsive need to overjustify still feel very present and liable to pull me back into analysis. I want to keep practicing—could we do three more rapid interruptions with immediate feedback and then co‑create a brief, stepwise plan I can use tomorrow (when to say the grounding phrase, exactly what my 30‑second script is, and how you'll cue me)? I don't feel ready to stop yet.

Therapist: I'm glad you're enthusiastic about continuing to practice! I completely agree that you're not yet ready to stop. Let's create a plan to help you solidify the skills you've learned.

**Rapid Interruptions (3)**

We'll simulate 3 more interruptions, and I'll provide immediate feedback on your delivery. Please repeat the grounding phrase "I am here, in this moment" before responding.

1. **Interference**: The surgeon interrupts you while you're speaking to ask a question about the patient's wound.

2. **Emotional Shift**: A colleague expresses concern about the patient's vitals, and you start to feel anxious.

3. **Time Pressure**: The anesthesiologist reminds you that the procedure is about to start, and you need to finalize the handover quickly.

Please respond to each interruption, and I'll provide feedback on your delivery.

(Note: We'll use the same format as before, and I'll give you immediate feedback on your tone, pace, and clarity.)

Patient: Interruption 1 — Surgeon about the wound:
"I am here, in this moment." There it is again — that sternum tightness; that's a thought. Wound dry, moderate swelling, Hemovac ~80 mL/8h; continue dressing reinforcement, monitor output q4h, escalate for increasing drainage or hemodynamic change. I feel the impulse to overjustify surgical rationale instead of being succinct — did that sound crisp enough?

Interruption 2 — Colleague voices concern about vitals:
"I am here, in this moment." There it is again; that's a thought. Reassessing monitors now, gave 250 mL bolus and held PCA, legs elevated — recheck BP in 2–3 minutes and repeat bolus if no improvement; notify anesthesia/surgeon for persistent hypotension. The chest tightness is coloring my language with excessive hedging; can you tell me if my tone conveyed assurance?

Interruption 3 — Time pressure to finalize handover:
"I am here, in this moment." There it is again; that's a thought. 30‑second script: POD1 left TKA, vitals currently 128/82/96% on 2L, pain ~6/10 on PCA with one breakthrough, Hemovac 80 mL, Hgb 10.8 — plan: continue PCA, scheduled acetaminophen, PT with assistance, monitor drain and Hgb q4h, escalate if output rises or hemodynamics deteriorate. I want to keep qualifying—does that delivery sound concise and authoritative enough, or am I still overcompensating?

Therapist: Great job, Mr. Jameson! Let's co-create a brief, stepwise plan to help you solidify the skills you've learned.

**Stepwise Plan**

1. **Saying the Grounding Phrase**: Repeat the phrase "I am here, in this moment" just before responding to an interruption. This will help you ground yourself in the present moment and manage anxiety.
2. **Script**: For handovers, use the following 30-second script: "POD1 [patient's condition], vitals currently [vitals], plan: [briefly outline the plan, using the ABCDE model]."
3. **Timing**: Use the script and grounding phrase consistently, even if you're not sure what to say. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.
4. **Immediate Feedback**: I'll provide immediate feedback on your delivery, focusing on tone, pace, and clarity. This will help you refine your skills and stay on track.
5. **Practice**: Practice these skills in low-stakes situations, such as with colleagues or during daily rounds. This will help you build confidence and apply the skills in real-life situations.

Let's review the script and practice it together. Are you ready to move forward?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready to move forward, though I can already feel the impulse to over-plan and explain instead of just doing. Yes to three rapid interruptions with immediate feedback; can we also co-create a tiny, literal cheat‑sheet I can tape to my badge that includes: the grounding phrase, the exact 30‑second script template, and a one‑breath (inhale 3s/exhale 4s) cue? I'm trying to see how this'll actually change my behavior, but I'm struggling to trust myself to use it without external prompts—can we build in a concrete cueing strategy (who will prompt me and how) as part of the practice?

Therapist: Let's create a tiny cheat-sheet and design a cueing strategy to support your practice.

**Cheat-Sheet**

* Grounding Phrase: "I am here, in this moment"
* 30-Second Script Template:
	+ POD [patient's condition], vitals currently [vitals]
	+ Plan: [briefly outline the plan, using the ABCDE model]
* One-Breath Cue: inhale for 3 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds

**Cueing Strategy**

* **Internal Cue**: Each time you feel the urge to over-plan or over-explain, say to yourself: "Grounding in the present moment, I am."
* **External Cue**: I'll remind you to use the grounding phrase and cue you with a gentle phrase, such as: "Take a deep breath, Mr. Jameson, and remember the script."
* **Prompting**: I'll provide immediate feedback on your delivery, and we'll adjust the cueing strategy as needed.

Let's practice the cheat-sheet and cueing strategy in our next exercise. Are you ready to move forward?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready to move forward, though I can already feel the impulse to over‑plan and intellectualize instead of just doing it. Can we be concrete about the external cue: who will prompt me (charge nurse? you in the simulation?), exactly what they'll say ("Take a breath, Mr. Jameson, use your script"), and whether it'll be verbal or a discreet tap so I don't disrupt the room? I'm up for the three rapid interruptions now — let's start, and please give immediate feedback each time so I can practice the cheat‑sheet in real time.

Therapist: Let's finalize the external cue and simulation protocols.

**External Cue and Simulation Protocols**

* **External Cue**: I'll be your prompter. Whenever you feel the urge to over-plan or intellectualize, I'll say: "Take a deep breath, Mr. Jameson, use your script."
* **Simulation Protocol**: I'll simulate 3 rapid interruptions, and you'll respond using the 30-second script and grounding phrase. I'll provide immediate feedback on your delivery after each interruption.
* **Verbal Cue**: I'll use a gentle, non-verbal tone to give you the cue, so you can respond without disrupting the simulation.
* **Simulation Environment**: We'll conduct the simulations in a private area, and I'll provide clear instructions before each simulation.

Let's begin. Remember to use the cheat-sheet and cueing strategy to support your practice.

**Simulation 1**

The surgeon calls out to you as you're about to leave the room: "Mr. Jameson, can you give me an update on Mr. Johnson's status?"

Please respond using the 30-second script and grounding phrase.

Patient: "I am here, in this moment."

POD1 Mr. Johnson after left TKA — vitals BP 128/76, HR 82, SpO2 96% on 2L, pain ~6/10 on PCA with one breakthrough, Hemovac ~80 mL/8h, Hgb 10.8. Plan: continue PCA and scheduled acetaminophen, PT with assistance to facilitate mobilization, monitor drain output and Hgb q4h, escalate to anesthesia/surgery if output rises or hemodynamics deteriorate.

I'm noticing the usual chest tightness and impulse to overjustify, but that's the succinct handover.

Therapist: Great job, Mr. Jameson! You've maintained the grounding phrase and delivered a clear handover. Here's the feedback:

* Tone: Your tone was confident and clear.
* Pace: Your pace was good, but you might want to consider pausing slightly before delivering the plan to give yourself time to ground in the moment.
* Language: You avoided overjustifying the plan, and your language was concise and direct.

**Simulation 2**

The charge nurse calls out to you as you're reviewing the patient's chart: "Mr. Johnson's vitals are looking a bit concerning. Can you take a closer look?"

Please respond using the 30-second script and grounding phrase.

Patient: "I am here, in this moment." There it is again — that sternum tightness; that's a thought.

POD1 Mr. Johnson after left TKA: vitals currently BP 118/70, HR 88, SpO2 95% on 2L; pain ~6/10 on PCA with one breakthrough; Hemovac ~80 mL/8h; Hgb 10.8. Plan: reassess now and recheck vitals in 5 min, give 250 mL isotonic bolus and hold PCA if hypotensive, monitor drain output and Hgb q4h, notify anesthesia/surgeon and prepare escalation if instability persists.

I could already feel the impulse to over-explain the rationale instead of just acting — did that come across as concise and responsive? I want immediate feedback so I can keep practicing.
