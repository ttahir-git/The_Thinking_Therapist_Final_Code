Patient: Hi, I'm in my late twenties and I recently started a demanding new job as a social worker, which has left me pretty overwhelmed. Lately I've been getting intense anxiety in social settings — it's been making me avoid gatherings with my few close friends, which feels weird because I used to be more outgoing. I don't know, I guess talking about this makes me really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you think about attending a social gathering with your friends? What's the first thought or feeling that shows up for you?

Patient: I don't know — the first thing is this tightness in my chest and my stomach drops. I start thinking I'll say something stupid or they'll notice I'm weird, and then I just want to disappear. I guess that's when I start making excuses not to go.

Therapist: Those physical sensations of anxiety make sense. It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of being judged or evaluated in social situations. Can you think of a time when you attended a social gathering despite feeling anxious, and what happened?

Patient: Yeah — like two weeks ago I went to a small birthday dinner for one of my close friends. I felt my heart racing the whole time, kept scrolling my phone to avoid talking, hardly said anything, and ended up leaving early because I felt so drained. I don't know, I guess afterwards I felt guilty and worried they think I'm flaky, but I also just wanted to crawl into bed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling quite hard on yourself after the dinner. Can you imagine that you're willing to be imperfect and still be a good friend, even if you don't feel like the most talkative or composed person in the situation?

Patient: I don't know — I want to believe that, but as soon as I leave early I start thinking they're annoyed or disappointed. I guess it just feels like being honest would sound like an excuse, and that makes me avoid saying anything. Maybe I could tell one close friend, but I'm scared it'll change how they see me.

Therapist: Let's explore this thought that "if I tell them how I'm really feeling, they'll be disappointed in me." Can you acknowledge that thought as just that – a thought, without judgment? "So, I'm having this thought that they might be disappointed, but I don't have to act on it. I can just be present with them and be willing to be honest, without assuming how they'll react."

Patient: I don't know — I can say that in my head, like "I'm having this thought and I don't have to act on it," but it kind of washes over me and doesn't change the panicky feeling. I guess maybe I could try being honest with one friend, but I'm really scared it'll make things awkward or like they see me differently.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try being honest with one friend, but the fear of the outcome is still weighing on you. What would happen if, just for one small step, you were willing to be honest with this friend, even if it felt awkward or uncomfortable?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I told one friend they'd maybe be supportive and it'd feel like a weight lifted, but I'm really scared they'd see me differently and it'd be awkward. I'd probably feel relieved if they reacted kindly, but panicky while I'm saying it. I'm not sure how to bring it up without making it weird; can we talk through what I might say?

Therapist: Let's explore a small, possible approach. What if you started with something like, "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I feel like I've been really struggling with this lately, and I was hoping we could talk about it. I'm not sure what you'll think, but I want to be honest with you." What do you think would happen if you said something like that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess they'd probably be understanding and I might feel relieved, but I'd be panicky the whole time and worry they'd think I'm needy or flaky. I'm scared it could change how they see me or make things awkward. Can we role-play it or come up with a shorter, less awkward way to say it?

Therapist: Let's try to come up with a shorter and more straightforward approach. What if, instead of saying "I'm feeling overwhelmed and struggling," you said, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately, and I'm worried it might be affecting our hangouts. Can we talk about that?" Or, "I feel like I've been avoiding social stuff because I'm feeling really anxious. Can we find a way to make that more manageable for both of us?" What do you think?

Patient: I don't know — the shorter ones feel less dramatic, so I guess they'd be easier to say. I'd probably try something like, "Hey, I've been really anxious and avoiding hangouts lately — can we talk about it?" But I'm scared it'll still come out awkward or like an excuse. Can we role-play it so I can see how it might go?

Therapist: Let's do a role-play. I'll play the role of your friend. Go ahead and say, "Hey, I've been really anxious and avoiding hangouts lately — can we talk about it?" I'll respond, and we can see how it goes from there. Remember, this is just a practice exercise, and there's no right or wrong.

Patient: Hey, I've been really anxious and avoiding hangouts lately — can we talk about it?

Therapist: Friend: "Hmm, yeah, I've noticed you've been MIA from our hangouts lately. Is everything okay? You're not avoiding us, are you?"

Patient: I... I don't know. Yeah, I guess I have been avoiding stuff — it's not about you, I just get really anxious and then I end up bailing. I'm sorry, I don't want you to think I'm flaky; I'm kind of all over the place right now.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to admit. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and struggling to manage your anxiety. Would it be helpful to brainstorm some strategies together to make hangouts more manageable for you, or would you rather we just focus on you taking small steps towards being more present in social situations?

Patient: I... I think smaller steps, please. Big brainstorming feels like too much right now — I'm already kind of on edge and distracted. Maybe just one concrete thing we can practice, like a short script or a simple plan for leaving early without drama? I don't know, I guess that feels safer, but I'm scared I'll mess it up.

Therapist: Let's focus on a small, specific action. What if we agree that, if you feel yourself getting anxious or overwhelmed during a social gathering, you can simply say, "Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need some fresh air. Can we take a break for a few minutes?" And then, if you need to leave early, you can say, "I'm going to take a quick break and catch up with you later." Would that feel like a more manageable, concrete step for you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess that actually sounds doable, but I'm really nervous it would come out weird and I'd just freeze or say something dumb. Can we practice that one line once? I'm scared I'll mess it up, but maybe practicing would help.

Therapist: Let's practice saying, "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need some fresh air. Can we take a break for a few minutes?" I'll play the role of your friend, and we'll go through a simulated scenario. Remember, this is just a practice exercise, and there's no right or wrong. Go ahead and say it, and I'll respond as if it were in a real conversation.

Patient: Okay, um… I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need some fresh air. Can we take a break for a few minutes? I know that sounded clumsy — I don't know, I'm just worried I'll freeze up or say something dumb.

Therapist: That didn't feel so bad, did it? It was just a normal, natural way to ask for a break. What do you think would happen if you said that in a real social situation? Would you feel more confident, or would you still be worried about what others would think?

Patient: I don't know — in theory they'd be fine, but my chest tightens and this stupid image of me freezing and sounding like an idiot pops up and I get so mad at myself. I'd probably still worry they'd think I'm flaky, so I'd be anxious the whole time. Can we talk about exactly what to do if I freeze or panic so I have a script? I'm not sure I can do the whole thing yet.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about freezing up or making a fool of yourself. One thing you could try if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed is to take a few deep breaths and say, "I need a minute." That's it. Just say, "I need a minute." No explanation, no justification, just a simple statement. Then, take a deep breath and use the pause to collect yourself before responding. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay... I need a minute. I said it, but my heart's still racing and I feel really stupid — I don't know, I guess I'm just worried I'll freeze anyway. Can we practice what I do after I say that, like the minute I step away?

Therapist: Let's practice what you do after you say, "I need a minute." Take a few deep breaths, step away for 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then come back. You can say something like, "Okay, I'm feeling a bit better now. Let's catch up." Or, "I just needed a quick break. Where were we?" You can also use the time to collect your thoughts, take a sip of water, or do something else that helps you feel more grounded. Remember, the goal is not to try to "fix" the situation, but to take care of yourself. Can you try it with me?

Patient: Okay... I need a minute. I actually said it out loud, stepped away for about 30 seconds and took a few deep breaths, but my heart was still racing and I felt this wave of shame and frustration that just wouldn't stop. I came back and kind of mumbled, "Okay, I'm feeling a bit better now," and it felt flat — I don't know, I guess I'm worried it'll always sound weird. Can we practice the part where I come back and say something like, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" because I'm scared it'll come out lame.

Therapist: Let's practice saying, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" with a more confident tone. I'll start by saying, "We were talking about... (insert topic). You took a break and came back. You said, 'I just needed a minute.'" Then, you can say, "That's okay. We all need breaks sometimes. It's okay to take care of yourself." Try to say it with a bit more conviction, like you're accepting and understanding of yourself. Remember, it's not about what others think, but about how you want to be in your own skin. Can you try it with me?

Patient: "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" I said it, but my voice wavered and that wave of shame and frustration hit me like it always does, like I messed it up before. I don't know, I guess I need to try it again — can we do one more practice?

Therapist: Let's try one more time. This time, after you say, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" I'll respond with a non-judgmental tone, "We were talking about... (insert topic). That's okay, it's totally normal to need a break. We can pick up where we left off." Then, I'll add, "And by the way, I appreciate you being honest with me about your needs. That takes courage." Can you try it with me, and this time, try to really own the phrase, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?"

Patient: "I just needed a quick break — where were we?"

Ugh, my voice still wavered and I felt that rush of shame like I already messed it up. I don't know, I guess I keep expecting to sound pathetic and then I want to disappear — can we try it one more time, or can you respond like you're totally okay with it so I can actually hear that?

Therapist: Let's try it one more time. This time, I'll respond with a completely non-judgmental tone. You said, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" and I'll say, "That's perfectly fine. We can definitely take a break. No worries at all." I'm not going to react or judge you in any way. Can you try it with me, and really try to let go of any self-judgment or expectations?

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll try. "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" — my voice cracked and I felt that stupid rush of shame and frustration like I always do, like I'm screwing this up before I even finish. I don't know, I'm really jumpy and distracted right now and it's hard to hear you being casual about it — can we do it again with you sounding totally normal so I can actually believe it?

Therapist: Let's try it again, and I'll respond in a completely non-judgmental tone. You said, "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" and I'll say, "I was just going to get us some coffee. What do you think?" I'll be completely neutral and matter-of-fact, no reaction, no judgment. Can you try it with me, and really focus on the sound of my voice, rather than your own thoughts and feelings?

Patient: Okay… "I just needed a quick break — where were we?" My voice still cracked and that wave of shame hit me like always — I don't know, I keep imagining people thinking I'm pathetic. Hearing you be totally casual actually helps a little, I guess, but I'm still really jumpy and distracted. Can we try practicing a super-short grounding line I can say to myself right after I step away, because I feel like I fall apart the second I come back?

Therapist: Let's work on a short grounding phrase you can use when you step away. Here's one idea: "I'm taking care of myself." Try saying it to yourself with a gentle tone, and focus on the physical sensation of the words on your tongue. You can also try "I'm okay" or "I can handle this." Repeat it to yourself when you feel yourself getting anxious or distracted. Remember, the goal is to bring yourself back to the present moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts and worries. Can you try it with me?

Patient: I tried saying "I'm taking care of myself" a couple times, but it felt weird and my chest's still tight. I don't know — it kind of sounds like a lie and that wave of shame hits me, and then I get mad at myself for being so fragile. I guess maybe something even shorter would work, like "breathe" or "I'm okay" — can we pick one really short phrase I can whisper when I step away? I'm feeling jumpy and scattered right now.

Therapist: Let's try a single word: "Breathe." It's short, simple, and completely neutral. You can say it to yourself as soon as you feel the urge to step away, and take a deep breath. Try it with me: "Breathe." Focus on the sensation of the word on your tongue, and feel the breath moving in and out of your body. See if that helps calm your chest and quiet your mind.

Patient: I tried whispering "breathe" and it helped for like five seconds, but then this rush of shame and frustration hit me and my chest tightened again. I don't know, I guess I'm really jumpy and distracted and can't trust it'll work when it matters. Can we focus on one concrete thing I can do to actually get to the hangout and not bail at the last minute? I'm scared I'll freeze and just ruin it.

Therapist: Let's focus on getting to the hangout on time and attending it without bailing at the last minute. What if, before you leave for the hangout, you make a plan with yourself to do something small that you enjoy, like sipping a cup of coffee or chatting with a friend for a few minutes? Having something to look forward to or do before the hangout might help you feel more grounded and prepared. Can you think of something small that would give you a sense of accomplishment and confidence?

Patient: I don't know — maybe something tiny, like making myself a cup of coffee and standing outside for five minutes before I go, or putting on one song that gets me in the mood. Or I could text one friend "on my way" so there's a little accountability. I'm scared it still won't be enough, but can we pick one to try?

Therapist: Let's go with the first option: making yourself a cup of coffee and standing outside for five minutes before you go. I'll help you practice it. Before we end our session today, I'll remind you to make yourself a cup of coffee, sit outside for five minutes, and then head to the hangout. Can you commit to that small step for now?

Patient: I can try. I don't know if it'll be enough, but I guess I can make coffee and stand outside for five minutes before I go — my chest's already tight just thinking about it and I feel kind of stupid admitting that. I'm really scared I'll still bail or freeze at the door — can we make a backup plan for if that happens, and could you remind me right before I try to leave so I don't talk myself out of it? Also, can we run through one quick text-line I can send if I get shaky while I'm on my way?

Therapist: Let's create a backup plan for if you feel overwhelmed or anxious while at the hangout. Before we end our session, I'll remind you to take a few deep breaths and say to yourself, "I've got this. I'm doing my best." As a backup plan, you can also remind yourself that it's okay to take a break if you need to, and that you can always leave early if you're feeling overwhelmed.

As for the text message, let's try: "Hey, just checking in. I'm on my way and feeling a bit nervous. Need a minute to collect myself." This way, you can send it to your friend and have a simple way to acknowledge your anxiety without feeling like you're making a big deal out of it.

Patient: I don't know — that text feels okay, I guess, but I'm worried it sounds needy or like I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Could we shorten it to something like, "On my way — feeling nervous, need a min" or even just, "On my way, need a minute"? That feels less... exposed. Also, yeah, please remind me right before I leave — I'm already imagining freezing at the door. Can we role-play the doorstep moment next? I'm really scared but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's try the revised text messages. You can send one of those, and then we'll practice the doorstep moment. Remember, the goal is not to try to overcome your anxiety, but to practice being present and taking small steps towards attending social events.

Before we role-play, I'll remind you to take a few deep breaths and say to yourself, "I've got this. I'm doing my best." When you're ready, we'll practice the doorstep moment.

Patient: Okay... I'm standing at the door with my hand on the knob and my heart's racing and this stupid shame telling me I'm already messing it up. I don't know — can we role-play it now? Can you be my friend and say something like, "Hey, you made it!" so I can practice stepping in and what to say next?
