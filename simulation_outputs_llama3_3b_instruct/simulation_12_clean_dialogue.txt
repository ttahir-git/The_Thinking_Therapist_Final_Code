Patient: Uh, well… I'm in my early fifties, been on construction sites my whole life, but starting this new, more demanding job has me... kinda off. I keep using jokes and sarcasm to dodge feeling overwhelmed — I guess that's my go-to when things get heavy. I don't know, it's hard to talk about without making a joke.

Therapist: That makes sense. Humor can be a way to temporarily escape or diffuse tension. Can you think of a recent situation where you used humor to avoid feeling overwhelmed, and what was the underlying emotion that you were trying to avoid?

Patient: Yeah — like last Tuesday my foreman asked me to pick up the new scheduling software and I kept screwing it up. I cracked a bunch of jokes about being a “technology dinosaur” so nobody had to see me flail. I guess underneath I was embarrassed and afraid I wasn't up to the job… I don't know, it just makes me want to dodge the whole thing.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that fear of not being up to the job. What's the value that's important to you in your work, something that you feel confident about or passionate about?

Patient: I guess what matters to me is doing solid, honest work and being someone the crew can count on — putting food on the table and not being the weak link. I'm proud of the craft stuff; it makes me feel useful. I don't know, talking about this feels kinda awkward.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using your self-worth to create a sense of security in your work. What would it be like if, instead of relying on your pride in your craft to feel secure, you were able to cultivate a sense of self-acceptance and confidence that came from within?

Patient: I guess it'd feel... lighter, like I wouldn't have to put on a show all the time and could actually ask for help when I need it. I don't know, though — it's weird and kinda scary to think about dropping that shield. How do you even start doing that?

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: notice your thoughts when you feel the urge to use humor or put on a tough face. What's the first thing that shows up, the first thought that pops into your head?

Patient: The first thought is usually, "Don't let them see you can't handle this" — I guess I'm afraid they'll think I'm soft or useless. So I make a joke to cover it up before anyone notices. I don't know, it feels dumb even saying that out loud.

Therapist: Can you imagine that your crewmates would be more interested in having a real conversation with you, rather than just a performance? What would that look like, and how would that feel?

Patient: I guess they'd be surprised — like they'd actually listen instead of just ducking my wisecracks. That would feel vulnerable, maybe even a relief if someone offered real help. I don't know, this is getting a bit tight for me; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's start with a tiny, everyday moment. Next time you're in a conversation with a coworker, instead of trying to be funny or tough, see if you can simply listen to them without interrupting or trying to respond with a joke. Can you try that for just one minute?

Patient: Okay, I can try that for a minute — I'll try to just listen and not jump in with a joke. I guess it'll feel weird and I'll probably get antsy; can you remind me what I'm supposed to focus on if my mind starts racing?

Therapist: As you sit with this moment, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sounds around you. Notice the physical sensations in your body, without judgment or trying to change them.

Patient: I tried it at lunch today — I planted my feet on the concrete and noticed the weight, and felt the garage air on my neck. My chest tightened and my hands started buzzing like I needed to break it with a joke; I managed to stay quiet for maybe 30 seconds before I blurted something to steer away. I don't know, it felt weird and kinda exposed. Can we slow down — what's a simple thing I can say to myself or out loud when that urge to joke shows up so I don't just dodge it?

Therapist: When you feel the urge to joke or change the subject, you can try saying to yourself (or out loud, if you prefer): "Pause." That's all, just "pause" – no judgment, no commentary, just a simple acknowledgment of the urge to respond.

Patient: Okay... "pause." Saying that even to myself brings up this hot shame — like that old screw-up's right there and I get mad at myself all over again. I don't know, it feels awful and makes me want to yank the joke out before anyone notices. I guess I'll try whispering "pause" under my breath, but can we slow down? How do I actually do that when the crew's around and I'm already red in the face?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and consider the idea that your crewmates are not looking to judge you, but are simply present and engaged in their own conversations. What if, instead of trying to protect yourself from their potential judgment, you could practice kindness and understanding towards yourself, even when you feel vulnerable or self-critical? You can try repeating the phrase "I've got this" or "I'm doing my best" under your breath, and see if that can help shift your inner dialogue.

Patient: I tried whispering something like "I've got this" and it felt... wrong — like a burn of shame right under my skin and I get mad at myself all over again. I don't know, saying that makes me want to toss out a joke so nobody sees me flinch. I guess I can try it, but what's a simpler line I can murmur that doesn't make me feel like a clown in front of the crew? Can we slow down — how do I do this without erupting into sarcasm?

Therapist: Let's try something even simpler: just "okay". It's a neutral, non-committal phrase that can help you pause without making you feel like you're admitting defeat or weakness. You can try murmuring "okay" under your breath when you feel the urge to joke or change the subject, and see if it can help you stay present without escalating the situation.

Patient: Okay... I tried murmuring "okay" and it just lights up that hot shame — like something from back then comes roaring up and I get mad at myself all over again. I don't know, my face goes hot and I blurt a joke before I can stop it. Could we try a tiny physical anchor instead — like pressing my thumb to my index finger or taking one slow breath — something neutral that can't be read as me being soft? I guess... can we slow down? This is getting tight.

Therapist: Let's try touching the back of your hand to your palm, or placing your hand on a stable object like the chair arm. This gentle, subtle touch can help calm your nervous system and provide a sense of grounding, without drawing attention to yourself. As you do this, bring your attention to your breath, and try to stay with it for just one more breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's touching my hand supposed to stop the buzz? I don't know, every time I try something like that it lights up that hot shame and my face goes red and I get mad at myself and want to toss out a joke. I guess I can try resting my hand on the chair arm and taking one slow breath, but what exactly am I supposed to do with my head while I'm doing it? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try this: as you rest your hand on the chair arm, bring your attention to the sensation of your hand making contact with the chair. Notice the feeling of your hand touching the surface, the sensation of your fingers pressing against the arm, and the weight of your hand on the chair. Now, slowly, and without thinking about it too much, bring your attention to your breath, and notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, without getting caught up in thoughts or urges to react.

Patient: Okay — my hand on the arm feels steady, but as I try to follow the breath this hot shame floods back and I get mad at myself all over again. I don't know, my chest clamps up and I want to toss out a joke before anyone sees me flinch; I guess I'm scared of sitting in it. Can we slow down — what do I actually do in that moment so I don't just blow it with sarcasm?

Therapist: Let's try this: when you feel the shame or self-criticism flooding in, and you know you're about to react impulsively, simply say to yourself, "I'll check in with the group after this." This small, concrete action gives you a clear exit strategy and allows you to transition out of the moment without judgment. You can then take a deep breath, and when you're ready, you can check in with the group, using your best "okay" or pause.

Patient: I guess I can try saying "I'll check in with the group after this," but I'm not sure how that actually stops the buzz—when I try to do something like that the hot shame floods me and I want to blurt a joke. I don't know how to say it without everyone thinking I'm slacking or making a scene; can you give me a quick, quiet example I could actually use on the site? Can we slow down — this is getting tight.

Therapist: Let's try this: as you feel the shame or self-criticism building, subtly tilt your head slightly to one side, and take a very brief pause (about a 1-2 second pause) before responding. This small, nonverbal cue can help signal to yourself that you need a moment to collect your thoughts before responding, without drawing attention to yourself or causing a scene.

Patient: I tried something like that before and all it did was make me more aware — my face goes hot and I get mad at myself and the joke just pops out. I don't know how a tiny head tilt's supposed to stop that. Can you give me a really short, quiet phrase or exact little move I can actually use on site so I don't blow it with sarcasm? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try this: take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and as you exhale, gently press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. This subtle physical action can help calm your nervous system and provide a clear signal that you need a moment to pause before responding.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's pressing my tongue supposed to stop the buzz? I tried taking a breath and it just lights up that hot shame and I get mad at myself all over again, and then the joke pops out before I can stop it. I don't know, can you give me one really tiny, quiet phrase or move I can actually use on the site that won't make me look soft? Can we slow down — this is getting tight.

Therapist: Let's try this: take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, make a small, barely perceptible nod to yourself, almost like a tiny, almost imperceptible "okay". This subtle physical action can serve as a private signal to yourself that you need a moment to pause and collect your thoughts, without drawing attention to yourself or causing a scene.

Patient: Ugh — I don't know, that tiny nod just makes me more aware and this hot shame floods back and I get mad at myself and the joke pops out. I guess maybe a really short, normal line like "one sec" or "hold up" might work on the site without sounding soft. Which of those would you pick, or is there an even quieter option I could try? Can we slow down — this is getting tight.

Therapist: Let's try this: "Just a sec". It's a brief, neutral phrase that acknowledges your need for a pause without drawing attention to yourself or committing to a specific action. It's also non-committal, which can help reduce the pressure to respond quickly or make a big deal about it.

Patient: Okay… I guess "Just a sec" might actually work — it's short and normal. I don't know, even that makes my face go hot and that old shame starts roaring and I want to toss out a joke before anyone notices. Can we slow down — could I try "hold up" or a tiny thumb-on-belt move instead, something even quieter?

Therapist: Let's try this: touch the edge of your belt buckle with your thumb. It's a tiny, almost imperceptible action that can serve as a private signal to yourself to pause and take a breath. This movement is so subtle that others are unlikely to notice, and it can help you regain control without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: I guess I could try the thumb-on-belt — I'll give it a shot — but I don't know, just thinking about doing that makes that hot shame from that old screw-up flare up and I get mad at myself and the joke just wants to pop out. It feels stupid and I worry it'll still read as me being soft or useless. Can we slow down? Maybe give me one more tiny, quiet option I can use on site that I won't have to explain.

Therapist: Take a pause. Just take a pause. This is not a word, not a phrase, not a gesture - just a pause. When you feel the urge to joke or react, simply pause.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to just pause. But when I do, that hot shame slams into me and I get mad at myself and a joke just wants to pop out — I don't know why. I guess I'm scared they'll think I'm useless; can we slow down? What's one tiny, follow-up move I can do after the pause so I don't blow it with sarcasm?

Therapist: As you pause, slowly lift your gaze up and look around the room, taking in the sights and sounds without focusing on anything in particular. This small, gentle movement can help you re-ground yourself and shift your attention away from the shame and self-criticism.

Patient: Okay — I tried lifting my gaze once and that hot shame just hit me, like I'm scanning for a way out. I don't know, I get mad at myself all over again and a joke bubbles up before I can stop it. Can we slow down — is there one more tiny thing I can do after looking around that won't make me look soft?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in through your nose, and as you exhale, gently roll your shoulders down and away from your ears. This small, subtle movement can help you release any remaining tension and move into a more present moment.

Patient: Okay — I rolled my shoulders like you said and I felt a tiny loosen up, but then that hot shame just slammed back and my face went bright and I wanted to throw out a joke before anyone noticed. I don't know, it still feels like I'm waiting for them to call me useless. Can we slow down — what's one really tiny, quiet follow-up move or phrase I can use right after the shoulder roll so I don't just blow it with sarcasm?

Therapist: Lean forward slightly, just a tiny bit, about 1-2 mm. This small movement can help you engage your body in a neutral, non-judgmental way, and provide a sense of stability and calm.

Patient: I tried leaning forward a bit and for a second it felt... okay, like a tiny bit steadier, but then that hot shame just slammed back and my face went bright and a joke wanted to pop out. I don't know, I guess I'm stuck waiting for them to call me useless and the pause just makes it worse. Can we slow down — give me one really tiny, quiet follow-up move or line I can use right after the lean that won't make me look soft?

Therapist: Make a tiny, almost imperceptible pursing of your lips. This small, subtle movement can help you engage your body in a neutral, non-judgmental way, and provide a sense of calm and focus.

Patient: I tried the lip-purse — it helped a little, then that hot shame hit and I got mad at myself and the joke wanted to pop out. I don't know, I guess I need one really tiny, quiet follow-up like "just a sec" or thumb-on-belt — which would be less noticeable on site? Can we slow down? This is getting tight.

Therapist: Take a brief pause, and then simply be still.

Patient: I tried that pause and being still — for a beat it settled, then that hot shame from that screw‑up just slammed back and the joke almost burst out. I don't know, being still feels like I'm waiting for them to call me useless and I get mad at myself all over again. Can we slow down? Give me one tiny, quiet follow‑up I can actually do so I don't blow it with sarcasm.

Therapist: Make a tiny, almost imperceptible nod to yourself, almost like a whispered "okay".

Patient: Ugh — I tried that tiny nod and that hot shame just slams back and I get mad at myself, and before I know it a joke pops out. I don't know how that tiny move's supposed to stop the buzz; I guess "just a sec" plus a thumb-on-belt feels safer — could I do those together? Can we slow down?
