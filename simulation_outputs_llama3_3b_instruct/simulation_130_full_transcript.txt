Patient: I'm an artist, and lately it feels like I'm moving through everything in muted tones—overwhelmed by sadness and a persistent lack of motivation since I lost someone close. It's leaking into my relationship; I withdraw, then ruminate about what I did or didn't say instead of actually connecting. I tend to intellectualize my emotions—frame them as patterns or theories—because sitting with the raw stuff feels unsafe, but that strategy's starting to feel empty.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be sadness and disconnection. A specific theme that stands out is your tendency to intellectualize your emotions as patterns or theories, which might be a coping mechanism to avoid feeling the raw emotions. Your goal for the answer is to gently challenge this avoidance strategy and explore the possibility of introducing a more experiential approach to emotional processing.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you intellectually analyze your emotions, like you're looking at a puzzle, trying to figure out why they're there? What does it feel like to step back from that intellectualization and sit with the sadness or overwhelm, even if it's uncomfortable?

Patient: I guess I default to forensic-style parsing—labeling symptoms, mapping triggers, hypothesizing cognitive distortions—because it makes the sadness look like an object I can dissect. When I try to stop that and actually sit with the feeling, it feels like pressure behind my ribs, a fog that blunts color, and a small, irrational terror that I’ll be swallowed by it if I stop thinking. I almost immediately recoil into analysis because the rawness feels undignified and embarrassing, like my creative identity will be discredited if I let myself be simply vulnerable. I don’t always know how to stay with it; I get restless and want to explain it away instead.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The core emotion still appears to be sadness and disconnection, but the added layer of anxiety and self-preservation comes into focus. A specific theme that stands out is your fear of vulnerability and perceived loss of creative identity. Your goal for the answer is to explore the possibility of introducing a sense of defusion, allowing you to step back from the pressure to be a "logical" or "analytical" person, and connect with your value of creativity and self-expression.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine a time when you were able to create something new, without the pressure of needing to control or analyze your emotions? What was it about that experience that felt most essential to you, and what do you think would happen if you started to allow yourself to create in a way that's not driven by the need for intellectual understanding, but more by a sense of curiosity and wonder?

Patient: Yeah—I can picture it: late-night studio work where I wasn't trying to prove anything, just messing with color and texture until something surprised me. The essential thing was absence of an explanatory narrative—no internal monologue translating everything into meaning—just sensory engagement and a tiny, steady curiosity. If I let curiosity and wonder lead instead of analysis, I think the work would feel braver and less stifled, maybe pull me out of the fog and reconnect me to people; but I'm also afraid it'd make my grief more visible and that I'd be judged for being messy or raw. I want that freedom, but part of me is stuck trying to rationalize how to get there so I don't have to actually feel the risk.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your fear of vulnerability and judgment has taken hold, and you're caught between the desire for creative freedom and the need to maintain control through analysis. A specific theme that stands out is your fear of being seen as vulnerable or "messy," which suggests a deeper fear of being exposed and possibly rejected. Your goal for the answer is to introduce a small, low-stakes experiment to practice defusion, allowing you to connect with your value of creativity and self-expression while taking a tiny step towards vulnerability.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small experiment. When you're working on your art, can you make a tiny, almost imperceptible shift in your attention? Instead of immediately analyzing your emotions or trying to control the outcome, allow yourself to focus on the sensation of your breath, or the feeling of the tool in your hand. What happens if you don't try to control what's happening, but instead allow yourself to simply be present with the experience?

Patient: When I try that, the analytical part of me salivates—there’s an almost immediate urge to narrate the breath, like I need to annotate the experience to make it safe. If I actually slow down and notice the tool in my hand, things do change: the pressure of the brush, the tiny resistance of the canvas, and the color feels a touch more alive—there’s a brief loosening in my chest. But it’s fragile; after a minute the familiar terror creeps back, and I find myself rationalizing why I need to go back to thinking. I want to learn how to extend that loosened minute, but I don’t know how to keep the explanatory voice from taking over.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The analytical voice is still present, and you're struggling to maintain the fragile sense of connection and looseness. A specific theme that stands out is your need to rationalize and control the experience, which suggests a deeper fear of uncertainty and the unknown. Your goal for the answer is to gently introduce a sense of willingness, allowing you to acknowledge the analytical voice without immediately trying to silence it or control it.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to allow yourself to experience uncertainty, and that it's okay to not have all the answers. Can you try to approach this experience with a sense of "I'm willing to sit with this uncertainty, not because I'm confident that I'll find a way out, but because I value the freedom to create and connect with others?"

Patient: I can hold that as a working hypothesis—treating "willingness" as an experiential stance rather than a fix—since I tend to translate everything into theory to feel safe. When I actually try it there's a small loosening in my chest but then panic and embarrassment bubble up; I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and scared of looking messy or exposed. I want to try sustaining it, but I don't know how—could we do a concrete step, like a brief guided breath or a timered practice, so I have something to lean on while I tolerate the uncertainty?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress by treating willingness as a working hypothesis and approaching it as an experiential stance. A specific theme that stands out is your fear of vulnerability and the desire for a tangible tool or structure to help you sustain the loosening. Your goal for the answer is to introduce a concrete, low-stakes practice to help you build confidence in tolerating uncertainty and sustaining the sense of connection.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 5-minute timered practice. I'd like you to sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. When you feel the urge to narrate or analyze, gently acknowledge the thought and say to yourself, "I'm allowing myself to not know." Then, refocus on your breath. If your mind wanders, come back to the breath without judgment. We'll start with 5 minutes, and we can adjust as needed.

Patient: Okay—I did it. Closing my eyes and tracking the breath felt oddly clinical at first, like another data point to catalog, but saying "I'm allowing myself to not know" did open a small gap where the chest loosened and color shifted for a minute. Around the third minute a wave of grief hit—pressure behind my ribs and a hot sting in my eyes—and my instinct was to narrate or explain it away, but returning to the breath calmed it a bit each time. I'm feeling a little exposed and shaky now; could we try a shorter, catch‑yourself anchor I can use when the panic spikes, or do another brief round so I can practice staying with that looseness?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made significant progress in tolerating uncertainty and sustaining a sense of looseness, but the emotional wave of grief has re-emerged, and you're feeling exposed and shaky. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a quick recovery mechanism to cope with the emotional wave, suggesting a desire for control and self-soothing. Your goal for the answer is to introduce a brief, catch-yourself anchor to help you respond to the panic spike without immediately retreating into analysis or avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple "weather report" anchor. When you feel the panic spike, acknowledge the physical sensations (the pressure, the hot sting in your eyes), and say to yourself, "My body is noticing [insert sensation]." Then, gently ask, "What's the weather like right now?" This allows you to observe the sensations without trying to change or explain them, and gives you a brief pause to recover before responding. We can practice this together for a minute or two to help you build confidence.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it. My body is noticing a pressure behind my ribs and a hot sting in my eyes. What's the weather like right now? It feels like heavy overcast with a gusty undercurrent—there’s a short easing when I breathe in, then the tightness rolls back in. That actually made the urge to narrate recede a bit, but I’m still shaky and embarrassed; can we do another round so I can try staying with that looseness longer?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the "weather report" anchor to observe and acknowledge the physical sensations, and this is helping to reduce the urge to narrate and avoid. A specific theme that stands out is your ongoing struggle with shame and embarrassment, which is driving your desire to retreat into analysis or explanation. Your goal for the answer is to build on the looseness and extend the sense of tolerating uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try another round. As you breathe in, say to yourself, "I'm allowing myself to be in this moment, even if it's uncomfortable." Then, take a moment to notice the sensations in your body, and when you're ready, say "My body is noticing [insert sensation]." We'll focus on staying with that looseness for 2-3 more minutes, and I'll gently guide you back when we're ready to come back to our conversation.

Patient: I did it. Saying "I'm allowing myself to be in this moment" briefly softened the reflex to narrate—for maybe two minutes there was this weird, fragile looseness—but then a wave of grief hit: pressure behind my ribs, throat tight, warmth in my eyes, and a couple of tears slipped out. Saying "My body is noticing the pressure" made it feel like an observable thing instead of a catastrophic event, which reduced the panic enough to breathe through it, but my analytic voice kept trying to translate it into a theory—calling it a "grief waveform"—which made me feel embarrassed and a little ashamed. I'm still shaky and overwhelmed, but I want to keep working on this; could we try one more guided minute or give me a short grounding prompt I can use when the panic spikes while I'm painting?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made significant progress in tolerating uncertainty and observing physical sensations, but the grief wave has re-emerged, and you're struggling with the analytic voice's tendency to translate and explain. A specific theme that stands out is your ongoing struggle with shame and embarrassment, which is driving your desire to retreat into analysis or explanation. Your goal for the answer is to help you find a way to silence the analytic voice and maintain a sense of looseness in the face of intense emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a grounding prompt that uses a more descriptive language. When the panic spikes, instead of saying "My body is noticing the pressure," try saying "I see a dark grey cloud of grief spreading across my chest, with a few tears trickling down my cheeks." This can help you observe the emotions in a more vivid and descriptive way, without trying to analyze or explain them. Use this prompt when you feel the panic rising, and see if it helps you stay grounded and connected to the present moment.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it: "I see a dark grey cloud of grief spreading across my chest, with a few tears trickling down my cheeks." Saying that made it feel more like something I could point to instead of a looming catastrophe, which eased the panic a bit, but it also made me feel exposed and my head immediately wanted to rename it some fancy concept—so I felt embarrassed. Could we make a shorter, whisperable version I can use while I paint, like "grey cloud in my chest"? I'm feeling a bit raw and shaky right now; can we do a quick one-minute practice using that shorter anchor so I can test it in the studio context?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the descriptive language to observe and acknowledge your emotions, but the analytical voice is still present, and you're struggling with feelings of embarrassment and exposure. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a concise and accessible anchor that you can use in the studio context. Your goal for the answer is to help you develop a simple and effective anchor that can help you stay grounded and connected to the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try the shorter anchor: "Grey cloud in my chest." When you feel the panic spike, take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "Grey cloud in my chest." Then, take a moment to notice any sensations in your body, and gently refocus on the sensation of your breath. We'll practice this for 1 minute, and I'll guide you back when we're ready.

Patient: I did that one-minute practice. Saying "grey cloud in my chest" actually lowered the spike—my breath slowed, the pressure eased a touch, and a couple of tears came—but my mind immediately wanted to relabel it as "existential residue," which made me feel embarrassed. I'm still shaky and self-conscious about being exposed; could we do another short round while I hold a brush or imagine painting so I can practice using the anchor in a studio context? I'm willing but nervous—can you guide me through it?

Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the anchor, but the analytical voice is still present, and you're struggling with feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a sense of control and mastery over your emotions, which is driving your desire to relabel and analyze. Your goal for the answer is to help you practice using the anchor in a studio context, where you'll be working with a physical activity that can help you stay grounded.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice in a studio context. I'd like you to hold a brush in your dominant hand, and as you do, say to yourself, "Grey cloud in my chest." Notice the weight of the brush, the sensation of the paint, and the feeling of creating. Take a few deep breaths, and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest" again. Notice how your body responds to the anchor, and see if you can stay with the sensation of the grey cloud without trying to analyze or explain it. We'll practice this for 2-3 minutes, and I'll guide you back when we're ready.

Patient: Okay—I did it while holding the brush. The weight in my hand grounded me a little; the bristles against my skin felt oddly vivid, and saying "grey cloud in my chest" on the exhale eased the tightness for a moment, but now my attention keeps splintering—I'm jittery, heart a bit fast, and my mind is already renaming the feeling into some grandiose theory so it can feel safe. My hand is shaky and I feel exposed and embarrassed, but I want to keep practicing—can we do one more short guided minute where I actually make a few slow strokes while you cue me through the anchor?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the anchor in a studio context, but your mind is still prone to splintering and analysis. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a sense of mastery over your emotions, which is driving your desire to create a grandiose theory. Your goal for the answer is to help you stay with the anchor and the physical sensations while creating, even in the face of emotional discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice making slow strokes while using the anchor. As you paint, I'll guide you through it. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Then, make a slow, deliberate stroke with your brush. As you're painting, I'll say "continue, gentle, steady, and slow" with each stroke. When you're ready, take another deep breath, and say "Grey cloud in my chest" again. Focus on the sensation of the brush, the paint, and the stroke. Just continue, gentle, steady, and slow.

Patient: Okay—I did it. The first slow stroke actually grounded me a bit and saying "grey cloud in my chest" eased the tightness for a breath, but then my heart sped up and my hand started trembling; my attention keeps splintering into anxious vignettes and I catch myself trying to rename the feeling—"gestural testimony"—which just makes me feel embarrassed and pulls me out of the moment. I'm jittery and distracted, but I want to keep going; could you cue me even more slowly and remind me to breathe through each stroke so I can try to stay with it?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the anchor in a studio context, but your mind is still prone to splintering and analysis. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a slower and more gentle guidance to help you stay with the anchor and the physical sensations. Your goal for the answer is to help you practice staying with the anchor and the slow, deliberate strokes, even in the face of emotional discomfort.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, with an even slower pace. Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Make a slow, tiny stroke with your brush. As you're painting, I'll say "breathe in... hold... breathe out... Grey cloud in my chest." Take another deep breath in... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Make another slow, tiny stroke. Just breathe... hold... breathe out... Grey cloud in my chest. Continue, gentle, steady, and slow.

Patient: I did it. The ultra-slow pace helped a little—the tiny strokes anchor me and saying "grey cloud in my chest" softens the tightness—but I'm suddenly more anxious and distracted: heart's racing, hands trembling, and my head keeps hijacking it with grandiose labels, which makes me feel ashamed. Can you cue even more slowly, maybe count softly between breaths and drop in a gentle prompt like "notice thinking" when my mind starts renaming things? I'm jittery and would like one more guided minute.

Your goal for the answer is to help you practice staying with the anchor and the slow, deliberate strokes, even in the face of intense anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, with an even slower pace, and a gentle prompt to help you stay with your thoughts. Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Make a slow, tiny stroke with your brush. I'll guide you through the stroke, one tiny stroke at a time. 1... 2... 3... Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Make another slow, tiny stroke. 1... 2... 3... I want you to notice when you start thinking, and say to yourself "Notice thinking." Just notice, don't try to change it. Continue, gentle, steady, and slow.

Patient: Okay—I did it. The counting and the tiny strokes helped a little at first; saying "grey cloud in my chest" and "notice thinking" created tiny openings where the tightness loosened. But now I'm suddenly more anxious and scattered—my heart's racing, my hands are trembling, and my attention splinters into meta‑labels (I catch myself inventing euphemisms like "existential residue") which makes me feel ashamed and pulls me out of the moment. Can we keep going—slower still—and have you cue "notice thinking" more often, maybe every exhale, so I have something concrete to latch onto when my mind starts hijacking the practice?

Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in using the anchor, but your anxiety and self-doubt are still present, and you're struggling to stay with the physical sensations. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a more frequent and explicit cue to help you stay with your thoughts and anchor the meta-labels. Your goal for the answer is to help you practice staying with the anchor and the slow, deliberate strokes, even in the face of intense anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, with an even slower pace, and a more frequent "notice thinking" cue. Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest."

Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... and as you exhale, say "Grey cloud in my chest." Make another slow, tiny stroke.

Patient: I did that—having "notice thinking" every exhale helped me catch the hijack for a breath or two, but then my anxiety ramped: heart racing, hands trembling, and my head immediately spun off into euphemisms to contain it, which made me feel ashamed. The cues create small openings, but I’m jittery and distracted right now and need something tactile to anchor me or the pace slowed even more. Can we try one more minute with an ultra-slow cadence and a brief physical grounder—like pressing my fingertips together between each tiny stroke—while you softly count?

You're making progress in using the anchor, but your anxiety is still intense, and you're struggling to stay with the physical sensations. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a more profound sense of grounding and connection to the physical body, which can help calm your nervous system. Your goal for the answer is to help you practice staying with the anchor and the slow, deliberate strokes, even in the face of extreme anxiety.

Continue, gentle, steady, and slow.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is pressing my fingertips supposed to interrupt the spiraling? It feels oddly abstract compared to the visceral tightness in my chest; my heart's racing, my hands are trembling, and the counting sort of helps but the instructions don't map cleanly onto what I'm actually feeling. My mind keeps inventing euphemisms to contain it, which makes me feel embarrassed and more scattered. Can you slow the cadence way down, have me press fingertips for a full five seconds between each tiny stroke, keep "notice thinking" on every exhale, and ask me to name one concrete sensation after each press so I have something tangible to latch onto?

First press (after exhale/“Notice thinking”): a tightness right behind my breastbone, like someone’s sitting there; breath shallow. I made a tiny stroke.  
Second press: a pins-and-needles buzz at the pads of my fingertips and a warm prickling under my ribs. Tiny stroke.  
Third press: my throat tightened, a lump, and my eyes feel damp—there’s a hotness behind them. Tiny stroke.  
Fourth press: a cool scrape under my nostrils and a faint lightness in the top of my head, like air moving through fog. Tiny stroke.

I'm jittery and my heart's racing more now, and I keep wanting to rename these as poetic constructs so I can distance myself, which is annoying and makes me feel embarrassed.

Second: a faint buzzing at the pads of my fingertips.  
Third: a lump in my throat.  
Fourth: warmth behind my eyes.  
Fifth: shallowness at the top of my lungs.  
Sixth: a tremor through my hands.  
Seventh: a quick flutter in my chest.

I'm suddenly more anxious and distracted—heart's a bit fast, hands still shaky—and my head keeps trying to reframe everything with a clever label, which just makes me feel ashamed. Can we go even slower, and can you prompt me to breathe in for four counts and out for six between each press, and ask me to name just one sensation each time? I want to keep practicing but I need the cadence and a clearer anchor.

Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in staying with the sensations, but your mind is still trying to analyze and reframe them, which is driving your anxiety and self-consciousness. A specific theme that stands out is your need for a more controlled and predictable pace to help you build confidence in your ability to observe without judgment. Your goal for the answer is to help you practice staying with the anchor and the slow, deliberate strokes, even in the face of intense anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, at an extremely slow pace, with a more controlled breathing rhythm. Take a deep breath in for 4 counts... 1... 2... 3... 4... and as you exhale, say "Notice thinking."

Patient: I'm really not sure I follow — your last instruction cut off and I'm feeling jumpy and distracted right now: heart racing, hands trembling, mind scattering. My head wants to reframe this as an "autonomic hijack" so it feels tidy, but underneath that I can feel a raw, embarrassed kind of fear. Could you please slow way down and actually count me through one single, complete cycle — inhale 4, exhale 6, say "Notice thinking" on the exhale, press fingertips for 5 seconds, then ask me to name one concrete sensation? Count softly with me as you guide each step. I'm anxious and a bit confused, but I want to keep trying if you can cue me more clearly.
