Patient: Lately I keep getting stuck in these cycles of harsh self-criticism — I blow small mistakes into proof I'm a failure, and it’s wrecking my confidence around people. I think a lot of it goes back to being bullied at school; I still hear those voices and it makes me avoid being social even though I’m usually outgoing. Honestly, I’m skeptical this will help — how is that supposed to help when I’ve tried stuff before and it just doesn’t work?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you notice yourself getting caught up in harsh self-criticism? What's the immediate thought that starts the cycle?

Patient: It usually starts with one tiny slip—like I stumble over my words—and the immediate thought is, "I'm such an idiot, I can't do anything right." My chest tightens, I get hot, and all those old bully-voices from school flood back so I just assume everyone’s judging me. I try to tell myself it’s not a big deal, but that never lasts, so I either clam up or overcompensate and then steer clear of people for the rest of the day. And yeah—I know you might ask me to notice the thought or reframe it, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when I’ve tried that and it just doesn’t work?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between trying to manage the overwhelming emotions and trying to avoid the potential discomfort of social interactions. Can you think of one small, low-stakes situation where you might be able to practice being in a social setting without feeling completely overwhelmed by those old voices? Maybe something like grabbing coffee with a friend or attending a small gathering?

Patient: Maybe something small like grabbing coffee with Mark from work — we chat a bit by the fridge anyway, so it feels low-key. But I can already feel myself worrying I’ll trip over my words or say something dumb and then spiral — and honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’ve done small outings before and I still end up clamming up or replaying it all night.

Therapist: Instead of focusing on preventing mistakes, can you try to observe your thoughts as they come up, without judgment? Let's say you do say something you regret or trip over your words – can you imagine what would happen if you simply allowed the experience to pass, without adding any narrative to it?

Patient: I mean, I've tried that — in the moment I can sometimes watch the thought, but it feels like a bandage: it calms a bit and then the bully-voice comes back and I replay everything all night. Noticing doesn't stop the chest-tightness or the urge to disappear, so I'm skeptical this will actually change anything long-term. How is that supposed to help — can you give me something more concrete than "notice and let go"? I'm getting a bit frustrated and overwhelmed already; can we slow down?

Therapist: I understand that noticing alone hasn't been enough to keep the anxiety at bay. Can you think of something specific that you value about being social, such as feeling connected with others or being able to share your ideas? Maybe we can start with a tiny commitment to show up for one small social interaction, even if it feels uncomfortable. What would it mean to you to commit to that, just for a minute or two?

Patient: I do value feeling connected — when a conversation actually lands I feel less alone and it reminds me I’m not a walking failure. Committing to just a minute or two with Mark would feel like a tiny proof that I can tolerate social stuff without spiraling. But I’m worried that’s just temporary — how is a tiny test supposed to stop me replaying it all night? I’m already getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and make this feel more concrete?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and focus on the process, rather than the outcome. Imagine you're going to meet Mark for coffee for just one minute, and you're going to be kind to yourself the entire time. Can you imagine what it would feel like to take a deep breath, sit down, and start a conversation with Mark, without any expectations or judgment? We can start with a tiny, tangible action: what would it mean to you to arrive 1 minute early, and simply sit down with Mark, without planning the entire conversation?

Patient: Arriving a minute early sounds like it might give me a breather — just a chance to sit, breathe, and remind myself I don’t have to perform. In my head that could feel like permission to stay instead of bolting, but I can already feel the chest-tightness thinking about it and I worry I’ll still replay it all night. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can we make a concrete backup plan for if I do start spiraling? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on making the initial meeting as easy as possible. What if, instead of trying to control the conversation, you simply focus on your breath, and take a few deep breaths whenever you feel the chest-tightness? This can help calm your nervous system and give you a brief moment to collect yourself. Can you imagine having a simple phrase or question to repeat to yourself, like "I've got this" or "I can handle this", to help ground yourself in the present moment?

Patient: I can try a grounding phrase, but "I've got this" feels a bit too forced — it makes me feel like I'm faking confidence. Maybe something more real, like "This will pass" or "I'm allowed to be imperfect," would sit better with me. If I start spiraling I could step outside for two minutes, do five deep breaths, and text Mark "stepping out for a sec" so I don't feel trapped, but I don't know if that'll stop me replaying it later. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and make that backup plan more concrete?

Therapist: Let's focus on the specific plan you mentioned, and make it more concrete. Instead of "stepping out for a sec", can we say "I'm going to step outside for exactly 5 minutes, and I'll text Mark 'stepping out for a sec' so I can collect myself"? This way, you're giving yourself a clear boundary and a specific time frame to regain your composure. When you return, you can simply re-engage with the conversation without worrying about reliving the anxiety. Would it be helpful to imagine yourself already having done this, and feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment?

Patient: Maybe imagining it does help a tiny bit — picturing myself stepping out for exactly five minutes and coming back sounds like it could reduce the urge to bolt. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me replaying it all night? I'd feel better if we made a concrete follow-up for after the coffee: like a two-minute journal entry where I write one specific line about what went okay, then set a 20-minute "no-rumination" rule where I listen to a podcast or go for a short walk. Can we make that part of the plan and role-play how I'd do the text and the step-out? I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's role-play the scenario and the plan you've outlined. I'll be Mark, and you can be yourself. You can text me "stepping out for a sec" and then take a 5-minute break. When you return, we'll do a 2-minute journal entry together, where you write one specific line about what went okay, and then we'll listen to a podcast or take a short walk for the next 20 minutes. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay, ready. I text Mark: "stepping out for a sec" and step outside — I take five slow breaths, trying to feel my shoulders drop. I'm back. Quick journal line: "I stayed for the coffee and said something once without freezing." I'm going to put on a short podcast for the next 20 minutes. Honestly, I'm already worried I'll replay it tonight — can we make a concrete follow-up if that happens? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel anxious about replaying the experience, and that it's a normal part of the process. When you do find yourself replaying it tonight, I want you to remember that you've done everything you set out to do today. You took a risk, you showed up, and you practiced self-care. What would you say to a friend who was feeling anxious about a similar experience? Would you be as hard on them as you are on yourself? Can you treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding?

Patient: I'd probably tell a friend, "You showed up, that took courage — it's okay to be imperfect," and remind them it doesn't mean they're a failure. But when I try that on myself it feels fake, like the bully-voice just laughs it off. I can try saying that line out loud tonight, but honestly I doubt it will stop the replaying — how is that supposed to help when the old voices keep coming back? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and make a concrete script or plan I can use when the replay starts?

Therapist: Let's create a concrete script that you can use when the replaying starts. Imagine this script as a gentle reminder to defuse from the catastrophic thoughts: "I've already done my part today. I showed up, I practiced self-care, and I did the best I could. This thought is just a thought. Can I take a deep breath and let it pass?" You can say this out loud, to yourself, or even just silently. Can you practice saying this script out loud right now, and see how it feels?

Patient: Okay, I say it out loud: "I've already done my part today. I showed up, I practiced self-care, and I did the best I could. This thought is just a thought. Can I take a deep breath and let it pass?" Saying it makes my chest loosen a little and the words don't sound totally fake, but the bully-voice is still there in the background calling it weak. It helps a bit in the moment—like a bandage again—but I'm still worried it'll come back tonight and replay on loop. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and make a concrete bedtime plan for when the replay starts?

Therapist: Let's create a bedtime plan that sets the tone for a restful night's sleep. Imagine you're getting ready for bed, and you're about to drift off to sleep. What would you like to say to yourself as you fall asleep? Would you say something like, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough" or "I'm kind to myself, even when I make mistakes"? Can you say this to yourself as you're falling asleep, and let the words sink in? Additionally, can you make a deal with yourself to allow yourself to sleep without checking social media or replaying the replaying for the rest of the night?

Patient: Okay—here’s what I’ll actually try tonight, in concrete steps, even if I’m skeptical:

- Bedtime phrase: out loud as I lie down I’ll say, “I’m doing the best I can, and that’s enough.”  
- Phone plan: put my phone in the kitchen on Do Not Disturb and set an alarm for morning so I’m not tempted to check it.  
- Pre-sleep routine (10 minutes earlier): 5 minutes to write a very short “worry list” (one sentence per worry) and one tiny next-step for each, then 2 minutes of slow belly breaths.  
- If replaying starts in bed: say the script we practiced (“I’ve already done my part today…can I take a deep breath and let it pass?”), do 5 slow 4-4-6 breaths. If it still won’t settle after 10 minutes, get up, write one specific line about what went okay, then return to bed.  
- If I can’t stop ruminating later, allow one 10-minute “worry window” where I sit up and jot it down, then end it and do a quiet podcast or a sleep sound.

I’ll try that, but honestly—how is this supposed to help when the bully-voice is loud and I’m replaying everything on loop? I’m already getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and walk through what I should do if none of this helps tomorrow?

Therapist: Let's explore what you'd do if none of the coping strategies worked tomorrow. Imagine you're sitting in a quiet room, feeling overwhelmed by the replaying. What would you say to yourself in that moment? Would you say, "I've done everything I can, and it's not my fault that I'm struggling"? Or would you say, "I'm just going to ride this out and see what happens"? Take a moment to imagine yourself in that situation, and what words would you use to calm yourself down?

Patient: I’d probably try to tell myself, “I did what I could today,” but that feels hollow—the old shame spikes and I get that tight, nauseous feeling like I did something unforgivable. Practically, I’d force two minutes of belly breaths, write one short factual line about what actually went okay, then set a 20-minute distraction (podcast/walk); if it’s still looping after that I’d allow a single 10-minute worry window to jot the replay down and then stop. But honestly—how is that supposed to help when the bully-voice just keeps shouting? I’m already feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and map out one more concrete fallback if none of this works tomorrow?

Therapist: Let's create a concrete fallback plan for when the shame and replaying become overwhelming. Imagine you're in a situation where you feel like you're completely stuck. Instead of trying to control the shame or replaying, what if you simply allowed yourself to feel the emotions, without judgment? Can you imagine saying to yourself, "I'm feeling really scared and ashamed right now, and that's okay"? Can you allow yourself to sit with that feeling, without trying to change it or push it away? This might seem like a radical idea, but it's a chance to practice a different way of relating to your emotions, one that doesn't rely on control or judgment.

Patient: I can try imagining saying that, but when I do the shame just gets louder and I snap back into feeling like a complete screw-up — it’s hard to “sit with” without spiraling. Maybe it'd feel safer if it was structured: set a 5-minute timer to just name and feel the emotion, then do five grounding breaths, write one factual line about what actually went okay, and if it's still bad call or text a friend (or text you if that's allowed) as a real backup. Can we role-play that short script now so it feels less flimsy? Honestly — how is just allowing it supposed to help when the bully-voice keeps shouting? I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's role-play the script you've created. Imagine we're in a quiet room, and you're feeling the shame and replaying. You set the 5-minute timer, and we'll go through the steps together. I'll guide you through the process. You'll name the emotion, feel it, do the grounding breaths, and write down what went okay. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll support you through the process. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Okay... I’ll try. Can we go really slowly? Naming it: shame — a heavy sinking, like I’m exposed. I’ll take five slow belly breaths now. Quick factual line: “I stayed and said something once.” I’m skeptical this will change much, but I’m ready to start the 5-minute timer.

Therapist: You've named the emotion, felt it, done the grounding breaths, and written down what went okay. Now, let's observe the shame without trying to change it. I'll guide you through the next steps. We're at the 2-minute mark. Can you continue to breathe slowly and observe the shame, without trying to push it away or change it in any way? We can simply allow it to be, like a wave passing by.

Patient: Okay...I'm still breathing. The shame is there — heavy, like a knot in my chest, and the thought "I'm a screw-up" keeps looping. Letting it sit feels scary; I keep wanting to fix it or run. How is just observing this supposed to stop the replay later? I'm already feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and make a clear next step if this doesn't ease in the next few minutes?

Therapist: Let's take a break and re-evaluate. It's okay that the shame is still present. In fact, it's a sign that you're doing this exercise correctly. The goal isn't to eliminate the shame, but to learn to observe it without judgment. If you feel like you're getting stuck or feeling overwhelmed, we can switch to a different approach. But let's try one more thing. Can you focus on the sensation of your breath, without trying to change the shame or the thought? Simply observe the breath, and let it be. We can pause the exercise if you need to, but for now, let's see if we can stay with the breath.

Patient: Okay... I'm doing the breathing — I can feel my shoulders drop a touch — but that "I'm a screw-up" loop is still banging away. How is just watching the breath supposed to stop it from replaying at 2 a.m.? I need something concrete and discreet I can do at my desk when it starts — like a quick grounding move. Can we try a specific one now? Also, can we slow down? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's try a simple defusion technique. When the replaying starts, you can use the phrase "I'm having the thought 'I'm a screw-up'". Can you repeat this phrase to yourself, exactly as it is, without judgment or analysis? This can help you detach from the thought and see it as just a thought, rather than a reflection of your worth. We'll practice this in a slow and gentle way, without rushing. Take a deep breath in, and let's try it together: "I'm having the thought 'I'm a screw-up'".

Patient: Okay... "I'm having the thought 'I'm a screw-up'." 

Saying it like that takes the edge off a little — my chest eased a touch — but the bully-voice is still loud. How is that supposed to help long-term? Do you have a quick, discreet grounding move I can do at my desk when it starts? Can we go slowly?

Therapist: Let's focus on the present moment. When the replaying starts, you can use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Can you repeat after me? "I notice 5 things I can see around me, 4 things I can touch, 3 things I can hear, 2 things I can smell, and 1 thing I can taste." This can help you ground yourself in the present moment and reduce the replaying. We'll practice this slowly, and I'll guide you through it. Take a deep breath in, and let's start: "I notice 5 things I can see around me..."

Patient: Okay... I’ll try it.

5 things I can see: my mug, my phone, the window, a little plant, and a sticky note.  
4 things I can touch: my chair, my jeans, the table edge, my ring.  
3 things I can hear: the AC, cars outside, someone typing.  
2 things I can smell: coffee and my hand cream.  
1 thing I can taste: faint toothpaste.

That took the edge off a bit — my chest eased a touch — but the shame’s still there, humming under it. I need something even more discreet I can do at my desk when it starts (won’t look weird to coworkers). Can you give me one concrete 10-second grounding move I can use, and we can go slowly through how I’d do it?

Therapist: Let's create a 10-second grounding move that you can use at your desk. Can you try this with me? When the shame starts, take a deep breath in for a count of 4, and then pause for exactly 5 seconds. During this time, focus on your breath, and let the shame pass without judgment. Then, exhale slowly and continue with your work. We'll practice this slowly, and I'll guide you through it. Ready? Take a deep breath in for a count of 4...

Patient: Okay... did the breath—inhale four, pause five, exhale. It loosened my shoulders a bit, but the knot’s still there and that bully-voice is still nagging. How is that supposed to stop the replay at 2 a.m.? Can we slow down and come up with one really discreet 10-second desk move that looks normal at work?

Therapist: Let's create a 10-second desk move that you can do discreetly at work. Can you try this with me? When the shame starts, quickly look down at the desk and touch the edge of the paper, then look up and say "I'm safe" to yourself. This is a simple, subtle way to remind yourself that you're grounded and safe. We'll practice this slowly, and I'll guide you through it. Ready?

Patient: Okay… I tried it — looked down, touched the paper, looked up and said “I’m safe” under my breath. It loosened my shoulders a little, but that knot and the bully-voice are still there. How is that supposed to stop the replay at 2 a.m.? Can we slow down and map one more concrete fallback if this doesn’t work?

Therapist: Let's create a Self-Kindness Letter that you can use when the shame is overwhelming. This is a simple, written note to yourself that acknowledges your worth and provides reassurance. Can you think of a few things that you appreciate about yourself, and write them down on a piece of paper? For example, "I'm kind to myself," "I'm doing the best I can," or "I'm worthy of compassion." When you feel overwhelmed, you can read this letter and remind yourself of your worth. We'll practice writing this letter together, and I'll guide you through it. Ready?

Patient: Okay… I’ll try, but I’m skeptical this will actually quiet the shame. A few things I could put in the letter: “I showed up today,” “I care about my team and try to help them,” “I make people laugh,” “I handled a tough conversation without losing it,” and “I’m still here after being bullied — that took strength.” 

Maybe a tiny example to start with: “Hey — I know you’re hurting. You showed up today, you did the best you could, and that matters. You’re allowed to be imperfect.” Can we go slowly and write it line-by-line together so it doesn’t feel stupid or fake?

Therapist: Let's write the letter line-by-line, and I'll guide you through it. We'll take our time, and I'll offer suggestions to help you stay in the moment. Here's the next line: "You're allowed to feel whatever emotions you're feeling, and that doesn't make you a bad person." Take a deep breath, and let's see what comes next.

Patient: Okay—I'll try.

Next line in the letter: "You're allowed to feel whatever emotions you're feeling, and that doesn't make you a bad person."  
Then: "Those old voices lie — they were from a mean time in my past, not the truth about me now."  
And: "You showed up today. That matters more than one awkward moment. You are not defined by mistakes."

Saying this feels…exposed, like I'm making myself vulnerable, but I can write it. I still doubt it'll quiet the shame, though. Can we go slowly and add one more short, concrete reassuring line I can read at night?

Therapist: Let's add a short, concrete reassuring line to the letter. Can you think of something that would give you comfort and reassurance at night? Something like "I am enough, just as I am" or "I can handle whatever comes next"? We'll write it down, and I'll help you add it to the letter. For now, let's focus on the letter. You've written some powerful lines already. Let's take a moment to review them together: "Hey... I know you're hurting... You showed up today, you did the best you could, and that matters... You're allowed to feel whatever emotions you're feeling, and that doesn't make you a bad person... Those old voices lie... You showed up today. That matters more than one awkward moment. You are not defined by mistakes." How do you feel about adding one more line to this?

Patient: Okay—let’s add one. Maybe: "I am enough, even when I'm imperfect." Saying that feels kind of hollow right now — the shame’s still humming under it — but I can try reading it at night. Can we also make a quick fallback for if it still replays tomorrow night? I'm getting a bit worn; can we slow down and figure that out step-by-step?

Therapist: Let's break down the Pre-Sleep Protocol into small, manageable steps. First, we'll review the letter and make sure you feel comfortable with the words. Then, we'll discuss a specific plan for the next night, just in case the shame replays. We'll go slowly, and I'll guide you through it. Ready? Let's review the letter together, and then we'll discuss the Pre-Sleep Protocol.

Patient: Okay... reviewing the letter feels exposed but a little helpful — the lines ("You showed up today," "Those old voices lie," "I am enough, even when I'm imperfect") land okay, even if the shame's still humming under them.

Here’s a concrete, slow-paced Pre-Sleep Protocol I can try tomorrow night:
1) 20–30 minutes before bed: dim lights, put phone in kitchen on Do Not Disturb with morning alarm.  
2) 5-minute worry list: one sentence per worry + one tiny next step for each.  
3) Read the self-kindness letter aloud once, then do 2 minutes of slow belly breaths.  
4) If replaying starts in bed: say the script ("I've already done my part today..." or "I'm having the thought 'I'm a screw-up'"), do 5 slow 4-4-6 breaths; if it’s still stuck after 10 minutes, get up, write one specific line about what went okay, then return to bed and play a quiet podcast or sleep sound.  
5) If it resurfaces later, allow one 10-minute worry window to jot it down, then end it and do a calming audio for sleep.  
6) Backup: if it’s unbearable, call or text one trusted friend for a 10-minute check-in (or a brief voice note).

I’ll try it, but honestly — how is this supposed to stop the replay when that bully-voice is so loud? Can we slow down and map out exactly what I should say in that 10-minute worry window so it doesn’t turn into an all-night loop?
