--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hey, I've been avoiding stuff since the move — I procrastinate like crazy to not feel the low. My brain immediately tells me the worst: if I start dealing with bills or the restaurant stuff I'll mess it up, the place will close, I'll be broke and alone — I'm absolutely sure that's how it goes, so I just distract myself instead.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be intense fear and avoidance of uncertainty. One specific theme or contradiction is the unexplored area of "the perceived consequences" of taking action. Your goal is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you distract yourself from dealing with bills or the restaurant situation? Is it like your mind goes blank, or do you feel a temporary sense of relief?

Patient: Usually I dive into busywork — chopping, cleaning, fiddling with recipes, or doomscrolling — and there's this quick, guilty relief like I dodged the bullet for a bit. But it doesn't go blank: almost right away my brain threads the worst story together — unpaid bills, angry suppliers, a bad review, health inspection, the restaurant closing, me losing everything — and it feels like that’s the only possible outcome. I know that sounds dramatic, but I get hooked by that disaster story and keep distracting myself so I don't have to sit with it. I'm honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed by how automatic it all is.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a pattern of avoidance and a catastrophic thinking pattern that perpetuates the cycle. The goal is to create space from this sticky thought process.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped by this automatic pattern. Would you be willing to take a tiny step towards facing this 'disaster story' without immediately trying to distract yourself? For example, could you just sit with the thought for 30 seconds, without jumping into busywork or other distractions?

Patient: Okay... I can try, but I'm warning you — my brain will immediately sprint to the worst. If I sit with it, my chest tightens and my hands get shaky, and within seconds I see unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, a bad inspection, the restaurant shutting, me losing everything. I'll try to stay with that for 30 seconds — can you stay with me or count it down so I don't bail into something else?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the intense physical sensations and the rapid progression to catastrophic thinking. It's essential to acknowledge the experience without trying to change or control it. The goal is to create a small window of observation without acting on the worst-case scenario.

Therapist Answer:
Let's count down together: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... (pause) Can you hold the thought for just one more second, and I'll be here with you?

Patient: Okay, I held it. My chest's tight and my hands are shaky, and in that second my head runs the whole movie: unpaid invoices piling up, suppliers cutting deliveries, a health inspector shows up during service, a brutal review, the bank freezes the account, the doors close, and I'm out on the street. It feels absolutely certain — I can't even imagine any other ending — and that certainty makes me want to sprint back to chopping or doomscrolling. Honestly, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by all that; can we slow down a little?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've tolerated the worst-case scenario for a brief moment, and now you're struggling to cope with the certainty of the outcome. The goal is to introduce a process to create some space from this experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step back and focus on your breath for just 1-2 breaths. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I did the breaths — I felt the air go in and out for a second, but my chest tightened and my hands started to shake almost immediately. In that one breath my brain blasted the whole disaster again — unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing — and I just can't imagine any other ending, which makes me want to bolt back to chopping or scrolling. Honestly, I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a strong conditioned response to the catastrophic thoughts, making it challenging to disengage. The goal is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is still responding strongly to the worst-case scenario. Can you try to notice when your thoughts start to slide into the "disaster story" again, and instead of getting caught up in it, can you say to yourself, "Ah, here we go again" – acknowledging the pattern without judgment or engagement?

Patient: I tried saying, "Ah, here we go again," but it landed flat — the voice just fires back, "No, that's exactly what's going to happen." My chest tightened and my hands started shaking and the whole disaster movie kicked in so fast I couldn't hold the phrase. Can you say it with me or keep counting? I don't think it changes the outcome, but I need you there or I'll bolt to something else.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to establish a gentle, observational relationship with the catastrophic thoughts. The goal is to introduce a defusion process to create some distance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, and this time, I'll say it with you: "Ah, here we go again." As we say it together, can you start to notice the sensation of the words, the sound of your voice, and the physical feeling of saying it?

Patient: Okay — "Ah, here we go again." Saying it out loud with you made my voice sound small, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking. The phrase didn't cut the movie off — within seconds I'm back to the same certainty: bills piling, suppliers gone, inspector, doors closed. I'm honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed; can we slow down or keep counting so I don't bolt into chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in acknowledging the phrase, but the catastrophic thoughts still seem to dominate the experience. The goal is to create space from the certainty of the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a slightly longer pause this time: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) Can you stay with the sensation of your chest tightening and your hands shaking for just a moment longer, without trying to change or control it?

Patient: I tried to stay with it, but my chest just tightened even more and my hands started shaking harder, and within a second the movie kicked back in — unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector walking in mid-service, the doors shutting — totally inevitable. I'm getting really overwhelmed by how fast it grabs me; can we slow down or keep counting so I don't bolt into chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Your body is strongly responding to the catastrophic thoughts, making it difficult to disengage. The goal is to introduce a process to create some flexibility in your relationship with the experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's count down again: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... (pause) Before we start again, can you notice the sensation of your breath, the feeling of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I tried to notice the breath but my chest tightened and my hands started shaking and within a second the whole disaster movie was back: unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing. I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down and can you keep counting or stay with me so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling frustrated and stuck in the cycle of catastrophic thinking. The goal is to gently challenge the assumption that you need to "follow the breath" to cope.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a break from counting. Instead, I want to ask you a question: What would it be like for you if, for just one moment, you didn't believe that the worst-case scenario was inevitable? Not literally, but if you could suspend that assumption for a tiny bit, what would you notice?

Patient: I can't really do it — my brain snaps back to the movie immediately — but if I forced it for a second maybe I'd notice my chest not being quite as tight and a tiny space where the panic isn't yelling. It feels like a ridiculous trick though, like that quiet would be fake and the disaster will kick back in any second. I'm already feeling overwhelmed by how fast it flips; can we slow down and can you stay with me?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with the idea of creating a temporary reprieve from the catastrophic thinking, and feeling skeptical about its effectiveness. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the value of small steps towards defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step: can you agree with me that it's okay to take a tiny step towards trying to create some space from the worst-case scenario? It doesn't have to be a grand or permanent change; just a tiny acknowledgment that you're willing to try, for a brief moment, to explore what might happen if you didn't immediately believe in the disaster story.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I guess I can agree to try a tiny step, but my brain will shout that it's fake and the disaster movie will start again, so I need you to stay with me or count or something. Honestly, I'm already feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down before I bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to trust the process and feeling uncertain about the value of small steps. The goal is to introduce a process that creates a sense of safety and connection.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together: inhale... exhale... and I'll be right here with you. When you're ready, can you repeat after me: "I am here with this thought, and I am here with myself"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try, but I already know my brain will scream at me. "I am here with this thought, and I am here with myself." Saying it made my voice small, my chest tightened, my hands started shaking, and within seconds the whole movie kicked back in — unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing — it still feels inevitable. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down and can you stay with me or count so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your self-compassion and willingness to try are admirable, but your brain is still responding strongly to the catastrophic thoughts. The goal is to create a small window of safety and connection.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Let's take a tiny pause: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... (pause) Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I felt the floor under my feet for a second, but then my chest tightened and my hands started shaking and the whole movie blared back: unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down and can you keep counting or just stay with me so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to find a sense of safety and connection despite my efforts to create a calm environment. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the overwhelm and invites you to take a different kind of action.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going to keep counting, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you look at me, and just say the words "I'm willing to try" without judgment, without trying to control the outcome? It doesn't matter what your brain says next; just focus on those two words.

Patient: Okay... "I'm willing to try." Saying it makes my voice small — my brain immediately screams it's fake and the whole movie starts up again: unpaid invoices, suppliers gone, an inspector, the doors closing. I'm not sure I follow how that helps and I'm already feeling overwhelmed — can you stay with me or count so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your self-compassion and willingness to try are notable, but the catastrophic thoughts are still dominating the experience. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the futility of trying to control the thoughts and invites you to focus on values.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not judging you. Let's look at something else for a moment. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then I want you to notice the sensation of your body in this moment, where you are, with me, and taking small steps towards trying to face the worst-case scenario.

Patient: I felt my feet on the kitchen floor for a second, but I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help stop the movie? The moment I notice, my chest tightens, my hands shake, and I can already see the unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, the inspector walking in, the doors closing. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down and can you stay with me or count so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're still struggling to find a way to slow down the catastrophic thoughts and create a sense of control. The goal is to pivot towards a process that acknowledges the futility of trying to control the thoughts and invites you to focus on values.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a different approach. Can you imagine yourself doing something you value, something that brings you a sense of comfort or joy, without necessarily trying to stop the catastrophic thoughts? For example, if you could, what would you do if you were in a situation like this, but instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, you were able to focus on something else?

Patient: Maybe I'd make my grandmother's stew and invite a few regulars over — that kind of cooking actually feels like home and would calm me. But my brain instantly flips it: I get distracted, the stew burns, someone gets sick, an inspector shows up, the place gets shut down — and I can't see any other ending. This is taking a lot out of me; can you stay with me or count so I don't bolt back to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a coping mechanism that brings you comfort, but your brain is still sabotaging it. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the defusion of catastrophic thoughts and invites you to explore the value of this coping mechanism.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not judging you. Let's focus on the fact that cooking your grandmother's stew and inviting others over feels like a source of comfort for you. Can you explore why that is? What is it about that experience that brings you a sense of calm and connection?

Patient: It feels like the smell, the slow stirring, the way folks gather around a big pot — it makes me feel useful and connected, like I'm home for a minute. But the minute I picture it my head goes straight to disaster: I get distracted, the stew burns, someone gets sick, a review ruins us, an inspector shows up, the doors close — and that certainty snuffs out the calm. I'm kind of drained just talking about it; can you stay with me so I don't bolt back to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the complex interplay between the comforting aspects of cooking and the catastrophic thoughts that quickly undermine it. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the defusion of catastrophic thoughts and invites you to explore the value of this experience.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you take a moment to acknowledge the part of you that feels a sense of calm and connection when cooking, without necessarily trying to ignore or suppress the catastrophic thoughts? What if, instead of trying to push them away, you simply allowed that feeling to be there, like a small spark, without trying to fan it into a flame?

Patient: There is a tiny spark — the smell of the stew, the slow stirring, people gathering — it calms me for a beat. But the moment I let it in my brain screams the movie again: I get distracted, the stew burns, someone gets sick, an inspector shows up, the doors close — and that certainty just zaps the calm. This is wearing me down; can you stay with me or keep counting so I don't bolt back to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the small spark of calm and are aware of its fleeting nature. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the defusion of catastrophic thoughts and invites you to explore the value of this small experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and then focus on the sound of your own breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? I'll stay with you and keep my presence here, without adding any new thoughts or suggestions.

Patient: I'm trying to feel my feet and my breath, but I'm not sure I follow — it just drags up that shameful screw-up I keep replaying and makes me feel stupid and useless. My chest tightens, my hands shake, and I want to run back to doing something busy. Can you stay with me or count slowly so I don't bolt?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to separate the sensations from the self-criticism and catastrophic thoughts. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the futility of self-criticism and invites you to explore the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not judging you. I'm just here. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, I am here, I am here"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "I am here, I am here, I am here." Saying it makes my voice tiny — my chest tightens, my hands shake, and that stupid shame keeps crawling up so fast the whole disaster movie starts again: unpaid bills, suppliers gone, an inspector, the doors closed. I'm really overwhelmed; can you stay with me or keep counting slowly so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?

Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to find a way to stay present and grounded amidst the overwhelming emotions. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the futility of self-blame and invites you to focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. I want to try something else. Can you notice the sensation of my hand on my arm, where I'm touching you? Can you feel the sensation of my hand on your arm, and then look at my hand, and then look at yours?

Patient: I can feel your hand — it’s a small, weird comfort — but my hands are shaking and my chest tightens the second I try to look. That stupid shame crawls up and the disaster movie kicks back in — unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, the inspector, the doors closing — and I can feel myself wanting to bolt. Can you stay with me or count slowly so I don't run back to chopping or doomscrolling?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're seeking a sense of physical connection and comfort, but it's being rapidly overshadowed by the catastrophic thoughts. The goal is to introduce a process that acknowledges the futility of self-blame and invites you to explore the value of physical touch.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to stay with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Can you look at my hand again, and this time, I want you to notice the sensation of my hand on your arm without trying to look away or change it. Just focus on the physical sensation of our connection, and let go of any thoughts or emotions that come up.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that helps, but I can feel your hand — it's a weird little comfort. Right after I notice it the shame spikes and the disaster movie starts again: unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing — I'm really overwhelmed; can you stay with me or count slowly so I don't bolt to chopping or doomscrolling?

Patient: I try to notice the air, but honestly I'm not sure I follow — it just drags up that shame and my chest tightens, my hands start shaking, and within a beat the whole movie fires up: unpaid bills, suppliers cut me off, an inspector shows up, the doors close. I don't know how that's supposed to help; can you stay with me or count slowly so I don't bolt back to chopping or doomscrolling?

I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. I'm not trying to change anything or fix it. Can you just be with me, right now, in this moment, without trying to do anything or achieve anything? Can you just be here?

Patient: I'll try to be here, but I don't really know how — the minute I try my brain kicks into the disaster reel: unpaid bills, suppliers cutting me off, an inspector, the doors closing.
