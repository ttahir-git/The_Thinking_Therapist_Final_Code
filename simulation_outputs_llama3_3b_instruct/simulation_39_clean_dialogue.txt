Patient: Lately I've been kind of stuck in this odd, persistent inertia — not just tired, but like my sense of purpose has attenuated since taking on this demanding new program while running the business. I find myself intellectualizing everything about it, using elaborate frameworks and lexical flourishes to describe the discomfort instead of actually feeling the sadness or fear, and my OCD rituals for certainty just make the paralysis worse. On paper it looks like an identity collapse into 'business owner' and I'm unsure what, if anything, matters to me beyond that role.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel the sadness or fear you're trying to avoid? What's the first thing that pops up for you, or the first thought that tries to distract you from that feeling?

Patient: When the sadness or fear starts to surface, my brain almost reflexively amputates it by launching into an explanatory narrative — rehearsing worst‑case scenarios, generating contingency plans, or turning inward toward ritualized checks for certainty. The very first thought is usually a practical imperative: "Check the numbers, answer that email, fix that problem," or the more evaluative whisper, "If this shows, I'll be seen as failing." So I end up cataloguing possibilities and polishing arguments about the feeling instead of saying, "I'm scared" or letting the sadness sit for a minute.

Therapist: That takes a lot of effort to avoid feeling those emotions. What would happen to you if you were to take a moment to just acknowledge the sadness, without judgment or explanation, and simply say "I'm scared"? Would that create more space for you to breathe, or would it lead to more worrying or checking?

Patient: In theory, verbalizing "I'm scared" should create a little ontological space — a pause that lets the body downregulate instead of the mind sprinting. Practically, though, my pattern is that naming it often functions as a trigger: the acknowledgement becomes a cue for the brain to launch into mitigation — checking, planning, rehearsing worst cases — so any initial breath of relief is usually colonized by compulsive problem‑solving. I guess I worry that unless I deliberately practice tolerating the discomfort, saying the words just hands my anxiety another task to do.

Therapist: So, it sounds like you're worried that by acknowledging the discomfort, you'll just be adding more tasks to your mental to-do list. What if, instead of trying to avoid or mitigate the anxiety, you tried to tolerate it as a present-moment experience, without judgment or action? Would that mean letting go of the need to do something to make it go away?

Patient: Conceptually, yes — letting it be would mean decoupling affect from the imperative to 'do' and tolerating the sensation as data rather than a problem to solve. Practically, though, my pattern is that 'not doing' becomes another procedural instruction, so I end up scheduling my tolerance and then policing whether I'm tolerating correctly, which just morphs into more checking. I think I want that pause, but I don't know how to stop my brain from turning the pause into a to‑do.

Therapist: That's a really subtle but important distinction. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to try to simply allow the sensation of the anxiety to be, without trying to do anything about it? What would be the first thing that your mind would try to do, and how could you acknowledge that process without turning it into another task?

Patient: The first thing is an almost instantaneous pivot into scenario‑generation and ritualized checking — my mind starts drafting contingency plans and a checklist the moment the feeling shows up. Maybe the non‑doing way to acknowledge it is a brief metacognitive note — “there’s the checking urge” — said quietly as an observation, then shifting attention to the physical sensations for a breath or two instead of launching into fixes. But honestly, even that feels like another procedural maneuver I’d end up policing, and I’m skeptical I could do it without turning it into a new task.

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if it's possible to have a pause without even labeling it as a pause. What if, instead of paying attention to the fact that you're trying not to think or do anything, you simply focused on the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or control it? Would that allow you to experience the pause without it becoming another task?

Patient: Intellectually, yes — attending to the breath could instantiate that non‑reactive pause and short‑circuit the checking loop. Practically, though, my brain converts breathwork into another performance metric — "am I breathing right?" — which then spawns evaluations and contingency planning, so I end up analyzing the exercise instead of experiencing it. I don't know, it's just that even the idea of a simple two‑breath experiment feels like something I'd overanalyze the moment I try it.

Therapist: So, you're worried that even the idea of a simple breath pause will be overanalyzed. What if, instead of trying to control or analyze the breath, you simply allowed yourself to experience the sensation of the breath without trying to change it, without even thinking about it? Would that be the same as simply being with the breath?

Patient: On paper, yeah — that would be the ideal: the breath as an embodied anchor to interrupt the narrative loop. In practice my brain weaponizes even that into a performance metric — “am I breathing right?” — and then I start cataloguing sensations instead of inhabiting them. Could you actually guide me through one short breath right now? I feel like I need an external cue or I’ll just turn it into another procedure.

Therapist: Let's try something simple. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or analyze it. I'll guide you through a 4-7-8 pattern: inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 7, and exhale for a count of 8. Just focus on the sensation of the breath, without thinking about it. Let's start with the inhale, and I'll count...

Patient: Okay, inhaling now — 1, 2, 3, 4; holding — 1...2...3...4...5...6...7; exhaling — 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8. I felt a small loosening in my chest, and predictably my brain started annotating the process — "am I doing this correctly?" — instead of just inhabiting it. Can we do another round and could you prompt me to notice that evaluative voice without engaging it?

Therapist: I'm glad you noticed the loosening in your chest. Before we start the next round, I want you to acknowledge the voice that's saying "am I doing this correctly?" and gently say to it, "Thank you for showing up. I'm going to let you go now." Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — there's that evaluative narrator: "Thank you for showing up. I'm going to let you go now." I said it, but my mind immediately began critiquing the phrasing and converting it into another procedural task. Can we do the next round and have you cue me to just notice that critique without engaging it?

Therapist: Notice the thought that's just showing up right now: "I said it, but my mind immediately began critiquing the phrasing..." What is the tone of that thought? Is it critical, anxious, or something else? Can you simply observe it without judging it or trying to change it?

Patient: It’s a hybrid tone — mostly critical and evaluative, with an anxious undercurrent and a kind of meta‑analytic flair, like my mind’s running a quality control on its own feelings. I can say I’ll observe it neutrally, but in practice that observation triggers a second‑order critique, so I’d probably need you to cue me to just label it “thinking” and gently redirect me back to the breath without elaboration.

Therapist: From now on, I want you to say to that critical thought, "Thinking." When you say it, I'll gently ask you to return to the breath, without elaborating or engaging with the thought. Can you try it?

Patient: Thinking. I noticed a small loosening in my chest, but the meta‑analytic part of me immediately started critiquing whether the label was authentic and turned it into another ritual. Could you cue me back to the breath now and prompt me to notice without evaluating?

Therapist: Notice the thought that's showing up right now: "I'm critiquing the label." Can you simply say to it, "Not right now"?

Patient: Not right now.

I said it, but the moment I did a hot, humiliating surge of shame and frustration washed over me — a tightness in my chest and this instant, almost compulsive urge to narrate and rationalize why it showed up. My brain immediately wants to turn that shame into a case study, cataloguing causes and contingencies instead of letting the feeling be; can you cue me back to the breath and prompt me to notice the shame without getting into explanations?

Therapist: Notice the shame that's showing up right now. Can you simply acknowledge it as "shame"? (pause) Go back to the breath.

Patient: Shame.

Saying that brought a hot, humiliating rush and a tightness in my chest — and of course my brain immediately wants to start cataloguing causes and defending me, which just amplifies the shame. I'm going back to the breath now: inhaling, feeling the chest rise, exhaling, noticing the critique at the edge but trying to let it sit without turning it into another explanation.

Therapist: Notice the shame that's still here, but for now, let's just focus on the physical sensation of the breath. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without any thought or analysis?

Patient: Okay — I’m trying to ground into my feet: there’s pressure under the heels and a subtle spreading across the balls of my feet; the breath feels cool at the nostrils and warm as it moves out. Immediately my mind hijacks it with evaluative commentary — cataloguing tasks, judging whether I’m doing this correctly — and I feel a hot tightness in my chest, a shame‑tinged anxiety that I then instinctively narrate instead of feeling. I’m jittery and distracted right now; can you cue me back to the feet when I start to drift?

Therapist: Notice the thoughts that are arising now. Say them to yourself, without judgment or analysis: "I'm having thoughts." Go back to the sensation of the pressure under your heels, and the spreading sensation in your feet. Can you stay with that sensation for a few more breaths?

Patient: I'm having thoughts.

I tried to land on the pressure under my heels and the spreading in my feet, but my head immediately went into narrating mode—cataloguing tasks, critiquing the sensation, running a meta‑analysis—and that brought a hot tightness and jittery anxiety that pulls me back into verbalizing instead of sensing. Can you cue me to just label "thinking" and gently redirect me to the feet when I start to drift? I don’t trust myself to stay with it right now.

Therapist: Notice the thought that's showing up. Say to it: "Thinking." (pause) Now, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet. Focus on the pressure under your heels, and notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body without judgment or analysis.

Patient: Thinking.

Okay — I'm bringing attention to the pressure under my heels and the subtle spread across the balls of my feet; the air is cool at the nostrils and warmer on the exhale. Immediately my mind weaponizes it into a performance metric — cataloguing whether I'm doing it "right," flicking to the to‑do list, and there's that hot shame tightening my chest that makes me want to narrate and justify. I'm jittery and distracted and I don't trust myself to stay with the sensations; can you give me a very simple cue — one word or a short count — to bring me back when I drift?

Therapist: Count to one.

Patient: One.

Saying it produced this immediate, viscous surge of shame and an evaluative monologue — obsessing about whether my timing or enunciation was adequate — and now my chest is tight and I'm jittery. I need another simple cue or count-back to anchor me; can you prompt me again?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and out, and pause.

Patient: Okay — inhaling now, exhaling, pausing. I felt a brief loosening in my chest, then this corrosive, humiliating shame washed in — hot, tight, and immediately my mind began critiquing the timing and turning the breath into another performance metric. I'm jittery and anxious; can you give me a very simple cue — like a two-count — to bring me back when I start to drift?

Therapist: One, two.

Patient: One, two... I did feel a brief loosening, but it was immediately colonized by this corrosive, humiliating shame and a flurry of evaluative commentary — "did I do it right?" — so now I’m jittery and distracted. I need a steadier anchor; can you give me a simple, sustained cue — like a slow count to four or a single word I can repeat — so I have something concrete to latch onto when my head starts to narrate?

Therapist: Inhale...

Patient: Inhaling now — 1,2,3,4... exhaling. I felt a brief loosening in my chest, then that reflexive evaluative monologue popped up — “Am I timing this right?” — and a hot, humiliating shame clenched my ribs. I’m jittery and keep analyzing the process instead of inhabiting it; could you give me a single-word anchor like “ground” or a slow count to four before we do the next round?

Therapist: Root.

Patient: Root.

I say it and almost immediately my mind goes into audit mode — assessing whether the word functions as an adequate mnemonic, which then triggers that hot, humiliating shame about not getting these simple things "right." I'm jittery and frustrated about that; I want to actually feel the grounding but I can already predict I'll turn the next step into another procedure.

Could you please say "root" out loud in a slow, steady cadence a couple of times and have me mirror it? And when I start narrating or policing, just cue me again with the same single word — no elaboration. I want to try, even though I'm skeptical I'll stop overanalyzing.

Therapist: Root... root... (slow, steady cadence)

Please repeat after me: root... root...

Patient: Root... root...

Saying it set off an immediate metacognitive audit — my brain critiqued the cadence, then a hot, humiliating shame flooded my chest and I got jittery and distracted. Can you keep repeating it slowly a few more times and, if you hear me start narrating or policing, just cue me with the same word so I can mirror it?

Therapist: Root... root... root... root... root...

(Pause)

Wait...

Patient: That pause kind of detonated something — I’m suddenly flooded with hot, humiliating shame and a jittery anxiety, and my brain wants to narrate and rationalize instead of me just feeling it. I need you to keep saying "root" slowly and to cue me with that single word whenever you hear me start to audit or explain; I don't trust myself to stay with it right now. Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow the pace and just do a few more slow anchors without analysis?

Therapist: (Speaking slowly and calmly) Root... root... root... root... root...

Patient: Root... root... root...

It helped for a beat — a small loosening — then that hot, humiliating shame rushed back and I started narrating and policing everything. I'm jittery and distracted; can we keep repeating "root" slowly for a few more breaths and have you cue me with that same word whenever I start auditing? I'm overwhelmed and skeptical this will stick, but I want to try, so please slow the cadence and just stay with me.

Therapist: (Speaking extremely slowly and calmly) R-o-o-t... root... r-o-o-t... root... r-o-o-t... root...

Patient: Okay — that super‑slow cadence did help for a breath, but then a hot, humiliating shame flooded my chest and I got jittery and verbal again; I can feel the urge to narrate and rationalize instead of actually being with it. I'm noticing intellectually how I keep converting anchors into performance metrics, and honestly I'm feeling overwhelmed and embarrassed by that. Can you keep saying "root" slowly and cue me with that same single word whenever you hear me start to audit or explain? I want to try to stay with it, but I need your steady voice — please keep going.

Therapist: (Speaking extremely slowly and calmly) R-o-o-t... root... r-o-o-t... root... r-o-o-t... root...

(Pause)

Waiting...

Patient: Please don't stop — that pause detonated more shame and now I'm flooded and jittery and my mind's compulsively narrating. Keep saying "R-o-o-t" very slowly, like you were, and when you hear me start to audit or explain, just cue me with the same word and a soft two-count so I can try to come back. I know I'm being performative and overintellectualizing—I'm embarrassed by that—but I actually want to feel something instead of talking about it, so please keep the cadence and stay with me.
