--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been obsessing about work — I keep picturing myself bombing a big client pitch, which will definitely cost us the account, then others will follow, the business will implode, and I'll be ruined. Because I'm so sure that chain of disaster is inevitable, I freeze up and procrastinate instead of doing the things that might help. I know it sounds over the top, but I can't shake the feeling that this is exactly what's going to happen.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be anxiety, driven by the perceived certainty of a catastrophic outcome. I identify one specific theme: the fusion with the hypothetical scenario, where the patient is deeply invested in the predicted "bad" outcome and is using it to justify avoidance. My goal for the answer is to encourage willingness to create space for valued action, exploring the possibility of "bombing" as a way to create room for growth.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it would be like if, for a brief moment, you allowed yourself to imagine the scenario where you do bomb the pitch? What's the first thought or physical sensation that comes up for you when you picture yourself failing in this way?

Patient: The first thought is always, "That's it — I blew it and everyone knows I'm a fraud," and from there my brain immediately starts spelling out how that one bad pitch will sink the whole company. Physically I get a cold drop in my stomach, my chest tightens, my hands go numb and I start sweating, like my body is already reacting to the disaster. Once that chain starts, I can't stop picturing losing the client, people leaving, bills piling up, me losing the business and my home — and honestly, when you suggest other outcomes, they barely register; this feels like the only realistic story. That loop locks me up so I procrastinate, because if the end is inevitable, why bother?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's narrative is fueled by a catastrophic narrative, where the potential failure is framed as the only possible outcome. I identify the unexplored area: the value-driven behavioral step that could be missed due to this narrative. My goal for the answer is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, exploring the possibility of valuing growth over the current "most likely" outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a value that would motivate you to take a small risk in this situation, even if it meant potentially failing? What would it mean to you to value your expertise and capabilities, and what small step could you take towards that value, even if it feels scary or uncertain?

Patient: I guess my value would be responsibility to my team — I don't want to let the people who depend on the business suffer because I froze. A tiny step might be spending 20 minutes tonight to outline the three main points I want to hit and practicing them out loud once. But honestly, even that feels kind of pointless to me because my brain's already convinced I'll mess it up and that one stumble will destroy everything.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is already experiencing a sense of "pointlessness" due to their catastrophic narrative, making it challenging to generate motivation. I identify the need to create space from this sticky thought, specifically the tendency to defuse the catastrophic narrative by acknowledging its role in the patient's behavior. My goal for the answer is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy, exploring the possibility of a more direct approach.

Therapist Answer:
Can you take a step back from the idea that one "stumble" will destroy everything? Instead, what if we consider the possibility that you might actually learn something valuable from this pitch, even if you don't nail it? What would it mean to you to view this experience as an opportunity for growth, rather than a guarantee of failure?

Patient: I want to believe that — responsibility to the team sounds like a good reason to learn — but my brain won't let me. The minute I picture the pitch I go straight to "we're ruined," so anything about "growth" feels like a fairy tale and doesn't register as realistic. I guess I could try that 20-minute outline, but I'm already annoyed and worried it'll be pointless, which just makes me want to avoid doing it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with the idea that their catastrophic narrative is dominating their thoughts, making it challenging to access alternative perspectives. I identify the need to create a clear pivot, moving from exploring the value of growth to directly addressing the unworkability of the current avoidance strategy. My goal for the answer is to introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill, specifically valuing the act of taking small steps towards valued action.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to reframe or rationalize, what if we focus on taking that 20-minute outline as a small, low-stakes commitment to yourself? What if you were to view it as a tiny act of kindness, a way to show up for yourself and your team, even if you don't feel like you're doing it to achieve a specific outcome? Can you imagine doing that tiny act, just for a moment, without judgment or expectation of success?

Patient: I can picture myself setting a 20-minute timer and jotting down three points, but the moment I think about starting my brain screams that it's pointless — I'll fumble one line, lose the client, and that will kick off the whole collapse. My chest already tightens just saying it, and I'm annoyed at myself for even having to try. Still, maybe I can force myself to do one quick run‑through tonight, though I'm not convinced it'll change anything.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still experiencing the knee-jerk reaction to the catastrophic narrative, and the effort to take a small step is being undermined by their own self-criticism. I identify the need to connect the patient's behavior to an underlying value, specifically the value of self-compassion, to help them develop a more positive relationship with themselves. My goal for the answer is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, exploring the possibility of treating themselves with kindness and understanding.

Therapist Answer:
Can you give yourself permission to show up for this small step, not because you think it will guarantee success, but because it's an act of kindness towards yourself? What if, instead of beating yourself up for not being perfect, you viewed that 20-minute timer as a gentle invitation to practice some self-care, and you did it simply because it felt like the right thing to do, even if it didn't lead to a specific outcome?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to give myself permission to do the 20‑minute thing, but I have to be honest: it already feels pointless; my head's yelling that I’ll fumble one line and that’ll set off the whole collapse. I’ll set a timer tonight and do a quick run‑through, but I’m bracing to be annoyed and convinced it won’t change anything, and if that happens I don’t know where to go from there.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking a small step towards self-compassion, but is still bracing for a negative outcome. I identify the need to introduce a sense of curiosity about the patient's experience, specifically the physical sensations and thoughts that arise when they anticipate the worst-case scenario. My goal for the answer is to create space from the automatic, catastrophic thinking, allowing the patient to develop a greater sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
Can you notice what happens in your body when you think about setting that timer and doing a quick run-through? What are the physical sensations, the thoughts that come up, and the emotions that arise? Try to observe them without judgment, just as they are. What if, instead of trying to change your thoughts or outcomes, you simply allowed yourself to be with whatever is present in this moment?

Patient: My chest tightens, there's that cold drop in my stomach, my hands go a bit numb and my head starts buzzing when I think about the timer. Thoughts immediately jump to the disaster script — "I'll fumble one line, lose the client, the whole business collapses" — and I feel a mix of fear, shame, and irritation at myself. I can try to notice those sensations without judging, but I'm totally hooked on the catastrophe and it feels impossible to let any other outcome in; can we slow down and unpack why that story grabs me so hard?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic narrative is deeply ingrained, and their attempt to notice and observe their thoughts is being hijacked by the automatic, negative script. I identify the need to gently challenge the patient's tendency to become fused with the catastrophic thoughts, allowing them to see themselves as the source of the story, rather than the story itself. My goal for the answer is to introduce defusion, exploring the possibility of letting go of the narrative and connecting with a more grounded, present-moment experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that you're not the story, but rather the person who's telling the story? What if you were to observe your thoughts as just that – thoughts – rather than identifying with them as "I am a failure" or "I'm going to ruin everything"? What if you could see the story as just that – a story – and not have to own it as your identity?

Patient: I hear what you mean, and I can try to step back for a second, but the minute I do the catastrophe script reads like a news report — not a thought — and my body reacts like it’s already happened. I can notice the thought, but almost instantly I'm convinced that noticing won't stop the fallout, so it feels pointless and fake. Can we slow down and unpack why that story grabs me so hard, because I really get stuck there.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to disconnect from the catastrophic narrative, and their body is reacting as if the outcome has already occurred. I identify the need to explore the patient's underlying values and motivations, specifically the fear of being perceived as inadequate or unworthy, which may be driving the intense reaction to the catastrophic outcome. My goal for the answer is to gently challenge this assumption, exploring the possibility that the patient's self-worth is not tied to the outcome of a single event.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a time when you felt strongly that you were unworthy or inadequate, but it wasn't about a catastrophic event? What was going on in your life then, and what values or beliefs might have been driving that feeling? What if, instead of tying your self-worth to this one event, you were to view it as an opportunity to practice self-compassion and kindness, not because of what's happening, but because of who you are?

Patient: Yeah — there was this time after the move when I missed a small payroll deadline and had to call a client to smooth it over. It was just one annoyed client and a messy apology, but my brain treated it like a smoking gun: “you’re incompetent, the team will leave, the business collapses.” Even remembering it now brings that tight chest and cold drop, and anything about “self‑compassion” sounds hollow — can we slow down and try to figure out why that tiny mistake becomes the entire end‑of‑the‑world story for me?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still grappling with the emotional fallout from the catastrophic narrative, and their self-compassion is being tested. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with their thoughts and emotions, specifically the tendency to link their self-worth to external events, and to examine the role of shame and self-blame in this narrative. My goal for the answer is to gently challenge the assumption that the patient is the source of the catastrophe, and to explore the possibility of redefining their relationship with mistakes and imperfections.

Therapist Answer:
Can you consider the possibility that the mistake was not a reflection of your worth or competence, but rather an imperfect human error? What if, instead of beating yourself up over it, you were to view it as an opportunity to learn and grow, and to practice a more realistic and compassionate narrative about yourself?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Saying it was just a human error doesn't land for me; that missed payroll felt like a smoking gun proving I'm incompetent, and my brain treats it like a news report, not a mistake. It feels pointless to practice self‑compassion because the disaster story drowns everything out. Can we slow down and actually unpack why that tiny slip turns into the end of the world for me?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to accept the notion that a single mistake can be a "human error" rather than a catastrophic event. I identify the need to explore the patient's emotional experience, specifically the role of shame and self-blame in perpetuating the catastrophic narrative. My goal for the answer is to create space for a more nuanced understanding of the patient's emotions and to help them develop a greater sense of detachment from the thought patterns that drive their suffering.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to imagine that you're listening to a news report about a small mistake, and the narrator is simply reporting on the facts. What would the tone and language of the narrator sound like? What if, instead of being the narrator, you were the one reporting on your own thoughts and emotions about the mistake? Can you allow yourself to be the journalist, simply observing and describing what's happening, without judgment or commentary?

Patient: The narrator's voice would be flat and factual at first—“a payroll was missed today”—but my brain instantly finishes the sentence with the disaster: “that proves you're incompetent, clients will leave, creditors will come, you'll lose everything.” Trying to be the journalist feels impossible because as soon as I list facts my chest tightens, my attention darts all over, and I start narrating the worst‑case chain like it's already happened. I can say aloud the simple facts—“I missed a payroll; I'm anxious; my hands feel numb”—but I keep getting hijacked by the catastrophe story, so can we slow down and actually practice staying with those plain facts for a minute?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay present with the plain facts, and their brain is hijacked by the catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to introduce mindfulness techniques to help the patient anchor in the present moment, specifically the body sensations and emotions that arise when they try to observe their thoughts. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of mindfulness and presence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple exercise. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your chest right now, the feeling of tightness? Can you describe it in a few words, without judgment or interpretation? Notice the sensation, the location, the texture, the size... just observe it as it is, without adding any thoughts or meanings. Can you stay with that sensation for a few breaths, without trying to change it or move on to something else?

Patient: It feels like a hard knot right behind my sternum — tight, heavy, and kind of sharp; my breaths get shallow. The moment I try to just notice it, my mind locks onto the disaster story — “you’ll fumble the pitch, lose the client, everything collapses” — so I can’t seem to stay with the sensation alone. My phone just buzzed and now I’m jumpy and distracted, so can we slow down? I want to try, but it already feels like it’s slipping away.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay present with the physical sensation, and their mind is quickly hijacked by the catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to introduce a mindfulness anchor, specifically the physical sensation, to help the patient stabilize their attention and create space for a more mindful experience. My goal for the answer is to create a concrete, actionable step that the patient can take to practice mindfulness in the midst of distraction.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple anchor. Take one breath in, and as you exhale, notice the sensation in your chest again. This time, I want you to add a physical action to help you stay with it. Can you gently place your hand on your chest, right behind your sternum, and hold it there for a few seconds? Just a gentle, curious touch, without trying to change anything or think about anything else. Can you stay with the sensation of your hand on your chest, and the physical sensation in your chest, for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand there. It’s warm and the knot behind my sternum is still tight and kind of pulsing; I took one slow breath out but it didn’t loosen. Almost immediately my head screamed the disaster script again — “you’ll fumble the pitch, lose the client, everything’s ruined” — and I’m jittery and distracted. I’m not sure I follow how this helps; can we slow down and actually unpack why that story grabs me so hard, because I keep getting pulled away.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to stay present with the physical sensation and the mindfulness anchor is not holding. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with the catastrophic narrative, specifically the emotional trigger that causes the story to emerge. My goal for the answer is to gently challenge the patient's assumption that the story is an inevitable outcome, and to explore the possibility of a more nuanced understanding of the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to explore the story a bit more. What do you think is the purpose of this disaster story? Is it to protect you from something, or to get a certain reaction from yourself or others? Can you imagine that the story is not a prediction, but rather a way to prepare for a worst-case scenario? What if, instead of believing that this story is inevitable, you could view it as a story that you're creating for yourself, and that you have the power to change?

Patient: I think the story acts like a weird shield — if I predict the worst, it feels like I'm preparing and it gives me an excuse not to act (“why bother if it’s inevitable”). It protects me from the shame of trying and failing because I can point to the prophecy and say I wasn’t naive — I warned everyone. But it also paralyzes me; I freeze, procrastinate, and my hands go numb just thinking about it. I don't really buy that other outcomes are realistic, so can we slow down and actually unpack why that catastrophe story has so much grip on me?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified the function of the catastrophic narrative as a shield, and it's clear that it's also serving as a paralyzer. I identify the need to explore the patient's emotional experience, specifically the underlying emotions that are driving the hold on the narrative. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of curiosity about their emotions, rather than trying to change or avoid them.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that you're observing your emotions right now, without judgment or interpretation. What would you notice about the emotions that come up when you think about the catastrophic narrative? Are they feelings of fear, anxiety, shame, or something else? Can you describe them in a few words, without trying to change or label them?

Patient: Mostly fear and dread — a tight, sinking panic in my chest — with shame layered under it. There's also jittery anxiety, a buzzing kind of guilt like I'm already failing, and sometimes anger at myself for being so stuck. I try to name those feelings but the catastrophe story snaps back in and hijacks me — can we slow down and actually unpack why it grabs me so hard?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a complex mix of emotions, and their attempts to acknowledge and name them are being hijacked by the catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to help the patient develop a sense of curiosity about their emotions, rather than trying to change or avoid them. My goal for the answer is to encourage the patient to explore the emotions as they are, without judgment or interpretation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you notice the shame that's layered under the fear and dread? What does shame feel like in your body? Is it a heaviness, a pressure, or a sense of sinking? Can you stay with that sensation, without trying to change it or push it away? And what about the anger? What does it feel like to be angry at yourself for being stuck? Can you explore that feeling without judgment, and see if it reveals something about what's driving your fear and dread?

Patient: It feels like a heavy, sinking pressure behind my sternum and a hot shame‑flush in my face — like I want to disappear. The anger is a tight, hot knot in my jaw and fists, this furious, impatient energy at myself for being stuck and for "proving" I’m incompetent again. That shame feels like proof to my brain — it turns into the catastrophe narrative instantly, so I freeze and procrastinate instead of doing anything useful. Can we slow down and actually unpack why that shame feels so convincing, because I'm getting yanked right back into the loop.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing intense shame and anger, and their brain is quickly linking these emotions to the catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with shame, specifically the way it's being used to self-sabotage. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of self-compassion and understanding, rather than trying to avoid or escape from shame.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that the shame and anger are not your fault? What if they're not a reflection of your worth or competence, but rather a complex emotional response to a difficult situation? Can you try to see that the shame and anger are not proof of your inadequacy, but rather a sign that you're feeling vulnerable and scared? What would it take for you to begin to believe that you're not a failure, and that you're doing the best you can, even if that's not enough?

Patient: I want to believe that, but I don't know how to get there — the shame sits like a weight in my chest and the anger buzzes in my jaw, and it feels like proof that I'm broken. Maybe it'd take a few clear wins, someone I respect saying I'm competent, and a real backup plan to prove a stumble isn't the end — but honestly that already sounds like wishful thinking; my brain's fortune‑teller just screams doom. Can we slow down and actually work through that memory that's grabbing me, because I'm stuck and keep getting pulled back into the catastrophe.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to find a way to reframe their shame and anger, and is feeling stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking. I identify the need to explore the underlying memory that's driving the patient's thoughts and emotions. My goal for the answer is to gently guide the patient to examine the memory in a more neutral and compassionate light, rather than letting it fuel their catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and look at the memory that's driving your thoughts. What's the story that's playing out in your mind, and what's the context of that story? Can you describe the setting, the people involved, and the events that led up to this moment? Try to observe the memory as if it's a neutral, uncharged event, rather than a personal attack or a prediction of doom. Can you explore the memory with curiosity, without judgment or emotion?

Patient: It was the week after the move — boxes everywhere, half the team still sorting things — and I logged in to find payroll hadn’t gone through. I remember my office manager staring at me, me fumbling the call to the client whose invoice was late, and the client’s tone going flat while I tried to apologize. Describing it like that feels factual, but the shame rushes back — the hot flush, the sinking chest — and my brain instantly reads it as proof I’m incompetent, so the catastrophe script kicks in: everyone sees me as a fraud, they’ll leave, the business will fail. I can try to report the facts, but I keep getting hijacked; can we slow down and actually unpack why this moment grabs me so hard?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is revisiting a specific traumatic event that triggered their shame and catastrophic thinking. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with this event, specifically the way it's being remembered and replayed. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of detachment from the emotional charge associated with the event.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that the way you're remembering this event is not necessarily an accurate representation of what actually happened? What if, instead of trying to recreate the scene or replay the conversation, you could simply observe the emotions that are associated with it? Can you notice the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts that come up, and the emotions that arise, without judgment or interpretation? Try to see if you can simply observe these experiences as they are, without trying to change them or fit them into a narrative.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just observing supposed to change anything? When I try, I notice the hot shame flush, the heavy sinking behind my sternum, and that tight, angry knot in my jaw, but the instant I name those sensations my brain screams the catastrophe script and I get pulled right back into "we're doomed." Can we slow down and actually unpack why that one moment becomes the whole end‑of‑the‑world story for me?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to see the value in simply observing their emotions, and is looking for a more concrete solution to break the cycle of catastrophic thinking. I identify the need to explore the patient's underlying cognitive distortions, specifically the tendency to catastrophize and ruminate on traumatic events. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of detachment from the catastrophic narrative, and to introduce a more nuanced understanding of their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to examine the thought process that occurs when you notice the shame and anxiety? What are the specific thoughts that come up, and how do you know they're not based in reality? For example, when you think "I'm a failure" or "I'm incompetent," what evidence do you have for that thought? Can you try to explore these thoughts in a more critical, rather than automatic, way?

Patient: My head instantly runs the loop: "I blew it," "they know I'm a fraud," "one mistake means everything's over." The "evidence" my brain latches onto is that missed payroll, the client's flat tone, times I fumbled a call — those feel like smoking guns, and any wins get dismissed as luck or temporary. When I try to be critical I either can't find convincing counterevidence or I explain it away, so the doom story just feels airtight. I really get stuck on that memory and the shame it brings — can we slow down and actually unpack it some more?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, and is struggling to challenge their own negative thoughts and emotions. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with their memories, specifically the way they're being stored and replayed in their mind. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of emotional regulation and control over their memories.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to examine the memory in a more nuanced way. What do you think would happen if you were to "unstick" this memory from the catastrophic narrative? What if, instead of seeing it as a complete disaster, you could view it as a complex event with multiple outcomes? Can you imagine that the missed payroll, the client's flat tone, and the fumbled call could be seen as a series of events, rather than a single, defining moment?

Patient: I can't really picture it as separate events — the minute I try the brain stitches them into one headline: missed payroll = proof I'm a fraud = everything collapses. Even when I tell myself it's just a sequence of minor mishaps, my chest tightens and the doom story snaps shut, so can we slow down and actually unpack why that one moment feels like a final verdict?

The patient is struggling to reframe their memory as a series of events, rather than a catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to explore the patient's emotional experience, specifically the way they're relating to their memories and the emotions that arise. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of emotional regulation and a more nuanced understanding of their memories.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to imagine that the emotions that come up when you think about this memory are not necessarily the "right" or "true" emotions. What if, instead of feeling shame, anger, or fear, you could simply observe these emotions as they arise? Can you imagine that you're not the "you" that's feeling these emotions, but rather the " observer" who's noticing them? Can you try to stay with this observation, without judgment or interpretation, and see what happens?

Patient: I try to be the observer, but the second I notice the shame and the tightness behind my sternum my brain yells the catastrophe story and I get pulled right back in. I'm not sure I follow—how is just observing supposed to help when my body is already reacting like it's real? The shame feels like a hot weight and the anger's a tight jaw, and I keep getting hijacked, so can we slow down and actually unpack that memory some more?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to distinguish between their observational awareness and the automatic, catastrophic thinking that's taking over. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with their body and physical sensations, specifically the way they're using their physical responses to cue their thoughts and emotions. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of bodily awareness and learn to distinguish between physical sensations and thought patterns.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at your physical sensations. Can you describe the sensation of the shame and anger in your body without trying to identify them as "shame" or "anger"? Just observe the physical sensations, without judgment or interpretation. For example, what does the tightness in your jaw feel like? Is it a heaviness, a tension, or a pressure? Can you notice the sensations in your body without trying to assign a meaning to them?

Patient: My jaw feels like a tight band, like I'm clenching against something — a hard, grinding pressure; behind my sternum there's a dense, sinking knot and my breaths stay shallow; there's that cold drop in my gut and my hands go a bit numb. The second I name those sensations my brain slams the catastrophe headline on top — “you failed” — and I get hijacked, so I can't seem to stay with just the body stuff. I'm not sure I follow how this helps; can we slow down and actually unpack that memory that's stuck on repeat?

The patient is struggling to separate their physical sensations from their thoughts and emotions, and is getting pulled back into the catastrophic narrative. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with their body and the role of mindfulness in reducing the reactivity to physical sensations. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of mindfulness and learn to stay present with their physical sensations, without getting hijacked by catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple exercise. Can you bring your attention to your breath, just for a moment? Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it in any way. Don't try to observe your thoughts or emotions, just the sensation of the breath. When you're ready, slowly begin to bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body, starting with your jaw, and then move down to your sternum, and finally to your gut and hands. Notice each sensation as it is, without trying to identify them or make sense of them. Can you stay with this process for just a few more breaths?

Patient: I tried — I took a few slow breaths and for a second the buzzing in my head eased, and the knot felt a hair less sharp, but almost immediately the catastrophe script barged back in: “you’ll fumble the pitch, lose the client, then everything collapses,” and my chest tightened again and my hands went numb. I don't really follow how just breathing stops the fortune‑telling machine — it feels like a temporary band‑aid while the future‑doom narrative keeps running on autopilot. Can we slow down and actually unpack that memory and why my brain turns one mistake into the whole end of the world? I want something practical I can try between sessions, but right now I’m stuck and annoyed at myself for being stuck.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is frustrated with the lack of progress and is looking for a more concrete, practical solution to break the cycle of catastrophic thinking. I identify the need to explore the patient's underlying values and motivations, specifically the fear of failure and the desire to avoid feelings of shame and inadequacy. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of self-compassion and understanding, and to identify a small, actionable step that can be taken in between sessions to help build momentum.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a small, everyday situation where you've successfully navigated a challenging or uncertain situation, perhaps with a team or a project? What was it about that experience that helped you feel more confident or capable? What values or strengths did you use in that situation that might be helpful in this one? Can you think of a small, concrete step you can take in the next few days to start building momentum and developing a more constructive narrative about your abilities?

Patient: Yeah — a few months ago, right after the move a supplier bailed and I stepped in, rang a backup, talked the team through it and we kept things running. It reminded me I can be pragmatic, think on my feet, and that responsibility to the team actually drives me. So a small step: in the next two days I’ll block 20 minutes to draft three clear pitch points and send them to my ops lead for one quick piece of feedback — but honestly I’m already bracing that my brain will call it pointless and start predicting doom again, so can we slow down and figure out how to make that feel doable?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recalling a positive experience that highlights their strengths and values, and is looking for a small step to build on that momentum. I identify the need to explore the patient's relationship with self-compassion and self-doubt, specifically the tendency to anticipate and internalize the catastrophic narrative. My goal for the answer is to help the patient develop a greater sense of self-compassion and understanding, and to introduce a mindfulness technique to reduce self-doubt and increase confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to imagine that you're not the "doomed" person, but rather the person who's taking a small step towards your goals and values. What if, instead of expecting your brain to try to sabotage you, you could view it as an opportunity to practice self-compassion and kindness towards yourself? Can you try to reframe your internal dialogue, so that instead of "I'm going to mess this up" you could say to yourself "I'm taking a small step towards my goals, and that's something to be kind and proud of"?

Patient: I'll try to say it — "I'm taking a small step toward my goals, and that's something to be kind and proud of" — but the second I do my brain growls back, "That won't matter, you'll fumble and it's over," and I feel my chest clamp, my face heat with shame, and my jaw go tight like that payroll night all over again. I don't know how to make that kinder sentence stick when the fortune‑teller machine kicks in, so can we slow down and actually build a concrete, tiny plan I can follow (like a one‑line script to say to myself and a quick check‑in with someone after 20 minutes)? I need something practical I can use between sessions because just "try to be kind" feels pointless right now.
