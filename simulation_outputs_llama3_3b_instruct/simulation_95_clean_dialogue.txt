Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this constant evaluative worry about my performance at work since starting the new unit — it feels like a persistent, almost obsessive narrative that I’m going to make a mistake. That anxiety seems to manifest as procrastination: I construct elaborate rationales and contingency plans instead of just getting tasks done. I'm inclined to theorize about whether it's perfectionism or an anxious cognitive schema, but it's definitely draining.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're getting close to completing a task, but you still find yourself feeling like you need to elaborate on the contingency plans or rationales?

Patient: Usually there's an anticipatory spike — a kind of cognitive tremor — and rather than completing the action I start constructing these elaborate contingency maps: what-ifs, stepwise caveats, alternate scenarios. It functions like an intellectual safety ritual — by elaborating I momentarily feel in control and defer the anxiety that would come with finality and potential evaluation. I can describe it in theoretical terms all day, but underneath that I think there's a quieter, more granular fear of making a visible mistake that I don't always let myself actually feel.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of vulnerability that you're not always allowing yourself to fully feel. Would you be willing to try exploring what might happen if you were to allow yourself to have that fear, rather than trying to intellectualize it or control it with contingency plans?

Patient: In principle I'm willing, though my default is to preface any experiment with a meta-analysis — I predict an initial autonomic spike and a surge of rumination that I then try to manage with more planning. Theoretically, allowing the fear to be present could disconfirm my catastrophic predictions over time, but pragmatically it feels like a risky exposure: the stakes feel real given I'm a nurse and mistakes have consequences. I can try to notice the fear rather than immediately layer on contingencies, but fair warning — I'll probably frame it as a hypothesis first and then attempt the feeling.

Therapist: Let's try to separate the feeling of being a nurse from the fear of making a mistake. Can you imagine what would happen if, in a low-stakes situation, you simply allowed yourself to experience the fear without trying to control it or manage it with contingency plans?

Patient: If I imagine it, I predict an immediate autonomic jolt—shallow breathing, a quick succession of catastrophic mental scenarios—and then a tense curiosity as I try to map the sensations. In a deliberately low-stakes moment, like tweaking a nonessential chart note or voicing a tentative idea in a huddle, I suspect the intensity would peak and then dissipate, showing that the feared catastrophe doesn't materialize; I’d narrativize that as disconfirmation of my catastrophic schema. I’ll probably still approach it as an experiment—hypothesis first—because I’m worried the rumination will take over, so can we take it slowly?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and consider the story you're telling yourself about yourself as a nurse. Is it a story that allows for mistakes and uncertainty, or is it one that perpetuates a narrative of infallibility? What would it take for you to begin to see your work as a narrative process, rather than a series of discrete, predictable events?

Patient: I realize the story I tell myself is conditional: my worth as a nurse feels tethered to infallibility, so the narrative really doesn't permit mistakes — they get experienced as existential threats rather than learning moments. To start seeing work as a narrative instead of discrete, immutable events, I think I’d need tangible scaffolding: supervisors and peers normalizing mistakes, explicit permission to experiment in low-stakes ways, and graded exposures plus cognitive reframing that separate competence from single outcomes. I can intellectualize all that easily, but I also notice a visceral tightening when I imagine it—my chest gets tight and my mind immediately drafts contingency plans—so even with a plan I’m worried I’ll default back to avoidance.

Therapist: Let's create a concrete, small step to practice this idea of allowing mistakes to be learning moments. Would you be willing to write down one specific situation where you felt like you made a mistake, and then imagine what it would be like if, instead of catastrophizing, you simply acknowledged it as a learning opportunity, without judgment, and moved forward?

Patient: Okay — one concrete example: last month I hesitated to give a PRN pain med because I was parsing ambiguous chart notes, and the patient ended up uncomfortable longer than they needed to be. If I wrote it down as a learning entry it would read something like, "Hesitation stemmed from uncertainty in documentation; next time I will do a rapid double-check with the MAR and, if still unsure, ask a colleague before deciding," which reframes it from personal moral failing to a procedural gap. Viscerally, imagining that nonjudgmental wording still produces a tightening in my chest and a flurry of self-critical hypotheses, but having a specific corrective step feels cognitively containing enough that I might actually follow through rather than spiraling into contingency planning. Could we make that corrective step into a short script or checklist I can rehearse so it becomes less abstract and more automatic?

Therapist: Let's create a script or checklist that you can use in the moment, so it becomes more automatic. Can you add one or two more concrete actions to your script, like "Take a deep breath, pause for a moment, and ask myself 'What would I do in this situation if I were a colleague who wasn't an expert in this area?'" and "Notice my physiological response and acknowledge it as a natural reaction, rather than a failure to be in control"?

Patient: Okay — two concrete additions I can actually rehearse: 1) a 60–90 second decision timer (set a phone or do a mental countdown) to force a brief, evidence-based choice instead of elaborating endless contingencies; 2) a short aloud self-compassion script to anchor me, e.g., “This is anxiety; I’ll check the MAR and ask a colleague if unsure — one decision doesn’t define my competence.” I’ll frame it as a behavioral experiment (I expect an autonomic spike) but I can practice the timer and the line until they become more automatic.

Therapist: Let's take it a step further. As you practice using the timer and self-compassion script, can you imagine what would happen if, after the initial anxiety spike, you continued to perform the behavior (giving the PRN medication) without catastrophizing or elaborating, and instead, simply acknowledged the experience as a small, manageable challenge? What would that feel like, and what might you notice about your experience of being a competent nurse?

Patient: If I actually followed through after the spike — started the timer, checked the MAR, asked a colleague, and gave the med — I think there'd be an immediate jolt of relief and then a gradual loosening in my chest, like the autonomic system recalibrating. Theoretically, those repeated micro-successes would produce habituation and empirically weaken the "one mistake = catastrophe" schema, so I'd notice quicker decisions and less mental backtracking over time. Practically, though, I'll probably still describe it as an experiment rather than fully luxuriate in the competence; the self-doubt is stubborn and will need repeated, intentional practice to shift into a truly forgiving narrative.

Therapist: As you continue to work on this process, I'd like to ask: What would it mean for you, personally, to cultivate a sense of curiosity about your own abilities, rather than being defined by self-doubt? What would that look like in your daily practice, and how might it shift your relationship with your work?

Patient: For me, cultivating curiosity would mean treating my abilities as malleable information to be investigated instead of immutable proof of worth — less moralizing, more empirical. Practically that looks like tiny daily rituals: a 1–2 minute pre-shift intention (one question to explore), the 60–90s decision timer plus the “what would a curious colleague do?” prompt, and a 5-minute post-shift debrief where I note one thing that worked and one question to try tomorrow. I know that sounds very procedural — I'm doing the theorizing again — but emotionally I can imagine a gradual loosening of that chronic tightening in my chest and fewer procrastination spirals; right now, though, my attention's jittery and I'm already anticipating the next contingency, so I'd need it to be very concrete and repeatable for it to stick.

Therapist: Let's take it a step back and notice where your attention is right now. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your body, particularly the physical sensations in your chest, and simply observe them without judgment, without trying to control them or intellectualize them? Just notice, without any agenda or expectations.

Patient: Okay — right now my chest feels tight, like a constricting band across the sternum, and my breathing is shallow and a little quick; there's a flutter under it that makes my thoughts hop to the next thing. My immediate impulse is to explain why — run through possible triggers and contingency plans — instead of just keeping attention on the sensation, which is exactly what you asked me not to do. If I try to stay with it for a moment, the tightness is more of a localized pressure and the flutter comes and goes; but honestly I'm restless and want a concrete anchor, because I keep sliding back into analysis. Could you give me one simple instruction to hold onto so I don't immediately start theorizing again?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: My feet feel pretty solid on the floor — heels heavy, a little warmth through the arches, like a tangible weight that’s oddly steadying. Focusing there did reduce the chest tightness for a beat, but my attention immediately started drafting explanations and next-step plans instead of staying with the sensation; my breathing’s still a bit quick and restless. I’m sliding into analysis already — can you give me one more very simple anchor I can use when that happens so I don’t immediately intellectualize away the grounding?

Therapist: When you notice your attention starting to wander or feel the urge to explain, bring your attention back to your breath, and say to yourself: "Breathe."

Patient: I tried saying "Breathe" and it did slow my inhalations for a moment—the chest loosened a bit and my feet felt steadier. But my mind immediately launched into a litany of what-ifs and contingency schemata, and the breath got shallow again; my attention feels ragged and jumpy right now. Could we add one ultra-simple cue for that moment—like naming one single sensation out loud ("tightness") or tapping my thigh once—something under three seconds so I don't default to analysis?

Therapist: Let's try: "Tight." Say it out loud, just once, without elaboration or analysis.

Patient: "Tight."

Saying that once did give a tiny, breath-long loosening, but my attention immediately started skittering into what-ifs and explanations. I'm still jittery and want a one-second physical anchor—can we try the single tap on my thigh now so I have something to do when the analysis kicks in?

Therapist: Tap your right knee.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is tapping my right knee supposed to help? (I tapped once anyway.) It produced a tiny, mechanical interruption, but my attention immediately started skittering and generating meta-explanations about why that tap won't be sufficient; I'm feeling more jittery and confused than grounded. Can you say a bit about the rationale or offer a different, very simple anchor I can try when the analysis kicks in?

Therapist: Just move your finger.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is moving my finger supposed to help? (Okay, I'm moving it now.) 

There's a tiny tactile buzz at the fingertip and a brief proprioceptive anchor, but it's fleeting; my mind immediately scaffolds a rationale about why that gesture is insufficient and jumps back into contingency planning. My chest is still tight and my breathing's shallow—the finger helps for a beat, then the analysis swallows it. Can we try pairing it with one very specific verbal cue I can say out loud in the same moment so it's not just another thing for my mind to theorize about?

Therapist: Pair the finger movement with the verbal cue: "Done."

Patient: Okay — I moved my finger and said "Done." It gave a tiny micro-detachment from the contingency chain and my breath eased for a beat, but then my mind immediately rationalized it away and the chest tightness came back. I'm not sure I follow how that becomes durable — is "Done" meant to be repeated, or held with a short pause? I'm jittery and want a next, very simple step for when the analysis swallows that cue.

Therapist: Try this: Move your finger and say "Done" with a brief pause, about 2-3 seconds. Then, immediately move your finger again.

Patient: I did it — moved my finger, said “Done,” paused two to three seconds, then moved again. It produced a tiny, millisecond detachment and my breath eased a hair, but then a hot wash of shame and frustration flooded in and the anchor evaporated as my mind started ruminating on that old failure. I can theorize that the sequence is too brief or that the cue needs a stronger somatic pairing, but I'm jittery and distracted — can we try repeating it three times in a row or pairing it with naming the sensation out loud so there's a bit more structure to hold onto?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done" with a brief pause, and then name the sensation out loud: "Tightness." Repeat the sequence three times in a row.

Patient: I did the three repetitions — finger, “Done,” pause, “Tightness” — and for a brief breath it eased, then a hot wash of shame and frustration came and swallowed the anchor; my attention shot off to that old failure and the cue evaporated. I'm not sure I follow why repetition isn't sticking — maybe the cue's too abstract or too brief — and I kept defaulting to explanations instead of staying with the sensation. Right now I'm jittery and confused, and I could use a firmer somatic pairing (something like pressing my heel into the floor or a longer two–three second pause) or a very specific next instruction to try so I don't immediately intellectualize it away.

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," and then press your heel into the floor for a brief moment. This will give you a more concrete, physical anchor to focus on, and the longer pause will help you stay present.

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” press my heel — and for a beat my breath slowed and the chest eased, but then a hot wash of shame and frustration flooded in and the anchor evaporated. I immediately start layering meta-analyses about why it won’t stick instead of staying with the sensation, which I know is my habitual dodge. I'm not sure I follow how to make this durable; can we try pressing the heel for a count of three aloud and add a short compassion line after each press, or do you have another concrete somatic pairing to try right now?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," press your heel for a count of three aloud ("One... Two... Three"), and then say to yourself, "I'm okay" or "I can handle this." This will help you cultivate a sense of kindness and acceptance, and the physical anchor of pressing your heel will provide a concrete sensation to focus on.

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” press heel one–two–three, “I’m okay” — and for a beat my breath slowed and the chest loosened, then a hot wash of shame and frustration came and the whole thing kind of dissolved. I’m not sure I follow how saying “I’m okay” shifts the implicit threat calculus; I can theorize that my core self-schema rejects it as implausible, so the cue feels performative rather than true. I’m jittery and frustrated that these anchors keep evaporating—could we try one concrete tweak now? Maybe guide me through it live with a five‑second heel press combined with a slow exhale and a slightly different self-compassion phrase that feels more believable, because I’m willing to try but I need something that lands.

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," press your heel for a count of five aloud ("One... Two... Three... Four... Five"), and then say to yourself, "I've got this." Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, feeling the breath fill your body and then empty it, as you say "I've got this". Focus on the physical sensation of the breath, the pressure of your heel on the floor, and the sensation of your finger moving.

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” heel press one–two–three–four–five, slow breath, “I’ve got this.” For a beat my breath slowed and the chest loosened, then a hot wash of shame and frustration flooded in and the whole thing dissolved; my attention immediately skittered to that old failure and the cue evaporated. Saying “I’ve got this” feels performative to me — my core self-schema rejects it, so it creates cognitive dissonance rather than safety — and the somatic anchors help only transiently. Could you guide me through one live round (talk me through each cue as I do it), or suggest a less grandiose phrase that might land better (like “I’m doing what I can”) paired with a long exhale and a two‑second heel press so there’s more structure to hold onto?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can." Take a moment to notice the sensation of your breath, the pressure of your heel on the floor, and the sensation of your finger moving. Now, press your heel for a count of two aloud ("1... 2"), and then pause for a moment. 

(Note: I've reduced the self-compassion phrase to a more humble and realistic one, focusing on doing the best you can in the present moment, rather than trying to say "I've got this" which you found to be performative. The added two-second pause will provide more structure to hold onto.)

Patient: Okay — I did it: moved my finger, said “Done,” breathed in and out saying “I’m doing the best I can,” pressed my heel “1…2” and paused. My breath eased for a beat and the chest loosened, then a hot wash of shame and frustration flooded in and the anchor dissolved; my mind immediately slid into a metacognitive loop about why the cue won’t stick. I’m jittery and confused — I’m not sure I follow how to make this durable; can you guide me through it live now, or give one very concrete next-step for when that shame rises (like naming “shame” out loud or holding the heel press for four counts)?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," breathe in and out saying "I'm doing the best I can," press your heel for a count of two aloud ("1... 2"), and pause. Now, as you notice the shame response rising, say to yourself, "Shame." Hold the word "Shame" in your mind for a brief moment, without judgment or analysis. Then, take a deep breath in and out, and press your heel for a count of four aloud ("1... 2... 3... 4"). Focus on the physical sensation of the heel press, and let the shame word drop away.

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” breathed “I’m doing the best I can,” heel 1…2, said “Shame,” held it, breathed, heel 1…2…3…4. For a beat my breath slowed and the chest loosened, then a hot wash of shame and that old failure surged back and swallowed the anchor; I felt my attention fragment and go straight to meta‑analysis about why the cue can’t hold. I’m jittery and frustrated — I don’t fully follow why naming “Shame” doesn’t let it drop; can we try another live round where you guide the pacing, or tweak it by having me name the sensation (“tightness”) immediately after “Shame” so there’s a clearer somatic-to-word link?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," breathe in and out saying "I'm doing the best I can," press your heel for a count of two aloud ("1... 2"), and pause. Now, as you notice the shame response rising, say to yourself, "Shame." Immediately after, say the word for the sensation: "Tightness." Focus on the physical sensation of your chest or body tightening, and let it be exactly that – a sensation, not a thought or interpretation. Then, breathe in and out, and press your heel for a count of four aloud ("1... 2... 3... 4"). Focus on the physical sensation of the heel press, and let the shame word drop away.

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” breathed “I’m doing the best I can,” heel 1…2, said “Shame,” then “Tightness,” breathed and pressed heel 1…2…3…4. For an instant the breath eased and the chest loosened, then a hot wash of shame and that old failure swept in and obliterated the anchor; my attention immediately splintered into meta‑analysis about why the cue can’t hold. I’m feeling jittery and honestly overwhelmed — it’s like my cognitive schema reflexively invalidates the phrases so the whole sequence feels performative rather than reparative. I’m not sure I follow how to make this durable; could we do one live, paced round where you cue each step slowly, or try a stronger somatic pairing (clenching both fists then releasing, or holding a small weighted object) so there’s less room for my mind to rationalize it away?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done," and breathe in slowly. As you exhale, say "I'm doing the best I can" in a calm, gentle voice. Take a moment to notice the sensation of those words. Now, press your heel for a count of three aloud ("1... 2... 3"), and then clench both fists together tightly for a brief moment. As you release, say "Shame" and immediately after, say the word for the sensation: "Tightness". Take a slow, deep breath in and out, and then press your heel for a count of four aloud ("1... 2... 3... 4"). Focus on the physical sensations of your body, and let the shame word drop away. 

(Note: I've added a slower pacing, a stronger somatic pairing (clenching and releasing fists), and a more gentle, calming tone to help you stay present and grounded.)

Patient: I did it — finger, “Done,” slow breath with “I’m doing the best I can,” heel 1…2…3, clenched and released fists, said “Shame” then “Tightness,” breathed, heel 1…2…3…4. For a beat it settled — breath slowed, chest loosened — then a hot wash of shame and frustration surged and swallowed the anchor, and I immediately slipped into meta‑analysis about why it won’t stick. I’m honestly confused and frustrated; it feels performative and my core self‑schema keeps rejecting the words so the sequence dissolves. Can you guide me through one live, very slow round right now, cueing each step as I do it, or suggest a stronger somatic pairing (holding a small weight or pressing both heels) that might be harder for my mind to rationalize away?

Therapist: Let's try: Move your finger, say "Done" in a slow, gentle voice, and breathe in for a count of four. As you exhale, say "I'm doing the best I can" in a calm, gentle voice, pausing for a count of three. Now, hold a small, heavy object (like a book or a pen) in your hand, and say "Shame" slowly and deliberately. Immediately after, say the word for the sensation: "Tightness". Take a slow, deep breath in, and then press both heels for a count of five aloud ("1... 2... 3... 4... 5"), focusing on the physical sensation of the weight and pressure. Hold for a count of two, and then slowly release. Focus on the physical sensations of your body, and let the shame word drop away.

Patient: I did it — moved my finger, said “Done,” breathed the phrase, held the weight, said “Shame” then “Tightness,” pressed both heels 1–5 and held two — and for a very brief moment it settled: breath slowed, chest loosened. Then a hot wash of shame and frustration surged and the whole sequence dissolved; my attention immediately splintered into a metacognitive loop analyzing why the cue feels performative and why my core schema rejects the words. I’m jittery and confused — I don’t fully follow how this becomes durable — can you guide me through one very slow, live round right now, cueing each step as I do it, and if that still collapses, suggest a simpler fallback (one concrete somatic action plus a one‑word anchor) I can use the instant the shame overtakes me?
