Patient: I'm in my early fifties, back in school, and lately I've been getting really anxious in social situations — even small gatherings with friends make me want to leave. I keep avoiding them more and more; my colleagues are supportive at school, but outside of that I feel stuck. I don't know, it's just... hard to talk about.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you think about or try to talk about your feelings in social situations? What's the first thing that comes up for you, and how does your body feel in that moment?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to talk about my feelings the first thing that comes up is this fear that I'll say something stupid or be judged. My chest tightens, my throat gets dry, my heart starts pounding and my hands feel shaky — I usually feel hot and a bit lightheaded too. I guess I just want to shut down or change the subject, so I end up avoiding it.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be really intense, can't they? It sounds like your body is reacting to the idea of being judged, which is driving your desire to avoid talking about your feelings altogether. What if, instead of avoiding the topic, you were to allow yourself to feel those physical sensations while still being present in the conversation? What would happen if you were to say to yourself, "It's okay to feel this way, and I'll take a deep breath, even if I don't know what to say"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I've tried that—taking a deep breath and telling myself it's okay—but it only helps for a moment. Mostly I still feel exposed, like everyone's waiting for me to say something stupid, and then I either clam up or try to steer the conversation away.

Therapist: Can you notice the thought "everyone's waiting for me to say something stupid" as just a thought, rather than a reality? See it as a narrative that might not be entirely accurate. What would it be like to view that thought as a fleeting, passing thought, rather than a truth about the situation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I could see it as just a thought it might take some of the sting away, but in the moment it feels totally real and my body acts like it's true. Even when I tell myself that, my chest still tightens and I end up shutting down or changing the subject. I don't really know how to hold that idea and the panic at the same time.

Therapist: Would you be willing to experiment with something just for a short while, say 30 seconds to 1 minute, where you allow yourself to feel the physical sensations without trying to change or distract yourself? What would happen if you simply acknowledged the tightness in your chest and the racing thoughts, without trying to "fix" or "change" them?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try for like 30 seconds, but I'm not sure I can stay with it. When I do try, my chest gets tighter, my breathing gets shallow, and my mind immediately jumps to everyone judging me, so I mostly want to stop or steer the conversation away. It feels... exposing, and I'm afraid I'll freeze or say something dumb.

Therapist: Can you think of a value that feels important to you, something that you'd be willing to take a risk for, even if it feels uncomfortable or vulnerable? What would happen if, instead of avoiding the conversation, you were to prioritize being present and genuine, even if that meant saying something you might consider "dumb" or taking a risk?

Patient: I don't know... I guess a value for me is connection — not feeling so alone and being honest with the people I care about. But if I try to risk being genuine I get so anxious I freeze or blurt something awkward, and then I just pull back, so I'm not sure how to actually act on that value without panicking.

Therapist: Can you think of a tiny, low-stakes situation where you might be able to put your value of connection into practice? Maybe it's a simple as sharing a small, vulnerable thought with a close friend, or expressing a minor opinion in a casual conversation. What would it be like to take a tiny step towards being more genuine, and what might be the smallest, most manageable step you could take this week?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the smallest step I can think of is sending one short, honest text to a close friend this week — something like, "Hey, I've been feeling a bit anxious lately; would you be up for a quick chat?" I'm nervous it'll sound needy or I'll delete it, so I could give myself a time-limit (send it by Friday) and permission to stop if it feels too much.

Therapist: Let's co-create a plan to help you send that text. Can you imagine yourself saying "Hey, I've been feeling a bit anxious lately; would you be up for a quick chat?" and then pausing for 10 seconds before sending it? We can practice a breathing exercise together, taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, to help you feel more calm and focused. When you're ready, go ahead and send the text, and we can check in after a few minutes to see how it feels.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I can try the breathing for a bit. Breathing in slowly for four, holding for two, out for five — again — in, hold, out. My chest feels a little less tight, but I'm still really nervous about sending the text; I guess I worry they'll think I'm needy or I'll delete it. Could we maybe draft the message together here first?

Therapist: Let's explore the value that's driving your concern about being perceived as needy. Can you think of a time when you felt seen and valued by your friend, where you were able to be vulnerable and open with them? What was it about that experience that felt valuable and satisfying to you?

Patient: I guess there was this one time last year when I told a close friend I was terrified about a presentation, and instead of brushing me off they just listened and said, "That makes sense," then offered to help me practice. It felt... lighter, like I wasn't being judged and someone actually cared enough to stick with me through the awkward parts. I don't know, it's hard to talk about without getting tense, but remembering that makes me want more of that.

Therapist: Now that you remember the feeling of being supported and heard, I want to ask: What if you were to approach your friend in the same way you approached that situation last year? What if, instead of trying to avoid feeling vulnerable or worried about being judged, you could approach the conversation with the same expectation of connection and support? Can you imagine how that might feel, and what might happen if you took that approach?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might feel a bit lighter, like when they helped with that presentation, but I also get this tightness and this loud worry that I'll sound needy or stupid and then I just pull back. Maybe if I went in expecting support I could actually send the text, but I'm really scared I'll freeze or delete it—can we keep working on the message a bit more here first?

Therapist: Let's work on the text together. Can we take a look at the message you drafted earlier, "Hey, I've been feeling a bit anxious lately; would you be up for a quick chat?" What if we add a small phrase to the beginning or end of the message that acknowledges your friend's potential support and understanding? For example, "Hey [friend's name], I value our friendship and appreciate your willingness to listen, and I've been feeling a bit anxious lately; would you be up for a quick chat?" What do you think about this addition?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds thoughtful, but it feels a bit formal and I worry it'll come off as needy. Maybe something shorter would feel more like me, like: "Hey [name], I've been feeling anxious lately — could we have a quick chat this week?" Or even simpler: "Hey, are you around to talk? I've been a bit anxious." I'm nervous I'll delete it — can we pick one together?

Therapist: Let's go with the revised message: "Hey, are you around to talk? I've been a bit anxious." I want to suggest that we practice sending this message in a low-stakes setting, like right now. Would you be willing to say this message to me, even though we're not actually talking to a friend? It's just a practice exercise to help you feel more comfortable with the words and tone.

Patient: I don't know... okay, I'll try it: "Hey — are you around to talk? I've been a bit anxious." I feel ridiculous saying it and my chest's tight, but I said it. What do we do now? I'm already worried I'll delete it.

Therapist: Let's simply observe what happens next. Take a few deep breaths, and notice what you feel without trying to change or analyze it. See if you can allow the experience to be as it is, without judgment or attachment to a specific outcome.

Patient: I tried the breathing — it helped a little, my chest loosened for a moment, but then my mind started chattering again and the tightness came back. I feel exposed and kind of stupid, and I don't know how to stop the urge to delete the message. I guess... can we keep working on the text or maybe role-play how my friend might respond? Sitting with this feeling feels like it's going to make me run.

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the text for now and imagine a conversation with your friend. What do you think your friend might say if they respond to your message? Can you picture a kind and understanding response, or a gentle probe to help you feel more comfortable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess they'd probably say something like, "Of course, I'm here — do you want to talk now or later?" But imagining that makes this stupid shame flare up, like I'm bothering them, and then I want to delete the message and hide. I don't know — can we role-play how I might respond if they say that? I'm nervous but I want to try.

Therapist: Let's role-play a scenario where your friend responds with a neutral or supportive message, and you respond in a way that's authentic and vulnerable. I'll play the role of your friend, and we can go through a brief conversation. When I respond, you can respond as you normally would, and we'll see how it feels. Ready?

Patient: Okay... I'm ready, I guess. If they said that, I'd probably answer, "Could we talk now? I'm feeling pretty anxious and kind of ashamed — I'm afraid I'll sound needy or say something stupid, but I could really use someone to listen." I don't know... how would I follow up if they ask what's wrong?

Therapist: If your friend asks what's wrong, you could say something like, "Honestly, it's just been a tough week with some work stuff and personal issues, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I value our friendship and I'm grateful for your listening ear." See how that feels? Notice if you can let go of the need to control the conversation or provide a specific answer. We can continue to explore this scenario and see where it goes.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that wording could work, but saying "I'm ashamed" already makes my face hot and I feel like an idiot — it's frustrating and humiliating. I worry they'll think I'm weak or needy and then I'll just clam up or change the subject. Could we role-play the follow-up where they ask, "Do you want to talk about it now?" because I'm scared I'll freeze and I want to practice what to say.

Therapist: Let's try role-playing a scenario where your friend asks, "Do you want to talk about it now?" Can you imagine taking a deep breath, and responding with something like, "Yeah, I don't know if I'm ready to talk about it yet, but I appreciate your willingness to listen. Can we catch up on something else for now, and maybe I'll talk about it later if I feel more comfortable?" Notice how you can acknowledge your fear and hesitation, while still maintaining a connection with your friend.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could say that, but even thinking "I'm not ready" makes my face hot and I feel stupid and annoyed with myself. Maybe I'd say, "I don't really want to get into it right now, but I appreciate you — could we talk about something light and I might share more later?" I'm scared I'll freeze saying that — can we role-play me actually saying it and how they might respond?

Therapist: Let's role-play this scenario. I'll respond as your friend, and we'll see how it goes. Here's my response: "No worries, we can definitely catch up on something else. What's been going on in your world that's been keeping you busy lately?" Go ahead and respond as you normally would, and we'll see how the conversation flows.

Patient: I don't know... mostly school — heaps of readings, assignments, and a couple of presentations — and some ongoing family tension that's just been wearing me down. It makes me anxious and kind of ashamed, like I'm failing, so talking about it feels embarrassing and I keep wanting to pull away.

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath and say "That sounds like a lot, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" without feeling like you need to add anything more? Notice how your body feels, and see if you can let go of the need to control the conversation.

Patient: I don't know... That sounds like a lot — I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. My chest's tight, my face heats up, and there's this shame that flares and makes me want to hide or talk about anything else. I guess I keep wanting to explain or change the subject because staying with it feels impossible.

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck in a loop of trying to avoid or change the subject. Can you try something different? Instead of trying to talk about something else, could you simply acknowledge that you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed? You could say something like, "I'm feeling really stuck right now, and I don't know where to start." See if that feels like a more authentic way to express yourself.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try. I'm feeling really stuck right now and I don't know where to start—saying that already makes my face hot and I feel ashamed, like I've failed at something. Can we slow down a bit? Maybe help me pick one tiny, non-scary thing I could actually say or do in the moment?

Therapist: Let's go back to the beginning. You've already sent the text to your friend, and they responded with a neutral message. What's one tiny thing you could say in response to that message, without feeling like you need to "fix" the conversation or avoid your feelings? Something small, like "Thanks for getting back to me" or "I appreciate your understanding". Can you take one tiny step forward with a simple response?

Patient: I don't know... maybe something tiny like, "Thanks — I appreciate you getting back to me." Saying even that makes my face hot and I feel stupid, like I'm bothering them, but I could try to send it. Can we practice it once more here before I actually hit send?

Therapist: Let's go through it one more time. As you say the message, I'll respond as your friend. Go ahead and say it, and I'll respond. Remember, it's just a tiny step, and you're doing it because you want to practice and build confidence. Take a deep breath and say: "Thanks — I appreciate you getting back to me."

Patient: I don't know... okay, "Thanks — I appreciate you getting back to me." I said it, but my chest's racing and my face feels hot — there's this sharp shame and frustration, like I messed up before, and I'm suddenly scared I'll delete it. I guess can we role-play how they might reply so I don't freeze?

Therapist: Let's role-play a scenario where your friend responds with a supportive message. I'll respond as your friend. Go ahead and imagine their response, and then we can practice responding back. Remember, the goal is to be kind and understanding with yourself, not to "fix" the situation.

Patient: I don't know... I guess they'd probably say something like, "I'm here — we can talk now or later, whatever you need." I'd want to reply, "Thanks — I don't really know where to start, I'm feeling overwhelmed and kind of embarrassed, but maybe I can say one thing: school and family stuff have been really heavy lately." Saying that already makes my face hot and I feel stupid — can we keep role-playing what they might say next? I'm worried I'll freeze.

Therapist: Let's continue the role-playing. I'll respond as your friend, and we'll see how the conversation unfolds. Remember, the goal is to be kind and supportive, not to "fix" the situation. Go ahead and imagine my response, and then we'll keep going.

Patient: I don't know... I imagine they'd say, "I'm here—do you want to talk now or later?" And I'd probably answer, "Thanks, I don't really know where to start. School and family stuff have been really heavy and I'm feeling overwhelmed and... ashamed." Saying that already makes my face hot and there's this familiar flash of failure that makes me want to disappear. 

If they asked what I need, I'd want to say, "Maybe just listen for a bit? Or can you help me name one small thing I could try?" I'm nervous I'll freeze—could we role-play how they might respond to that?

Therapist: Let's continue the role-playing. I'll respond as your friend, and we'll see how the conversation unfolds. Remember, you're not alone, and you're not a burden. Go ahead and imagine my response, and then we'll keep going. Take a deep breath and say: "Maybe just listen for a bit?"

Patient: "Maybe just listen for a bit?" I said. I don't know... I said it, but my chest's tight and my face feels hot — there's this sharp shame and frustration, like that old failure flashing up, and I'm terrified I'll freeze or start rambling. Can we keep role-playing how they'd respond? I guess they'd say "Of course" — how would I answer after that without spiraling?

Therapist: Let's continue the role-playing. I'll respond as your friend, and we'll see how the conversation unfolds. Remember, their response is a positive one, and you've got this. Go ahead and imagine my response, and then we'll keep going. Since I said "Of course", you could say something like: "Thanks, just need to catch my breath and collect my thoughts for a bit." Or, you could say something even simpler, like "Thanks, I'll try to calm down". What would you like to say?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'll say, "Thanks — I just need to catch my breath and collect my thoughts for a bit." Saying that already makes my face hot and there's this familiar flash of failure that makes me want to disappear — can we slow down? I don't want to freeze, so could you maybe help me with what to say next?
