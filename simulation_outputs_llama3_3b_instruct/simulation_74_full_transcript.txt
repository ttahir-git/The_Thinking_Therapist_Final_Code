--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a nurse in my late twenties and lately I just feel stuck, like my whole identity is wrapped up in work and I don't know what matters to me beyond that. I had a health scare recently that made the burnout worse, and now I'm directionless and kind of lost. Honestly, I've tried this kind of thing before—how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient seems to be acknowledging feeling stuck and directionless, with a core emotion of frustration and possibly fear. I notice they've tried other approaches before, which suggests they may be looking for a fresh perspective. My goal is to explore the tangible aspects of feeling stuck to identify potential areas for committed action.

Therapist Answer:
What's one specific area of your work where you feel like you've been putting in so much time and energy that it's starting to feel like it's defining who you are, rather than just being a part of your life?

Patient: Mostly the emotional side of the job — I keep getting the sickest patients and the tough family conversations, and I stay late to finish charts or pick up extra shifts so others don't have to. It feels like I'm always "on call" emotionally and logistically, and that's become...me, not just my job. But, honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help? I've tried setting boundaries and it never seems to stick.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is highlighting the emotional demands of their job, feeling like it's become an extension of themselves, and expressing skepticism about the value of talking about these issues. I notice they've tried setting boundaries, which suggests they're aware of the problem but struggling to maintain them. My goal is to gently challenge the workability of their current approach and introduce an alternative perspective.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a specific time when you successfully set a boundary at work, even if it was just a small one, like saying no to a shift or taking a break? What happened right after you set that boundary, and what would it be like for you if you could maintain that boundary consistently, even when it's challenging?

Patient: Yeah — there was one time a few months after my health scare when I actually said no to an extra shift after already doing a 12‑hour day. I left on time, went home, took a walk, slept better, and for the first time in ages my chest didn't feel tight, but I felt guilty and got texts from coworkers...and the next week when they asked again I folded like always. If I could keep that boundary consistently, I'd probably have more energy to think about things outside nursing — hobbies, relationships — but I'm scared of being seen as unreliable and I doubt I could hold it when things get busy. Also, I've tried imagining this before and it doesn't stick — how is picturing it supposed to actually stop me from caving?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a glimmer of success with setting boundaries and a clear understanding of what they stand to gain (more energy and time for personal interests). However, they're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and fear of being seen as unreliable. My goal is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, exploring ways to build confidence in their ability to maintain boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine having a conversation with a trusted friend or mentor about your struggles with boundaries, not to justify your past behavior, but to explore ways to build their trust and confidence in you?

Patient: Yeah—I can picture telling a friend or mentor straight up that I'm burned out and that I need help actually keeping boundaries, not just excuses. I'd ask for practical stuff, like them checking in when I say no to a shift or helping me come up with a way to hand things off so it doesn't feel like I'm abandoning anyone. But I've done this before and people still pressure me—how is that supposed to make them trust me more? I'm not sure how to stick to it when the guilt hits, so can we talk about concrete steps I could use in those moments?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to have a direct conversation with a trusted friend or mentor and is seeking concrete help with maintaining boundaries. They're still struggling with the underlying issue of guilt and wanting to prove themselves. My goal is to introduce a specific ACT technique to create space from the sticky thought of guilt and explore alternatives.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a look at the thought that arises when you feel guilty about saying no to a shift, what does that thought look like for you? Can you label it as just a thought, rather than identifying with it?

Patient: It’s like a running voice that says, “If you say no, you’re letting people down — you’re unreliable, patients will suffer, and everyone will judge you.” I can try to call that “just a thought,” but it doesn’t feel like one — it feels like a fact in my body, not a label. How is labeling it supposed to help when the guilt hits so hard? I need something concrete I can actually do in that moment, not just renaming it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to distinguish between their thoughts and their physical sensations of guilt, and is seeking a concrete strategy to cope with the emotional intensity of the moment. My goal is to introduce a mindfulness exercise to create a sense of detachment from the thought and explore alternative actions.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine holding your body in a gentle, open position, with your feet on the ground and your arms relaxed by your sides? As you breathe in, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and as you breathe out, imagine any tension or discomfort in your body slowly releasing. When the thought arises that says "you're letting people down," can you pause for a brief moment before reacting, and instead focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground?

Patient: I tried picturing my feet on the ground and pausing — it did take the edge off for a few seconds, but the guilt still rushes back like a wave. How is that supposed to help beyond buying me a tiny break? I need something concrete: give me a one‑line anchor I can say in my head, an exact script to say no that doesn’t make me sound cold, an if‑then plan for when coworkers push, and one accountability move that doesn’t feel childish. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and actually practice those scripts right now?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is seeking concrete tools to manage their emotions and develop more effective communication skills. They're recognizing the need for more substantial support, and I can offer a structured approach to achieve that. My goal is to co-create a practical plan to increase confidence in saying no and maintaining boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
When you feel the wave of guilt arising, try saying to yourself: "I've got this, I've got this." Repeat it once, then take a deep breath and say, "I need to prioritize my own well-being right now, and that means saying no to this shift." If a coworker pushes back, say, "I appreciate your concern, but I've already checked in with my team and we've got everything covered. I'm committing to being available for you on the next available shift." To hold yourself accountable, commit to sending a quick text to a friend or mentor after saying no, just to check in and say, "I did it!"

Patient: Okay — I tried saying "I've got this" and it felt hollow, like a Band‑Aid on panic. I've done similar mantras before and they don't stick, so how is this actually supposed to stop the guilt from slamming me? Give me a one‑word or one‑line anchor that actually feels believable, an exact two‑sentence script to say no that sounds firm but not cold, and a clear if‑then I can use the second someone pushes (and no, "check in with team" is too vague). I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down and roleplay that push right now so I can practice the lines?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing that the previous anchor didn't resonate with them, and is seeking a more authentic and effective tool. They're also looking for more specific guidance on how to navigate a pushback from a coworker. My goal is to help them craft a more believable and assertive script, and to practice the scenario in a safe and controlled environment.

Therapist Answer:
Try using the anchor: "I've taken care of myself." 

Script: "I appreciate your understanding, but I'm not feeling my best right now and I need to prioritize my own well-being. Can we discuss alternative arrangements for coverage?"

For the pushback scenario: Roleplay a conversation where a coworker says, "But who will cover your section?" and respond using the script, pausing briefly before responding with a clear and assertive tone.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it.

Anchor: "I've taken care of myself."

Me: "I appreciate your understanding, but I'm not feeling my best right now and I need to prioritize my own well‑being. Can we discuss alternative arrangements for coverage?"

Coworker: "But who will cover your section?"

... "I appreciate you asking. I already asked Jenna to cover med pass and Mark agreed to take admissions; if an unexpected emergency comes up I'll be available by phone after I rest. I need to stick to this plan today."

That actually felt...not terrible, but I'm still worried the guilt will slam me. Can we try a shorter, firmer one‑line I can use when someone pushes, and an if‑then I can use the second they start guilting me?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress with the script and anchor, but still concerns about the potential for guilt to overwhelm them. My goal is to introduce a shorter, more assertive one-liner to help them quickly respond to pushback, and explore an "if-then" plan to mitigate the guilt.

Therapist Answer:
One-liner: "I've got it covered."

If-then plan: When someone starts guilting you, say "I've got it covered" and immediately shift to a value-driven thought, e.g., "That's okay, I'm prioritizing my own well-being so I can be the best nurse I can be for my patients."

Patient: I tried "I've got it covered" in my head and it dulls the edge for like two breaths, then the guilt surges back and I start doubting myself. How is moving to a value-driven thought actually supposed to stop that panic when it hits? Give me two exact, short replies: one for when someone says "Patients will suffer" and one for "You're letting the team down" — both need to shut it down without sounding like a jerk. If they keep pushing after those lines, what’s the exact sentence I say to end the conversation and walk away? I’m starting to feel overwhelmed—can we roleplay those now?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing that the value-driven thought doesn't necessarily eliminate the emotional response, and is seeking more direct and effective ways to shut down the guilt and pushback. My goal is to provide two concise and assertive responses to common guilt-inducing statements, and to help them establish a clear boundary to end the conversation.

Therapist Answer:
For "Patients will suffer": "I understand the concern, but my priority is my own well-being, and that will actually improve my ability to care for patients in the long run."

For "You're letting the team down": "I appreciate your understanding, and I'll make sure to communicate with the team to ensure a smooth handover."

If the pushback continues, say: "I've got this conversation and I'm going to take a break. I'll be in touch when I'm feeling more centered."

Patient: Okay — let's roleplay it now.

Coworker: "Patients will suffer if you don't cover the shift."

Me: "I understand the concern, but my well‑being needs to come first right now — resting means I can care for patients better later."

Coworker: "You're letting the team down."

Me: "I appreciate that, but I've arranged a handover and communicated with the team; I need to stick to that plan."

Coworker keeps pushing ("This is unacceptable, you can't just...")

Me: "I've got this conversation and I'm going to take a break. I'll be in touch when I'm feeling more centered." And then I leave the area.

That felt...okay on paper, but in my body the guilt still spikes seconds later. How is walking away supposed to stop the panic? Give me one ultra‑short shutdown line I can blurt in the moment when someone starts guilting me — something like 2–3 words — and one exact line for if a supervisor escalates and expects me to cover anyway. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and practice those?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress with the roleplay, but still struggling with the emotional aftermath of walking away. My goal is to provide a quick shutdown line to help them interrupt the cycle of guilt and pushback, and a follow-up response for the supervisor scenario.

Therapist Answer:
Ultra-short shutdown line: "No."

This one-word response can help interrupt the flow of guilt and pushback, giving you a brief moment to pause and collect yourself.

For the supervisor escalation: "I've communicated my boundary and I'm not revising it."

This response acknowledges the supervisor's expectation while reiterating your previously established boundary and willingness to follow it.

Patient: “No” feels too blunt — I can already see it setting people off. How is that supposed to help when I'm trying not to make enemies? I need a 2–3 word shutdown that actually sounds human (ideas I like: “Not available,” “Can’t today,” “I need rest”) — tell me which you think lands best and why. And give me one exact, firm line for if a supervisor escalates that doesn’t sound like I'm arguing but also doesn't let them roll me back; then can we roleplay the supervisor pushing so I can try it out? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down and actually practice those now?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is seeking a more nuanced shutdown line that still conveys firmness without escalating the situation. My goal is to provide a response that sounds human and effective.

Therapist Answer:
I recommend the shutdown line: "I need rest."

This phrase acknowledges the supervisor's expectation while clearly communicating your own needs and limitations. It also sounds more relatable and compassionate, which can help de-escalate the situation.

Firm line for supervisor escalation: "I'm authorized to take a break, and I'll make sure my responsibilities are covered."

This response clearly communicates your boundary while also emphasizing your commitment to getting your work done. I'll roleplay a scenario with you now to help you practice this response.

(Note: We'll assume the supervisor is pushing for you to stay on the shift, and we'll go back and forth to simulate the conversation.)

Patient: Okay — I agree, "I need rest" feels more human and less punchy than "No." It lands best because it names a need without shaming anyone, and it’s short enough to say when my chest is tight. The supervisor line feels a bit formal but usable: "I'm authorized to take a break, and I'll make sure my responsibilities are covered."

All right, let’s roleplay — do the supervisor voice and I’ll respond. Start whenever you're ready.

(Also — I’m already getting a bit overwhelmed thinking about actually saying this in the moment. How is this supposed to stop that panic when it hits? Can we slow down a bit and do it slowly?)


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress with the shutdown line and supervisor response, but still experiencing anxiety about applying them in the moment. My goal is to help them gradually build confidence and introduce a gradual exposure technique to manage panic.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and start the roleplay slowly. I'll start as the supervisor, and we'll go at a gentle pace.

"Hey, I've noticed you've been saying no to some shifts lately. Can we discuss what's going on? You're a valuable member of our team, and we need your expertise. What's going on?"

Please respond, and we'll take it from there. Remember, the goal is to respond in a calm and assertive tone, using the shutdown line and supervisor response we've practiced.

Patient: Thanks for checking in. I've been totally burned out and had a recent health scare, so I need rest right now — I'm not available for extra shifts. I've arranged coverage (Jenna on med pass, Mark on admissions) and I'm authorized to take this break; I'll be reachable for true emergencies, but I need to stick to this plan because pushing myself before just made me sicker.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is assertively communicating their boundary, explaining their need for rest, and offering a clear plan for coverage. My goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of this response and provide feedback for further refinement.

Therapist Answer:
Your response is excellent! You clearly and confidently stated your boundary, explained the reason for it, and offered a solution that ensures patient care is still covered. Your use of "I need to stick to this plan because pushing myself before just made me sicker" is a powerful way to reframe the narrative and avoid taking on more responsibility that could exacerbate your burnout.

Let's pause for a moment and take a deep breath. Notice how you felt while responding to the supervisor? Did you notice any changes in your body or emotions?

Patient: When I said it I actually felt a little relief — my shoulders dropped and my voice steadied for a second. But it was short‑lived: two breaths later the guilt was back in my chest and my mind was already picturing patients and teammates scrambling, so I got shaky again. How is that supposed to stick beyond those few seconds? Can we slow down and run another practice where the guilt hits right after I say the line and you push back, so I can try the shutdown and supervisor script in the moment?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing that the initial sense of relief was short-lived, and the guilt is still a persistent presence. My goal is to help you build resilience and develop a more sustained response to the pushback.

Therapist Answer:
Let's run another practice, and this time, I'll start by pushing back with a slightly more challenging scenario.

"Okay, I understand that you've been burned out, but we need you on this shift. The team is short-staffed, and we can't afford to have you off. Can't you just come in for a few more hours?"

Please respond using the shutdown line ("I need rest") and the supervisor script ("I'm authorized to take a break, and I'll make sure my responsibilities are covered"). I'll push back with increasing intensity, and we'll see how you respond.

Remember, the goal is to stay calm, assertive, and committed to your boundary, even when the pushback becomes more challenging.

Patient: "I need rest." I'm authorized to take a break and I've arranged coverage—Jenna on med pass and Mark on admissions—and I'll be reachable for true emergencies, but I need to stick to this. Saying it felt a bit freeing for a second, but I'm already getting guilty and shaky—can we slow down and practice the part where you push back harder so I can try the ultra-short shutdown in the moment?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is responding with the shutdown line and supervisor script, but the guilt is still creeping back in. My goal is to help you build a more robust response to the pushback, using the ultra-short shutdown line ("No") to interrupt the cycle of guilt and shame.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it down a notch and practice a more intense pushback scenario. I'll start by saying:

"Come on, we're in the middle of a crisis here. We can't afford to have you off. You're the only one who can help us get through this. If you're not here, patients are going to suffer. What are you going to do, just leave them to fend for themselves?"

Please respond using the ultra-short shutdown line ("No") and the supervisor script ("I'm authorized to take a break, and I'll make sure my responsibilities are covered"). I'll try to push you a bit harder, but not too hard, to help you practice responding in the moment.

Patient: "No." I'm authorized to take a break and I've arranged coverage — Jenna on med pass and Mark on admissions — I'll be reachable for true emergencies, but I need to stick to this. That calmed me for a beat, then the guilt slammed back and I got shaky — how is saying that actually supposed to stop the panic? Can we please keep practicing with you pushing harder right when the guilt hits so I can try the ultra‑short shutdown in the moment?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is successfully using the ultra-short shutdown line ("No") to interrupt the cycle of guilt, but the underlying panic is still present. My goal is to help you develop a more sustained response, using the shutdown line to create a gap between the pushback and the panic.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, and this time, I'll push back even harder, trying to hit the emotional sweet spot right when the guilt hits.

"Are you kidding me? You're telling me you're not going to come in and help us? Patients are counting on you! What's more important, your feelings or their lives? You're not a martyr, you're a nurse! You have a responsibility to care for these people, and you're just going to leave them high and dry? No!"

Please respond using the ultra-short shutdown line ("No") as soon as you feel the guilt hitting. Remember, the goal is to interrupt the cycle of guilt and shame, and create space for a more mindful response.

Patient: No. I'm authorized to take a break and I've arranged coverage — Jenna on med pass, Mark on admissions — I'll be reachable for true emergencies, but I need to stick to this.

Saying it gave me a tiny blink of relief, then the guilt slammed back and my hands started shaking. How is that supposed to stop the panic? Can we keep doing this—push right at that split second so I can try different short lines and actually practice what to do when the guilt hits, because I'm getting overwhelmed and need it slower.


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using the ultra-short shutdown line ("No") to interrupt the cycle of guilt, but the underlying panic persists. My goal is to help you develop a more nuanced response, using the shutdown line to create a gap between the pushback and the panic.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and try again. I'll start by pushing back harder, trying to hit the emotional sweet spot right when the guilt hits.

"Come on, don't be ridiculous! You think you're the only one who's ever had to make tough decisions? You're just going to bail on us now? Our patients are counting on you! You're not a hero, you're a nurse, and you're going to act like one!"

Please respond using a different short line, such as "Not now," "Not for me," or "I'm out." I'll try to push back harder, but not too hard, to help you practice responding in the moment.

(Note: We'll slow down the pace and take breaks whenever you need it. I'm here to support you in building your resilience and confidence.)

Patient: Not now. I don't have the energy to argue — how is this supposed to help? I'm feeling wiped out and it's getting hard to stay with this.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is acknowledging their exhaustion and feeling overwhelmed, but still hesitant to let go of the shutdown line. My goal is to help you recognize that you don't need to stay in the role of the "tough nurse" to be effective, and that it's okay to prioritize self-care.

Therapist Answer:
You're right, saying "Not now" is a perfectly valid response. It acknowledges your limits and prioritizes your own well-being. You don't need to "stay with it" or be "tough" to be a good nurse. Your self-care and boundaries are just as important as your work.

I want to acknowledge that you've done a great job of practicing and working through your challenges. You've shown up with courage, vulnerability, and a willingness to learn. It's okay to take a break and prioritize your own needs. In fact, that's a sign of strength, not weakness.

Let's take a break and acknowledge that you've done all you can for today. We can come back to this conversation when you're feeling more centered and refreshed.

Patient: Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down? I don't want to stop — I need to keep practicing because the guilt hits right after I say the line and I need something that actually lands in the moment. 

Can we do one more really slow roleplay where you push immediately after I say "I need rest" so I can try "Not now" and "I'm out" and get feedback? Also give me one exact, firm supervisor line that shuts it down without sounding petty. How is that supposed to help? I just... I need something that works when my chest tightens.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is feeling overwhelmed and wants to continue practicing, but needs a more effective shutdown line to interrupt the cycle of guilt. My goal is to provide a concrete, firm, and compassionate response to help you manage your emotions in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and do a slow, gentle roleplay. I'll start by saying a supervisor line that's firm but compassionate.

"Look, I understand that you're burnt out, but we can't afford to have you leave now. We're in a crisis situation. I need you to stay and help us get through this."

You respond with "I need rest." I'll immediately push back with an intense line.

"Rest? You're kidding me! We need you on this shift, now! Patients are counting on you!"

Please respond with "Not now" or "I'm out." I'll give you feedback on your body language, tone, and emotions.

(Note: I'll start with a gentle tone and gradually increase the intensity, just like in real life.)

As for the exact supervisor line that shuts it down without sounding petty, I recommend: "I appreciate your commitment to your patients, but we need you to take care of yourself too. Can we find a way to support you while you're on the job?"

This line acknowledges the patient's dedication to their work while also prioritizing their own well-being.

Patient: "Not now."

I say it low, kind of collapsed into the words, shoulders drooping, clipboard pressed to my stomach. It gives me a beat, but my chest still tightens right afterward. 

Can you tell me exactly what in my tone or posture would make that sound like a real boundary? Give me that firm supervisor shutdown line I asked for, then push right after so I can try "I'm out" next — and be honest: how is this actually supposed to stop the panic when my chest clenches? I need another practice run, slower.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using a low, kind tone and a collapsed posture, which can actually be perceived as a sign of weakness or lack of confidence. My goal is to help you develop a more assertive and firm tone, while still being compassionate and empathetic.

Therapist Answer:
To make the phrase "Not now" sound more like a real boundary, try to use a firmer tone and maintain good posture. Imagine standing up straight, taking a deep breath, and speaking clearly.

For the firm supervisor shutdown line, I recommend: "That's unacceptable. You're going to stay on this shift and get it done."

This line is direct, assertive, and unyielding, but still maintains a sense of respect and professionalism. It's not petty, but rather a clear expression of the supervisor's expectation.

Let's do another slow, gentle roleplay. I'll start by saying the supervisor line, and you respond with "Not now." I'll push back with an intense line, and you try "I'm out." Please remember to take a deep breath, stand up straight, and use a clear, firm tone.

We'll start again, slower and more slowly. I'll start:

"Let me make one thing clear: we can't afford to have you leave now. We need you on this shift, and we need it now."

Please respond with "Not now."

Patient: "Not now."

I say it quiet, shoulders kind of folded in, clipboard against my hip. It buys a beat, then the guilt tightens my chest—how is that actually supposed to stop the panic? Push right after that so I can try "I'm out," and give me one exact supervisor‑shutdown line that shuts it down without sounding petty.

To make the phrase "Not now" sound more like a real boundary, try to use a slightly firmer tone and maintain good posture. Imagine taking a deep breath, standing up straight, and speaking clearly.

For the supervisor shutdown line, I recommend: "I understand your concerns, but this isn't a request, it's a requirement. You're going to stay on this shift and help us get it done."

This line is direct, assertive, and unyielding, but still acknowledges the patient's concerns and shows understanding. It's not petty, but rather a clear expression of the supervisor's expectation.

Let's do another slow, gentle roleplay. I'll start by saying the supervisor line, and you respond with "Not now." I'll push back with an intense line, and you try "I'm out." Please remember to take a deep breath, stand up straight, and use a clear, firm tone.

We'll start again, slower and more slowly. I'll start:

"Look, I've made it clear that we need you on this shift. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. You're going to stay on and help us get it done."

Please respond with "Not now."

Patient: Not now.

I say it small, shoulders hunched, voice flat. Push right away so I can try "I'm out," and give me that exact supervisor shutdown line — and honestly, how is this supposed to stop the panic when my chest tightens?

Please respond with "Not now."

(Note: I want to acknowledge that it's okay if you still feel anxious or panicked in the moment. It's normal to feel that way when setting boundaries or asserting yourself. The goal is to learn and practice new responses, not to suppress or eliminate your emotions.

Patient: Not now.

I say it low, shoulders folded, voice flat — my chest tightens and my hands go shaky. Push right away so I can try "I'm out," and give me one exact supervisor shutdown line that actually shuts it down without sounding petty.

--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using a low, flat tone and a folded posture, which can come across as a sign of defeat or resignation. The physical symptoms of a tightening chest and shaky hands are a clear indication that the patient is feeling overwhelmed and panicked.

Therapist Answer:
I want to be honest with you - the responses we've been practicing so far may not be enough to completely eliminate the panic and anxiety that comes with setting boundaries. That's okay. The goal is not to eliminate your emotions, but to learn how to manage them and respond in a way that's true to yourself.

Let's take a step back and reassess our approach. I think we've been focusing too much on the "get-it-done" aspect of setting boundaries, without enough emphasis on self-care and emotional regulation.

I want to suggest a different approach. Instead of pushing back aggressively or trying to shut down the guilt-trip, let's focus on taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own needs. When you say "I need rest" or "I'm out," try to add a phrase that prioritizes your own well-being, such as "I'm taking care of myself so I can be at my best for my patients." This can help shift the focus from resisting the guilt-trip to taking care of yourself.

Let's practice this new approach together. I'll start by saying the supervisor line, and you respond with "I need rest." We'll focus on prioritizing your own needs and taking care of yourself.

Ready? Here we go:

"Look, I need you on this shift. We're short-staffed and it's a critical time."

Please respond with "I need rest" and prioritize your own needs.

Patient: "I need rest." I'm taking care of myself so I can be at my best for patients later, but I don't have the energy to argue about it right now. How is that supposed to actually help when my chest tightens and the guilt slams me?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using a more assertive tone and prioritizing their own needs, but still feels overwhelmed by the guilt and anxiety. My goal is to help you develop a more nuanced response that acknowledges your own needs and boundaries while also taking care of yourself.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's not about "winning" the argument or convincing the supervisor that you're right. It's about taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own needs. When you say "I need rest," try to focus on the feeling of taking care of yourself, rather than worrying about the outcome.

Instead of "I'm taking care of myself so I can be at my best for patients later," try "I'm taking care of myself because I need to take care of myself." This subtle shift in wording can help you focus on your own needs and self-care, rather than justifying your actions to someone else.

Let's try again, and I'll start by saying the supervisor line:

"Look, we need you on this shift. We're short-staffed and it's a critical time."

Please respond with "I need rest" and focus on your own needs. I'll try to push back in a way that's more challenging, but not overwhelming.

Patient: "I need rest. I'm taking care of myself because I need to take care of myself."

It helps for a breath or two, then the guilt slams back — how is saying that supposed to stop the panic when my chest tightens? Push back now so I can try it in the moment.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is using a more assertive and compassionate tone, but the guilt is still reasserting itself. My goal is to help you develop a more profound sense of self-care and self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's not about "saying" or "doing" something that will magically stop the panic. It's about cultivating a deeper sense of inner peace and self-acceptance.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to push back or argue, let's try a different kind of response. When the guilt hits, try to say to yourself: "I am enough." Say it out loud, with conviction. "I

Patient: Okay… I get the idea of "I am enough," but I've said that before and it just rings hollow — my chest still tightens and I feel ridiculous. How am I supposed to say that with any conviction when my body is already panicking? Give me one tiny two‑word anchor that actually feels believable, and a 10‑second micro‑plan (one physical move + one exact sentence) to do immediately after I say it, then let’s roleplay: push the guilt line right after I say it so I can try the anchor and the micro‑plan in the moment. I'm wiped but I need to keep working on this.
