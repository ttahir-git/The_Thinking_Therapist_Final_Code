Patient: Hi, I keep getting stuck berating myself over every perceived failure — I see one tiny mistake and my brain says I'll lose my friends, blow any chance at romance, and end up alone and broke for good. My past relationships were rough and I keep replaying them, convinced any new one will implode and leave me ruined. I know people tell me that's unlikely, but my mind goes straight to the worst and I can't seem to stop it.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough pattern to break, and it's understandable that past experiences can be really painful. What's one thing about having a new connection or pursuing your relationships that feels truly important to you, like something that would make the risk worthwhile to you, even if there's a chance of failure?

Patient: What I'd really want is someone who actually sees me — someone to share the little stuff with so I don't feel invisible anymore. But the minute I imagine that, my brain jumps to them getting bored, leaving me, and then I'm even lonelier and more ashamed, like proof I'm a failure. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't stop picturing that exact ending.

Therapist: It sounds like feeling invisible is a really painful experience for you, and it's understandable that you'd want someone to see and appreciate you. Can you try to imagine what it would be like if you didn't have that fear of being rejected or bored? What would you be doing instead, if you weren't worried about the worst-case scenario?

Patient: If I wasn't so scared, I'd try small things — join a group, say yes to a coffee, actually tell someone how I feel for once. But the instant I picture that, my brain says I'll say the wrong thing, they'll quietly pull away, gossip will start, and that will spill into every other part of my life until I'm totally alone and can't even keep a job or pay bills. I know that sounds extreme, but that's the story my mind insists will definitely happen; other endings just don't feel real.

Therapist: So the story your mind is spinning seems pretty vivid. Can you acknowledge that it's a story, and not necessarily a prediction of what will definitely happen? Is there a small part of you that's willing to entertain the possibility that maybe, just maybe, things could go differently?

Patient: I guess I can call it a story — there's a tiny part that knows it's not a guaranteed future — but the rest of me is yelling that it's real and already happening. Even when that small part whispers "maybe," my brain drowns it out with the loud, detailed disaster plot, so the hopeful bit feels useless and childish. It just seems impossible to actually believe anything other than the worst.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the story and admit that there's a glimmer of hope. Can you try to lean into that tiny voice that whispers "maybe" and see if you can imagine what it would be like to be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to be in the unknown?

Patient: I want to — I can hear that tiny voice saying maybe it's okay to try and be kinder to myself. But the instant I do, my head starts narrating the worst: I'll say something awkward, they'll pull away and gossip, I'll lose friends, my unemployment will make it impossible to bounce back, I'll be evicted, and I'll be utterly alone — it feels inevitable. I know that "maybe" should matter, but right now it just feels childish and I'm getting tired of living inside that story.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really exhausted by the story and the constant self-narration. Can you try to pause for just a brief moment and acknowledge the feeling of being tired of living in this narrative, without judgment? What's one small action you could take right now, just for a breath, to move away from this story and create some space?

Patient: Okay, I'll try a pause. I can step outside for five minutes and take slow breaths or make a cup of tea—something tiny to break the loop. But even as I do it, my brain's already predicting I'll look ridiculous if anyone sees me, they'll gossip, and that'll kick off the whole spiral back to being alone, so it feels like the pause won't actually matter.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to take that pause and try to break the cycle. Can you try to hold the thought that your current state of being "uncool" or "judged" isn't a reflection of your worth as a person, and that you're doing this tiny action (taking a break) for your own benefit, not to impress anyone else?

Patient: I can try to tell myself that being "uncool" doesn't equal my worth and that I'm making tea just for me. But the moment I let that thought in, my brain paints the whole chain — say something dumb, people gossip, I lose friends, can't find work, get evicted, end up completely alone — and it feels like proof that being kind to myself is pointless. I'm trying to hold the pause, but I'm so tired of the catastrophe story feeling louder than anything calm.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of that catastrophic story. Can you try to create a tiny gap between your thoughts, and notice the sound of your breath as you're standing there, or the sensation of the tea in your cup, without judgment? What if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts, you simply allowed the pause to be what it is – a small, present-moment experience, without any agenda?

Patient: I tried to notice my breath and the tea — for a few seconds it was actually kind of okay, like the noise in my head softened. But then the disaster tape kicked back in: they'll notice me being awkward, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends I have, I won't be able to find work, get evicted, and end up utterly alone — it all feels inevitable. I'm exhausted by how loud that story is, and part of me thinks the pause won't matter, but another tiny part liked the quiet. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the story again. Before we try to tackle that, can you take a tiny step back and acknowledge to yourself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed? That it's a normal part of the process, and that you're doing the best you can with what you have right now?

Patient: Okay — I can say it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and I am doing the best I can right now, I guess. But the moment I let that in, my brain screams that showing I'm overwhelmed will make people see me as weak, they'll pull away and gossip, that'll cost me the few friends and any job leads I might have, and I'll end up alone and even homeless — I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't shut that tape off. I'm really tired of this story; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a pause again, but this time, I want you to do something small that feels gentle with yourself. Would you be willing to say to yourself, "I'm allowing myself to feel overwhelmed right now, and that's okay" – without adding any judgment or trying to change the thought?

Patient: Okay — I'm allowing myself to feel overwhelmed right now, and that's okay. But the instant I say that, my head screams they'll think I'm weak, they'll pull away and gossip, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and be completely alone — other endings don't feel real. I'm trying to hold the pause but I'm getting tired; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Before we try to "turn the corner" on this narrative, can you try to acknowledge to yourself that it's okay to not be okay right now? That it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that it's okay to not have all the answers?

Patient: Okay — I can say it's okay to not be okay. But the second I let that in my brain yells they'll see me as weak, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, end up evicted and utterly alone — it feels like that'll definitely happen. I'm really worn out by this loop; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back from the story. I want you to notice the sensation of your body right now, where you're sitting, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or think about anything else?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor and the chair under me — for a few seconds the noise softened and it felt a bit grounding. But almost immediately my brain spat out the whole disaster movie: they'll see me as weak, start gossiping, I'll lose friends and job leads, get evicted, and end up completely alone — it's so loud I can't stay with the sensation. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to focus on your breath or the sensation of your body, I want you to try something even simpler. Can you allow yourself to simply exist, without judgment or trying to change anything, for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I can try to just exist for one breath. For a second it gets quieter, but my brain immediately screams they'll notice I'm fragile, start gossiping, I'll lose friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone — it feels inevitable and I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause again. I want you to look at me, and I want you to see that I'm here with you, in this moment. Can you say to yourself, "I see this person, and I am here with them"?

Patient: Okay — I can say it: "I see this person, and I am here with them." But the second I say that my mind screams they'll notice I'm needy, start gossiping, I'll lose the few friends and job leads, get evicted, and end up completely alone — I'm really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause and take a moment to acknowledge that the thoughts are still there, but they don't get to dictate the pace of our interaction. Can you allow yourself to simply be with me, in this moment, without trying to change or react to the thoughts?

Patient: I can try to be with you—there’s a tiny sliver of calm when I do, like for a breath it’s okay—but almost immediately my mind yells the whole disaster: they’ll notice I’m needy, gossip will start, I’ll lose friends and job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I want to stay here and try, but I’m really overwhelmed by how loud that story is; can we slow down?

Therapist: I want you to know that I'm not trying to "fix" you or your thoughts. I'm just here with you, in this moment. Can you try to be with me, not the thoughts? Notice the sensation of my presence, the sound of our breathing, the space between us?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help me? When I try to be with someone else, my brain just flips on the worst movie: they'll notice I'm needy, gossip will start, I'll lose friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone, so I can't really hear you over that noise. I'm confused and overwhelmed by it all; can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm here to support you, and I'm not expecting you to "fix" anything. Can we try something even simpler? Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Notice the feeling of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how does focusing on my feet help with all this? I can feel the floor for a second, but then my brain launches the whole disaster movie: they'll notice I'm needy, gossip will start, I'll lose friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I'm confused and overwhelmed by it all; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something that might feel a bit counterintuitive. Can you try to say the following to yourself, with a completely neutral tone: "I am having a hard time being here right now."

Patient: Okay — I can say it: "I am having a hard time being here right now." But the moment I say that my brain screams they'll see me as weak, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone — other endings just don't feel real. I'm jittery and distracted and that catastrophe tape is so loud; can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not trying to make you feel any way, I'm just here to bear witness to your experience. Can you try to observe your body right now, without judgment or trying to change anything? Notice the sensations in your body, the way you're sitting, the way your hands are holding the cup? Can you simply observe this moment, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my body supposed to help? I can feel my hands tight around the cup and my feet on the floor for a beat, and it does calm me a little, but then the disaster tape kicks in: they'll notice I'm needy, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I'm jittery and distracted and can't hold the sensation long—can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not trying to make you calm down or distract you from your thoughts. I just want to help you notice that your body is trying to tell you something. Can you try to notice what's happening in your body right now, without trying to change it or fight it? What is happening in your body, exactly?

Patient: My chest feels tight, like there's a knot under my sternum, my jaw's clenched, palms sweaty, breath shallow, and my legs won't stop wanting to move — I'm jittery and distracted. I can notice that for a second, but then my brain turns it into proof: people will see I'm fragile, gossip will start, I'll lose friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I'm not sure I follow how noticing this helps — I'm overwhelmed and can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to use this information to change your thoughts or feelings. I just want you to acknowledge that you're noticing these physical sensations, without trying to make sense of them or try to change them. Can you simply observe the sensations in your body, without labeling them or trying to understand what they mean?

Patient: My chest's tight like a knot, my jaw's clenched, palms sweaty, breath shallow, and my legs keep wanting to move — I can feel all that, but I'm not sure I follow how noticing it helps. The second I notice, my brain screams that people will see I'm fragile, gossip will start, I'll lose friends and job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone — I'm jittery and distracted and can't hold this for long; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or label it? Simply observe the sensation of the breath, without adding anything else.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice the air; for one slow breath I can feel it cool in my nose and warm as it leaves, and it quiets the noise for a second. But then my chest tightens and the disaster tape kicks in: they'll see I'm fragile, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I'm jittery and distracted and it's hard to stay with the breath — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, right now. That's already a kind and compassionate act. Can you try to offer yourself kindness and understanding, not just for your thoughts, but for the fact that you're showing up and trying to work with me?

Patient: I can try to say something like, "I'm doing the best I can right now," but the moment I let that in my brain screams they'll see me as weak and needy, it'll confirm I'm unlovable like my past relationships felt, gossip will start, I'll lose friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up totally alone. I'm exhausted by how loud that disaster tape is and I'm jittery and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to pause for a moment. Can you look at me, and see that I'm here with you, without judgment? Can you hold onto that simple fact for just one second?

Patient: I can try — for a beat I can see you're here and it actually lands a little, but then my brain yells that they'll notice I'm needy, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone. I'm jittery and distracted and I don't know how to keep holding that simple fact; can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to help you find a way to hold onto that simple fact, without getting caught up in the other thoughts. Can you try to say to yourself, "I am seeing the therapist, and I am seeing them now," without adding any other words or thoughts?

Patient: Okay — "I am seeing the therapist, and I am seeing them now." But the second I say that my brain launches the disaster movie: they'll think I'm needy, start whispering, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, my unemployment will spiral, I'll get evicted and end up utterly alone — other endings don't feel real. I'm jittery and distracted and it's getting hard to even hold that sentence; can we slow down?

Therapist: I want to take a step back. Can you try to notice the sensation of your body sitting in the chair, without trying to change it or think about anything else? Just notice the sensation of your body being present in this space, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to notice it. I can feel my hips pressing into the chair, my shoulders tight, feet flat but wanting to fidget, and my hands kind of curled in my lap. But as soon as I tune in my brain starts the disaster tape — they'll see me as fragile, gossip will start, I'll lose the few friends and any job leads, get evicted, and end up utterly alone — it's drowning out the moment and I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?
