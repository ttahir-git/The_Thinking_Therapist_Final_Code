Patient: I've been having this intense anxiety in social settings, so I keep avoiding gatherings with friends even though my partner's really supportive. It feels tied up with the grief and this empty-nest stuff while I'm trying to be a student again, and it's just overwhelming. Honestly, I'm skeptical—how is talking about it supposed to help? I've tried things before and they didn't work.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how you're feeling. What's one specific social situation that triggers your anxiety the most, and what's the first thing that goes through your mind when you're in that situation?

Patient: Mostly it's small dinner parties or get-togethers at a friend's house — the kinds where conversations move fast and there are a lot of little inside jokes. The first thing that hits me is, "They'll notice I'm awkward, I'll say the wrong thing or start crying," and my chest goes tight and I start scanning for an escape. I don't know — how is talking about that supposed to help? I've already run those scenarios a thousand times and it doesn't change the feeling.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being judged or feeling awkward is really tied up with the value of being liked and accepted by others. Can you think of a time when you felt fully accepted and valued in a social situation – what made that feel so good, and is that something you'd be willing to take a small step towards in a dinner party scenario?

Patient: Yeah — I can think of once at a small book club meeting where someone actually asked me what I thought and waited while I answered; I felt listened to and not rushed, and it was...nice. But how is that supposed to help with a loud dinner where jokes fly and I can barely get a word in? I guess I could try a tiny step — like staying for 20–30 minutes and preparing one short comment ahead of time — but I've tried little experiments before and they usually just leave me drained.

Therapist: That's a great attempt to take a tiny step – staying for 20-30 minutes and preparing a short comment. But how about we explore whether this approach might be more exhausting than helpful? What's the worst that would happen if you couldn't think of something to say, or if you did say something and it fell flat?

Patient: Worst-case is they notice I'm awkward, someone makes a joke at my expense or just drifts away and I end up humiliated or crying — then I leave early and replay it for days. I worry it would feel like proof I don't belong anymore, especially with the whole empty-nest/grief thing on top of being back in school. But seriously, how is imagining the worst supposed to help? I've run these scenarios a thousand times and it doesn't change the panic.

Therapist: I understand your skepticism about imagining worst-case scenarios. Can we try a different approach? Instead of imagining the worst, what if you focus on cultivating a sense of kindness and compassion towards yourself, like you would towards a friend in a similar situation? What if, instead of being "awkward," you were simply "new" and "learning" – would that change how you feel about approaching that dinner party?

Patient: I try telling myself kind things, but it mostly feels hollow when my heart's racing — being "new" doesn't stop the panic. How is that supposed to help differently than the pep talks I've already done? I could try a short compassionate phrase to use when I start to spiral, like "it's okay, I'm learning," but I'm not convinced it'll actually stick.

Therapist: Those phrases can be helpful, but they might not be as immediate or effective as you'd like. Can you try noticing the physical sensations in your body when you start to feel anxious, like your heart racing or chest tightening – and then pause before responding or reacting? Simply acknowledging that sensation, without trying to change it, might create some space from the overwhelming feeling.

Patient: Okay — when it starts my chest tightens, my hands go cold, and my mind immediately scans exits while my breathing gets shallow. I can try pausing and quietly naming those sensations — "tight chest, racing heart" — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from bolting? If we're doing an experiment, I'll commit to that one tiny step: name the sensations and take one slow breath, and we'll see if it helps.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try the experiment. As you pause and name the sensations, can you connect those feelings to the value of being able to be present and care for yourself in social situations, even if it's just for a few minutes? What would it mean to you to be able to stay with those sensations, rather than trying to escape or react to them?

Patient: Maybe if I could actually stay with the sensations it would mean I can tolerate the discomfort instead of being hijacked by it — like proving to myself I don't always have to run away, which would feel...small but important with the empty-nest grief and school stress. But it also feels terrifying, like being trapped in the panic instead of escaping it. How is that supposed to help when staying has left me wiped out before? I'll try naming the sensations and that one slow breath, though I'm not convinced it'll stick.

Therapist: Let's try to find a small, concrete step that builds on the tiny experiment we've started. Instead of focusing on staying with the sensations for a long time, can you try staying for just one more minute after the initial panic passes – and then, if needed, taking a brief pause to name the sensations before responding?

Patient: Alright — I can try staying one more minute after the initial panic and then pausing to name the sensations before I respond, but I'm skeptical it'll just feel like dragging out the torture and leave me depleted. How is that supposed to build any real confidence when I've done tiny experiments before that fizzled? I'll try it at the next small gathering, and if it doesn't help we need to be practical about what to do next because I can't keep getting wiped out by these attempts.

Therapist: I understand your skepticism. When you do try the new approach at the next gathering, instead of focusing on whether it "works" or not, what if you focus on simply showing up – just being present in the moment, and responding in a way that feels authentic and kind to yourself? We can explore ways to make that a more concrete goal after we try it out.

Patient: Okay... I can try showing up and being present for a few minutes, but it sounds vague and honestly draining — how is that supposed to help when showing up usually just wipes me out? I'll give it a shot at the next thing, but I'm not convinced it'll make a difference.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and reframe your goal. Instead of trying to "help" or "change" your anxiety, what if you simply allowed yourself to be willing to show up and experience the uncertainty of the situation, without judgment or expectation? What if you were to approach it with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I can...try to be willing to show up and not control everything, but saying "curiosity" feels almost ridiculous when my chest's already tight and my mind's panicking. How is being open supposed to help when all I want is to get out of there? I'll aim for willingness, but I'm really on edge about how that'll actually change anything.

Therapist: Let's try to gently detach from the idea that you need to be "open" or "curious" in order to feel willing. What if you simply acknowledge the sensation of tension and the desire to escape, without trying to label it or change it? Can you allow yourself to be present with that feeling, without judgment, and simply see what happens?

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice the tension and the urge to leave without trying to fix it, but my chest's already tight and my head's scattered so it's hard to stay with anything. How is that supposed to help when noticing hasn't stopped me from bolting before? I'll try it at the next thing, but I don't have much energy for more experiments that just wear me down.

Therapist: Let's try a low-stakes mindfulness exercise. Instead of trying to change or notice your anxiety, can you simply pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Can you focus on the sensation of each breath, without trying to control it or change it?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Feet on the floor — it's steady, a little cool under my shoes. Breath is shallow and jerky when I pay attention, and my chest tightens more when I try to notice it, so honestly — how is that supposed to stop me from panicking? I'll do a few quiet breaths and notice them, but I'm already worn out and I need something that actually feels like it will help, not just another experiment.

Therapist: Let's try to ground yourself in a small, tangible action that feels more immediate and potentially helpful. Instead of focusing on your breath or body sensations, can you simply focus on taking one small step towards the gathering, like getting out of the house and driving there? What would that feel like, and what might you hope to achieve by doing that?

Patient: Getting out of the house feels like climbing a cliff — even just walking to the car makes my chest tighten and my head go fuzzy. Maybe if I force myself to drive there and park for ten minutes, it could prove I can tolerate it without having to stay the whole time, but honestly I can already imagine just sitting in the car and turning around. How is getting to the doorstep supposed to change what happens once I'm inside and the panic starts? I'll try the parking-for-10-minutes plan at the next event, but I'm not sold it'll help and I'm already worn thin thinking about it.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and ask: what's the worst that could happen if you don't get out of the house and attend the gathering? What would be the most catastrophic outcome, and how likely is that to happen? Can you consider that your anxiety might be blowing things out of proportion?

Patient: Mostly it's internal — I skip it, feel like I've failed myself, my friends drift a bit, my partner gets worried, and the loneliness just deepens. It's not catastrophic in a big-picture way, probably more likely that nothing awful happens, but my body's convinced it's life-or-death. How is breaking down the probabilities supposed to stop the panic? I'll try the parking-for-10-minutes plan, but I'm already worn out thinking about it.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the potential outcomes of attending or not attending, can you simply focus on what's happening right now, in this moment? Can you bring your attention to your breath, your body, or your surroundings without judgment?

Patient: Okay... my breath's shallow, chest tight, feet feel heavy on the floor, and the hum of the heater is louder than I expected. My mind keeps skittering to the exit and to all the ways this could go badly — how is paying attention to that supposed to help when it just makes it louder? I'll try to rest my attention on my feet and take one slow breath, but I don't have much energy for more exercises that leave me wiped out.

Therapist: Let's try something that doesn't require sustained attention or energy. Can you simply get up from the chair and take one small step towards the door – just a tiny step, without thinking about what's on the other side?

Patient: Okay... I can try one small step, but my legs feel like lead and my chest's already tight. How is taking one step supposed to change the rest of it? Fine — I'm going to stand and put one foot toward the door, but I'm not promising I won't sit back down.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to take that small step towards the gathering and stay for just 5-10 minutes, without feeling like you're going to collapse or escape? What would that feel like, and what values would you be connecting to by doing that?

Patient: I guess if I could do that it would feel like tiny proof I can tolerate the discomfort instead of always running — a small reclaiming of myself after the empty-nest stuff. It would feel shaky and barely enough, but relieving if I could leave on my own terms, and it connects to values like staying connected, being present for my partner, and not letting school/friendship slip away. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? I'm already worn out thinking about it and worried these little wins won't stick.

Therapist: Let's not focus on the long-term benefits just yet. Can you commit to showing up to the next gathering, not with the expectation of success or perfection, but simply because it's a small, consistent step towards your values – and if it feels too hard, you can always leave early if needed?

Patient: Alright... I can try to commit to showing up and giving myself the option to leave early if it gets too much, but I'm already wiped thinking about it and it feels like dragging myself through mud. How is this supposed to help when my past attempts just left me drained and frustrated? I'll go, but I don't have high hopes—and I'm nervous about how I'll feel while I'm there.

Therapist: Let's focus on what you can control right now – the act of showing up. What would it take for you to start feeling a sense of curiosity or interest about the gathering, rather than dread? Can you approach the experience with a sense of "I'm here, and I'll see what happens"?

Patient: I can't just flip a switch to curiosity — when my chest tightens it's like my brain goes on autopilot to get out. Maybe if I have concrete things to control — go with my partner, plan to stay 10–15 minutes, sit near an exit, have one simple question or comment prepared to ask someone — then "I'll see what happens" doesn't feel so vague. I'll try that, but I'm already worn out thinking about it, and honestly, how is all this supposed to help in the long run?

Therapist: Let's try to find a middle ground. Instead of having a rigid plan, what if you simply aim to show up with a willingness to be present, and see where the experience takes you? You can still prepare a question or comment, but approach it with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than a specific outcome in mind. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay... I can try to go with willingness, bring one question, sit near an exit, and plan to stay 10–15 minutes. But honestly, I don't know how "curiosity" is supposed to kick in when my chest's already tight — I'm on edge just thinking about it, and I'm worried it'll just leave me drained. I'll do it, but if it doesn't help we need a better plan because I can't keep getting wiped out by these experiments.

Therapist: Let's focus on taking the action, rather than relying on curiosity. What's one thing you can do right now, in this moment, to take small steps towards showing up and being present? Can you simply get up, put on your coat, and head out the door, without thinking too much about what might happen?

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I'm going to stand, put my coat on, and walk to the front door, but my chest's tight and I feel wiped out—how is that supposed to help more than sitting here? I'll move toward the door now, but I can't promise I won't come right back.

Therapist: You're doing the best you can, and that's something to acknowledge and be kind to. You've taken a small step towards showing up, and that takes courage. Let's not worry about whether it was "successful" or not. Can you simply acknowledge the physical sensation of your feet moving towards the door, and the sound of the wind outside?

Patient: Okay... my feet feel heavy, like I'm dragging them, and there's a cool draft under the door when I lift my foot. I can hear the wind—it's sharp and my chest tightens more when I notice it. I can try to stay with that for a few breaths, but honestly, how is paying attention to the wind and my feet supposed to stop me from wanting to run?

Therapist: You're not trying to control the outcome, but simply noticing the sensations in your body and surroundings. What if, instead of trying to control your breathing or thoughts, you simply allowed yourself to be with the sensations, without judgment or trying to change them? Can you try to notice the sensation of the wind and your feet without trying to label it or respond to it?

Patient: I can try... the wind feels sharp on my face and my foot's stalled on the threshold. When I try not to label it the tightness just gets louder—how is simply noticing supposed to stop me from bolting? I'll hold it for a few breaths, but I'm already shaky and drained.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that you're feeling shaky and drained. That's okay. What's the sensation of your body and breath right now, without trying to change or label it? Can you simply allow yourself to be with that sensation, without judgment or trying to respond to it?

Patient: My breath's shallow, chest tight, shoulders hunched, and my stomach's in a knot — my head's fuzzy and everything feels heavy. I can try to just be with that for a few breaths, but honestly it usually just makes the panic louder — how is sitting with it supposed to help when it feels like being trapped? I'll stay with it for a bit and see, but I'm already worn out.

Therapist: You've been sitting with your anxiety for a few breaths, and it's not feeling like it's changing much. Can you give yourself permission to move, not to escape or avoid, but simply to release the tension in your body? You can get up and walk away from the door, or take a few more steps back into the safety of your home. What would that feel like?

Patient: I'd probably step back inside — a small rush of relief, like the tightness loosens a bit, but then there's this hollow guilt, like I bailed and proved my worst fear. It would feel safe and exhausted at the same time, like I used up all my energy just to get away. How is retreating supposed to help beyond that tiny relief? I don't know — I just feel worn out and stuck.

Therapist: Let's explore this feeling of guilt and relief together. What is it about retreating that feels like it's perpetuating the cycle of anxiety? Is it the feeling of failing yourself or your partner? Can you try to see that this feeling is not a reflection of your worth or ability, but rather a complex emotional response to a difficult situation?

Patient: Retreating gives this tiny relief and then slams home that I couldn’t handle it — like it proves I’m not fit for those spaces anymore, which makes me pull back even more. My partner looks worried and I feel guilty, and that just layers onto the empty‑nest loneliness, so I end up avoiding more things. I get the idea that it’s not about my worth, and that avoiding keeps me from getting disconfirming evidence, but how is thinking that supposed to stop my heart from racing right now? I'm worn thin just going over it.
