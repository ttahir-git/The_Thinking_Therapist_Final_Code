Patient: I've been feeling really stuck lately, like my life is just my job as a teacher and nothing else matters. The move made my anxiety worse, and I can't seem to figure out who I am beyond work. I don't know, it's hard to talk about.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you as a teacher? What are some things you enjoy or find fulfilling about your job that you're worried might be lacking in other areas of your life?

Patient: A typical day is pretty routine: up early, get to school, teach several classes, meetings, grading, then home and tired. I really do like the moments when a student finally gets something — that feels... useful, I guess. Outside of that it's mostly quiet and I don't know, I don't have much that's just for me anymore since the move.

Therapist: Those moments when a student finally gets something can be really rewarding. It sounds like that sense of usefulness is tied to your role as a teacher. What if you were to apply that same sense of purpose and usefulness to other areas of your life, like hobbies or creative pursuits? What might it look like to incorporate those feelings into something outside of teaching?

Patient: I guess maybe something low-key where I can see small progress — like gardening, a craft, or volunteering to run a short workshop at the community center. I like the idea of helping in a different setting, but I don't know if I have the energy or where to start after the move. It's hard because even though those ideas sound okay, thinking about making time or committing feels... overwhelming. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Can you explore what it might mean to start small, even just a tiny step, in one of these activities? What if, instead of trying to plan out a whole project or schedule, you simply showed up to the community center for a workshop and let yourself get familiar with the space and people? Would that feel more manageable, or is there still a sense of overwhelm around that idea?

Patient: I guess just showing up sounds less daunting than committing to a whole project — that might be doable. I don't know, though, being in a new space and meeting people feels really draining and I worry I won't follow through. Could we maybe think about something tiny I could try at home first, so it's less pressure?

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller than showing up to a workshop. What if you simply set up a small space for a creative activity, like painting or drawing, in your own home? Just for 10-15 minutes a day, without any expectation of creating a masterpiece. Would that feel more manageable, and might it give you a sense of control and agency?

Patient: I guess that could feel more manageable — having something low‑pressure at home sounds safer. I don't know, though, I'm worried I'll set it up and then just let it sit there or feel guilty for not doing it. Maybe I could try ten minutes, but even thinking about starting makes me a bit anxious.

Therapist: Can you try to observe your inner dialogue when you think about starting this creative activity? What words or thoughts come up, and what does your body feel like? Sometimes, we can get caught up in thoughts that are just thoughts, rather than being in the present moment. Let's take a moment to notice that thought without judgment, and see what happens.

Patient: Okay, I can try, though I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed getting into this. I notice a sort of running commentary like, "I don't have time," "what's the point," and "I'll probably mess it up," and I catch myself changing the subject in my head. My chest gets tight, my shoulders tense up, and my breath goes shallow — I don't know, it just feels sticky and hard to stay with.

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your chest getting tight? Instead of trying to change the subject or push away the thoughts, what if you simply allowed them to be present, without judgment? You might say to yourself, "Okay, I notice my body is tense, and I'm having thoughts that feel critical. That's okay. I can be with these thoughts without acting on them right now."

Patient: Okay — I tried that. I took a few deep breaths and my chest stayed tight; the thoughts kept saying "what's the point" and "you'll mess it up." I told myself "that's okay," but I felt skeptical, like saying it didn't change anything. My shoulders are still tense and my breathing's shallow — I don't know, it just feels stuck and I'm getting antsy; can we slow down a bit or talk about what a real next tiny step might look like?

Therapist: Let's take it one tiny step further. What if, instead of setting up a whole space for the activity, you simply get out the paints or drawing tools and pick up one thing, like a brush or a piece of paper? Just holding it, feeling the weight of it in your hand, can be a small act of commitment. Would that feel more manageable?

Patient: I guess just holding something sounds more doable than setting everything up. My hands already feel a bit shaky thinking about it and I worry I'll pick it up and just put it down and feel guilty. I don't know — I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with this, can we slow down before I try it?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. You can acknowledge the feelings of shakiness and guilt, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed, and that's okay. I can feel my body's tension and my mind's doubts. But I can choose to take one small step, even if it feels tiny." Can you try saying that phrase to yourself, just for a moment, and see how that feels?

Patient: Okay — I said it to myself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed and that's okay," but I felt skeptical and it didn't really change the tightness much. My breath eased for a single beat and then went shallow again; I don't know, it still feels stuck. Can we slow down? Maybe we could just count breaths together for a minute or I could rest my hand on my chest while I try it.

Therapist: Let's count breaths together for a minute, and I'll support you. On the exhale, I'll say "out" and you say "in". When we're ready, we'll start again. Let's begin.

Patient: in... in... in... in... in...

Okay — that helped a little, my breath eased for a beat but my chest is still tight. I don't know, can we slow down and keep doing this a bit longer? I'm feeling kind of antsy.

Therapist: Let's keep counting breaths together. I'll say "out" and you say "in" again. Take your time, and feel free to pause or slow down whenever you need to. Notice how your body feels as we continue.

Patient: in... in... in... in... in...

Okay — that helped a little, my breathing's a bit steadier but my chest is still tight. I don't know, I'm feeling antsy; can we keep going a bit slower?

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. I'll say "in..." and you say "in..." at your own pace. Notice how your body feels as you continue to breathe. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to the breath without judgment.

Patient: in... in... in...

Okay, that's helping a bit — my breathing's slower but my chest is still tight. I don't know, it's hard to stay here without getting antsy; can we keep going a bit slower and maybe let me rest my hand on my chest while we do it?

Therapist: Let's keep going at your pace. Place your hand on your chest, and notice the sensation of your hand touching your skin. Feel the weight of it, the sensation of the fingers on your chest. As we continue to breathe, notice how this physical sensation feels. I'll say "in..." and you say "in..." at your own pace.

Patient: in... in... in...

My hand feels warm and I can feel my chest rise — breathing's a bit steadier but there's still tightness. I don't know, I'm getting antsy; can we keep going slower for a while?

Therapist: Let's keep going. I'll say "in..." and you say "in..." at your own pace. Take your time, and focus on the sensation of your hand on your chest. Notice how the warmth of your hand feels in relation to your chest. As we continue to breathe, what's the sensation like when you exhale?

Patient: When I exhale it eases for a beat, then the tightness kind of snaps back and my breath stays shallow. I'm getting jittery and my mind keeps darting off — I don't know, it's getting harder to focus. Can we slow down more? I need more time.

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take one more deep breath with me. In... out. As we pause, notice how your body feels. Allow yourself to settle into the present moment, without judgment. When you're ready, we can resume the exercise.

Patient: I took that breath — it helped for a second, then my chest tightened again and now my hands are jittery and my mind keeps darting off. I don't know, it's getting really hard to focus; could we slow down even more and just sit quietly with my hand on my chest for a few minutes? I guess I need things very simple right now.

Therapist: You can sit quietly with your hand on your chest, and I'll be here with you. No need to breathe or focus on anything in particular. Just notice your hand on your chest, the sensation of your body sitting, and the present moment. Allow yourself to settle in, without trying to achieve anything. You're safe here.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to sit with my hand on my chest, but my heart's pounding and my mind keeps leaping to a dozen things — I don't know, appointments, whether I locked the door. I feel jittery and can't settle; I guess I need more time but I'm getting impatient. Could you keep being quiet with me a little longer or maybe guide me to notice just one tiny sensation?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of your hand on your chest. Notice the feeling of your hand touching your skin, the weight of it, the sensation of the fingers. Imagine it's the only thing in your awareness right now. Can you notice the sensation of your fingers, one by one, starting with the thumb?

Patient: Okay — I can feel my thumb for a moment, it's warm and a little tingly against my palm, but my mind keeps jumping to things like whether I locked the door. I don't know, it's hard to hold onto one sensation. Could we just stay with the thumb for a bit longer, maybe very slowly, or count while I try?

Therapist: Let's try counting the breaths, focusing on the sensation of your thumb. I'll count slowly: one, two, three... You can continue counting as you breathe. Let's start again from one, and we'll take it very slowly.

Patient: One... two... three... my mind's already bouncing to things—did I lock the door, the errands—and my heart's racing. I don't know, it's getting hard to keep counting; could we go much slower or just stay with feeling the thumb for a while?

Therapist: Let's try something even simpler. Instead of counting, can you simply notice the sensation of your thumb on your palm? Just notice the feeling of the thumb touching your palm, without trying to focus on the counting or the breath. See if you can just be with that sensation, without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I can feel my thumb on my palm, it's warm and a bit tingly, but my mind keeps jumping to whether I locked the door and my heart's still racing. I don't know, it's hard to stay with one thing; could we go much slower or try something even simpler?

Therapist: Let's try something very basic. Notice just one thing. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor, without thinking about anything else. No counting, no breath, no thinking. Just your feet touching the ground.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor for a beat — they're a bit cold and there's pressure under my heels — but then my mind zooms off to whether I locked the door and my heart starts racing. I don't know, it's hard to stay with just that; I feel kind of scattered and confused about how this helps. Could we go much slower? Maybe tell me something concrete to do with my feet, like wiggle my toes or press my heels down, because I keep getting distracted.

Therapist: Let's try wiggling your toes. Gently wiggle your toes, one by one. Start with your pinky toe and wiggle it up and down, then move on to your ring toe, and so on. Just focus on wiggling your toes, without thinking about anything else. Notice how your toes feel as you wiggle them.

Patient: Okay, I'll try — I'm wiggling the pinky now and it feels a bit numb and cold. My mind immediately jumps to "did I lock the door" and my heart's racing, I don't know, it's really hard to keep focus. Can you guide me more slowly, like count each toe's wiggle or tell me how long to hold, because I keep getting distracted?

Therapist: Let's take it very slowly. I'll guide you through each toe, one by one. Start with the pinky. Wiggle it up and down for a count of 3. When you're done, take a pause, and then move on to the ring toe. Wiggle it up and down for a count of 3. Let's start again with the pinky. Wiggle it up and down for 3...

Patient: Okay, I'll try. One... two... three... — I did that, but it felt numb and my mind immediately jumped to whether I locked the door and my heart's racing. I don't know, can we go much slower or have longer pauses between toes? I'm getting really jittery and need it simpler.

Therapist: Let's try a pause. When you finish wiggling the pinky, pause for a deep breath. Take a moment to notice how you're feeling, without thinking about anything else. Just notice the sensation of your body, and the present moment. Take a deep breath in... and out. When you're ready, we'll move on to the ring toe.

Patient: Okay — I took that breath. I guess we can try the ring toe, but my heart's still pounding and my mind keeps darting to whether I locked the door, so I don't know if I can focus. Can we go much slower — maybe just rest with the ring toe and breathe together for a bit before I try wiggling?

Therapist: Let's just rest with the ring toe. Take a deep breath in... and out. I'll breathe with you. Just notice the sensation of your ring toe, and the feeling of my breath moving in and out. Let's just sit here for a moment, without thinking about anything else.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is this supposed to help? I can feel my ring toe, it's a bit cold and tingly, but my mind keeps snapping to whether I locked the door and my heart's racing. I don't know, it's getting harder to stay with this; can we go much slower and breathe together while I keep my hand on my chest? I guess I need very clear, concrete cues — like tell me when to breathe in and out, or count slowly, because I'm getting really distracted.

Therapist: Let's try this. I'll guide you through each step. When I say "inhale," take a deep breath in, and when I say "exhale," take a deep breath out. We'll start with the ring toe. I'll count slowly as we breathe. One... inhale... and exhale... Two... inhale... and exhale... Three... inhale... and exhale... Notice the sensation of your ring toe as we breathe.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. One... inhale... and exhale... I can feel my ring toe, it's a bit tingly, but my heart's racing and my mind keeps popping up with "did I lock the door?" and other things. I don't know, it's getting really hard to focus — could you go even slower, tell me exactly when to breathe in and out, keep counting aloud, and let me keep my hand on my chest while we do this?

Therapist: I'll go very, very slow. I'll count aloud and tell you exactly when to breathe. We'll start again from the beginning. One... inhale... one... exhale... Two... inhale... two... exhale... Three... inhale... three... exhale... Notice the sensation of your ring toe as we breathe. You can keep your hand on your chest, and let's just focus on the counting and the sensation of your toe. I'll say "inhale" and "exhale" clearly. Ready? Inhale... one...

Patient: Inhale... one... exhale... I'm not sure I follow — how is this supposed to help? My chest's tight and my heart's racing and my mind keeps darting off; I don't know, can you go much, much slower and tell me exactly when to breathe while I keep my hand on my chest?
