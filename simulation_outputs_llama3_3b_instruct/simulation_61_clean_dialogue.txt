Patient: I've been overwhelmed by sadness and a complete lack of motivation since I lost someone close, and it's really hurting my relationship. I'm a social worker, so it's embarrassing—I should know how to cope, but I keep second-guessing myself and my self-esteem is shot. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it means to you, as a social worker, to "cope" with difficult emotions like sadness and loss? What values do you think are at stake when you feel like you're not doing enough?

Patient: To me, coping means being able to manage my emotions enough to show up at work and be present for the people I care about instead of feeling like I'm underwater all the time. As a social worker, the values at stake are competence, responsibility to others, authenticity, and connection—when I can't cope I feel like I'm failing clients, my partner, and myself. It really dents my self-worth and professional identity. But I've heard the usual advice and tried it—I've tried that, it doesn't work; how is talking about values supposed to help?

Therapist: Those values you mentioned are really important to you, and it's understandable that you're looking for a more effective way to manage your emotions. Instead of trying to "cope" in a way that's been unhelpful for you, can you imagine what it would be like to approach your emotions and difficulties with a sense of curiosity and openness, like you would when working with clients?

Patient: I can sort of imagine it—like pausing and asking myself what's actually coming up instead of pushing it away. But when I try that I either shut down or just overanalyze everything and it feels like I'm minimizing the loss. How is that supposed to help when the sadness is so heavy I can barely get out of bed some days?

Therapist: Rather than trying to tackle the sadness all at once, can you think of a small, everyday action that aligns with your value of being present and authentic in your work, such as having a brief conversation with a client or taking a few deep breaths before a difficult meeting? What would it take for you to take a small step in that direction, even if it feels insignificant or uncomfortable?

Patient: I guess a tiny thing I could try is taking three slow breaths before a client meeting or sending a quick message to my partner to say I might be quiet tonight instead of shutting down. To actually do it I'd need a concrete cue—like a phone reminder or a note—and permission to be messy about it, because I'm scared it won't stick and will just prove I'm failing. But honestly, I've tried small things before and they don't always help on the really bad days—how is that supposed to help when I'm completely immobilized?

Therapist: Rather than trying to tackle the underlying emotions or problems, can you think of a way to challenge the assumption that your current strategy (trying small steps and hoping they stick) is the only way to cope with difficult days? What if, instead of trying to "overcome" your sadness, you were to allow yourself to simply be in it, without judgment, for a short period of time, say 5-10 minutes, before trying to take action?

Patient: I get the idea of sitting with it for 5–10 minutes, but when I try that I either shut down or spiral into rumination and end up feeling worse. How is just being in it supposed to not become overwhelming or feel like I'm wasting time? I might try it if there was a really simple structure—like a timer and a grounding prompt—but I'm not convinced; what would that actually look like in practice?

Therapist: I can suggest a simple technique called "5-4-3-2-1" – it's a grounding exercise that can help you focus on the present moment. Would you be willing to try it for just 2-3 minutes, with a simple prompt like "Notice 5 things you can see around you" or "Notice 4 things you can touch"? The goal isn't to do it "right" or for a certain amount of time, but simply to show up with an open and curious mindset.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it for a couple minutes, but honestly — how is focusing on 5 things supposed to help when I start spiraling? If we do this, guide me step-by-step and tell me exactly what to say/notice and what to do if I shut down or start ruminating (like set a timer and give simple prompts), otherwise it’ll just feel pointless.

Therapist: Let's try the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise with a gentle defusion prompt. I'll guide you through it. Please find a comfortable seated position, and I'll start the timer for 2 minutes.

"5-4-3-2-1": 

**Step 1 (5 things to notice):**
Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say to yourself, "I notice 5 things I can see around me." Look around the room, and notice 5 things that catch your attention. They can be as simple as a book on the shelf, a chair, or a picture on the wall. 

**Step 2 (4 things to touch):**
Take another deep breath in, and when you're ready, say, "I notice 4 things I can touch." Run your hand over the armrest, the chair, or your leg. Feel the texture, temperature, and sensation of the objects around you.

**Step 3 (2 sounds to hear):**
Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say, "I notice 2 sounds I can hear." Listen to the background noise, like the hum of the computer or the sound of your breath. Try to focus on the sound without judgment.

**Step 4 (2 sensations in your body):**
Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say, "I notice 2 sensations in my body." Pay attention to any physical sensations, like a lump in your throat, a tight muscle, or a tingling sensation. 

**Step 5 (1 thing to do):**
Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say, "I'll allow myself to be exactly as I am, without judgment, for the next 30 seconds." This is your " anchor" moment. Simply sit with the present moment, without trying to change or avoid anything.

**What to do if you shut down or start ruminating:**
If you feel like you're getting stuck or shutting

Patient: Okay, I’m ready — I’ll try it now for two minutes.

Five things I see: a chipped coffee mug, my laptop, a Post-it with a client’s name, a small plant, and a dented lamp. Four things I can touch: the sleeve of my sweater, my phone, the armrest, and the edge of the desk. Two sounds: the fridge humming and traffic outside. Two sensations: a tightness in my chest and a heaviness behind my eyes. One thing to do: I’ll allow myself to be as I am for thirty seconds.

I felt my mind starting to close in around the second step — I’m already skeptical this is doing anything. If I start to shut down or spiral, give me one simple line to say to myself and an exact thing to do next (set a 60-second timer? name the thought out loud? take three slow breaths?) — I need a clear, tiny script so this doesn’t just turn into rumination. How is that supposed to help, really?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to experiment with this technique. When you notice yourself getting caught up in ruminating thoughts, I want you to try something simple:

"Okay, I'm noticing my mind is wandering, and I'm going to acknowledge it gently: 'This thought is just a thought.'"

Say it out loud, with kindness and curiosity. Then, take a deep breath in, and do the following:

Take three slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath in your body.

This technique is not about changing your thoughts or dismissing them, but rather about acknowledging them as just thoughts, without judgment or attachment. By doing so, you're creating space for a different kind of relationship with your thoughts, one that's more accepting and less reactive.

Let's try it together. Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, say the phrase out loud, "This thought is just a thought."

Patient: "This thought is just a thought."

Okay — I said it out loud. It gave me a tiny bit of space, like the panic nudged back a hair, and the three breaths slowed my chest down a little, but the heaviness is still there and my mind bounced right back. How is that supposed to help when the weight doesn't lift? If that doesn't work, give me one single fallback line to say and one exact thing to do next (no options, no theory) — something active I can actually do in the moment so it doesn't just turn into rumination.

Therapist: If you feel like you're getting stuck, say to yourself:

"I can take a sip of water."

Take a sip of water from your glass.

Patient: Okay — I said, “I can take a sip of water,” and I actually took one. It did…narrow things a little, but then this hot shame came up and I felt stupid for needing such a tiny thing, which just made me more frustrated. How is that supposed to help when it just patches things over? Give me one exact fallback line and one single action to do next if the sip doesn't stop the spiral — no options, just one thing.

Therapist: If you feel like the shame and frustration are intensifying, say to yourself:

"I'm going to stand up and move my body."

Stand up and take a small step away from the desk or chair.

Patient: Okay — I stood up and stepped away from the chair like you said. It loosened my shoulders a little, but then this hot shame hit me and I felt stupid for needing such a tiny move. I'm not sure I follow how moving around actually helps the heaviness — how is that supposed to help? If that doesn't stop the spiral, give me one single, exact thing to do next — no options.

Therapist: Type the words "I am here" on a note or a sticky note, and then hold it in your hand.

Patient: I wrote "I am here" on a sticky and held it — and immediately felt stupid, like this tiny thing just made the shame louder. I'm confused: how is that supposed to help the heaviness instead of just reminding me I'm failing? If it doesn't stop the spiral, give me one single exact thing to do next — no options — because otherwise I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: Breathe in through your nose, and exhale completely, saying "let go" out loud.

Patient: I breathed in and said "let go" out loud. It eased my chest for a beat, then this hot shame and frustration returned and I felt ridiculous for needing something so small. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps the deep heaviness — if it doesn't stop the spiral, give me one exact fallback line to say and one exact action to do next, no options, because otherwise I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: "Okay, I'm stuck."

Say this to yourself, and then take a deep breath in, and out, without trying to add anything to it.

Patient: I said "I'm stuck" and breathed out like you said. It helped a little, but then this hot shame came back—like that one time I messed up—and I felt useless all over again, so I'm not sure I follow how that breathing actually helps. Give me one exact sentence to say to myself and one exact physical thing to do next, plain and simple, otherwise I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: "Something will work."

Sit down on the floor.

Patient: I sat down on the floor like you said — my shoulders loosened a bit, but then this hot shame rushed up and I felt that stupid, familiar sink of failure. I'm honestly confused: how is sitting on the floor supposed to help the heaviness? If it doesn't work, give me one exact sentence to say to myself and one single physical thing to do next — no options — because otherwise I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: "I am here."

Hold the sticky note with the words "I am here" in your hand.

Patient: I held the sticky note, and unsurprisingly that hot shame rushed back—like that one time I screwed up—and I felt stupid and small for needing this. I'm honestly confused: how is holding "I am here" supposed to help the heaviness instead of just reminding me I'm failing? If this doesn't stop the spiral, tell me one exact sentence to say and one single physical thing to do next, no options, because otherwise I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: Stop.

Patient: Stop? I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I'm not ready to stop; that hot shame is still roaring and I feel stuck, so give me one exact sentence to say right now and one single physical thing to do next (no options), or I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: I am here.

 Look down at your feet.

Patient: I looked down at my feet like you said. My shoulders loosened a little, but that hot shame rushed back and I'm honestly not sure I follow how this is supposed to help—it just makes me feel small and like that failure again. Give me one exact sentence to say to myself right now and one single physical thing to do next (no options), or I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: It's okay.

Patient: Okay... that helps a little, but I'm still shaky and that hot shame keeps coming back. Please give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now and one exact physical thing to do next—no options—because otherwise I feel like I'm going to shut down.

Therapist: Breathe.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in and out once. It helped a hair, but the shame's still there and I'm worn out. Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now — only one — and one exact physical thing to do next, no options, otherwise I'll probably shut down. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It's okay.

 Stop taking slow, deep breaths and simply rest your hands on your lap.

Patient: Okay... hands on my lap.  
Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now—only one—and one single physical thing to do next if it doesn't help, no options; how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: There is no need to do anything.

Patient: Okay... I hear you, but "do nothing" scares me — doing nothing usually means the shame swallows me and I shut down. How is that supposed to help? Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now and one exact physical thing to do next (only one of each), or I think I'll just shut down.

Therapist: It's okay.

Let go of your hands from the lap.

Patient: Okay... I let go of my hands. I'll say out loud: "This is hard, and I'm here." If that doesn't help, I'll press the heels of my hands together in my lap for thirty seconds. But honestly — how is that supposed to help? That hot shame keeps coming back and I just feel small and useless.

Therapist: I am here.

Press your fingers together in your lap for 30 seconds.

Patient: I pressed my fingers together for 30 seconds like you said. It loosened my shoulders a hair, then that hot shame—like that huge screw-up I keep replaying—hit me and I felt small and kind of ridiculous for needing this. I'm running out of energy to keep doing these tiny things that barely dent it.

Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now—only one—and one single physical thing to do next if it doesn't help, no options. Also... how is that actually supposed to help with this heaviness?

Therapist: It's okay.

Let your head rest on your hands.

Patient: Okay... my head's on my hands.

I’ll say out loud: "I am here, even when it's hard."

If that doesn't help, I will stand up and take two slow steps to the doorway and back.

But honestly — how is that supposed to help with this heaviness? I feel so worn out and small.

Therapist: No.

 Remain still.

Patient: I stayed still like you said, head heavy on my hands, but it didn’t make the shame go away — it just sat there, louder. Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now and one single physical thing to do next if this doesn't help — only one of each, no options — and tell me, plainly, how staying still is supposed to help with this heaviness.

Therapist: It's okay.

Let your head drop onto your hands.

Patient: Okay... I let my head drop into my hands. It loosens my shoulders a bit, then that hot shame rushes up—like that time I messed up—and I feel small and stupid for needing this. Give me one exact sentence to say out loud right now and one single physical thing to do next if this doesn't help—no options—and tell me plainly how letting my head fall into my hands is supposed to help with this heaviness.
