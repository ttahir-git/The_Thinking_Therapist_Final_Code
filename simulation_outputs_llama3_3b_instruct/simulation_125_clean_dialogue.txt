Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed by sadness since I lost my partner, and it's taken the wind out of my motivation—work and my relationship are starting to suffer. I try to keep busy as a senior data scientist, but I get distracted and avoid things I used to enjoy. I don't know, it's just been hard to figure out what to do next.

Therapist: What's one thing you value about your work as a senior data scientist that you feel like you've lost touch with since your partner's passing, or what would you like to regain if you could make some progress?

Patient: I guess I really miss the satisfaction of solving tricky problems and mentoring younger folks—seeing a model come together used to feel meaningful. I don't know, lately I can't focus long enough to get into the flow or have the patience to coach, and that bothers me.

Therapist: It seems like your avoidance is making it difficult to tap into that sense of flow and fulfillment. Can you think of a small, manageable step you could take in your work right now to make room for those values, even if it's just for a few minutes a day?

Patient: I guess I could try a single 20-minute "deep work" block each morning to focus on one small modeling task—no pressure to finish anything. I don't know if I'll actually stick to it, I get distracted, but maybe a timer and closing email will help. Or maybe just one 15-minute mentoring chat a week, something low-stakes to reconnect with that part of the job.

Therapist: That sounds like a good starting point – a 20-minute block to work on a small task or a 15-minute mentoring chat can be a gentle way to re-establish that connection. What would be the worst that could happen if you allowed yourself to get interrupted or stuck during that first 20-minute block – is it something that would significantly impact your ability to do the task or your well-being?

Patient: I guess the worst is that I get distracted, the little task doesn't get done, and I end up feeling useless like I'm failing at work and life. I don't know, that feeling could spiral into more avoidance and make the sadness worse, like I can't even trust myself to try. But practically, it's not catastrophic—deadlines might slip a bit, and I'd feel guilty, but I could probably fix it later.

Therapist: It's interesting that the potential consequences of the 20-minute block aren't catastrophic, and you can still address any fallout later. Can you try to approach this morning routine with kindness towards yourself, even if the task isn't completed – what if you simply showed up and gave it your best effort, without adding judgment?

Patient: I guess I can try to be kinder and just show up for those 20 minutes, but I don't know if I won't immediately start judging myself. Maybe I could make it less scary—coffee, close email, set a timer, and tell one colleague so there's a little accountability. I don't know, it feels awkward to plan this, but maybe that's something I could do tomorrow.

Therapist: With that plan in place, what's one value that comes to mind as a potential reward or motivation for showing up to the 20-minute block tomorrow – something that would make you feel good about taking care of yourself and making progress?

Patient: I guess the value would be feeling competent and useful again — a small win that reminds me I can still do meaningful work. I don't know, maybe also showing up for myself and for the people I mentor so I'm not just... drifting.

Therapist: Let's try to think of your 20-minute block as an experiment in "being with" your difficult emotions and thoughts, rather than trying to push them away or avoid them. Can you imagine sitting with that feeling of sadness and hopelessness for the first 20 minutes, without judgment, and see what happens when you do?

Patient: I don't know... that feels really scary, like if I focus on it it'll just take over. I guess I could try a briefer version—like spend the first 5 minutes of the 20 noticing the sadness without trying to fix it, then switch to the task—I'm worried I'll just start avoiding again.

Therapist: That's a great approach – noticing the sadness for 5 minutes without trying to fix it can be a small step towards building tolerance. What would it be like if, instead of immediately jumping to problem-solving or trying to avoid the sadness, you simply allowed yourself to sit with the feeling for those 5 minutes, without judgment or resistance?

Patient: I don't know... it feels really scary, like if I focus on it it'll just take over and I won't be able to stop. I guess if it's only five minutes I could try, but I'm worried I'll immediately start scrolling or planning to escape. Could we maybe map out a tiny safety step if I get overwhelmed—like a breathing cue or a short grounding thing—so I don't bail?

Therapist: Let's explore some tiny safety steps together. What would be a simple, low-stakes behavior you could do if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed during those 5 minutes, such as taking a deep breath, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or doing a quick stretch?

Patient: I guess a few tiny things might help: three slow, deliberate breaths while saying a grounding phrase to myself (even though just admitting that makes me feel ashamed, like I always mess things up), or noticing the weight of my feet and naming five things I can see. I could also keep a small object—like a coin or stress ball—to squeeze for 30 seconds so I have something physical to focus on. If I start to bail, maybe a one-minute stretch and a quick message to a colleague saying "on a short break" would give me a little permission to reset.

Therapist: Let's put together a simple plan for tomorrow's 20-minute block. Can you write down the specific steps you'd like to take, including the grounding phrase, the physical object, and the stretch/stress ball, and also include the message to your colleague to reset? Having a clear plan can help you feel more in control and prepared to show up for that 20-minute block.

Patient: Okay, I guess here’s a simple plan for tomorrow — specific steps so it doesn’t feel fuzzy (and I’m kind of embarrassed admitting how small this is, but…):

1) Night before: pick one tiny modeling task and one mentoring person; set a 20-minute timer for 09:00; put a coin/stress ball by my keyboard and lay out my mug.  
2) Before starting: make coffee, close email, tell one colleague “I’m doing a focused 20-min block, back after” so I have a little accountability.  
3) First 5 minutes (noticing): sit, take three slow deliberate breaths while silently saying the grounding phrase: “I’m here. This moment is okay.” I don’t know, saying that makes me feel a bit ashamed, but I’ll try it.  
4) If I get overwhelmed during those 5 minutes: squeeze the coin/stress ball for 30 seconds, name five things I can see, then do a one-minute stretch (reach arms up, roll shoulders, touch toes).  
5) Next 15 minutes: work on the single small task with timer on, no email, no Slack. If distracted, gently note it (“that’s a thought”) and come back.  
6) If I still can’t settle after the grounding and stretch: send a short message to the colleague, “on a short break,” and take a 5-minute reset (walk, breathe) before trying another short block.  
7) After the block: do a quick, low-key check-in with myself — write one sentence about what went okay, even if it’s tiny, so I remember it’s not all ruined. I guess that’s it; I don’t know if it’ll work, but I’ll try.

Therapist: Tomorrow, when you're getting ready for your 20-minute block, take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to have a small plan, and that it's okay if it doesn't work perfectly – what if, in fact, it's just a tiny step towards making progress?

Patient: I guess I can try to think of it that way — as just a tiny step — but I feel kind of ashamed and frustrated, like I'm repeating the same old screw-ups, so I'm nervous it'll fall apart. I don't know, maybe if we made the plan even smaller or had a quick accountability check-in it would feel safer. Could we pick one tiny loose goal together now so it doesn't feel so scary?

Therapist: Let's identify a ridiculously small, non-negotiable win for tomorrow – something that you can commit to, without fail. For example, can you commit to simply sitting in your chair for the full 5 minutes without getting up, or without checking your phone?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just sitting for five minutes supposed to help? I guess I can try to sit in my chair for the full five minutes without checking my phone, but I'm already feeling ashamed and frustrated, like I'll just slip up and prove I can't stick to anything. I don't know, it feels small and stupid, but okay—I’ll commit to that tiny win tomorrow and see what happens.

Therapist: It's interesting that you feel this way. Can you try to approach this tiny win as a small act of kindness towards yourself, rather than a test of your willpower? Imagine saying to yourself, "I'm doing this because I'm willing to try, not because I'm trying to prove anything to myself or others – what if I just do it because it's the right thing to do?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I guess I can try to tell myself it's an act of kindness, but I don't know, it feels like I'm just making excuses for screwing up and that makes me ashamed. I don't want to sound difficult, but it's hard to believe a tiny thing will change anything when I keep proving to myself I can't stick to stuff.

Therapist: Can you look at the thoughts that come up when you think about doing this tiny win – what words or phrases do you use to describe yourself, and what's the tone behind those words?

Patient: I guess they’re pretty mean—things like “you’re useless,” “you always mess things up,” “what’s the point,” or “not cut out for this anymore.” The tone is flat and accusatory, like tired disappointment, and it makes me feel ashamed and small. I don’t know, it’s really hard to sit with that without wanting to escape.

Therapist: Can you try to see these critical thoughts as just thoughts, rather than a reflection of your true self? Imagine saying to yourself, "Those thoughts are thoughts – they're not the truth about you" – what does that feel like?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to tell myself "those thoughts are just thoughts" it mostly rings hollow, like I'm lecturing myself and nothing really changes. I guess there’s a tiny flicker of relief, but mostly it pulls up shame, like I'm just pretending I won't mess up again. I'm not sure I follow how that actually helps right now; maybe we could try saying it together once and see if that feels different, because on my own I keep drifting away.

Therapist: Let's try saying it together, slowly and gently. Can you repeat after me: "Those thoughts are just thoughts – they're not the truth about me"? As you say it, notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or react to the thoughts?

Patient: I don't know... "Those thoughts are just thoughts — they're not the truth about me." I said it, but it feels thin and kind of embarrassing, like I'm faking. I can feel my breath moving, shallow and slow, but it's hard to keep attention on it. I guess I managed a little, but I'm not sure it helped — it just pulls up this shame that won't quiet.

Therapist: Let's try using a physical sensation to anchor your attention. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, feeling the weight and connection to the earth? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your body sitting in the chair – can you focus on one of these sensations, without trying to change it or react to the thoughts?

Patient: I guess I can try to notice my feet on the floor. I feel the weight on my heels, a bit of pressure under my toes, and the floor feels cool against my socks, but my breath is shallow. I don't know — my mind keeps drifting to stuff I messed up and that shame tightens, so it's hard to stay with the sensation.

Therapist: Let's try saying a kindness-oriented phrase to counteract the shame. Can you say to yourself, "May I be kind to myself, exactly as I am, in this moment"? Notice how that feels, and see if you can allow it to settle in a bit – what's the sensation in your body, and how does it relate to the phrase?

Patient: I don't know... saying that phrase feels weird and kind of empty — my chest tightens and there's a knot in my stomach, my jaw gets tense like I'm holding myself together. I guess there's a tiny warm spot for a second, but then shame and that old frustration rush back and I immediately want to look away. I don't know, can we... maybe keep it shorter or try something else?

Therapist: Let's try a shorter phrase with a specific focus. Can you try saying to yourself, "May my shame be kind and gentle"? Notice how that feels, and see if you can allow it to settle in a bit.

Patient: I tried it—“May my shame be kind and gentle”—and it felt weird, like a tightness in my chest and a knot in my stomach, my jaw tensing up. There was a tiny flicker of warmth for a second, then the shame came back and it felt kind of fake. I don't know, maybe that's too formal—could we try something even shorter, like "Be gentle," or just a quick grounding breath instead? I guess I'm feeling stuck and a bit... drained.

Therapist: Let's try a simple grounding breath together. Can you bring your attention to your breath, noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Try to focus on the sensation of your breath without trying to change it, just notice it as it is – what happens when you do?

Patient: I don't know... I tried to follow the breath — it felt a bit shallower, a tiny calm for a second, but then thoughts about things I've messed up pop up and the shame tightens my chest. I guess it makes me want to look away or scroll. Can we slow down? Maybe something even shorter — like one slow breath and a quick permission to fail — because I'm kind of worn out.

Therapist: Let's try a simple permission statement: "It's okay to fail." Can you say this to yourself, slowly and gently, and then take one slow breath in and out, noticing the sensation of the breath without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I said "It's okay to fail" and took one slow breath. For a second it loosened something, then the shame came back and my chest tightened and my breath went shallow. Can we slow down a bit? Maybe just one more tiny step—one slow breath and a quick, quiet check-in—because I'm kind of worn out.

Therapist: Let's take it one small step further. Can you take just one more slow breath, and then quietly ask yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, right now"? Notice how that feels, and see if it brings a tiny sense of kindness or acceptance.

Patient: I took one slow breath and asked it — "I'm doing the best I can, right now?" I don't know — there was a tiny looseness for a second, like maybe a little kindness, but then the shame and that old frustration came back and tightened my chest. I'm kind of worn out and it's hard to hold onto even that small feeling, so can we slow down and maybe just sit with that one breath a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's just sit with that one breath, slowly and gently, and try to notice it without trying to change it or react to the thoughts. Can you focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to do anything with it? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of your body sitting in the chair, and the sensation of the breath – just notice it, without judgment.

Patient: I tried to notice the breath — there was a tiny looseness for a beat, then that rush of shame tightened my chest and my mind ran. I don't know, I guess I'm struggling to stay with it right now; can we slow down and do one very short grounding step — like squeezing the coin and one slow breath — before trying again?

Therapist: Let's try it. Can you quickly squeeze the coin and take one slow, gentle breath in through your nose and out through your mouth? Just focus on the sensation of the breath, and the pressure of the coin in your hand – what happens when you do?

Patient: I squeezed the coin and took the slow breath — I felt the pressure in my hand and a tiny looseness for a second, then that old shame voice popped up like, “you always mess up,” and my chest tightened. I guess it helped briefly, but the frustration and that nagging sense of failure rushed back and I wanted to scroll away. Can we... maybe do one more really short one? I don't know, I need it to be even smaller.

Therapist: Let's try a pause of just one second. Can you pause for exactly one second, and then take one slow, gentle breath in through your nose and out through your mouth? Just focus on the breath, and let the pause be a brief, neutral experience – what happens when you do?

Patient: I paused for a second and took the slow breath—there was a tiny looseness, then that shame voice came back and tightened my chest, and I felt like reaching for my phone. I guess it helped a little, but I'm pretty worn out and it's hard to hold onto it. Can we do one more really tiny thing—like one second pause, one slow breath, and then I write one sentence about how it felt? I don't know, I need something concrete and tiny to hang onto.

Therapist: Let's try it. Can you take one second pause, one slow breath, and then write the word "okay" on a piece of paper or on the screen in front of you? Just write the word, without trying to add anything to it or analyze it – what happens when you do?

Patient: I did it — paused, one slow breath, and wrote "okay" on a scrap of paper. For a second there was a tiny looseness, then that shame voice — “you always mess up” — slammed back and my chest tightened and I almost reached for my phone. I guess it helped a little, but I'm still kind of shaky and worn out; can we try one more tiny pause like that before we move on?
