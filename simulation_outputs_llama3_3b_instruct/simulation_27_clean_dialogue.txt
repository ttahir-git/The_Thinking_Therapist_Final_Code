Patient: Lately I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed — since the move I’m just flat and can’t find the energy to paint, and it’s starting to put a strain on my relationship. I used to be out and about, always chatting and sketching, but now I can’t even bring myself to start a canvas. I’m skeptical this will help though — how is talking supposed to fix it?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's happening when you try to start painting, and what's the first thing that makes you want to stop?

Patient: When I try to start I just stand in front of the blank canvas and my hands go weirdly heavy, like I can't pick a single mark — I used to dive in with gusto, but that energy's gone. The first thing that makes me stop is that voice in my head: "This will be rubbish," and then I bail — make tea, scroll my phone, clean something pointless. I've tried timers and little rituals to force myself and none of it works, so… how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the "This will be rubbish" voice is really powerful for you. Can you be kind to that voice for just a moment? Thank it for showing up, and then ask yourself: What would happen if you gave yourself permission to just make a small, imperfect mark on that canvas, without the pressure of expecting it to be perfect?

Patient: Okay, I tried being nice to that voice once before and it felt ridiculous — thanking it just made me laugh at myself. If I let myself make one messy mark, maybe for a second I'd feel lighter, but usually my hands go heavy and I end up doing something else, and then my partner sees me checked out and gets upset. How is that supposed to help when it always turns into more distance between us?

Therapist: It sounds like the pain of feeling stuck is closely tied to the pain of feeling disconnected from your partner. Can you tell me more about what you value most in your relationship, and how you think making space for your art could help you connect with your partner on a deeper level?

Patient: I really value the companionship — the laugh-until-we-cry bits, feeling seen for what I make, and having someone who respects my odd hours and messy studio. In my head, making space for art could remind my partner who I am and give us little shared moments, like showing a quick sketch or painting together, but I try and either bail or they get hurt, and then it just widens the gap. Honestly, I’m not sure how promising tiny attempts are when they’ve failed before — how is that supposed to help when it ends up feeling like another thing I can’t deliver on?

Therapist: Can you think of a tiny, value-driven action that would help you connect with your partner in a small way, even if it's just a tiny sketch or a funny meme you share with them? What would it take for you to feel like you're showing up for that shared moment, even if it's just a small one?

Patient: Maybe something tiny like a two-minute doodle I sneak onto a Post-it and leave on their mug, or snap a quick messy photo and text it with a stupid joke — nothing grand, just a little reminder of me. For that to feel like showing up I'd probably need a timer (three minutes?), and for them to not make a big deal if it’s terrible — just a quick laugh or a “nice” so I don’t spiral. But honestly, I’ve tried tiny stuff and it fizzles; how is that supposed to help when every little try just becomes another thing I can’t follow through on?

Therapist: I want to challenge the idea that every tiny attempt has to be perfect. What if, instead of trying to follow through on a specific outcome, you simply commit to showing up with the intention of leaving a small doodle or sharing a joke, without adding a lot of expectations? Would that feel different for you?

Patient: Maybe? On paper, focusing on intention instead of outcome sounds kinder and less scary, but in real life I still freeze up. I'd probably set the three-minute timer and tell myself it's just about showing up, not being brilliant — but then that voice says "what's the point" and I bail. How is that supposed to help when intention hasn't stopped the spiral before, and should I tell my partner I'm doing this or just leave the doodle and hope they get it?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to get your partner's approval or validation, you simply show them the doodle, and say something like, "I did this for myself, because it felt good"? Would that feel like a more honest and kind way to share your creative expression with your partner?

Patient: Maybe — that sounds kinder, and I like the idea of owning it for myself instead of fishing for compliments. But I'm wary: when I’ve tried to say it was just for me, my partner still turns it into a big check-in and we end up spiraling into a conversation I don't have the energy for. And even if I decide that, my hands still go heavy and I freeze — how is that supposed to help when the doing part won't show up?

Therapist: Let's start with something even smaller: just for 30 seconds, commit to picking up a pen or pencil, and make a single mark on a piece of paper. Not for anyone else's benefit, just for yourself. Can you do that with me right now, and see what happens when you let go of the need for perfection?

Patient: Alright — I picked up a pencil and, after a few seconds of my hands feeling stupidly heavy, I forced one ugly little squiggle onto the paper. For a breath it felt oddly lighter, but the voice immediately piped up, "what's the point," and I nearly dropped it. How is that supposed to help when the tiny lift vanishes fast and then everything still turns into a big, draining conversation with my partner? I'm trying to hold onto that small win, but I don't know how to keep it from disappearing.

Therapist: Can you acknowledge that thought, "What's the point," without trying to argue with it or push it away? Instead, simply thank your mind for showing up, and say to yourself: "This thought is just a thought. I've already made a mark, and that feels lighter. What's one way I can take care of myself and this feeling of liberation, even if it's just for a moment?"

Patient: "This thought is just a thought" — okay, I can say that, and I have already made a mark. One small thing I could do is stick that squiggle on the fridge or their mug, make a cup of tea, and stand in the sunlight for two minutes just to hold onto that tiny lightness without turning it into a conversation. But honestly, I'm not sure that'll stick — how is that supposed to help when the lift always disappears?

Therapist: Let's try something simple: take a few deep breaths with me, and when you feel the mind starting to wander, bring your attention gently back to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it. Can you do that for me right now, and see if that helps you feel more connected to your body and the small mark you made earlier?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried a few deep breaths with you and my mind immediately wandered to the dishes, the blank canvas, and whether my partner's going to be upset. I could feel my feet for a second and a tiny bit of calm flickered, but then the heaviness in my hands and that "what's the point" voice showed up again. How is that supposed to help when the relief disappears so fast? Maybe we could try breathing while I hold the squiggle on the paper so I don't just shrug it off — I don't know, I'm confused.

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on your breath, hold the squiggle on the paper and look at it for a few seconds. Just gaze at it, without judgment or trying to make sense of it. What happens when you simply look at the squiggle without thinking about it? Can you stay with that for just a minute or two?

Patient: I tried that — I stared at the squiggle and, for a second, it stopped being nothing and looked almost like a tiny hill or a wave, and my chest felt a little less tight. But then my mind leapt to the move, the unpaid bills, and my partner's disappointed face, and I lost it again. I'm not sure I follow how just looking at a doodle is supposed to change any of that — it feels like a neat trick that fades fast. Can we do something so the small lift actually lasts, or am I just signing up for little moments that fizzle out?

Therapist: Let's try something new. Instead of just looking at the squiggle, can you commit to doing one more small, imperfect, and value-driven action with it? For example, you could write a short message on the back of the paper, like "I made this". What happens when you add that small, imperfect action to the squiggle?

Patient: Okay — I wrote "I made this" on the back and plopped it on their mug. For a beat it felt sort of proud and silly, like I’d actually shown up for myself, but then the doubt came back: "They'll make it into a thing and we'll argue," and my chest tightened. I'm not sure I follow how that tiny brave move fixes the bigger heaviness — it brightens a moment but fades fast. Can we try something that might help the lift stick longer, because honestly I don't know what that would look like.

Therapist: Let's try something that might help you take a bigger step. Can you commit to making a small, imperfect piece of art that you'll share with your partner in the next 24 hours, not because you think it will impress them, but because you value the process of creating something and sharing it with someone you care about? What's the smallest, most imperfect thing you could create that would feel like a small act of bravery and connection?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is promising to share a tiny thing in 24 hours supposed to fix the bigger drift? I could try the smallest brave thing: a one-minute messy ink squiggle on a Post‑it that says "I made this" and leave it on their mug, telling myself it's for me, not for their reaction. But honestly, I'm worried they'll turn it into a big conversation and my hands will freeze — how am I supposed to keep it small?

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller. Instead of writing "I made this" on the Post-it, can you simply place the Post-it on the mug, with the squiggle and the words, and just... leave it? Can you stay with that for a few minutes, without trying to change it, without trying to share it, without trying to make sense of it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just leaving a Post‑it supposed to help anything? I can stick it on the mug now, but I already know my hands will want to check if they saw it or my brain will jump to the next worry. I'm confused and a bit annoyed, but I can try to leave it and hang back in the kitchen for a couple minutes to see if I can actually hold still without turning it into a thing.

Therapist: Let's take a step back. Instead of trying to change the Post-it or control the outcome, can you simply observe the physical sensations in your body while you're standing in the kitchen, waiting to see what happens? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, the sensation of your hands feeling heavy or light. Can you stay with that, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay, I can try. My feet feel solid on the floor for a second, the air's shallow, my hands are still heavy and my chest is tight — and then my mind hops to the bills and whether my partner's going to bring it up. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that actually changes anything — how is that supposed to help when the relief just fizzles? Can we try something concrete to help the small lift stick, because I'm confused and a bit annoyed that it keeps disappearing.

Therapist: Let's try something concrete. Instead of just observing the sensations in the kitchen, can you take one small step outside with the Post-it, and just leave it on a surface where your partner might see it? Can you commit to doing that, and see what happens when you take that small action?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is sneaking a Post‑it outside supposed to help anything? I can try it though: I'll step out now, stick the Post‑it on the porch table where they might see it, and hang back for a few minutes, but I'm nervous it'll turn into a big conversation and my hands will freeze.

Therapist: Let's focus on your body's physical sensations while you're stepping out with the Post-it. As you walk to the porch, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the movement of your legs, the sensation of the air on your skin. When you put the Post-it on the table, notice the sensation of your hand making contact with the surface. Can you stay with those physical sensations, without judgment or trying to change them, as you wait for a few minutes?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I shuffled out, felt the porch boards under my feet and a cool breeze on my face, and when my hand pressed the Post‑it to the table my chest loosened for a second. But then my mind zipped to the bills and my partner's disappointed look and the heaviness came back. How is staying with those sensations supposed to make the lift stick longer? I'm confused and a bit annoyed — can we try something concrete I can do in that moment when it fades?

Therapist: Let's try something concrete. As you're standing there, looking at the Post-it, take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I'm doing this because I value being kind to myself and taking small actions towards my art, even when it's hard." Can you say that to yourself, without judgment, and then take one small action that feels connected to that value, like taking a sip of water or adjusting your position on the porch?

Patient: Okay — I took a deep breath and actually said, "I'm doing this because I value being kind to myself and taking small actions towards my art, even when it's hard." I took a slow sip of water, felt the cool on my lips, and for a beat my chest loosened and my feet felt steadier. But then my head went straight to the bills and whether they'll turn this into a big thing, and I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when the lift always slips away? I can hang on to it for a minute, but I need something practical for when it fades — what do you want me to try next?

Therapist: Let's try something concrete. Take the Post-it with you, and when you see your partner or when they bring it up, you can say, "I wanted to share this with you because I value our relationship and my art. I'm doing this because I care about you and our connection." Can you say that to yourself, without judgment, and see what happens when you take a small, compassionate action towards your relationship?

Patient: I can try saying that to myself — “I wanted to share this with you because I value our relationship and my art” — and I can carry the Post‑it, but I’m doubtful it won’t just turn into a big thing. Every time I try to explain it’s for me, my partner still makes it a check‑in and my hands go heavy and I freeze. If I do say it and they push back or start a big conversation, what do you want me to do in the moment so I don’t shut down or get defensive?

Therapist: When your partner responds or starts a big conversation, I want you to take a deep breath and say to yourself, "This conversation is just a thought." Can you say that to yourself, without judgment, and then pause for a moment? Then, respond to your partner in a way that's still connected to your value of valuing your relationship and your art, but without getting caught up in the conversation itself. For example, you could say, "I understand you might be concerned, but for me, this is about taking small steps towards my art and our connection."

Patient: I can try to breathe and tell myself "This conversation is just a thought," but honestly in the moment I go blank — my throat tightens and I either apologize or snap. How is that supposed to help when I freeze and half the time can't get words out? Could you give me a tiny, practical script I can actually use if they press — something like, "I hear you, I need 20 minutes to collect myself; can we talk then?" — would that be okay, or am I just setting myself up for another argument?

Therapist: I like your idea of saying, "I hear you, I need 20 minutes to collect myself; can we talk then?" That's a gentle, compassionate way to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. It's okay to acknowledge your partner's concerns and take a break to collect yourself. You're not setting yourself up for another argument, you're taking care of yourself and your own emotional safety. Remember, the goal is not to win the argument or convince your partner, but to stay calm, kind, and connected to your values.

Patient: Maybe — I can try that line, but honestly I’m skeptical. How is that supposed to help when my throat locks up and I go blank? Could you give me a couple of tiny, one‑sentence responses I can actually say if they push — like a gentle boundary, a firmer follow‑up, and something for if they accuse me of avoiding them? I feel nervous and distracted just thinking about it — can we role‑play it now so I don't fumble?

Therapist: Let's role-play a few scenarios. I'll play the role of your partner, and you can try out some of these one-sentence responses. We'll start with a gentle boundary: "I need some space to think about that; can we talk about it later?" Then, a firmer follow-up: "I'm not going to engage in a conversation that's not respectful; can we find a better way to discuss this?" Finally, a response to accusation: "I'm not avoiding you; I'm taking care of myself and my emotions; can we focus on understanding each other?" Are you ready to try?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try — but honestly I’m skeptical I’ll get the words out when the moment hits. Here’s how I’d say them, short and simple:

- Gentle boundary: “I need some space to think; can we talk about this in 20 minutes?”  
- Firmer follow-up: “I want to talk, but not like this — let’s pause and come back when we’re both calmer.”  
- If accused of avoiding: “I’m not avoiding you; I’m taking care of myself so I can be present for you later.”

My throat still tends to lock up when they push — can we role‑play it now with you as them pushing a bit, so I can try saying these and you can tell me if they sound okay or if they fall flat? I'm nervous and easily distracted, so maybe go slowly.

Therapist: Let's start with a gentle scenario. I'll say something that might trigger a reaction, and you can try using your scripts. Here we go:

"Hey, I've noticed that you've been avoiding me all day. You're not responding to my messages, and it feels like you're trying to push me away. I'm feeling hurt and confused. Can we talk about this?"

Please respond as if you were in that situation, using one of your scripts. I'll give you feedback on how it sounds and offer suggestions for improvement. Go ahead!

Patient: I hear you, and I’m sorry you feel hurt — I don’t want to push you away. I need some space to think so I don't say something I'll regret; can we talk about this in 20 minutes? My throat tends to lock up when I'm on the spot, so I just need a little time to collect myself.

Therapist: Your response sounds calm, kind, and clear. You're acknowledging your partner's feelings, taking responsibility for your actions, and setting a boundary in a non-confrontational way. You're also showing empathy and understanding, which can help to diffuse tension.

One tiny suggestion: instead of saying "I don't want to push you away," you could say "I don't want to say something I'll regret" - it's a slightly different phrase that still conveys your intention to communicate without escalating the situation.

Now, let's try a firmer follow-up response. I'll respond as your partner, and you can try using the firmer follow-up script: "I want to talk, but not like this — let's pause and come back when we're both calmer."

Patient: I want to talk, but not like this — let's pause and come back when we're both calmer. My throat locks up and I go blank, so can we take 20 minutes and then agree to listen without blaming? I'm not sure it’ll fix everything, but I can try.

Therapist: Your response sounds calm, clear, and compassionate. You're setting a boundary, taking responsibility for your own emotions, and offering a willingness to listen and communicate when you're both calmer.

One minor suggestion: instead of saying "I'm not sure it'll fix everything," you could say "I'm not sure it's the solution, but I'm willing to try" - it's a slightly different phrase that still conveys your openness to finding a solution without implying that it's a magic bullet.

Now, let's try responding to an accusation. I'll say something that might trigger a defensive response, and you can try using the response: "You're just avoiding me and it's not fair."

Patient: I’m not avoiding you — I’m taking care of myself and my emotions, and I want us to understand each other. My throat tends to lock up when I feel accused, so if I seem quiet that’s why; can we pause for 20 minutes and come back calmer? Honestly, though, how is that supposed to help when I go blank and we just end up arguing — can we role‑play that pushback a few times so I don’t fumble?

Therapist: Your response sounds calm, clear, and compassionate. You're acknowledging the accusation, taking responsibility for your own emotions, and setting a boundary while also showing a willingness to listen and communicate.

One minor suggestion: instead of saying "we just end up arguing," you could say "we might have a hard time having a constructive conversation" - it's a slightly different phrase that still conveys your concern about the conversation without predicting an outcome.

Now, let's role-play the pushback scenario a few times. I'll say something that might trigger a defensive response, and you can try using your responses. Remember, the goal is to stay calm, assertive, and compassionate, even when faced with challenging interactions.

Here we go: "You're always so self-centered and never listen to me. You just do whatever you want and expect me to deal with it!"

Please respond as you normally would, using one of your scripts. I'll give you feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Patient: I hear you — that sounds painful. I want to talk, but not like this; can we pause and come back when we're both calmer? My throat locks up when I feel accused, so I might go quiet or snap — can we role‑play that pushback a few more times so I don't fumble? Honestly, I'm skeptical this'll fix things, but I'm willing to try.
