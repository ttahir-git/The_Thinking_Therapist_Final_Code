Patient: I've been stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism, always seeing myself as falling short — it's gotten worse since I lost my loved one and it's really knocked my social confidence. I guess a lot of this ties back to being bullied at school; I still expect people to notice my flaws and judge me. I don't know, talking about it feels really uncomfortable so I tend to shut down or steer the conversation away.

Therapist: Can you think of a specific situation where you catch yourself expecting to be judged by others, even though you know intellectually that they're not paying attention? What would it feel like if, in that moment, you could let go of that expectation, and instead focus on your own presence and worth?

Patient: Yeah — like last week in seminar when I had to say something about my essay, I was sure everyone was thinking I sounded stupid even though I know they probably weren't. If I could let go in that moment, I guess I'd just breathe, feel lighter, and actually listen instead of rehearsing apologies in my head. I don't know, it's hard to picture it without getting anxious — can we talk about what to do when that spinning starts?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. When you feel that spinning anxiety starting, can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, without judgment? Notice how your body is responding, and simply say to yourself, "I am feeling anxious, and that's okay." Would you be willing to try this for just 30 seconds, and see what happens when you focus on your physical sensations rather than the thought of being judged?

Patient: Okay, I can try it for 30 seconds — I don't know if it'll do anything, but I'll give it a go. When the spinning starts my chest tightens, I start rehearsing apologies in my head and my hands get clammy. Saying "I'm feeling anxious and that's okay" feels weird, but I'll try to focus on my breath.

Therapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore this further. It sounds like you value being able to manage your anxiety and feel more confident in yourself. Can you think of a specific situation where you'd like to practice this skill, like that seminar, and what you'd like to achieve or feel in that situation?

Patient: Yeah — that seminar where I have to say something about my essay. I want to stop feeling like everyone’s going to pick me apart, to breathe, say what I mean, and not apologize the whole time. I don't know, I guess if I could just stay present and not spiral that would feel like a win.

Therapist: What's one small thing you can do before that seminar to prepare yourself for speaking in front of others? For example, could you write down one thing you want to say about your essay, or practice saying it out loud in front of a trusted friend or family member?

Patient: I guess I could write one clear sentence about my essay on an index card and practice saying it out loud a couple times before the seminar — even in the car or the bathroom. Maybe take three slow breaths right before I speak so my chest doesn’t tighten up. I don't know, it feels awkward, but that seems doable.

Therapist: Can you try practicing this routine of writing and rehearsing your sentence, taking three slow breaths before speaking, and then actually going into the seminar, without trying to "not" think about being judged or anxious? Just focus on your verbal statement and your physical breath. What would it feel like if you simply showed up with that small, prepared response, rather than getting caught up in the anxious thoughts?

Patient: I guess if I just showed up with that one line and three slow breaths, I'd probably feel a bit lighter — more present instead of stuck in my head — and maybe less compelled to apologize for every little thing. I don't know, I'd still get butterflies and my hands might be clammy, but it would feel more doable, like I actually had something to hang onto. Can we talk about what to do if I still start spiraling and the breathing doesn't seem to help?

Therapist: If you do start to feel like you're spiraling, I'd like to ask: What's the most modest, tiny thing you could do to take a break from the spiral, just for a second? For example, could you excuse yourself to grab a drink of water, or take a brief pause to stretch? Sometimes, taking a small step away from the situation can help calm the nervous system.

Patient: I guess the smallest thing would be to excuse myself for a second to get a drink or go to the bathroom — anything that gives me a real, physical pause. I could also press my feet into the floor or squeeze and release my hand a couple times while breathing, or just anchor on the texture of my index card. I don't know, it feels awkward to do any of that in front of people, but having one tiny, doable move seems less terrifying than trying to wrestle with my thoughts.

Therapist: Let's practice one of these physical anchors right now. Can you try pressing your feet into the floor for just 5 seconds, and then slowly releasing? Notice the sensation of your feet making contact with the ground, and what happens in your body as you release?

Patient: Okay — I pressed my feet into the floor for five seconds. I could feel the weight on my heels and the roughness of the carpet under my soles, and my chest loosened a little like someone took the pressure off. I guess it didn't stop the thoughts, but the spinning slowed for a moment and my shoulders dropped; I don't know, it feels weird to notice something so small, but maybe that's kind of okay.

Therapist: Let's make a plan to practice this anchor more regularly. Can you commit to practicing pressing your feet into the floor at least 2-3 times a day, especially when you feel anxious or restless? Would you be willing to try this practice in front of a mirror, so you can notice how your body responds to the physical sensation of grounding yourself?

Patient: I guess I can try that — 2–3 times a day sounds doable. I don't know about the mirror part though; that feels kinda awkward and makes me more self-conscious, so maybe I'll try it once in the mirror and then do the rest in private (like mid-afternoon, before my seminar, and before bed). I'll set a phone reminder so I don't forget — can we check back on how it felt next time?

Therapist: I'd love to check in with you in a few days, after you've had a chance to practice your foot-pressing anchor regularly. What do you think might be different or what might you notice about how you're feeling when you practice, and when you're in situations that normally trigger anxiety?

Patient: I guess if I do this regularly I'll notice the spinning slow down faster and I might actually get my one line out without apologizing a dozen times. I don't know if the butterflies will go away, but maybe my chest won't feel like it's tightening as long, and I might feel a bit more present instead of trapped in my head. Can we also talk next time about what to do if I totally freeze and nothing else seems to help?

Therapist: If you do find yourself frozen or unable to act, what would be one tiny thing you could do to take a small step towards your values, even if it feels insignificant or embarrassing? For example, if you're in the seminar and completely paralyzed, could you just take one small breath, or glance at the audience for a brief second? Sometimes, acknowledging our inability to act can be just as important as taking action itself.

Patient: I guess if I freeze I could just take one slow, deliberate breath and clear my throat — something tiny and visible to break the paralysis. Maybe I'd whisper my one sentence under my breath or glance at the window for a second, just to move my body and get momentum. I don't know, it feels embarrassing to do that in front of people, but even a small, awkward move feels better than staying stuck.

Therapist: I want to emphasize that these small actions, like taking a breath or glancing at the window, are not about drawing attention to yourself, but about taking care of yourself and moving forward. When you find yourself in a situation where you're feeling stuck, remember that you've already taken steps to prepare and cope. You've developed a tool to help you break the paralysis and get moving. Can you repeat to yourself, "I've done this before, and I can do it again"?

Patient: "Okay — I've done this before, and I can do it again." I guess saying it out loud makes my chest ease a little, but I don't know, it still feels shaky like I'm waiting for someone to call me out. Can we try a quick role-play where someone reacts badly so I can practice the breath and my one line?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. I'll play the role of a teacher or professor, and I'll respond with a critical comment that might make you feel uncomfortable. You'll respond with your prepared line, and then we'll pause and take a few deep breaths together. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready. My one line is: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone." I don't know, go ahead with the critical comment when you're ready.

Therapist: "Are you really sure that's what your essay is saying? I think you're being too soft – don't you think that individual effort is just as important as environmental factors? Your grade is going to reflect that, not some idealistic theory."

Now, take a deep breath in and out, and remember your one line: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone." Go ahead and say it, even if you feel like the other person is disagreeing with you.

Patient: (Deep breath) "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone." I said it, but my voice shook and I could feel my face get hot — I don't know, it still felt like they'd think I'm soft or clueless. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and maybe try it again with a less harsh response so I can notice what helps?

Therapist: Let's try again, but this time, I'll respond in a way that's a bit more neutral. You'll still respond with your line, and then we'll pause and take a few deep breaths together. I'll say: "That's an interesting perspective. Can you tell me more about how you came to that conclusion?"

Please go ahead and respond with your line: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone."

Patient: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone." I said it — my voice felt a little steadier and I actually breathed out afterward, but I don't know, there's still this nagging worry they'll think I'm naive. Can we try another version where the listener nods but asks a follow-up challenge so I can practice holding my ground?

Therapist: Let's try again. I'll respond in a way that shows I'm engaged and interested, but also challenges your idea a bit. You'll respond with your line, and then I'll ask a follow-up question. I'll say: "That's an interesting perspective. I've worked with students who have had great results with more individualized approaches, though – how do you think you would adapt to a more hands-on learning style?"

Please respond with your line: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone."

Patient: "My essay argues that supportive environments shape learning outcomes more than individual effort alone." I said it — my voice wavered and my chest tightened, I guess I braced for the challenge. I don't know, can we go on to that follow-up so I can practice answering it?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to continue. Let's move forward with the follow-up question. I'll ask: "What makes you think that supportive environments are more important than individual effort in learning outcomes?" Please respond as if you were in a real conversation, and we'll take it from there.

Patient: I guess because I've watched people pour themselves into work and still falter when the setting was hostile, while others made slower progress but really thrived once someone actually supported them. For me, being bullied in school meant no matter how hard I tried I felt shut down, so the environment ended up dictating what I could show or accomplish. I don't know, it feels awkward saying that out loud — can we slow down a bit before we go on?

Therapist: You've shared a powerful story that illustrates the impact of environment on learning outcomes. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share something so personal. Can you take a deep breath and tell me what you hope that your work says about the importance of supportive environments? What do you hope others take away from your perspective?

Patient: Okay — (deep breath). I guess I want my work to show that supportive environments really shape what people can do, and that blaming people for "failing" misses the bigger picture. I want teachers and classmates to realize their words and actions matter, to give space and practical support instead of just saying "try harder," but I don't know, it still feels weird to say that out loud.

Therapist: I think it's beautiful that you're sharing your hopes for your work to make a positive impact. Remember that your value as a person is not defined by your work or your opinions, but by your willingness to share your thoughts and perspectives. When you're in the midst of a challenging conversation, remind yourself that you're speaking from a place of kindness and a desire to help others. Can you take a moment to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your thoughts and feelings with me, and with others?

Patient: I... I guess I am trying to be brave — saying that out loud makes my chest tighten and I feel kind of embarrassed. There's this shameful voice that pipes up, like I'm just waiting for someone to call me out, and it's frustrating because I want to believe I'm doing something meaningful. I don't know, it's hard to accept that it takes courage, but can we talk about how to hold onto that feeling when the old voice starts up?

Therapist: I want you to know that it's completely normal to feel like that inner voice is waiting to pounce. It's like having a shadow self that pops up to question your efforts. One way to acknowledge this voice is to give it a label, like "that voice" or "my inner critic." Then, try to say to yourself: "I'm here, I'm trying, and I'm doing the best I can." Can you take a moment to repeat this phrase, and notice what happens to your body and your mind?

Patient: "Okay... 'I'm here, I'm trying, and I'm doing the best I can.'" Saying it made my chest tighten and this hot shame flushed up — that voice immediately told me it was a lie and I got annoyed and frustrated with myself. I don't know, I guess can we slow down and talk about how to actually hold onto that phrase when the shame rushes in?

Therapist: It's not surprising that the phrase triggered the shame response. That voice can be quite persuasive. Let's try to create a contrast to the shame-filled voice. Can you imagine a gentle, kind voice that says to you: "You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of"? Try to listen to both voices in your mind, and see if you can create a sense of space between them. What if you allowed both voices to exist, but didn't get caught up in their arguments?

Patient: I guess I can kind of hear both — the kind voice shows up but the critical one barges in and makes me feel hot and small, like everything's wrong. I don't know, it's really frustrating because that shame grabs me and I get mad at myself for even trying. Can we slow down and try a short practice to help the kind voice feel realer—maybe a phrase or grounding I can actually believe in when the shame rushes in?

Therapist: Let's practice a simple phrase that you can use to ground yourself in kindness when the shame-filled voice takes over. Repeat after me: "I am enough, exactly as I am, in this moment." Say it slowly, and notice the physical sensations in your body as you say it. Can you feel any changes in your chest or breathing? Then, try to add a phrase that acknowledges your efforts, like "I'm doing the best I can." See if you can hold both phrases together in your mind, and notice how it feels.

Patient: "I am enough, exactly as I am, in this moment." Saying it made my chest tighten and a hot shame rush up — that inner voice immediately told me it was a lie and I felt pissed at myself. I tried adding "I'm doing the best I can," but it felt like waving a tiny flag in a storm; the kind voice is so quiet I can barely hear it. I don't know, I guess can we slow down and try a shorter line or pair the phrase with a physical anchor so it doesn't get snuffed out?

Therapist: Let's try a shorter phrase that's a bit more tangible. Instead of "I am enough, exactly as I am," try saying to yourself: "I am safe." This phrase can be a simple anchor that grounds you in the present moment. When you say it, notice the physical sensations in your body, and see if you can pair it with a gentle touch, like holding your hand or touching your arm. This can help make the phrase feel more substantial and less vulnerable to the shame-filled voice. Try it with me: "I am safe."

Patient: "I am safe." I said it, but my chest clenched and this old rush of shame and that stupid flash of failure came back — I don't know, it feels like the words just slide off me. I felt embarrassed and kind of angry at myself for not being able to make it stick. Can we slow down and try it with the foot press or me holding my forearm, or maybe a shorter phrase like "I'm here" so it doesn't feel so ridiculous?

Therapist: Let's try a different anchor. Instead of saying the phrase, try holding your forearm with a gentle touch. Place your hand on your arm and say to yourself: "I am safe." Notice how the physical sensation of your hand on your arm feels, and see if that can help ground you in the present moment. Alternatively, we can try a shorter phrase like "I'm here" as you mentioned. Let's try it with the forearm anchor. Hold your arm and say "I'm here" slowly and clearly. See if that feels more substantial and less vulnerable to the shame-filled voice.

Patient: Okay... I put my hand on my forearm and said "I'm here" slowly. The touch felt a little grounding, but my chest still tightened and that stupid flash came back — I felt hot and embarrassed and kinda pissed at myself for it not sticking. I don't know, maybe the phrase is too big; can we try it again but slower, and this time press my feet at the same time? I guess can we just slow down a bit before we go on?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and start again. We'll take it very slowly. Please put your feet on the ground and press down gently with your heels. Now, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I'm here." Notice how your body feels, and see if the phrase feels more substantial this time. If not, we can try again. Remember, we're not trying to force the phrase to stick, but rather cultivate a sense of connection between your body and your words.

Patient: Okay — I pressed down with my heels, took a slow exhale and said "I'm here." For a moment my shoulders eased and it felt a bit steadier, but then this hot shame rushed back and I got pissed at myself. I guess it helped a little but it's fragile; I don't know, can we slow down and try it again with my hand on my forearm too? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the progress you've made so far. You've used a phrase, tried an anchor, and experienced a small moment of relief. Now, let's build on that. Please hold your hand on your forearm and press down with your heels, just like before. Now, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I am here." Notice how your body feels, and see if we can create a sense of connection between your physical sensations and your words. We'll take it very slowly and gently, and we'll be here to support you.

Patient: Okay — I did it: pressed my heels, put my hand on my arm, breathed out and said "I am here." For a second my shoulders eased and it felt steadier, but then that hot shame rushed back and I got pissed at myself; I don't know, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. Can we slow down and just sit with that tiny bit of relief for a minute, or do a very slow repeat, before we move on?
