--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been consumed with anticipatory worry about my performance at work—every pull request feels like a potential indictment of my competence, and that escalates into paralysis. As a developer I'm inclined to approach it like a systems problem—cataloguing failure modes and optimizing processes—but that analytic insulation seems like a way to avoid actually feeling the anxiety and shame underneath. The result is chronic procrastination: I delay tasks to sidestep the anxiety, which then feeds into a loop of guilt and decreased productivity.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion seems to be anxiety and shame. One specific theme that emerges is the avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, which is linked to your tendency to approach problems analytically and insulate yourself from emotional discomfort. This avoidance behavior contributes to chronic procrastination and guilt.

Goal: Connect this avoidance behavior to an underlying value, and introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what's at stake for you when you're faced with a pull request? What's the core value that you're trying to protect or preserve when you feel anxious about it?

Patient: Mostly I'm trying to protect my professional identity—I want to maintain the narrative that I'm competent, reliable, and not a liability to the team. Cognitively it feels like defending my epistemic credibility and predictability: a bad PR threatens my standing, future opportunities, and the internal schema that I'm "good enough." With my PTSD history, perceived criticism amplifies that threat response, so instead of engaging I get hypervigilant and end up procrastinating as an avoidance strategy.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The underlying value of protecting your professional identity and maintaining a positive self-image is closely tied to your history of PTSD. The amplification of perceived criticism has created a strong threat response, leading to avoidance and hypervigilance. This highlights the interplay between past trauma and present-day coping mechanisms.

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, and create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, and it's understandable that you'd want to protect your professional identity. Can you imagine, for a moment, what would happen if you let go of the need to be 'good enough' or 'not a liability'? What might that feel like, and could you find some kindness and compassion towards yourself if you were to approach challenges with a more open mind?

Patient: Intellectually I can imagine it: relinquishing the “good enough” narrative would probably lower my anticipatory arousal, let PR feedback register as data instead of moral failure, and free cognitive bandwidth for experimentation. Emotionally it’s much harder—my PTSD-trained alarm makes kindness feel like removing armor, which feels risky and unsafe. I can articulate self-compassion strategies—reframing errors as hypotheses, graded exposure, scripted affirmations—but when asked to actually feel it I default to analysis instead of tenderness. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling; can we work through one small, practical step I could try that doesn’t feel like too much of a vulnerability?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the intellectual understanding, but struggling to connect it to emotional action due to the lingering effects of PTSD. The notion of vulnerability feels risky and unsafe, which is a common experience for individuals with PTSD. This highlights the need for a small, low-stakes experiment to build confidence in willingness.

Goal: Identify a small, value-driven behavioral step that you can take to practice tenderness and begin to bridge the gap between intellectual understanding and emotional action.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with a small, tiny step. Can you commit to simply taking a 30-second pause before responding to the next pull request that triggers your anxiety? No action, just a 30-second pause. This tiny step allows you to acknowledge the feeling without needing to do anything about it, and it might help you build some tolerance for the discomfort. What do you think about this tiny step?

Patient: Okay—I can try that. My default will be to immediately start anticipatory cognitive elaboration—drafting replies, enumerating failure modes—so those 30 seconds will probably be noisy with thoughts. I'll commit to holding still for the next PR that spikes me and just noting what comes up; if I end up ruminating instead of pausing, can we troubleshoot what went wrong together?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've set a small, manageable goal, and acknowledged the likelihood of rumination. Now, you're taking a step towards recognizing when you're deviating from your intention and willing to explore what went wrong.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and troubleshoot together.

Therapist Answer:
That's a great attitude! When you find yourself ruminating, can you try to say to yourself, "I've got a bit of a thought storm going on here. Can I simply acknowledge it, without judgment, and then gently bring my attention back to the pause?" Notice how you're doing, and we can explore what happens next if you continue to hold the pause.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try saying that to myself. Framing the surge as a “thought storm” feels linguistically useful; I predict the script will create metacognitive distance and might blunt the initial reactivity, but my instinct is still to leap into solution-mode. If I end up ruminating instead of pausing, can we plan a concrete fallback—like one slow breath or looking away for five seconds—so we can troubleshoot what went wrong?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've refined your strategy to create metacognitive distance and recognize the instinct to leap into solution-mode. Now, you're thinking about creating a concrete fallback to help you recover from rumination.

Goal: Introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
I like the idea of having a fallback plan. For now, let's focus on the pause. Can you commit to pausing for 5 seconds, and then look away from the screen, or take one slow, deep breath, whenever you feel yourself starting to ruminate? This tiny act of noticing and pausing can be a powerful way to build space and bring you back to the present moment.

Patient: Yes—I’ll do the 5‑second pause and then either look away or take one slow breath when I notice rumination. I expect my default will be to start drafting fixes or enumerating failure modes, so I’ll use the “I’ve got a thought storm” script as a cue; if that fails, my fallback is one slow exhale and deliberately focusing on an arbitrary object for five seconds. I’ll jot down what pulled me out of the pause each time so we can troubleshoot patterns together—would you suggest a short phrasing for the sticky note I could put on my monitor?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete fallback plan, including a script to create metacognitive distance, and a backup plan to recover from rumination. Now, you're thinking about tracking your progress and identifying patterns to inform future strategies.

Goal: Co-create a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
For the sticky note, how about "Storm, pause, breathe" or "Notice, pause, pause again"? Something short and simple that serves as a visual reminder to create space and bring you back to the present moment. When you jot down what pulled you out of the pause each time, can you also include the specific thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations that arose? This will help you identify patterns and refine your strategies over time.

Patient: "Storm, pause, breathe" feels good — short, action-oriented, and semantically aligned with the script, so I'll put that on a sticky note. I can commit to logging what pulled me out of the pause (specific thoughts, bodily sensations like tight chest or shallow breathing, and the behavioral trigger), but I'm likely to record cognitive content more reliably than raw feelings — I tend to translate emotion into analysis to stay safe. Could you give me a tiny palette of one- or two-word emotion labels (like "shame," "anxious," "frustrated," "numb") that I can use quickly on the log so I don't overthink the wording?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've chosen a sticky note phrase that resonates with your script, and you're recognizing the tendency to translate emotions into analysis. Now, you're thinking about a simple way to label your emotions quickly.

Goal: Provide a tiny palette of emotion labels for rapid tracking.

Therapist Answer:
Here are a few options for one- or two-word emotion labels that you can use to quickly note your emotions:

* panic
* numb
* anxious
* frustrated
* ashamed
* frustrated
* tight
* flat

Feel free to pick the ones that resonate with you the most, or add your own. The goal is to find something that works for you and doesn't require overthinking.

Patient: I'll use: anxious, ashamed, numb, frustrated, tight — and I'll add "overwhelmed" as a catch‑all. I'll stick to those on the log and pair them with a very short cognitive note (e.g., "what if I'm exposed") since I'm likelier to record thoughts than sensations. Does that set feel manageable, or would you pare it down further?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've selected a concise set of emotion labels that cover the range of possibilities. Now, you're thinking about the balance between emotional labels and cognitive notes.

Goal: Optimize the log format for ease of use.

Therapist Answer:
It looks like you've struck a good balance. The addition of "overwhelmed" as a catch-all is a great idea. To make it even more streamlined, you could consider pairing each emotion label with a very brief phrase, such as:

* anxious: "what if I'm exposed"
* ashamed: "self-doubt"
* numb: "dissociation"
* frustrated: "blocked"
* tight: "physical tension"
* overwhelmed: "information overload"

This way, you'll have a simple and consistent format for tracking your emotions and thoughts.

Patient: That mapping feels practicable — I like the semantic shortcuts, they'll reduce the cognitive load when I'm logging in-the-moment. Given my proclivity to transmute affect into cognition, I'll primarily record the paired phrase and a one-line thought (e.g., "what if I'm exposed"), and try this for the next three PR triggers as a micro-experiment. Is three instances a reasonable data point to start troubleshooting patterns, or would you prefer a different target?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've decided on a practical log format, and you're planning to test it with three triggers. Now, you're thinking about the sample size for data collection.

Goal: Determine a suitable sample size for data collection.

Therapist Answer:
Three instances is a good starting point, but ACT research often recommends collecting data over a longer period to capture more nuanced patterns. Consider committing to log for at least 7-14 days, or whenever you feel you've developed a sense of consistency in your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This will give you a more accurate picture of your patterns and help you refine your strategies over time.

Patient: I'm willing to try a week as a compromise, but can I pilot the 3‑PR micro‑experiment first to make sure the logging itself doesn't just become another rumination loop? My main worry is that keeping a log will feel like performance monitoring—exposing—and will trigger the same shame/avoidance cycle. Can you give me the absolute-minimal entry format (one line: emotion tag + 5-word thought + trigger?) and advise how to treat non‑PR days or missed logs so I don't spiral into "did I fail the experiment" thinking? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling with the fear that tracking will just quantify my incompetence.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that logging might become another source of anxiety, and you want to ensure it doesn't exacerbate your avoidance behavior. You're also worried about non-PR days and missed logs.

Goal: Develop a minimal log format and strategies for non-PR days.

Therapist Answer:
Minimal log entry format:
"Emotion | Thought | Trigger"

For example:
anxious | what if I'm exposed | PR1
ashamed | self-doubt | PR2
numb | unclear | no trigger

Regarding non-PR days or missed logs, remember that it's okay to miss a day or two without judgment. If you miss a log, simply acknowledge the thought "Oh, I missed a day" and commit to the next day. Avoid catastrophic thinking by asking yourself: "What's the worst that could happen if I miss a day? Would it make me incompetent? Would it undo all the progress I've made?" Instead, focus on getting back to logging as soon as possible, and treat the missed day as an opportunity to learn and improve for the next day.

Patient: That minimal format feels doable—emotion|thought|trigger—and I’ll pilot the 3‑PR micro‑experiment first. To prevent logging from becoming another performance metric, I plan to timebox each entry to 30 seconds (one-word emotion, five-word thought, trigger code) and if I miss a log I’ll just write “missed | overwhelmed | —” instead of ruminating. Can you help me craft one very short corrective script for the moment I notice self‑judgment—something like “data, not judgment” or “thought storm, pause”—that I can actually say to myself without overanalyzing? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m still a bit anxious this will just quantify my incompetence.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've refined the log format, and you're addressing the risk of logging becoming a performance metric. Now, you're working on developing a corrective script to manage self-judgment.

Goal: Create a concise script to interrupt self-judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a very short corrective script: "Stop judging, see it."

This phrase acknowledges your thought without engaging with it, allowing you to pause and reorient towards your goals. If you feel the urge to analyze or judge yourself, simply repeat this phrase to yourself, and then continue with your log entry. This script is brief, concrete, and non-judgmental, making it more likely to stick.

Patient: The phrase resonates on a cognitive level—short and nonjudgmental, so it should interrupt the narrative loop. My worry is a physiological override: when my SNS spikes a verbal cue might get drowned out by the arousal. I want to pair it with a micro-anchor (one slow exhale, a three‑second thumb‑index finger squeeze, or a deliberate look at the sticky note)—which do you think is least likely to feel performative and most likely to register in the moment? If I try it and it still fails, can we map a 2‑step troubleshooting cascade I can use immediately so the experiment doesn't just become another shame metric?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the verbal cue might get lost in the physiological response, and you want to find a more visceral anchor. You're also thinking about the potential for the experiment to become another source of shame.

Goal: Find a non-verbal anchor and develop a 2-step troubleshooting cascade.

Therapist Answer:
For the anchor, I think a deliberate look at the sticky note would be the least likely to feel performative. It's a physical action that's unrelated to self-criticism, and it provides a clear visual cue. Try looking at the sticky note with your thumb-index finger for 2-3 seconds, and see if that helps you interrupt the narrative loop.

Regarding the troubleshooting cascade, if you find that the verbal cue is still getting lost, here's a 2-step approach:

1. Take a deep breath and pause for 2-3 seconds to calm your nervous system.
2. Say to yourself: "What's the one thing I can do right now to move forward?" (e.g., "I can take a sip of water," "I can look away from the screen," or "I can type out my log entry.")

This cascade acknowledges your physiological response, provides a brief pause, and refocuses you on a concrete action that moves you forward.

Patient: Okay — that sounds doable: I’ll make the sticky-note look + one slow exhale my primary anchor. Concretely I’ll rehearse this micro-protocol: 1) look at sticky note 2–3s + exhale, 2) say “Stop judging, see it” once, 3) if arousal persists, do the cascade (deep breath, then ask myself a one-action question). Can you give me a three-word version of that one-action prompt I can actually remember and use under high arousal (something like “One small step” or “Do one thing”)? Also, how should I adapt this when I’m on my phone or in a meeting — I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling because I’m worried this will just feel like another performance metric.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've refined the anchor and micro-protocol, and you're thinking about the one-action prompt for high arousal.

Goal: Develop a concise one-word prompt for high arousal.

Therapist Answer:
A three-word prompt that might work is: "Breathe. Move. Now."

This phrase is short, simple, and actionable, making it easier to remember and use under high arousal. If you're on your phone or in a meeting, you can try using a brief gesture instead of verbalizing the prompt. For example, you could:

* Give yourself a subtle nod
* Make a brief, calm gesture with your hand (e.g., a small wave or a gentle tap)
* Take a subtle glance at the sticky note (even if you're on your phone or in a meeting)

These physical cues can help you interrupt the narrative loop and refocus on taking a small action.

Regarding your concern about performance metrics, remember that the goal is to develop a skill that helps you cope with anxiety, not to create another source of anxiety. When you're on your phone or in a meeting, try to focus on the sensation of your anchor (the sticky-note look + slow exhale) rather than the outcome. Ask yourself: "What's happening in this moment? What's my body saying?" This can help you stay grounded and focused on the process, rather than getting caught up in performance expectations.

Patient: The three-word prompt is crisp and likely easier to access under arousal — I can see that sticking. My main worry is the log becoming another evaluative metric; can we add a nonjudgmental closure token like "done|OK|—" and define success as "pause attempted" (count of attempts) rather than PR outcome? Also, if the SNS spike drowns out verbal cues, I'd prefer a covert somatic anchor — would a discreet thumb-press to my palm be a viable in-situ fallback, or should I stick with the sticky-note glance/hand gesture?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've refined the three-word prompt, and you're thinking about the log becoming another evaluative metric. Now, you're exploring ways to make the log a more neutral, observational tool.

Goal: Introduce a nonjudgmental closure token and redefine success.

Therapist Answer:
A nonjudgmental closure token could be: "done|OK|—"

This phrase acknowledges the completion of the log entry without evaluating its quality or outcome. By framing success as "pause attempted," you're focusing on the action itself, rather than the result.

Regarding the somatic anchor, a discreet thumb-press to your palm can be a viable fallback. This physical action is subtle, easy to do discreetly, and can be an effective way to interrupt the narrative loop. You can practice this in private to ensure it feels comfortable and natural.

Consider pairing the thumb-press with the three-word prompt: "Breathe. Move. Now." This way, you'll have a clear, unambiguous cue that helps you refocus when the verbal cue is drowned out.

To further reinforce this, you can also try the sticky-note glance + slow exhale + thumb-press sequence in private, so you can gauge your reaction and make any necessary adjustments.

Patient: Alright — I’ll pair the thumb-press with the “Breathe. Move. Now.” prompt, use the closure token “done|OK|—”, and pilot the 3‑PR micro‑experiment before extending to a week. 

I’m still worried the log will feel evaluative, so I’m thinking of a minimal success code: A = attempt (pause initiated), S = success (held 5s), F = failed (reacted immediately), plus the single emotion tag — does that seem sensible and nonjudgmental? 

Also: when I’m on a call or my phone and can’t glance at a sticky note, is the discreet thumb-press alone enough, or should I add a covert breath pattern (two short exhales) to help anchor it? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m still a bit anxious it’ll become another metric.

Therapist Thinking:
You've refined the success code, and you're thinking about the log feeling evaluative. Now, you're exploring ways to make the log a more neutral, observational tool.

Goal: Finalize the success code and somatic anchor.

Therapist Answer:
The success code you've proposed, A = attempt, S = success, F = failed, with the single emotion tag, seems sensible and nonjudgmental. This format allows you to track the outcome of your pause attempts without evaluating their quality or outcome. The single emotion tag adds a minimal layer of nuance, while keeping the overall focus on the action.

Regarding the somatic anchor on-the-go, adding a covert breath pattern (two short exhales) might be a good idea. This can help you anchor the prompt more effectively, especially in situations where you can't glance at a sticky note. The two short exhales can be a subtle, discreet cue that interrupts the narrative loop and refocuses your attention.

Consider practicing the discreet thumb-press + "Breathe. Move. Now." + two short exhales sequence in different contexts (e.g., on your phone, in a meeting, or during a walk) to gauge your reaction and ensure it feels comfortable and natural.

By piloting the 3-PR micro-experiment with this refined setup, you'll be able to assess its effectiveness in reducing anxiety and improving your ability to pause and reflect. This will help you determine whether the log has become another source of anxiety or a useful tool for managing your anxiety.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how are two short exhales supposed to interrupt a full sympathetic spike when my arousal is already high? It sounds coherent as a protocol, but in practice it feels like adding another procedural layer that might just get swallowed by the alarm response. Also: in a meeting, if I do a discreet thumb‑press but don't actually hold the 5s, does that count as A or F on the log? I keep worrying this will morph into another performance metric instead of a safety skill—can you give a concrete micro-example of how this plays out (e.g., PR ping while I'm on a call) so I can actually visualize doing it?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the two short exhales might not be enough to interrupt a full sympathetic spike, and you're worried about adding another procedural layer that could get lost in the alarm response. You're also questioning how to handle situations where you don't meet the full criteria for success.

Goal: Simplify the somatic anchor and clarify the success code.

Therapist Answer:
Let's simplify the somatic anchor. Instead of two short exhales, you could use a single, brief breath (just a quick inhale or exhale) to signal that you're refocusing. This is a more subtle cue that might be less likely to get overwhelmed by the alarm response.

Regarding the success code, you're right to be cautious about adding another procedural layer. To avoid this, you could clarify that the success code only counts when you initiate a pause and hold it for at least 5 seconds. If you only do a discreet thumb-press, it would be F, and you can try to pause again and retry.

Here's a concrete micro-example:

* You're on a call, and a pull request triggers your anxiety. You feel a sympathetic spike, and your mind starts racing.
* You discreetly press your thumb against your palm (A).
* You take a brief breath (Breathe. Move. Now.) to refocus.
* You successfully pause for at least 5 seconds, logging A|anxious|PR1.
* You feel more centered, and you can continue the call.

In this example, you initiated a pause, held it for 5 seconds, and logged the attempt. If you only did the thumb-press, it would be F, and you'd try to pause again and retry.

Remember, the goal is to develop a safety skill that helps you cope with anxiety, not to create another performance metric. By keeping the log simple and focused on the action, you can avoid getting caught up in evaluation and self-judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — there's a small inconsistency that's tripping me up. You said A = attempt, S = success (held 5s), F = failed, but then the example logs A|anxious|PR1 after a 5s pause; should that be S instead? Also, I still doubt a single brief breath will reliably down-regulate a full SNS spike — can you say, in plain terms, why that would work and what to do if the verbal/breath cue gets lost in the arousal? Finally, if I'm on a call and can't log immediately, do I retroactively code (and how precise does that need to be) — I worry this will morph into a performance metric unless the rules are crystal clear.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've caught a consistency issue, and you're questioning the effectiveness of the brief breath as a cue. You're also concerned about retroactively coding and the potential for it to become a performance metric.

Goal: Clarify the success code, address the brief breath as a cue, and provide guidance on retroactive coding.

Therapist Answer:
Regarding the success code, you are correct that the example I provided earlier logs A|anxious|PR1, which is actually F (failed) since you didn't meet the 5-second pause requirement. To correct this, the correct log would be F|anxious|PR1 if you only did the discreet thumb-press.

Regarding the brief breath as a cue, I acknowledge that it might not reliably down-regulate a full SNS spike. In situations like this, the brief breath might not be enough to interrupt the alarm response. If this happens, try to focus on the physical sensation of the thumb-press on your palm, and use that as a cue to pause and refocus. This can help you break the cycle of automaticity and regain control.

If the verbal/breath cue gets lost in the arousal, simply acknowledge the thought "I've lost the cue" and try to refocus on your physical anchor (the thumb-press). Don't worry about the lost log entry; instead, focus on the next moment and take a new pause.

Regarding retroactive coding, if you can't log immediately, you can try to retroactively code yourself to F|overwhelmed|PR1. To make this clear, set a rule for yourself: if you can't log immediately, don't worry about the previous attempt. Instead, focus on the next moment and take a new pause. This helps avoid creating a performance metric out of what was initially a safety skill.

Patient: Okay—I'm getting tripped up by a couple of procedural ambiguities and need very concrete rules so this doesn't calcify into another performance metric.

Quick clarifying points so I can actually follow this in the moment:

1) Codes — spell it out in binary terms I can use without thinking: S = paused ≥5s, A = attempted pause (initiated action but <5s), F = no pause initiated. If I log later (e.g., still on a call), rule: only retro-code S/A if within 5 minutes and I can reliably remember holding the 5s; otherwise default to F/missed. Is that strict window okay?

2) Anchor hierarchy — give me a prioritized list to run through automatically if the first cue fails (so I don't have to invent under arousal). My proposed cascade: (a) glance at sticky note + thumb-press, (b) single brief exhale + say “Stop judging, see it,” (c) if still ramped, 3-count deep breath + sip of water or look away for 10s. Does that sequence seem plausible and nonperformative?

3) Micro-script rehearsal — write out a one-line script I can literally say in my head when a PR pings during a meeting (so I can visualize it). My version: “PR ping — thumb-press, breathe, stop judging, hold 5s — log later.” Is that acceptably simple?

I still feel skeptical that a breath will reliably interrupt a full SNS spike, so I want these rules to be fail-safe and forgiving. I'm anxious this will become an evaluative checklist unless the retro-coding rule and the 5-minute grace period are firm. I'm not sure this will work, but I want to try—can you confirm or adjust those three concrete items so I can rehearse them mentally?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified procedural ambiguities, and you're seeking concrete rules to ensure the system doesn't become another performance metric.

Goal: Clarify codes, anchor hierarchy, and micro-script.

Therapist Answer:
**1. Codes:**

To make it easy to remember, let's use binary terms:

* S = pause initiated (attempt) and held for ≥5s
* A = pause initiated (attempt) but <5s
* F = no pause initiated (missed)

Regarding retro-coding, a 5-minute window seems reasonable for a grace period. If you can't log immediately, and the 5 minutes pass without remembering holding the 5s, default to F/missed. This helps prevent retroactive evaluation and keeps the focus on the next moment.

**2. Anchor Hierarchy:**

Here's a prioritized list for automatic execution if the first cue fails:

1. Glance at sticky note + thumb-press
2. Single brief exhale + "Stop judging, see it"
3. If still ramped, 3-count deep breath + sip of water or look away for 10s

This sequence is designed to be non-performative and help you refocus. If the first cue fails, you can fall back to the next one.

**3. Micro-Script:**

Your script is simple and clear: "PR ping — thumb-press, breathe, stop judging, hold 5s — log later." I've added "log later" to emphasize that the focus is on the next moment, not on the log entry.

To address your concerns, I've made the following adjustments:

* The script is extremely simple and easy to remember.
* The anchor hierarchy is clear and prioritized.
* The retro-coding rule and 5-minute grace period provide a fail-safe mechanism to prevent evaluative behavior.

By following these concrete rules, you can reduce the risk of the system becoming another performance metric. Remember, the goal is to develop a safety skill to help you cope with anxiety, not to create another metric. Rehearse these rules mentally to feel more comfortable with the process.

Patient: Okay—I'm a bit confused and honestly a little overwhelmed by the procedural detail, but I want to make this executable. Quick confirmations/adjustments so I can rehearse without inventing under duress:

1) Codes: yes—S = held ≥5s, A = attempted but <5s, F = no pause. 5‑minute retro window is fine; default to F after that.  
2) Anchor hierarchy (prioritized, run automatically): (a) thumb-press + glance at sticky note, (b) single brief exhale + mental “Stop judging, see it,” (c) 3-count deep breath + look away 10s or sip water. That ordering feels less performative to me.  
3) Micro-script I can actually visualize: “PR ping — thumb-press & look, breathe, stop judging, hold 5s — log later.”

Two concrete asks before I start rehearsing: in plain terms, why would a single brief exhale interrupt a full SNS spike (what’s the physiological logic, short and nontechnical)? And please confirm that A counts as progress (i.e., we treat attempt count as the metric, not PR outcomes), because I’m worried logging will calcify into another shame test if A is treated like failure. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m still skeptical — can we role-play one micro-example together so I can actually imagine doing it in a meeting?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've confirmed the procedural details, and you're ready to move forward. Now, let's address your questions and concerns.

**1. Codes:**

Confirmed! The codes are now clear: S = held ≥5s, A = attempted but <5s, F = no pause.

**2. Anchor hierarchy:**

I agree that the ordering of the anchor hierarchy can be adjusted to reduce performative cues. Here's an alternative:

* (a) single brief exhale + mental "Stop judging, see it"
* (b) thumb-press + glance at sticky note
* (c) 3-count deep breath + look away 10s or sip water

This ordering prioritizes the mental "Stop judging, see it" phrase, which can help you interrupt the narrative loop.

**3. Micro-script:**

Your revised script is clear and concise: "PR ping — thumb-press & look, breathe, stop judging, hold 5s — log later."

**Physiological logic of a single brief exhale:**

In the context of a full SNS spike, a single brief exhale can help calm the nervous system by reducing the sympathetic tone. When we're under stress, our nervous system goes into "fight or flight" mode, characterized by increased heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate.
