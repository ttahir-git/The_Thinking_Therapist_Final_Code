Patient: I've been stuck in this pattern where I use procrastination to avoid dealing with grief from losing someone, and it's gotten worse since I started a demanding new program. I'm unemployed otherwise, so I fill my time with busywork that feels productive but really just keeps me from feeling anything. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about and I guess I worry it's making things worse.

Therapist: Can you describe what it's like when you're in the middle of a task that feels like busywork – do you ever notice that you're not really engaging with the task itself, but rather just going through the motions?

Patient: Yeah, it's like I'm on autopilot—I pick small, "productive" things and keep checking them off without actually thinking about them. I guess those tasks let me avoid the grief, but mostly I'm just going through the motions and feeling kind of numb. I don't know, it's awkward to say that out loud and I don't really know how to stop.

Therapist: Let's try to defuse the discomfort around admitting that you're using busywork as a way to avoid your emotions. Instead of saying "I'm avoiding my grief," can you say to yourself "I'm using these tasks as a way to take my mind off things right now"? What might happen if, instead of trying to avoid your emotions, you were to approach them with a sense of curiosity, like "What's going on when I feel numb or overwhelmed?"

Patient: Okay, I can say, "I'm using these tasks as a way to take my mind off things right now" — I guess saying it out loud makes it more real. Maybe if I actually got curious I'd notice what's under the numbness, like being tired, guilty, or just really scared. I don't know, it feels risky to go there; I usually just distract myself because it feels safer.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're using distraction as a way to avoid uncertainty. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you might be willing to explore what's under the numbness, even if it feels scary? For example, when was the last time you noticed what you were feeling in a moment when you weren't trying to distract yourself?

Patient: I guess a low-stakes moment could be when I'm making tea—I could sit with the cup for a couple minutes and try to notice what's happening. Last night after getting a disappointing email, I sat on the couch and felt a tightness in my chest and this hollow sadness, but I started doing the dishes to not feel it. I don't know, it still feels risky to actually stay with that stuff.

Therapist: Let's try to reframe your experience with the tightness and hollow sadness after the disappointing email. Instead of saying "I was overwhelmed and avoided the feeling," can you say to yourself "I'm noticing a physical sensation in my chest and a feeling of sadness – it's like my body is trying to tell me something"? What might happen if, instead of avoiding it, you were to stay with the sensation for just a few more breaths, without trying to distract yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I stayed with it for a few more breaths it might get louder at first, like that tightness would sharpen. Maybe after a minute it would ease or at least I'd know what I'm actually feeling instead of the fog. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed just talking about it — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to slow down. Let's take a break if you need to. Take a deep breath with me and when you're ready, we can come back to this. No pressure. Would you be willing to take a few more deep breaths with me, and when you're feeling more centered, we can try to explore this further at your pace?

Patient: Okay, I'll try taking a few deep breaths with you now. I did three slow ones and I feel a tiny bit steadier but also kind of shaky—I don't know, it brings up a lot. Can we go slower? I guess maybe just notice the chest tightness for one breath and then pause, if that's okay.

Therapist: Let's focus on the chest tightness for just one breath. Notice it for this one breath, and as you exhale, pause for a moment before taking the next breath. What's the sensation like in that one breath? (pause)

Patient: It's a tight, shallow pressure across my chest, like someone's tightening a belt; when I exhaled it eased a little but my heart was kinda racing. I don't know, I guess it feels weird and exposed to actually pay attention to it. Can we slow down and do one more breath like that?

Therapist: Let's take one more breath together. Notice the sensation in your chest, and as you exhale, pause again before taking the next breath. This time, I want you to add a slight phrase to yourself as you breathe out: "I am here with this feeling." Can you try that for one breath?

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I breathed out and said "I am here with this feeling." For that exhale the tightness eased a little, but then I felt kind of raw and wanted to look away or do something busy to avoid it. I don't know, it feels risky to stay with it; can we go slower and try one more really short breath like that? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take one more super-short breath. Just breathe in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am here with this feeling" again. This time, don't worry about the sensation or the outcome – just focus on the words and the breath. Can you do that for just one tiny breath?

Patient: Okay, I did that tiny breath and said the phrase. For a second the tightness loosened, but then a hollow sort of sadness came up and I felt this urge to get up and do something busy instead. I don't know, I guess can we just keep going slower—maybe one more really slow breath?

Therapist: Let's take another tiny breath, and this time, as you exhale, can you say to yourself "I am here with this feeling" again? But this time, also add a small phrase that acknowledges the sadness: "I am here with this feeling and this sadness too." Take your time, and just breathe with those words.

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I breathed out and said "I am here with this feeling and this sadness too." For a moment the sadness felt bigger, like a hollow under the tightness, and my eyes started to sting; I don't know, it feels raw and exposed. I guess can we slow down — maybe just sit in silence for a minute or have me name one small thing I can see in the room before we try another breath? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Therapist: It's okay to take a break and sit in silence for a minute. Just be with the sensations in your body and the thoughts in your mind. When you're ready, we can continue. For now, take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you name one small thing you can see in the room, like a chair or a picture on the wall?

Patient: I can see a chipped blue mug on the side table. Noticing it makes me feel a tiny bit steadier, but my chest's still tight and I don't know what's next.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to look at the chipped blue mug some more. Notice the color, the shape, the texture of the ceramic. Can you describe it to yourself, just for a moment, without judgment? What words come to mind when you think of this mug?

Patient: It's a chipped blue mug—dull cobalt with the glaze worn thin in spots, a small jagged chip on the rim and a faint coffee ring inside. It's squat and a bit heavy, the handle fits my fingers the way a familiar thing should. Words that come to mind: worn, steady, ordinary, a little sad. I don't know, noticing it calms me a bit, but I guess I'm nervous about getting into what it might remind me of.

Therapist: The words "ordinary" and "sad" come up, suggesting that the mug may be a trigger for your grief. Can you explore this further? What is it about this mug that feels ordinary, but also sad? Is it the fact that it's a familiar object, or the fact that it's worn and faded?

Patient: I guess it's ordinary because it's always been there — a small, steady thing that doesn’t demand much and feels familiar. But it's sad because it's worn and chipped, and looking at it brings up this shame and frustration, like I haven’t kept things together—I don't know, that feeling actually stings. I'm getting kind of uncomfortable going deeper right now; can we slow down or maybe talk about one small thing I could do when that feeling comes up instead of immediately distracting myself?

Therapist: It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your comfort. We can definitely slow down. One small thing you could do when that feeling of shame and frustration comes up is take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. You can say to yourself "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." How does that feel?

Patient: I don't know — saying "I'm doing the best I can" feels oddly true but also makes this hot shame flare up, like I'm being reminded of everything I haven't managed. I guess breathing and saying it helps a little, but I immediately want to shove the feeling away by doing something busy to prove I'm not failing. Can we slow down and come up with one very small, concrete thing I can do in that moment—like a 2-minute grounding task—so I don't just default to distracting myself?

Therapist: Let's focus on a 2-minute grounding task to help you feel more grounded and centered when you're feeling overwhelmed. When that shame and frustration come up again, take 2 minutes to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sounds around you. That's it – just notice these things for 2 minutes without trying to change or distract yourself. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I can try that — I'll give it two minutes. When the shame and frustration hit I get this urgent need to prove I'm not failing, so I usually jump into busywork; I don't know if just noticing my feet and the air will be enough. I'm a little scared it'll just make the shame louder, so can we agree on a tiny follow-up, like you checking in for 30 seconds afterward if it feels overwhelming?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to give this a try. We can definitely agree on a follow-up check-in. Let's aim to check in with each other in 30 seconds after you've finished the 2-minute grounding task. If you're feeling overwhelmed, you can signal to me, and we can come back to it together. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know, I guess that sounds okay — I'll try the 2 minutes and wait for your 30‑second check-in. I'm already bracing though; there's this sharp shame/annoyance that tells me I'll just bail and do something busy instead, so if it gets overwhelming can we switch to a 30‑second concrete task (like naming five things I can touch) instead of staying with it?

Therapist: I completely understand. If you find that the 2-minute grounding task becomes overwhelming, we can definitely switch to a 30-second concrete task like naming five things you can touch. Let's agree that if you need to switch, you can signal to me, and we'll pivot to the 30-second task. For now, let's start the 2-minute grounding task. Take a deep breath and begin.

Patient: Okay—I took a deep breath and tried to start, but my mind just jumped around and I feel suddenly anxious and distracted; my hands are a bit shaky. I don't know, I guess I'm bracing for it to get worse, so can we switch to the 30‑second task now and I'll name five things I can touch? I'm already worried I'll bail, so please check in after.

Therapist: I completely understand. It's okay to switch to the 30-second task. Let's take a deep breath and start fresh. I'll check in with you in 30 seconds. When you're ready, just start naming five things you can touch – it's a very simple and low-stakes task. Remember, there's no right or wrong, just your voice and your fingers. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. Um… the chipped blue mug, the couch fabric under my hand, the wooden edge of the side table, my sweatshirt sleeve, and the carpet by my foot. I don't know, my hands are really shaky and my mind keeps jumping around — I guess I'm already worrying I'll bail and do something busy instead. Can you check in in 30 seconds like we planned? If it spikes can we switch to that quick five-things-I-can-see task?

Therapist: I'll check in with you in 30 seconds. If you need to switch, we'll pivot to the quick five-things-I-can-see task. Take another deep breath and focus on your hand – notice the sensation of the fingers, the weight of the hand, and the sensation of touching the blue mug. Let's go for the full 30 seconds.

Patient: I tried to focus on my hand and the mug, but my heart started racing and my thoughts kept darting off to this stupid, shamey feeling — it's frustrating and makes me want to get up. I don't know, I could only hold it for maybe ten seconds before I felt like bailing. Can we switch to the five-things-I-can-see task now? I'm really anxious about losing it.

Therapist: Let's switch to the five-things-I-can-see task. Take a deep breath and notice your surroundings – what do you see around you? Can you name five things that are visible in the room?

Patient: Okay… um—here goes: the chipped blue mug on the side table, the couch fabric under my hand, the framed picture on the wall, a lamp with a little dent in the base, and my laptop screen. I don't know, saying those makes this hot shame flare and my hands are shaking — I keep wanting to get up and do something. Can you check in with me now? If it spikes can we switch to the touching task or a minute of breathing?

Therapist: I'm checking in with you now. You're feeling a strong sense of shame and anxiety, and your hands are shaking. That's okay. It's okay to feel this way. Can you take one more deep breath with me, and let's see if we can calm down a bit? If you need to, we can switch to the touching task or take a minute to breathe. What do you need right now?

Patient: I don't know... I need the touching task right now. My hands are really shaky and this hot shame/annoyance is flaring up and making me want to run, so can we do 30 seconds of naming five things I can touch and then you check in right after? Tell me when to start.

Therapist: Let's start the 30-second task. When you're ready, start naming five things you can touch, and I'll check in with you immediately after. Remember, I'm here to support you, and there's no pressure. When you're ready, take a deep breath and begin: "I'm going to name five things you can touch..."

Patient: Okay… I'm naming five things I can touch: the chipped blue mug, the couch fabric under my hand, my sweatshirt sleeve, the wooden edge of the side table, and the carpet by my foot. I don't know—my hands are really shaky and I feel kind of stupid; can you check in now?

Therapist: I'm here for you. Your hands are shaking, and it's okay to feel that way. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Take a deep breath with me, and let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. We're in this together.

Patient: I took that breath — I guess I'm a tiny bit calmer, but the shame's still loud and my hands are shaky and I feel overwhelmed. I don't know, I keep thinking I should be up doing something to prove I'm not failing instead of sitting here. Can we slow down and do one minute of paced breathing with you counting, something concrete I can follow?

Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's take a minute to pace our breathing together. I'll count slowly and calmly, and you can follow along. On the count of three, inhale deeply through your nose... one... two... three. Hold for a second... four... five... six... and exhale slowly through your mouth... six... five... four... three... two... one. We'll do this for one minute, and I'll check in with you when it's over.

Patient: I tried to follow the breathing — I think it helped a little, but my hands are still shaking and that hot shame's still loud, and I feel really anxious and distracted. I don't know, I guess I'm overwhelmed right now; can we slow down? Maybe we could do one very small concrete step I can use when the urge to bail comes up, like a 30‑second grounding or a checklist I can keep by the mug.

Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's take a moment to think about what small step you could take when the urge to bail comes up. Can you imagine yourself doing something small, like taking one sip of water, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground? Or maybe you could write down one thing you're willing to try, no matter how small it feels? We can work on creating a checklist or a trigger phrase that you can use to help you stay on track. What sounds like a small, manageable step to you?

Patient: I guess a tiny manageable step could be a sticky-note checklist by the mug: (1) three slow breaths, (2) sip some water, (3) name three things you can touch — 30 seconds total. I don't know, it feels kind of dumb and my shame's already flaring, but it's concrete so maybe I won't bail. Can we try it now and have you time me for 30 seconds and check in after?

Therapist: Let's try the checklist together. I'll time you for 30 seconds. On the count of three, start the checklist and I'll check in with you when it's over. Remember, it's okay if you feel silly or if your shame flares up – we're just trying to build a small habit of taking care of yourself. When you're ready, start the checklist: (1) three slow breaths, (3... and...

Patient: Okay, starting now — one, two, three. I did three slow breaths; they helped a bit but my hands are still shaky. Took a small sip of water. Named three things I can touch: the chipped blue mug, the couch fabric, my sweatshirt sleeve. 

I guess I feel a tiny bit steadier but the shame's still loud and I keep wanting to get up and do something. Can you check in like we planned? I'm already bracing that I'll bail, so please tell me what you notice.
