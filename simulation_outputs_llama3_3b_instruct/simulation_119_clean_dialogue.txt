Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — I can't tell what matters to me beyond being a data scientist, and losing work has made it worse. I'm burned out and anxious about instability, like nothing else outside that role seems to matter. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about this supposed to change anything?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "losing work" feeling like a big blow to your sense of purpose? What, if anything, is keeping you from feeling like a data scientist in the same way after losing your job?

Patient: Losing the job felt like someone pulled the floor out from under me — being a data scientist wasn't just a paycheck, it was my routine, my social circle, and how I measured my worth. Since the layoff, I try to work on side projects or take courses but it all feels hollow, like the things that used to light me up now just remind me of how burned out I am. I think part of it is that my identity got wrapped up in titles and external validation, so without that the role doesn't stick the same way — I don't feel like "me" when I try to do the same stuff. But honestly, I've tried talking about this, planning, networking, even volunteering — how is talking about it here supposed to actually help me get past the stuck, directionless feeling?

Therapist: I can understand why talking about this might feel like a waste of time. But sometimes, the first step to finding a new path is acknowledging what's truly important to us. Can you think of a time when you felt truly fulfilled and engaged in your work as a data scientist, before your role changed? What, if anything, was it about that experience that you valued most?

Patient: There was this one project where we built a churn model that actually cut churn — I was right in the thick of it, figuring features, iterating models, and presenting results that people used. I loved the problem-solving, the clear impact, and the team energy — it felt like what I did mattered. But how is me remembering that supposed to help now? I've tried recreating that with side projects and meetups and it just doesn't stick.

Therapist: I sense that you're holding onto the idea that there's one specific experience that will be the key to unlocking your passion and purpose. Can you consider that maybe the value wasn't in the specific project, but in the qualities you brought to it – like the problem-solving, the team energy, or the sense of impact? What if, instead of looking for a single experience to trigger your passion, we explored ways to cultivate those qualities in your daily life?

Patient: Yeah, I can see that — the churn project had the problem-solving, the team energy, and real impact. The thing is, I've tried to recreate those qualities with solo side projects, meetups, and volunteering, and it just feels hollow — no real stakes, no team that actually relies on me, no feedback loop. How is that supposed to help me get unstuck if all the stuff I try feels fake? Can you give me concrete ways to bring those elements back into my day-to-day that don't just feel like pretending?

Therapist: I understand why solo projects and meetups feel hollow. One thing to consider is that your desire for real stakes and feedback might be rooted in a fear of being invisible or underutilized. Can you think of a time when you felt like you were making progress, even if it was slow or imperfect? Maybe we can explore a simple experiment to introduce a sense of accountability and feedback in your daily life, like a "done" list, or a small, imperfect task that you commit to completing each day?

Patient: Okay, I get the idea of a "done" list, but how is that supposed to recreate real stakes? I've made to-do lists and set tiny tasks before and they just became something I ignored — it feels hollow without people depending on it. The only time I felt slow progress was when I had weekly demos with my team — knowing others would use the results forced me to finish things. If we're going to try this, it needs real accountability — like committing to show progress to someone, pairing with a peer for weekly reviews, or having a public deadline — otherwise it just feels like pretending again.

Therapist: I think you're right that external accountability can be a powerful motivator. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a peer buddy or accountability partner who would check in with you regularly, not to critique, but to simply acknowledge and celebrate your progress together? Maybe we can brainstorm ways to find someone who shares similar interests and values, or even join a community of professionals who work in a related field?

Patient: Okay, I like the idea in theory, but I’m skeptical — free meetups and vague buddies have flaked on me before. If we’re serious, I want concrete options that create real stakes: (1) ask a trusted ex-colleague for a 6-week weekly demo slot, (2) join a small paid accountability cohort or coach (money = binding), or (3) take a tiny paid freelance or pro-bono gig with fixed deliverables so someone actually depends on me. Can you help me draft a short message to an ex-colleague or an example post for a cohort that sets clear expectations (weekly 30-min demo, deliverable, and a fallback if someone flakes)? Also — how do I handle the anxiety of being judged when I present imperfect work?

Therapist: Let's start with drafting a clear and specific message to your ex-colleague or cohort. Here's an example:

"Hey [Name], I'm interested in exploring a 6-week demo slot to work on [specific project/area]. I'd like to propose the following:

* Weekly 30-minute demos to share progress and receive feedback
* A clear deliverable (e.g., a specific report or presentation) by the end of each week
* A fallback plan in case I flake or need to cancel (e.g., a video call or phone call)

If you're available and willing to commit to this, let me know and we can schedule a start date. If not, I'd be happy to explore other options.

Regarding anxiety about presenting imperfect work, can you think of a time when you received feedback on something you thought was flawed? How did you respond to it? What might it take for you to feel more comfortable sharing your work, even if it's not perfect?"

Patient: The draft is close, but it's still a bit vague — I need something more concrete and binding. A couple tweaks I'd want: add a proposed start date/time (with timezone), specify the meeting format (15–20 min demo + 10–15 min feedback), allow one reschedule per person with a requirement to send a 5-minute async update if they miss, and state a fallback (recorded update emailed). Also include confidentiality and a short clause asking for one actionable suggestion per session. If you suggest money as binding, be concrete (e.g., $20/session to hold the slot) — though I’m skeptical money always works.

About feedback: the churn-model demo I mentioned got real praise and I felt proud and energized — that’s what I want to get back. But other times when I got harsh critique I either got defensive or shut down and avoided showing work again for weeks. So what helps me is a clear frame up-front that this is a work-in-progress and a tight ask from reviewers (like “one question, one action item”), plus a short script I can use to open the demo so I don’t have to improvise when I’m anxious.

Can you draft:
1) A short message I can send to an ex-colleague with those concrete items (start date, format, reschedule rule, fallback, confidentiality, and optional small fee).  
2) A brief cohort post (one paragraph) that lists the commitment, deliverables, price, and limited spots.  
3) A 2–3 line opening script I can use at the start of each demo to reduce anxiety and invite focused feedback.

And be blunt — I’ll push back if it sounds fluffy. How is that supposed to actually reduce the fear of being judged?

Therapist: Here are the drafts you requested:

**Message to ex-colleague:**

"Hey [Name], I'm interested in setting up a 6-week demo series (starting [Proposed Start Date] at [Timezone]) to work on [Specific Project/Area]. Here are the details:

* Weekly 15-20 minute demos + 10-15 minute feedback session
* Reschedule policy: if I flake, you'll send a 5-minute async update; if you flake, I'll send a recorded 10-minute update to share with the group
* Confidentiality: everything shared during these sessions will remain confidential
* Optional: $20/session to hold the slot (if you're interested, please reply with a yes/no)
* Commitment: I'll deliver a specific report/presentation by the end of each week

If you're interested, let's schedule a time to discuss further.

**Cohort Post:**

"Join our 6-week accountability cohort! For $100, you'll receive:

* Weekly 15-20 minute demos + 10-15 minute feedback session
* A clear, structured format to help you stay on track and make progress
* A supportive community of peers who will help you grow and learn

Limited spots available. If interested, reply with a yes/no by [Date]."

**Opening Script:**

"Hello everyone, welcome to our weekly demo session. I want to start by saying thank you for taking the time to review my work, even if it's not perfect. Before we begin, I want to set a clear expectation: this is a work-in-progress, and I'm open to constructive feedback that will help me improve. I'll do my best to keep the demo focused, and I appreciate any one question or action item you have to help me move forward."

As for reducing the fear of being judged, I'd argue that the clear structure and boundaries in these commitments can actually help alleviate anxiety. By setting a clear expectation for the format, deliverables, and feedback, you're creating a sense of predictability and control. The confidentiality clause also helps to reduce the fear of judgment or criticism. The opening script aims to reframe the mindset to focus

Patient: This is closer, but still too soft — I need language that actually creates consequences and reduces ambiguity. A few concrete tweaks I want you to make now:

- For the ex-colleague message: include a firm start date/time (with timezone), a meeting link placeholder, payment method and refund rule (e.g., Venmo/CashApp collected up front, refunded only if canceled 48h before), one reschedule allowed per person with 24h notice otherwise async update required, and a line: “Please give one actionable next step per session.”  
- For the cohort post: state the exact price for the full 6 weeks (e.g., $120), max 6 spots, start date, weekly time commitment, and a “no refunds after week 1” policy to keep it binding.  
- Opening script — tighten it: two lines max: “Quick context (30s): goal and what I tried. Please give one question and one concrete action I can do before next week.”  

Also give me two 1–2 line comebacks I can use mid-demo when feedback feels judgmental, e.g.:
- “Thanks — that’s helpful. Can you translate that into one specific next step I can deliver by next week?”  
- “I’m hearing critique; I’ll note it, but can you name one change that would actually move the metric/goal I care about?”

And be blunt: how does this actually reduce the fear of being judged? I want practical answers — like rehearsal, scripted responses, and tightly bounded feedback — not pep talks. Can you draft those exact revised messages and the two comebacks now, and then roleplay a harsh-but-useful piece of feedback so I can test one of the comebacks? I'm skeptical, but let's try.

Therapist: Here are the revised drafts:

**Message to ex-colleague:**

"Hey [Name], I'm setting up a 6-week demo series (starting [Firm Start Date at [Timezone] PDT] at 2 PM EST) to work on [Specific Project/Area]. Here are the details:

* Payment: $20/session, paid via Venmo ( [Venmo Handle] )
* Refund policy: no refunds after week 1; if you cancel within 48 hours of the scheduled demo, your payment will be refunded.

"Quick context: goal and what I tried. Please give one question and one concrete action I can do before next week."

**Comeback 2:**
"Thanks — that's helpful. Can you translate that into one specific next step I can deliver by next week?"

As for reducing the fear of being judged, here are some practical solutions:

* Rehearsal: Practice the opening script and comebacks in front of a mirror or with a friend to feel more comfortable with the language.
* Scripted responses: Write down potential feedback scenarios and practice responding with the comebacks.
* Tightly bounded feedback: When receiving feedback, take a moment to acknowledge the

Patient: These look a lot closer to something I'd actually send — thanks — but a couple quick issues before we test it: the start time line is inconsistent (PDT vs EST), and I don't love how transactional the $20 ask sounds to an ex-colleague — can you give a one-sentence alternative phrasing that still creates consequence but feels less like "pay me to be my friend"? 

Also, let's do the roleplay now: give me a harsh-but-useful piece of feedback on a churn-model demo slide (say you’re a product manager who thinks the model won’t move the business metric), and I’ll respond using Comeback 1: “I’m hearing critique; I’ll note it, but can you name one change that would actually move the metric/goal I care about?” Be blunt in the feedback so I can practice.

Therapist: Here are the revised drafts:

**Alternative phrasing:**
"Hey [Name], I'd love to work with you on this project. To make it worth your time, I'm asking for a commitment to show up and provide feedback. In return, I'll make sure to deliver a high-quality demo and provide a clear understanding of how we can work together."

**Harsh-but-useful feedback:**

"Hi, I appreciate the effort you put into the churn-model demo, but I have to be honest, I'm not convinced that the changes you made will move the needle on our key metric. Specifically, I'm concerned that the feature you added may actually increase churn instead of decrease it. Can you help me understand your thought process behind this change and what data you're using to support it?"

Now, let's do the roleplay. You can respond using Comeback 1: "I'm hearing critique; I'll note it, but can you name one change that would actually move the metric/goal I care about?"

Patient: I'm hearing critique; I'll note it, but can you name one change that would actually move the metric/goal I care about?

Therapist: Product Manager: "One change that might actually move the metric is simplifying the feature's dependencies. If we can reduce the number of components that interact with this feature, we've seen in the past that it can lead to a 10-15% decrease in churn. However, I'd need to see some more data on how you've structured the dependencies in this version to be convinced. Can you walk me through that?"

Now it's your turn again. How do you respond?

Patient: Okay — quick walkthrough: in this build the feature touches three components: auth-service (for flags), the recommendation engine (for scoring), and the email pipeline (for re-engagement). I added a client-side event that triggers a server-side join between auth and rec-engine, which increases coupling and could cause spurious re-engagements that raise churn.

Plan: I'll (1) send a dependency diagram + call flow, (2) propose a decoupling option (move decision server-side behind a feature flag and fall back to current logic), and (3) draft a 5% A/B rollout with clear metrics (7‑day retention, 7‑day churn, and conversion lift) and success thresholds. I can have the diagram and A/B plan within 48 hours — which would you prefer to see first, and what exact metric threshold would convince you this change is worth pushing?

Therapist: Product Manager: "That's a good start. I appreciate the transparency on the dependencies. However, I'm still concerned about the coupling between the components. Can you elaborate on why you think the decoupling option is worth pursuing? What's the minimum viable proof that we need to demonstrate to justify the investment in this change? And what's the most concrete, tangible metric you can commit to tracking for the next 2 weeks to measure the effectiveness of this change?"

In this response, I'm trying to push for more concrete evidence and metrics to convince me of the potential value of the decoupling option. I'm also trying to make it clear that I need to see more than just theoretical reasoning or hypothetical benefits.

Patient: Totally get the push for concrete evidence — here’s how I’d make the decoupling actually testable and low-risk.

Why decouple (short): decoupling removes the spurious client-side trigger that’s causing accidental re-engagements, lowers blast radius (easier rollback), and gives clean attribution for any behavior change so we can know whether the feature itself helps or hurts. It’s worth trying because it turns a guessy, coupled change into a controlled experiment with a clear rollback path.

Minimum viable proof (exact): 
- Implement the decision server-side behind a feature flag (no client-side event join). 
- Do a 5% randomized A/B rollout (treatment = decoupled logic) for 2 weeks.  
- Collect primary and safety metrics and compare to control.

Primary metric to track (what I commit to for the next 2 weeks):
- 7-day retention delta (cohort-level). Success threshold: >= +3 percentage points absolute improvement OR a >=5% relative reduction in 7‑day churn. 

Immediate indicators / safety metrics (tracked daily):
- 24-hour retention, conversion lift on the targeted action, error rate and latency for the involved services, and support/ops alerts related to these flows. Fail-fast rule: if error rate or latency increases by >0.5pp or we see a spike in support tickets, we roll back.

Concrete deliverables & timeline (what I’ll produce):
- Within 48 hours: dependency diagram + decoupling design + A/B spec (including randomization plan, sample size estimates, metrics, dashboard queries, and analysis plan).  
- After alignment: deploy server-side flag and start a 5% rollout within ~72 hours.

Question for you: is +3pp (or 5% churn reduction) the right success bar, or do you want a different threshold or more conservative safety limits?

Therapist: You've provided a clear and structured approach to testing the decoupling option, with a clear plan for implementation, metrics, and safety measures.

As for the success threshold, I'd like to see a more conservative estimate. While +3% improvement in retention is a good starting point, I'd like to see a more stringent threshold to ensure that the decoupling option is genuinely beneficial. How about a 1% absolute improvement in retention, or a 10% relative reduction in 7-day churn as the success threshold?

This would provide a more stringent test of the decoupling option, making it more likely that we'll see a genuine improvement in the outcome. Additionally, it would also provide more wiggle room for potential failures or variations in the experiment.

Let's assume we set the success threshold to 1% absolute improvement in retention. What do you think?

Patient: Okay — with that 1% absolute improvement as the bar, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it’s a stricter and more convincing threshold — on the other, I’m anxious this could be unrealistic for a 5% rollout over two weeks and set us up to “fail” in a way that’ll look bad. 

Practically, before committing I need two concrete things: (1) a quick power/sample-size check — what sample or rollout % would reliably detect a 1% absolute lift in 7‑day retention in 2 weeks? (2) a smaller-success rubric: if we don’t hit 1% but see positive directionality plus strong safety signals and a meaningful boost in early indicators (24‑hour retention or conversion), can that count as “progress” that justifies scaling? 

I’ll draft the A/B spec to aim for the 1% bar, but I need your call on whether to bump rollout% (so we can detect it) or accept the two-tier outcome plan. Also — I’m nervous about how this will be judged if we miss it, so can we agree now on how results will be framed to stakeholders if we get mixed signals?

Therapist: To estimate the required sample size, let's use the formula for a two-sample proportion test:

n = (Z^2 \* p \* (1-p)) / E^2

where:
n = sample size
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)
p = true proportion (0.01 for 1% absolute improvement)
E = margin of error (0.01 for 1% absolute improvement)

Plugging in some numbers, we get:

n ≈ 384

This means we'd need a sample size of at least 384 users to detect a 1% absolute improvement in 7-day retention with 95% confidence.

Regarding the two-tier outcome plan, I agree that it's a good way to manage expectations. Here's a possible framing for the results:

"We're excited to share the results of our experiment on decoupling the recommendation engine from the auth service. While we didn't quite hit the 1% absolute improvement in 7-day retention, we did see a positive directionality in the data and strong safety signals, including improved 24-hour retention and conversion lift. This suggests that the decoupling approach may be a step in the right direction, and we're excited to explore further. We'll continue to monitor the data and consider scaling the approach based on future results."

This framing acknowledges the failure to meet the exact threshold while highlighting the positive trends and signals in the data.

As for how to handle mixed signals, we can agree that if we don't hit the 1% threshold, we'll frame the results in a way that emphasizes the progress made and the potential for future improvements. We can also discuss how to handle the emotional response to missing the threshold, such as reframing it as a learning opportunity or a necessary step towards future success.

Patient: Okay — I'm getting kind of anxious about this and I need practical clarity, not hand-wavy numbers.

First, that n≈384 is wrong for a 1% absolute lift — you used p=0.01 as if that's the baseline, but p should be the baseline retention (e.g., if baseline 7‑day retention is 20%). Using a standard two‑sample test with alpha=0.05 and 80% power, detecting a 1 percentage‑point lift from 20% → 21% needs roughly 25,500 users per group (≈51k total). So yeah — a 5% rollout over two weeks is almost certainly underpowered; we'd need much more traffic or a much bigger effect.

Given that, I need concrete options, not pep talk:
- Do we (A) increase rollout % (how high) or (B) extend the experiment duration (how long) or (C) target a larger minimum detectable effect (e.g., 3pp) so sample sizes are realistic?
- Draft one short, blunt stakeholder-facing paragraph that frames mixed results (hit/not hit + directionality + next step) and two one-line responses to the likely questions: “Why didn’t we hit 1%?” and “Are we rolling this out or killing it?”

Also — I'm panicking about being judged if this looks like a failure. Can you give me a 1‑sentence script to open the stakeholder debrief (so I don’t implode), and then let’s roleplay the Q&A so I can rehearse responses? I don’t want to stop here.

Therapist: To address the underpowered experiment, I recommend option C: targeting a larger minimum detectable effect (e.g., 3pp) to make the sample sizes more realistic. This would require adjusting the baseline retention and the desired effect size, but it would also provide a more conservative and realistic estimate of the experiment's power.

Here's the updated calculation:

n = (Z^2 \* (p - delta) \* (1 - p)) / E^2

where:
n = sample size
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)
p = baseline retention (e.g., 20%)
delta = desired effect size (e.g., 3pp)
E = margin of error (e.g., 3pp)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

n ≈ 9,600

This is a more realistic estimate of the sample size required to detect a 3pp effect with 95% confidence.

Now, let's draft the stakeholder-facing paragraph:

"We conducted an experiment to decouple the recommendation engine from the auth service to improve 7-day retention. While we didn't meet the 1% absolute improvement target, we observed a positive trend in the data, with improved 24-hour retention and conversion lift. We'll consider scaling the approach based on future results and continue to monitor the data for any signs of improvement."

And here are two one-line responses to the likely questions:

* "Why didn't we hit 1%?" → "We didn't have enough sample size to detect a statistically significant effect, but we observed a positive trend in the data."
* "Are we rolling this out or killing it?" → "We'll consider scaling the approach based on future results, but for now, we're evaluating the findings and discussing next steps."

Now, here's a 1-sentence script to open the stakeholder debrief:

"Let's take a moment to acknowledge the effort and learnings from this experiment, and discuss the implications for our next steps."

Let's roleplay the Q&A session. I'll play the role of a stakeholder, and

Patient: Okay — let's do the Q&A roleplay, but I'm jittery and distracted right now, so I need you to hit me with a real, blunt stakeholder question. I'll open with the one-line debrief script and try the canned responses if pushed. Ask me the first hard question (like "Why didn't we hit 1%?") and we'll go from there.

Therapist: Let's get into the roleplay.

You're standing in front of a group of stakeholders, with a projector behind you displaying the experiment results. You take a deep breath and start with the debrief script:

"Let's take a moment to acknowledge the effort and learnings from this experiment, and discuss the implications for our next steps."

The stakeholders nod, and I, as a skeptical stakeholder, speak up:

"Why didn't we hit 1%? We invested a lot of time and resources into this project. What went wrong?"

Go ahead and respond with the canned response, "We didn't have enough sample size to detect a statistically significant effect, but we observed a positive trend in the data."

Patient: "We didn't have enough sample size to detect a statistically significant effect, but we observed a positive trend in the data." 

Sorry — I'm a little nervous saying this, but practically that means the 5%/2‑week rollout was underpowered for a 1pp bar. We have three concrete paths: (A) increase rollout % to get signal faster, (B) extend the test duration to accrue more users, or (C) target a larger detectable effect (e.g., 3pp) and treat this as directional proof; which do you want me to pursue first?

Therapist: I nod thoughtfully, and respond:

"I appreciate your candor about the underpowered experiment. I'm not sure I'm comfortable rolling out a feature that we can't even say has a statistically significant impact. That's a pretty big risk.

Let's take a closer look at each of those options. Increasing the rollout percentage or extending the test duration might help, but it's also going to require more resources and time. And targeting a larger detectable effect might make the results more convincing, but it also means we're committing to a more ambitious goal.

Can you tell me more about the trade-offs between each of those options? What are the implications for our users, our business, and our team if we pursue each of those paths?"

Patient: Okay — I’m a little jittery about this, but here’s a straight, practical breakdown of the trade-offs and what each path actually means for users, the business, and the team.

Option A — Increase rollout % (bigger percent assigned to treatment)
- Pros: Get statistical signal faster; can detect smaller lifts in a short window.  
- Cons: Higher user exposure / blast radius (more people see the change if it’s harmful); higher ops/QA risk and potential support load; faster feedback loop but higher near-term risk.  
- Business implication: Faster decision-making (good if time-sensitive) but higher chance of visible regressions.  
- Team implication: More deployment coordination, faster monitoring, quicker rollback readiness.

Option B — Extend experiment duration
- Pros: Lower per-day risk (same small rollout but more time to accrue sample); smaller blast radius at any moment; reduces volatility from daily noise.  
- Cons: Slower decision, possible confounders (seasonality, product changes), slower learning cycle.  
- Business implication: Safer, but delays product decisions and potential opportunity cost.  
- Team implication: Longer monitoring and analysis window; less urgent ops burden.

Option C — Target a larger minimum detectable effect (e.g., 3pp instead of 1pp)
- Pros: Much smaller sample requirement so test is feasible with low rollout and short duration; easier to get clean signal.  
- Cons: You’ll miss smaller but real wins; if the true effect is <3pp, you may prematurely stop something that actually helps.  
- Business implication: Favors big bets over incremental gains; less operational risk.  
- Team implication: Simpler rollout/monitoring and less pressure on rapid data collection.

Concrete samples/examples (so this isn’t hand-wavy)
- To detect a 1 percentage-point absolute lift from a 20% baseline with ~80% power and alpha=0.05 you need ~51k total users (≈25.5k per arm).  
- To detect a 3pp lift under the same assumptions you need roughly ~9.6k total users.  
- So whether you increase rollout or extend duration depends on your 2‑week user pool. Example: if 2‑week traffic = 100k users, you’d need ~51% assignment to detect 1pp (impractical); if 2‑week traffic = 1M users, 5% assignment is probably enough.

What I recommend (practical, low-regret path)
1. Run a quick power check using our actual 2‑week user population (I need the 2‑week active user count). That tells us exactly how much rollout or time we need.  
2. If stakeholders want a fast answer (decision in ~2 weeks): increase rollout % to whatever the power calc says is necessary. If that rollout % is >15–20%, add extra monitoring and a strict fail‑fast rule.  
3. If stakeholders want minimal user risk: extend the experiment duration until we hit the required sample size.  
4. If ops or stakeholders refuse both, switch target to a larger MDE (e.g., 3pp) and treat the current run as directional proof-of-concept before scaling.

Short, blunt stakeholder-facing messaging (one-paragraph)
- "The experiment showed a positive direction but was underpowered for the 1pp target given the assignment and time window; we observed improved early indicators (24‑hour retention, conversion), and recommend either increasing assignment for a short, controlled rollout to get statistical power quickly or extending the experiment duration. If you prefer minimal user exposure, we can instead target a larger, more detectable effect size (3pp) and proceed with a lower rollout."

Two one-line answers to the likely follow-ups
- "Why didn’t we hit 1%?" → "Because with the current traffic and a 5%/2‑week setup we didn’t have enough users to reliably detect a 1pp lift — we saw directionality, but not statistical significance."  
- "Are we rolling this out or killing it?" → "Not rolling to 100% yet — we should either increase assignment for a short, monitored test or extend the experiment; killing it now throws away directional signals."

A one-sentence opening for the stakeholder debrief (so I don’t implode)
- "We learned useful things: the change shows positive early signals but the test was underpowered for our 1pp bar — here are three concrete options and my recommended next step."

I’m nervous about how this will look if we miss, so can we agree now on which path you want (A: increase rollout %, B: extend duration, or C: raise MDE to 3pp)? Also I need the expected 2‑week active user count so I can give exact rollout % / duration numbers.
