Patient: Lately I've been stuck under this heavy sadness and I can't seem to get motivated after a huge fight with my family — it's spilling into my relationship and my work. My mind keeps running the worst-case tape: I fall behind at the office, I get fired, my partner leaves, and I'm left alone and ruined. I can't shake it, it feels like that's exactly what's going to happen.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses intense feelings of hopelessness, with a fear of potential negative outcomes (loss of job and relationship) linked to their current struggles. One specific theme to explore is the catastrophic thinking pattern that's perpetuating their stuckness. The goal for the answer is to introduce a process to gently challenge this catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you think about those worst-case scenarios? What's the first thing that pops into your mind when you imagine yourself falling behind at work or losing your job?

Patient: When I picture falling behind at work, the first thing is my boss telling me I'm not pulling my weight, then a performance plan, then being let go — like a chain reaction that I can already see. After that it just spirals: no income, we lose the house, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and I'm left alone and ruined — I can't shake the certainty that that's how it goes. My chest tightens and my mind locks onto that story so hard I can't focus on the actual tasks in front of me. Honestly, any suggestion that it could turn out okay just feels unreal to me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is heavily invested in a catastrophic outcome chain, and their mind is stuck on the perceived inevitability of it. One area to explore further is the role of certainty in this thinking pattern. The goal for the answer is to encourage willingness to explore an alternative perspective.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're not just worried about the outcome, but also certain about it. Can you try to make a small, tiny space for a different possibility? Just for a moment, imagine that maybe, just maybe, you're able to avoid that chain reaction – perhaps you get a chance to re-evaluate your performance, or your boss has a different conversation. What would it be like, in that moment, if you had some small, tiny glimmer of hope?

Patient: If I let a tiny glimmer in, it feels like a quick warm spot — like maybe my boss actually asks how I'm doing and offers time to catch up, or my partner sits down and says they'll stick by me. But honestly, that thought gets swatted away immediately: my brain says that's just the calm before the storm, they give me a chance and then cut me loose next month and everything collapses. It leaves me feeling foolish for even hoping and then more panicked than before.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a push-pull between a tiny glimmer of hope and the certainty of their catastrophic outcome. One specific theme to explore is the role of values in guiding their thinking. The goal for the answer is to help the patient connect with values that might counterbalance their catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a value that's really important to you – something that would make you feel strong and capable, even in the face of uncertainty? What would that value be, and how might it be relevant to your situation right now?

Patient: I guess being dependable — I've always prided myself on being someone people can count on at work and at home. If I could live that value now it would make me feel a bit steadier and more capable, but my brain snaps it away: even if I try to be dependable I'll slip up, they'll notice, it just ends with me losing my job and my partner and being alone, so it sort of feels pointless to even aim for it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a value of being dependable, but it's being used to reinforce their catastrophic thinking. One area to explore further is the concept of perfectionism and the role of self-acceptance in defusing this pattern. The goal for the answer is to introduce an ACT technique to challenge perfectionism and cultivate self-acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling with the idea that your attempts to be dependable might not be enough. Can you try to accept yourself as you are, right now, in this moment, rather than striving for some idealized version of dependability? I'd like to try something called "self-as-context" – can you repeat after me: "I am, as I am, in this moment, dependable enough"?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. "I am, as I am, in this moment, dependable enough." Saying it out loud feels hollow — my mind snaps right back to "no, you're fooling yourself, you'll still fail and they'll leave." I'm getting kind of overwhelmed by that, can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to accept themselves as they are, and the self-acceptance exercise is not having the desired effect. One area to explore further is the process of defusion, to help the patient detach from their catastrophic thinking. The goal for the answer is to gently challenge the notion that self-acceptance is a static state.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and explore what's happening when you say "I am, as I am, dependable enough". What's happening to your body, what thoughts are popping up, what emotions are arising? Can you notice the sensation of your mind snapping back to those catastrophic thoughts, and see that as a process, rather than a fixed state?

Patient: My chest tightens, my breathing gets shallow and my stomach knots — it’s like my body locks up. Then the machine starts: “you’ll fail, they’ll fire you, you’ll lose the house, they’ll leave” — it’s automatic and feels like a fact, not just a thought. I can try to watch it as a series of events in my head, but that just feels ridiculous and makes me more panicked — can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a physiological response to catastrophic thinking, and defusion is not yielding a break in the cycle. One area to explore further is the use of mindfulness to create space from the catastrophic narrative. The goal for the answer is to introduce a mindfulness exercise to create a small, temporary pause in the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, the rise and fall of your chest. Can you stay with this sensation of the breath for just a moment, without trying to change it or let go of it, just observe it as it is?

Patient: I did try to follow the breath — for a second I noticed my feet on the floor and the air on my skin and it felt a tiny bit calmer. Then the fortune-telling machine kicked in: “you’ll get fired, lose the house, they’ll leave,” and my chest tightened and my breathing went shallow again. I'm feeling overwhelmed by how fast it snaps back — can we slow down some more?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to sustain a mindful pause, and the catastrophic thinking is quickly resurfacing. One area to explore further is the concept of values in action, to help the patient connect with actions that align with their values despite the thoughts. The goal for the answer is to introduce a small, value-driven action to create a sense of momentum.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of one tiny, small action you could take right now, in this moment, that feels connected to being dependable? For example, can you respond to a pending email, or make a phone call to someone you care about? It doesn't have to be a grand action, just a small one that feels like a step in the right direction.

Patient: Maybe I could send a quick, honest email to my boss saying I'm behind but laying out a short plan to catch up — just one sentence to show I'm being responsible. But the machine screams that the email will be a red flag, they'll start a performance plan, HR will be involved, and next thing I know I'm out of a job and everything falls apart. I'm getting pretty overwhelmed by that picture — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is resisting a small action that feels like a step towards being dependable, and the catastrophic thinking is intensifying. One area to explore further is the role of curiosity in exploring the story, rather than getting caught up in the narrative. The goal for the answer is to introduce a question-based approach to challenge the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and explore this story together. What would you think would happen if you sent that email, and what's the worst that could really happen? Can you look at the story from a more curious perspective, rather than assuming the worst? What would the email say, exactly?

Patient: I'd probably write something short like: "Hi Mark — I'm behind on the Thompson file and wanted to let you know I'm prioritizing it; I can deliver a revised timeline by Friday and would appreciate a quick 10-minute check-in if you have time. Thanks, Frank."  

But the instant I picture hitting send the machine goes into overdrive: Mark flags it, HR sees the note, they put me on a performance plan, then a warning, then I'm let go — then we lose the house and my partner walks out; it's like a domino that's already fallen.  

Saying the words makes my chest tighten and I feel panicked and kind of stupid for even trying — can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is resisting the idea of taking small action due to the catastrophic thinking, and the self-criticism is intensifying. One area to explore further is the concept of self-as-context, to help the patient separate their self-worth from the catastrophic thinking. The goal for the answer is to introduce a gentle, non-judgmental response to self-criticism.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're beating yourself up for trying to take a small step, and that's making things worse. Can you try to see that this is just your mind's way of protecting you from potential disappointment, rather than a reflection of your worth as a person? Can you look at the thought "I'm kind of stupid for even trying" and say it back to yourself, but with a tone that's more like "Oh, I'm thinking that right now" – like you're just noticing a thought, rather than owning it?

Patient: Okay. "Oh — I'm thinking I'm kind of stupid for even trying." Saying it like that makes it sound smaller for a second, like it's just a thought and not a verdict, but then the machine starts up again — "they'll notice, they'll judge, it'll all fall apart" — and my chest tightens. I'm really getting overwhelmed by how fast it flips back to doom; can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having some success in reducing self-criticism, but the catastrophic thinking is quickly resurfacing. One area to explore further is the concept of values-based action, to help the patient connect with the importance of taking small steps towards their values despite the thoughts. The goal for the answer is to introduce a small, incremental action that aligns with the value of being dependable.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a tiny, tiny step you could take right now that's connected to being dependable, something small that's not too scary? For example, can you take a few deep breaths before sending that email, or can you respond with a simple "Okay, I've got this"?

Patient: I could try taking three slow breaths, then open the email and type that one-line draft without sending it — just to get it out of my head. But the fortune-telling machine's already screaming that even drafting it will be noticed and lead to a performance plan and then I'm fired, so I'm starting to panic; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is getting close to taking a small action, but the catastrophic thinking is intensifying. One area to explore further is the role of mindfulness in the present moment, to help the patient focus on what's happening right now, rather than getting caught up in the hypothetical. The goal for the answer is to introduce a mindfulness exercise to anchor the patient in the present.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the chair beneath you. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or get caught up in your thoughts. Can you just focus on the sensation of your breath, for just a few more seconds, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: I did try—three slow breaths and for a second my chest loosened and I felt the chair under me. But as soon as I let that happen the machine kicked in: “they’ll see you slack off, Mark will mark you down, HR will pounce, you’re done,” and now my breathing’s shallow again and my head’s racing. I’m really overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit more?

The patient is struggling to maintain a mindfulness anchor, and the catastrophic thinking is resurfacing. One area to explore further is the role of curiosity in exploring the story, rather than getting caught up in the narrative. The goal for the answer is to introduce a question-based approach to challenge the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and explore this story together. What would happen if you didn't send that email right now? What would be the worst that could possibly happen? Can you imagine a scenario where Mark sees the email, and instead of getting upset, he responds with something like "Hey, thanks for reaching out, I appreciate it"? Can you try to imagine what that might feel like?

Patient: If I don't send it now the machine spits out the whole worst-case: Mark thinks I’m avoiding responsibility, HR notices later, they put me on a performance plan, then I get fired, we lose the house and my partner walks out — like a movie I can already see. I can kind of imagine Mark actually replying “Thanks, I appreciate the heads-up” and feeling a brief weight lift, but my brain immediately says that’s just the lull before the hammer — they'll be nice now and then ditch me later. My chest's tight just saying this and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down some more?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still getting caught up in the catastrophic thinking, and the self-criticism is intensifying. One area to explore further is the concept of values-based action, to help the patient connect with the importance of taking small steps towards their values despite the thoughts. The goal for the answer is to introduce a small, incremental action that aligns with the value of being dependable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to notice the sensation of your body, specifically your chest. What happens when you imagine that brief moment of Mark responding with a kind message? Can you find a small part of your chest that feels slightly less tight, slightly more relaxed? And what if, instead of trying to push the catastrophic thinking away, you were to allow that feeling of slight relaxation to be there, even if it's just for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: There’s a tiny spot just under my sternum that sort of loosens for a second — like a small unknotting when I imagine Mark being kind, almost warm for a blink.  
But the fortune-telling machine says that’s the setup: they’re nice now, then they notice you’re slipping, HR steps in, you’re on a plan, then out the door and everything collapses, and that image snaps my chest tight again.  
I’m really overwhelmed by how fast it flips back — can we slow down a bit more?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a small glimmer of relaxation, but the catastrophic thinking is quickly resurfacing. One area to explore further is the concept of mindfulness of the present moment, specifically the sensation of the chest tightening. The goal for the answer is to introduce a mindfulness exercise to anchor the patient in the present moment, without getting caught up in the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's bring your attention back to that tiny spot under your sternum, the one that felt slightly loosened for a second. Can you gently, without judgment, notice the sensation of it tightening again? What happens when you allow it to tighten, without trying to push it away or get caught up in the catastrophic thinking? Can you simply observe it, like a physical sensation, without getting drawn into the story?

Patient: I try to focus on that tiny spot and I can feel it tighten — like a knot pulling in, my breath getting shallow and my heart ticking faster. As soon as I notice it the machine flips on and the tightening becomes proof: “they’ll see you, you’ll be put on a plan, then fired,” and I get dragged into the story. I’m really overwhelmed just paying attention to it — can we slow down more? I need a bit more time to sit with the feeling without the doom running.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a mindfulness anchor, and the catastrophic thinking is intensifying. One area to explore further is the concept of kindness towards the body, specifically the physical sensations. The goal for the answer is to introduce a gentle, compassionate approach to the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I'd like you to say to your body, in a gentle, kind tone, "I'm here with you, and I'm going to allow you to feel whatever is happening, without trying to change it or get caught up in the story." Can you say it, slowly and gently, with me, and really focus on the sensation of the words on your tongue?

Patient: Okay — "I'm here with you, and I'm going to allow you to feel whatever is happening, without trying to change it or get caught up in the story." Saying it made my tongue feel a little heavy and, for a blink, my chest softened and the words actually landed. Then the fortune-telling machine screamed that it's pointless, they'll notice and everything falls apart, and my chest tightened hard — I'm really overwhelmed, can we slow down more?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a small moment of connection with their body, but the catastrophic thinking is quickly resurfacing. One area to explore further is the concept of defusion, to help the patient detach from the catastrophic thinking. The goal for the answer is to introduce a defusion technique to challenge the notion that thoughts are facts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's look at the sentence that popped up: "it's pointless." Can you see that sentence as just a sentence, rather than a truth? Can you say to yourself, "I'm noticing that sentence, and I'm going to let it be what it is – just a sentence"? Can you allow it to exist without taking it as a fact, without getting caught up in the story?

Patient: Okay — I'll try: "I'm noticing the sentence 'it's pointless' and I'm going to let it be just a sentence." Saying that makes it feel a bit smaller for a blink and my chest loosens a hair, but then the fortune-telling machine starts screaming it's a fact — "you're wasting time, they'll notice, you'll be fired" — and that drags me right back into panic and shame. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by how fast it flips; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to notice the sensation of your body, specifically the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin? Can you allow that feeling of grounding to be there, without trying to do anything else, just for a moment?

Patient: Yeah — I can feel my feet on the floor and the weight shifting, the chair under my thighs, and for a tiny second it makes me feel a little steadier. But of course the machine starts up: that steadiness is a fake calm before Mark notices, HR pins you down, and everything falls apart — my chest tightens and my breathing goes shallow. I'm really getting overwhelmed by how fast it flips back; can we slow down a bit more?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a small moment of grounding, but the catastrophic thinking is quickly resurfacing. One area to explore further is the concept of "unscrewing" the catastrophic thinking, to help the patient release the idea that they need to be in control of the outcome. The goal for the answer is to introduce a gentle, gentle release of control.

Therapist Answer:
Let's look at the sentence that popped up: "that steadiness is a fake calm before..." Can you see that sentence as a thought, rather than a prediction? Can you say to yourself, "I'm noticing that thought, and I'm going to let it be just a thought, without trying to make it true"? Can you imagine letting go of the need to control the outcome, and instead, allowing yourself to be with the present moment, exactly as it is?

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing that thought "that steadiness is a fake calm before..." and I'm going to let it be just a thought. But the fortune-telling machine immediately screams it's proof: Mark will notice, HR will pounce, I'll be put on a plan, then fired, we lose the house and my partner leaves — it's like a movie I can't switch off.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that it's okay to feel foolish for trying to sit with the thought. Can you say to yourself, with kindness and gentle tone, "I'm feeling really scared and uncertain right now, and that's okay. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? Can you offer yourself some compassion, just for this moment, without trying to change anything or get caught up in the catastrophic thinking?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it: "I'm feeling really scared and uncertain right now, and that's okay. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." Saying it actually softens my chest for a beat, like it lands for a second. Then the fortune-telling machine screams that it's meaningless and the whole domino plays out, and I get panicky and feel kind of foolish for even trying — can we slow down?

Can you try to tolerate the discomfort of the knot, without trying to change it or make it go away? Can you simply observe it, without judgment, and say to yourself, "This knot is here, and I can tolerate it"?
