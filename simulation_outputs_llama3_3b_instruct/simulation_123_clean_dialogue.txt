Patient: I've been feeling really anxious in social situations lately — I end up avoiding gatherings with friends even though I usually want to go. It's frustrating because I'm normally outgoing and my partner's really supportive, but my OCD and the constant money stress make it worse. I don't know, I guess that's mostly what’s been on my mind.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically happens in social situations that makes you feel anxious? Is it the fear of saying something awkward, worrying about being judged, or something else entirely?

Patient: Usually it starts with my heart racing and my mind going blank, like I'm just waiting to mess up a joke or say something awkward. I guess it's mostly the fear of being judged and making a scene, and sometimes my OCD throws in intrusive doubts about whether I'm saying the "right" thing — I don't know, it just spirals.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being judged or making a mistake can be overwhelming. What would happen if you were to show up to a social gathering and, despite feeling anxious, simply tolerated the uncertainty and discomfort, rather than avoiding it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually went I'd get panicky — heart racing, trying to breathe, wanting to bolt. Maybe afterward I'd feel a little relieved or proud, but in the moment it would feel unbearable and I'd probably clam up or leave early. I don't know how long I'd be able to tolerate that.

Therapist: Your anxiety in the moment is like a strong signal that something is uncomfortable, but it's not a definition of who you are. Can you thank your mind for that "you're going to freak out" story, and instead, imagine yourself as the person who will take a deep breath, and with curiosity, say to yourself, "What's the smallest, most subtle step I can take to move towards this gathering?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess the smallest step might be telling myself I'll just pop in for like 20–30 minutes and then leave if it gets too much, or even just texting one friend I'll come by so I have a familiar face there. Saying that out loud makes me feel weird and exposed though — I'm getting kind of overwhelmed. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It's completely okay to start small, and your suggestion of texting a friend to arrive and leave early is a great place to begin. Can you allow yourself to feel that sensation of being a bit exposed, but not judge it? Instead, notice that it's just a physical feeling, and remind yourself that you're doing this for your own comfort and to take care of yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice it, but it immediately feels gross and like my brain's trying to yank me away. Can we focus on something concrete instead — like how to actually text a friend or plan that 20–30 minute pop-in, because talking about the feeling just makes me shut down.

Therapist: Let's break it down further. What's the first step you could take to text your friend and arrange a short visit? Could it be as simple as opening your phone, typing a message, and hitting send?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the first step is just opening my phone and typing something short like, "Hey — thinking of popping by for 20–30 mins tonight, would you be around?" But saying that out loud already makes me weird and anxious — can you help me make it sound less awkward?

Therapist: How about we try rephrasing it as a more casual message? Instead of "thinking of popping by for 20–30 mins," could you say "Hey, want to grab a coffee for a bit?" or something similar? That way, it feels less like a big commitment and more like a casual hangout.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that does sound less scary than the "pop by" phrasing. But even "want to grab a coffee for a bit?" makes me feel like I'm forcing casual — can we try something really short, like "Free for a quick coffee later?" I don't know, it still feels awkward to send, but that feels closer to something I could actually do.

Therapist: "Free for a quick coffee later" is a very small step, and it's concrete. What would be the value of getting out of the house and having a short visit with your friend?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it could make me feel less stuck and lonely, and it'd be proof that I can handle the anxiety for a little while. It might also remind me I'm still social and not just my worries, but talking about that feels weird — can we focus on the exact message I'll send?

Therapist: Let's focus on the message you're going to send. What if, instead of trying to justify or analyze it, you simply type "Free for a quick coffee later" and then stop? Can you take a deep breath and let the thought sit there without judgment?

Patient: Okay, I breathed. I'll try typing: "Free for a quick coffee later?" I don't know, it already feels lame and like I'm overthinking how they'll read it — is that okay to send? I'm getting kind of anxious just thinking about hitting send.

Therapist: It's completely okay to send a message that feels a bit awkward or imperfect. In fact, it's a sign that you're taking a small step. Hitting send is a physical action, not a reflection of your worth. Can you allow yourself to let go of the need for it to be perfect, and instead, focus on the act of sending the message?

Patient: Okay... I can try to hit send. I don't know, I guess my hands are kind of shaky and I'm already imagining them reading it the wrong way. Can you just type the exact message I should copy so I don't have to figure out the wording?

Therapist: Here is the exact message: "Free for a quick coffee later?" Copy and paste it into your phone, and take a moment to look at it. Then, take a deep breath and hit send.

Patient: Okay... I copied it and I hit send. My hands were shaking and now I'm just staring at my phone, already imagining them reading it and thinking it's lame. I don't know, I guess part of me is proud but mostly I'm kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down? What should I do while I wait for a reply?

Therapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed after taking a small action. Why don't we take a few deep breaths together, and I'll guide you through a quick mindfulness exercise? Can you focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it in any way?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to focus on my breath, but I don't know — my chest feels tight and my mind's already racing about the reply. When I breathe in it feels shallow; I'm trying to let it be, but it's making me feel weird and a bit nauseous. Can we keep this really short—like two slow breaths—and then do something concrete I can do while I wait?

Therapist: Let's do two slow, deep breaths together: inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4. Ready? Inhale... hold... exhale... hold... Now, can you do something with your hands while you wait for the reply? Maybe do a quick stretch or fidget with a small object, like a paperclip?

Patient: Okay — I did the two breaths. I guess I'll stretch my shoulders and fidget with a paperclip, twisting it between my fingers, but I'm suddenly hit with this shame-y, annoyed feeling about something and my hands are kind of shaking. I don't know, it's distracting — can we keep this really short and concrete while I wait?

Therapist: Let's bring your attention back to the physical sensation of the paperclip in your hand. Notice the feeling of the paperclip between your fingers, the sensation of your hands shaking, and the sound of your breath. That's all. Don't try to change it, just observe it.

Patient: I can feel the paperclip — it's cold and kind of sharp between my fingers, and my hands are shaking. I feel... embarrassed and annoyed at myself for shaking like this, like it's proof I can't handle stuff, which just makes me tighten up more. I don't know, I guess I can try to focus on the sound of my breath, but can we stick to short, concrete things while I wait?

Therapist: Let's focus on the sound of your breath. Can you listen to the sound of your breathing, without trying to control it or change it in any way? Instead, focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Now, bring your attention to the paperclip again, and simply notice its presence between your fingers.

Patient: I can hear my breath — it's shallow and kind of loud in my ears. The paperclip is cold and sharp and my fingers are still shaking, which makes me feel embarrassed, like I'm failing at being calm, and that just tightens me up more. I don't know, can we do another quick, concrete thing I can do while I wait for the reply?

Therapist: Let's do a small, physical action that doesn't require attention: blink. Simply blink your eyes a few times, without trying to control it or change it. Notice the sensation of your eyelids moving, the pressure in your eyes, and the release of tension as you blink.

Patient: I blinked a few times — I could feel the lids and a tiny bit of release, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking and I feel kind of... ashamed, like I shouldn't be reacting like this. I don't know, can we do another quick, concrete thing I can do while I wait?

Therapist: Let's do another small physical action: take a sip of water. Simply pick up your glass and lift it to your lips, without thinking about the water or the taste. Just focus on the physical action of lifting the glass.

Patient: I picked up the glass and took a sip. My hands were shaking and I got that ashamed, annoyed feeling again — like I'm failing, which just tightens me more. I don't know, I guess it helped a little, but I'm still on edge. Can we do another really short concrete thing while I wait? Maybe ten slow shoulder rolls or count backwards from 20?

Therapist: Let's do the shoulder rolls. Go ahead and roll your shoulders forward and backward in a slow, gentle motion. Take it one roll at a time, focus on the sensation of your shoulders moving, and don't try to control it. When you're ready, count backwards from 20, starting now: 20, 19...

Patient: 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

Okay... I did it. My shoulders feel a bit looser but my chest's still tight and there's this shame-y, annoyed feeling under everything — like I'm mad at myself, which makes me tense up more. I don't know, I guess it helped a little but I'm still jittery; can we do another quick, concrete thing while I wait? Maybe five slow breaths or check my messages?

Therapist: Let's do the five slow breaths. Take a deep breath in... hold... out... hold... out... hold... Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it. As you breathe out, acknowledge the feeling of shame and annoyance, but don't try to judge it or change it. Just allow it to be present.

Patient: Okay — I did the five slow breaths. The shame and annoyance are still there, like a tight knot in my chest, and I can't stop thinking I'm somehow messing this up. I don't know, I guess it helped a tiny bit, but I'm still jittery — can we do another quick grounding thing, maybe name five things I can see around me?

Therapist: Let's focus on your surroundings. Take a glance around the room and notice five things you can see: the chair, the bookshelf, the clock, the window, and the...

Patient: I don't know — I can see the chair, the bookshelf, the clock, the window, and my laptop. There's this shame-y, annoyed knot in my chest, like I'm embarrassed for being so shaky, which just makes me tighten up more. Can we do another quick, concrete grounding thing while I wait?

Therapist: Let's bring your attention to your feet. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the feeling of the ground beneath you, and the sensation of your shoes on your feet. Just observe this sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — the soles pressed into the carpet and my shoes against my ankles — but there's this shame-y, frustrated knot in my chest that won't let me fully settle. I don't know... I guess it's making it hard to focus on anything simple like that. Can we do another quick, concrete thing while I wait, like checking my messages or counting the pattern on the rug?

Therapist: Let's try counting the pattern on the rug. Notice the colors, the shapes, and the way they repeat. Start at the edge of the rug and count the patterns as you move your gaze across it: "One, two, three, four..."

Patient: One, two, three, four, five, six... I don't know, my mind keeps snagging on that shame-y, annoyed knot and I can't really focus — I guess I lost the thread. Can we do something concrete instead while I wait, like checking my messages?

Therapist: Let's take a look at your messages. You can glance at the screen and see if there are any responses from your friend. That's it. Just look at the messages.

Patient: They replied — "Sounds good, see you later!" I don't know, I guess I'm kind of relieved but my hands are still shaking and I feel weirdly exposed. Can we do one more quick grounding thing while I wait to actually leave?

Therapist: Let's focus on your breath one last time. Take a deep breath in... hold... out... hold... out... As you exhale, notice the sensation of your body relaxing a bit, and the feeling of the air leaving your body. When you're ready, we'll get up and head out.

Patient: I did the breath... I guess I'm not totally ready to get up yet — my chest's still tight and there's this shame-y, annoyed knot like I'm failing, which just makes me freeze. I don't know, I want to go but I'm overwhelmed; can we do one more really short grounding thing before I actually head out?

Therapist: Let's focus on your feet again. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the feeling of the ground beneath you, and the sensation of your shoes on your feet. Just notice these sensations, without judgment or analysis. Say to yourself: "I am here, I am now, and I can do this."

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — the soles pressed into the carpet — and I tried saying "I am here, I am now, and I can do this," but it just feels weird and that shame-y knot is still loud and makes me freeze. I don't know, I want to go but I'm overwhelmed; can we do one more tiny, concrete thing — like list two things I should grab before I stand up? I guess that might help.

Therapist: Let's make a list of two things you should grab before you stand up. Just type them into a note on your phone: "Water bottle" and "Coat". That's it.

Patient: Okay — I typed "Water bottle" and "Coat" into a note. I'm still stuck with that shame-y, annoyed knot and my hands are shaking, and I don't know, I guess it's making me freeze. Can we do one more tiny thing to actually get me up — like a 30-second countdown or a short line I can say when I arrive so I don't feel blank?
