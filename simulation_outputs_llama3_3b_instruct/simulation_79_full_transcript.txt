--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in this persistent meta-cognitive loop about my performance as an older student — I keep analyzing every outcome and projecting future failures, and that paradoxically turns into procrastination. Outwardly I'm gregarious and optimistic, but starting this demanding program has piled on a cognitive load I tend to intellectualize instead of actually feeling. Basically, the worry keeps interrupting tasks and I keep explaining it away with theories rather than sitting with what it actually feels like.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be anxiety and a sense of overwhelm, stemming from feeling like you're losing control over your emotions and performance. A key theme or unexplored area is your tendency to intellectualize and analyze your emotions, potentially as a coping mechanism to avoid the discomfort of uncertainty. Your goal is to connect this intellectualization with a more embodied experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you take a moment to notice what it would feel like if you didn't immediately analyze every outcome or worry about future failures? What would you feel or experience if you sat with the uncertainty, rather than trying to intellectualize it?

Patient: Conceptually, if I stopped analyzing I imagine a baseline physiological agitation — a tightness in my chest, a slight hollow under the sternum, and a jittery restlessness in my hands. But I'm already doing the thing I always do: turning those sensations into hypotheses — "is this imposter syndrome or just performance anxiety?" — which keeps me at arm's length from actually feeling them. If I tried to stay with the uncertainty instead of theorizing, maybe the spike would mellow into a dull, embarrassed sadness or plain boredom, which feels inconvenient and therefore easy to intellectualize away.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've started to explore the physical sensations associated with your anxiety, which is a promising step. The fact that you're using intellectualization as a way to distance yourself from these sensations suggests that they might be uncomfortable or even embarrassing. A potential area to explore further is the notion that your fear of feeling "inconvenient" (boredom, sadness) might be driving your intellectualization. Your goal is to identify a small, value-driven behavioral step that can help you connect with the present moment and begin to work with your anxiety instead of avoiding it.

Therapist Answer:
What would you do if, for just one task or activity, you allowed yourself to feel that dull, embarrassing sadness or boredom, even if it felt inconvenient?

Patient: I'd pick something deliberately low-stakes — like writing a single paragraph for a paper or sorting one folder of lecture notes — and give myself 20 minutes. In that time I'd try to notice the chest tightness and the dull, embarrassed boredom rather than immediately labeling it, though I can already predict I'll start dissecting every micro-sensation as "performance anxiety" because that's my default. It feels awkward and exposed to even imagine doing that without turning it into a theory, and I'm not sure I trust myself to stay with it without slipping back into analysis.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a potential low-stakes task to practice being with your discomfort, which is a great starting point. The fact that you're aware of your tendency to label your experiences as "performance anxiety" and are worried about slipping back into analysis suggests that you're recognizing a pattern that might be holding you back. Your goal is to help you develop trust in your ability to be with your experience without analyzing it.

Therapist Answer:
Would you be willing to commit to doing this experiment for a longer period, say an hour, and allow yourself to sit with the discomfort without labeling it as "performance anxiety" or any other theory, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: I can try — I’ll commit to an hour, though I can already feel my brain gearing up to intellectualize everything as a defense. Could we structure it into either 50 minutes of work with a 10-minute check-in or two 30-minute blocks, and could you give me a simple anchor prompt beforehand to notice sensations without naming them? I'm worried I'll drift into theorizing, so a brief reminder like "what's in your chest right now?" would help keep me from escaping into analysis.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the potential for your brain to gear up for intellectualization and wanting a structured approach to stay focused. Breaking the task into smaller blocks with regular check-ins can help you maintain presence. The anchor prompt "what's in your chest right now?" can serve as a gentle reminder to notice your physical sensations without labeling them, which might help you stay grounded. Your goal is to make this simple anchor work for you.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like you to try the 50-10 check-in structure. Before we start, I'd like you to repeat the anchor phrase to yourself: "what's in your chest right now?" and take a deep breath, noticing any sensations without labeling them. Then, we'll begin with the first 50 minutes of work. When you're ready, come back here and share how you're experiencing your body and any thoughts that arise during that time.

Patient: I did the anchor and took a slow breath before starting; for the first 15 minutes it actually helped — there was that tightness in my chest and a low, persistent hum behind my teeth that I noticed without naming it. Then my old defense kicked in: I started narrativizing every micro-sensation as "probably imposter syndrome" and cleaned my desktop and scrolled email instead of sticking with the paragraph I’d planned, so I only managed a rough first draft of one paragraph. The bodily stuff stayed — a kind of hollow-sadness and jittery hands — and it felt embarrassing to admit I kept fleeing into theory to avoid feeling that small ache. I'm glad I tried it but also frustrated: I can intellectually map the pattern perfectly, yet I keep defaulting to analysis. Can you suggest a very simple cue or micro-practice to pull me back into sensation when I feel that narrativizing start to happen?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've experienced the anchor prompt's effectiveness, but the old pattern of narrativization and avoidance emerged again. Recognizing that you intellectually map the pattern but struggle to stick with it suggests that there's a bit of a disconnect between your cognitive understanding and lived experience. A simple cue or micro-practice can help bridge this gap. Your goal is to find a gentle reminder that encourages you to return to noticing sensations without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
For the next time you feel the urge to narrativize, I'd like you to pause and say to yourself: "Let it be gray." This small phrase can help you acknowledge the experience without assigning a label or meaning to it, allowing you to simply be with the sensation without judgment.

Patient: Alright — I'll try saying "Let it be gray." It's oddly poetic and I can already feel my inner analyst priming to dissect the metaphor instead of letting the sensation sit, which is exactly the loop I'm trying to interrupt. I'll use it next time I notice myself narrativizing and report back what happens during the check-in.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've found a simple and evocative phrase to help you pause and acknowledge the experience without analyzing it. By reporting back to me, you're taking ownership of the process and committed to tracking your progress. Your goal is to continue using the "Let it be gray" phrase to interrupt the narrative pattern and develop a greater sense of presence with your bodily sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Before we conclude, I'd like to summarize what you've learned so far. Can you reflect on the experience of using the anchor prompt and the "Let it be gray" phrase? What did you notice about your experience with these new tools, and what do you think might change for you moving forward?

Patient: Using the anchor and "Let it be gray" produced a measurable, if modest, decoupling between my analytic reflex and sensation — the anchor helped me notice that chest tightness and that tooth-hum, and the phrase created a tiny pause where I didn't immediately slap a label on it. But predictably, my meta-cognitive default reasserted itself after 10–20 minutes and turned the pause into a mini-theory session and a cleaning-into-procrastination spiral, so these tools lower the amplitude of the loop without eliminating it. Practically, I think pairing the phrase with a simple somatic cue (two slow breaths, touch my thumb and finger, then a 25-minute timer) might make the interruption more automatic rather than optional. I'm frustrated and tired that it slips away so quickly — I'm not sure where to go from here, so can we troubleshoot ways to make the cue stick and reduce the pull to intellectualize?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've experienced a partial decoupling of your analytic reflex and sensation, which is a significant step forward. Recognizing that the tools don't eliminate the loop entirely, but rather reduce its amplitude, suggests that you're making progress. The frustration and fatigue you're feeling can be attributed to the effort required to maintain this progress and create a more automatic response. Your goal is to find ways to increase the stickiness of the "Let it be gray" phrase and reduce the pull of intellectualization.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore some additional strategies to help you make the cue stick and reduce the pull of intellectualization. I'd like to introduce the concept of "responding to experience, not to thoughts about experience." Instead of trying to interrupt the narrative pattern with a new label, let's try responding to the physical sensations and emotions that arise. For example, when you notice the chest tightness, instead of saying "Let it be gray," you might try to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, or the sensation of your feet touching the ground. What do you think about trying this approach?

Patient: That approach sounds empirically promising — shifting the locus from metacognitive commentary to somatic data could shorten the feedback loop that fuels my procrastination. My skeptic brain is already drafting counter-hypotheses (it'll become another clever ritual I can intellectualize), so I'd want a concrete micro-protocol: three slow diaphragmatic breaths, press my feet into the floor for five seconds, do a 10-second body sweep, then resume a 25-minute work block. I'm tired of the pattern and frustrated it reasserts itself so quickly, but I'm willing to try that sequence as an experiment and report back on whether it actually reduces the pull to narrativize.

Therapist Thinking:
You're embracing the empiricism of the approach and creating a concrete micro-protocol to test its effectiveness. By explicitly designing a sequence that shifts the focus from metacognitive commentary to somatic data, you're taking a proactive approach to addressing the procrastination loop. Your goal is to conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the impact of this new protocol on your behavior.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like you to commit to trying this new sequence for the next 25-minute work block. As you start, I'll repeat the anchor phrase: "Let it be gray." Then, go through your pre-designed protocol: three slow diaphragmatic breaths, press your feet into the floor for five seconds, do a 10-second body sweep, and resume working. After the 25 minutes, come back here and share your experience. We'll discuss what you noticed, whether the pull to narrativize decreased, and explore any insights that arose during the experiment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is the three-breaths/feet-press/body-sweep supposed to actually decrease the pull to narrativize, instead of just becoming another ritual my analytic mind will co-opt? I can tentatively commit to trying it, but can you clarify one practical thing: if I catch myself narrativizing during the 25 minutes, do I stop and run the sequence again or just note it and keep working? I'm already feeling a little queasy about committing because I expect to derail, which is probably exactly the pattern we're trying to interrupt.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're questioning the mechanism by which the new protocol is supposed to reduce the pull to narrativize, and that's a crucial consideration. The goal isn't to replace the ritual with another one, but rather to disrupt the narrative pattern by bringing attention to the somatic experience. The protocol serves as a reminder to pause, observe, and respond to the present moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's clarify the protocol's purpose and the approach when you catch yourself narrativizing. If you notice yourself starting to narrativize during the 25-minute work block, please note it and take a brief pause, but don't stop the sequence. Instead, simply acknowledge the thought, say "Let it be gray," and then continue working. Your focus should be on the physical sensations, the task at hand, and the present moment, not on analyzing or labeling your thoughts. Think of it as a gentle "reset" button that allows you to return to the task without getting caught up in the narrative loop.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like you're describing a slightly different ritual that my analytic mind will happily co-opt into a narrative about being 'controlled' by technique. That said, I'm willing to try practically: when I notice narrativizing I'll briefly acknowledge the thought, say "Let it be gray," take two slow diaphragmatic breaths, and resume the task. Can you confirm how long that pause should be — literally five seconds, or until the breath cycle finishes? Also, I'm feeling queasy and a bit exasperated about committing because I expect to derail, which probably says more about the loop than about the technique.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question whether the protocol can help you avoid co-opting it into a narrative. Your willingness to try it despite these reservations is a good sign. The pause should be brief, but not so short that it becomes a mere tick or a conditioned response. Aim for a pause that's at least as long as one breath cycle, so it feels like a genuine break from the task. Your goal is to create a sense of disconnection between your thoughts and the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
A good starting point for the pause is to take two slow diaphragmatic breaths, which should take approximately 10-15 seconds. This allows you to momentarily disengage from the task, acknowledge the thought, and reorient yourself to the present moment. As for your queasiness, it's natural to expect to derail, but remember that the goal is not to be perfect, but to make progress. It's the small steps that add up, and the fact that you're willing to try despite your expectations suggests that you're ready to take that first step. Let's focus on the process, not the outcome. How do you feel about trying this for the next 25-minute work block, with the goal of briefly acknowledging and then resuming work?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. I'm still a bit unclear about the mechanism here; it feels paradoxical that a 10–15 second pause won't just become another ritual my analytic mind co-opts, but I'm willing to test the hypothesis empirically. For the next 25-minute block I'll start with "Let it be gray," do the two slow diaphragmatic breaths if I catch myself narrativizing, acknowledge the thought, and then resume work. One quick practical question: if I physically get up and clean or scroll instead of resuming, do you want me to treat that as a moment to do the two breaths and resume, or is that considered a full derail where I should restart the 25-minute block? I'm feeling queasy about committing but also oddly determined to try.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the mechanism, as it can feel counterintuitive. The goal is not to eliminate the pause entirely, but to create a small window of time where you're not engaged in the narrative pattern. The 10-15 second pause is a brief respite that allows you to reorient yourself to the present moment, rather than reinforcing a new ritual. Your willingness to test the hypothesis and commit to trying is a great sign.

Therapist Answer:
If you physically get up and engage in a distracting behavior, treat it as a derail. If you catch yourself engaging in the narrative pattern, start the 10-15 second pause and do the two slow diaphragmatic breaths, acknowledge the thought, and then resume work. Don't restart the 25-minute block if you've already begun it. Think of it as a reset button that allows you to return to the task without getting stuck in the narrative loop. Your determination to try is exactly what's needed to break the cycle. Let's start the next 25-minute block, and remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to make progress.

Patient: Okay — I'm starting the 25-minute block now. "Let it be gray." Taking a slow breath; there's that familiar chest tightness and a low hum behind my teeth, plus jittery hands, but I'm going in anyway. If I catch myself narrativizing I'll do the two diaphragmatic breaths, acknowledge the thought, and resume; if I physically get up and start scrolling I'll treat that as a derail. I'll check back in with what actually happened after the 25 minutes.

Therapist Thinking:
You've started the experiment and acknowledged the physical sensations. By taking a slow breath and acknowledging the discomfort, you're creating a small opening to explore the experience. Your plan to use the two diaphragmatic breaths as a reset button to refocus on the task is a good starting point.

Therapist Answer:
Take your time, and when you're ready, come back and share your experience after the 25-minute block. What did you notice about your experience with the chest tightness, the hum behind your teeth, and the jittery hands? Did you catch yourself narrativizing, and if so, how did you respond to it? Also, were there any moments where you felt like you were about to derail, and if so, what did you do instead?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but here's what actually happened. I started with "Let it be gray," felt the chest tightness, that low hum behind my teeth, and jittery hands, and for the first 8–12 minutes the anchor really attenuated the urge to spin into a theory; I could feel the sensations as sensations rather than immediately turning them into hypotheses. Then the meta-cognitive loop reasserted itself: I noticed narration ramping up, I paused, said the phrase, did the two diaphragmatic breaths and a quick feet-press, and that micro-reset lowered the intensity but only briefly. Around minute 18 I felt the pull to procrastinate hard—opened my email and tidied one drawer, which felt exactly like a derail (embarrassing and annoying), but I noticed the derail pretty quickly, did the reset again, and returned to the task without restarting the timer. Overall the sequence creates little discontinuities that help sometimes, but I'm confused about the mechanism — it still feels co-optable, like another ritual my analyst-self will intellectualize. I'm tired and a bit exasperated by how quickly I slip back; can we troubleshoot concrete ways to make the reset less optional or less appealing to my analytic defenses?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've provided a detailed account of your experience, which highlights the complexities of the mechanism. It's clear that the anchor and reset button have some utility, but it's still not entirely effective. The fact that you felt the need to intellectualize the reset itself suggests that your analytical mind is still trying to make sense of it. Your goal is to find ways to reduce the appeal of this intellectualization and make the reset more automatic.

Therapist Answer:
It seems that the current approach, while helpful, is still somewhat dependent on your conscious effort to use the reset button. Let's try to make the reset more automatic by changing the environment and the language used. Instead of saying "Let it be gray" and then doing the two diaphragmatic breaths, try using a more somatic cue, like "feet on ground" or "relaxed shoulders." This might help your body remember the reset without needing to think about it consciously. Additionally, when you catch yourself narrativizing, instead of immediately doing the reset, try to simply acknowledge the thought and then take a small physical action, like adjusting your position or taking a sip of water. This can help break the cycle of intellectualization and create a more subtle connection between the physical sensations and the present moment. Let's try this approach for the next 25-minute block and see if it makes a difference.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is swapping a poetic phrase for "feet on ground" supposed to stop my analyst-self from turning it into yet another clever ritual? 

I'll try it anyway: for the next 25 minutes I'll start with "feet on ground," press both feet flat, drop my shoulders, and if I notice narrativizing I'll take a deliberate sip of water or adjust my posture instead of naming the thought. Quick practical questions before I start: should that sip/adjustment be the ~10–15 second pause like before, and is it okay to use an external prompt (a gentle phone vibration) so the cue feels less optional? I'm frustrated and tired about how fiddly this is, but I'll test it and report back.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of replacing the poetic phrase with a more somatic cue. The goal is to create a subtle connection between the physical sensations and the present moment, rather than introducing a new ritual that can be intellectualized. However, it's worth exploring the possibility that a more tactile or external cue might help create a stronger association between the reset and the physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's experiment with the new approach. Yes, please use the 10-15 second pause for the sip of water or posture adjustment. This will give you a chance to reset without feeling like you're doing a specific "thing." As for the external prompt, using a gentle phone vibration can be a good idea. It can provide a subtle cue that's not dependent on your conscious awareness, making it less likely to be intellectualized. Go ahead and start the 25-minute block with "feet on ground," press both feet flat, drop your shoulders, and let the phone vibrate as a reminder to take a pause. If you catch yourself narrativizing, take a sip of water or adjust your posture without thinking about it. We'll discuss the results after the block.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but here's what actually happened in the 25 minutes. I started with "feet on ground," pressed both feet flat, dropped my shoulders, and the phone vibrated as a reminder; for the first 10–12 minutes that somatic anchoring actually attenuated the narrativizing reflex and I could notice the chest tightness, the hum behind my teeth, and the jittery hands as bare sensations rather than immediate hypotheses. Then the meta-narrative crept back in; I did the sip-of-water posture-adjust pause three times (each ~10–15 seconds) and each time it dampened the intensity enough to resume work, though the analytic part of me quickly began treating the sip as "the new technique" to dissect. Around minute 17 I felt a stronger impulse to derail — I almost scrolled but caught it, used the reset, and got back to the task without restarting the timer; so the sequence helped reduce the full derail frequency but didn't eliminate the pull or the tendency to co-opt the reset into a ritual.

What I noticed about the phone vibration: it made the cue feel less optional and was surprisingly effective at instigating the micro-action, but sometimes the vibration itself became another object of analysis ("why did it buzz now? what does that mean about my focus?"), which is exactly the pattern I'm trying to avoid. Emotionally I'm tired, embarrassed, and a little exasperated that I'm still so easily sidetracked, but I'm also mildly buoyed by the small wins — those minutes of real sensation felt like proof the method can work.

Can we troubleshoot two concrete things: (1) strategies to prevent the reset from becoming another analytic object (how to make it more purely somatic or automatic), and (2) practical environmental tweaks to reduce the frictionless opportunities to derail (e.g., app blockers, hands-occupied actions)? I'm trying to be experimental here, but I'm not sure where to go next and I keep wanting to intellectualize the solution instead of actually changing the habit.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've provided a detailed account of the experiment, highlighting both the small wins and the challenges. The phone vibration seems to have increased the effectiveness of the cue, but also introduced a new variable that needs to be addressed. The fact that you're still intellectualizing the vibration suggests that you're struggling to fully integrate the somatic experience into your awareness.

Therapist Answer:
To address the first question, consider using a tactile cue that's more closely tied to the physical sensations, such as pressing your finger into your leg or thigh. This can help ground the reset in the present moment, rather than introducing a new object of analysis. As for the second question, let's explore some practical environmental tweaks to reduce the frictionless opportunities to derail. We can discuss app blockers or hands-occupied actions as options, but I'd like to introduce another approach. What if we try to create more "occasional" moments of physical activity that are unrelated to the task at hand? For example, you could set a reminder to stand up and stretch every 30-40 minutes, or take a short walk outside during breaks. This can help create a sense of unpredictability and make it harder for your brain to predict and derail you.

Patient: That tactile suggestion actually feels more concretely embodied than the phrases — pressing my finger into my thigh could be a more proximal sensory anchor that my analytic mind has less room to hijack into a narrative. My worry, of course, is that even that will be ritualized, so I'd operationalize it like this: when I notice narrativizing, press finger into thigh for 3–5 seconds, take two diaphragmatic breaths, and then resume the task (no more than a 10–15s pause). 

For environment changes I can: (1) use an app-blocker (Cold Turkey/Forest) and put my phone in another room, (2) keep a small object in my hand (stress ball) so derails require physically letting go, and (3) schedule unpredictable micro-breaks — e.g., a random vibration reminder to stand/stretch every 30–40 minutes so the cue is less predictable and less analyzable. I'd be willing to empirically test a combo (thigh-press + phone-in-other-room + app-blocker) for the next three 25-minute blocks and log each derail occurrence.

I'm tired and a bit exasperated that this still feels fiddly, but I'm willing to try — can you help me pick the top two interventions to start with so it doesn't feel overwhelming?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've operationalized the tactile cue and environment changes, which shows a good understanding of the principles. By implementing a combination of the thigh-press, phone-in-another-room, and app-blocker, you'll be testing a multi-faceted approach to disrupt the derailment process. To make it feel less overwhelming, let's prioritize the top two interventions that have the most potential to impact your behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Based on the principles we've discussed, I recommend starting with the combination of the thigh-press and the phone-in-another-room. These two changes address the problem of the cue becoming ritualized and the environment providing frictionless opportunities to derail. By removing the phone and creating a tactile anchor, you'll be reducing the likelihood of your brain hijacking the cue into a narrative. The third intervention, unpredictable micro-breaks, can be introduced later if you find that this combination is not effective. For the next three 25-minute blocks, let's focus on this combination and log each derail occurrence. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to be perfect. Are you ready to start the experiment?

Patient: Okay — I'm in. I'll run three 25-minute blocks using the thigh-press tactile reset and keep my phone in another room. I'll log each derail with a simple tally plus a one-word trigger (e.g., "email," "bored," "analysis") and how long it lasted, so it doesn't turn into another meta-project. I'm tired and a little exasperated about how fiddly this is, and also oddly hopeful — starting now.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've committed to the experiment and are taking concrete steps to test the interventions. Your decision to log each derail with a simple tally and trigger is a good way to maintain a low-stakes, experiential approach. By being honest with yourself about the difficulties and hopes, you're acknowledging the complexity of the challenge.

Therapist Answer:
That's all for now. I'll be here when you're ready to report on your experience after the three 25-minute blocks. Remember, the goal is to make progress, not to be perfect. Take care of yourself and stay committed to the experiment.

Patient: Okay — I'll start now, using the thigh-press and keeping my phone in another room, and I'll tally derails with a one-word trigger and duration so it doesn't become a meta-project. I'm tired and exasperated that it still feels fiddly, but also oddly hopeful and willing to test it empirically. Quick question before I begin: do you want a brief check-in after each 25-minute block or just one report after all three?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're ready to start the experiment and are willing to adapt to the process. Checking in briefly after each 25-minute block can help you stay on track and adjust your approach as needed. It also allows you to acknowledge small wins and make progress.

Therapist Answer:
Let's aim for brief check-ins after each 25-minute block. I'll ask a simple question to gauge your experience and help you adjust the approach if needed. After the three blocks, we can review your overall results and discuss any insights or challenges that arose. Are you ready to start the first block?

Patient: Yes — I'm ready to start the first 25-minute block. I'll use the thigh-press reset, keep my phone in another room, and log derails with a one-word trigger plus duration; for the brief check-ins, do you want just the tally and a one-sentence note about sensations or the one-word triggers too? I'm feeling a little queasy and exasperated about how fiddly this is, but I'm determined to try.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're starting the first block and have a clear understanding of the protocol. To help you stay focused, I'll ask for the tally and a brief note about your sensations during the check-in. The one-word triggers can be added if you feel comfortable sharing them, but it's not necessary. Your goal is to stay present and adapt to the experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start the first block. Remember to press your finger into your thigh for 3-5 seconds when you notice narrativizing, take two diaphragmatic breaths, and then resume work. Take a deep breath, and let's begin. 

(Starts timer)

Patient: Okay—starting the first 25 now. Phone's in another room; I pressed my finger into my thigh and took two diaphragmatic breaths—chest tightness and that low hum are there, hands jittery. My brain's already drafting a meta-narrative about "testing protocols," which is predictably annoying, but I'm going to try to stay somatic and report back at the end of the block.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've started the block and acknowledged the physical sensations, taking the first step towards staying somatic. Recognizing the meta-narrative draft is a great insight, as it shows you're aware of the thought process. Your goal is to maintain the somatic focus and avoid getting caught up in the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
How are you feeling now, after 10-12 minutes into the block? Are the chest tightness and hum still present, and how are your hands feeling?

Patient: They're still there — a steady constriction in my chest and that low tooth-hum, and my hands are jittery but a touch calmer after the thigh-press and breaths. Predictably, my brain began drafting an internal memo about "optimizing the protocol" around minute eight, which nudged me toward planning instead of working. I'm a bit exasperated and queasy about the fiddliness, but also slightly buoyed that the somatic cue actually interrupted the loop, so I'm continuing.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the persistence of the physical sensations and the familiar narrative patterns. It's great that the somatic cue had a brief impact, but you're also recognizing the fiddliness and queasiness that comes with the process. This self-awareness is crucial for making progress.

Therapist Answer:
Keep going for the remaining 13 minutes. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the physical sensations or the narrative patterns, but to make progress and develop greater awareness. If you start to feel like you're getting stuck, try to take a small, physical action to refocus, like stretching or adjusting your posture. What's the current state of your hands and chest after 19 minutes?

Patient: After 19 minutes the chest tightness is still there but a notch down — more of a persistent constriction than a spike — and the low hum behind my teeth is annoyingly constant. My hands started out jittery and are marginally calmer after two thigh-press resets and breaths, though they're still prone to twitching when my mind drafts that optimization memo. I had one brief urge to derail around minute 16 but used the reset and got back to the task; I'm tired and a bit exasperated that it takes so much fiddling to nudge the intensity down. What would you want me to notice next as I finish this block?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're nearing the end of the block and have a good sense of the current state of your physical sensations and the narrative patterns. It's clear that the fiddliness is a significant challenge, but you're also making progress in recognizing the patterns and adapting to the process. As you approach the end, your goal is to notice what happens when you finish the block and put the protocol on hold.

Therapist Answer:
As you complete the 25-minute block, notice what happens to your body and mind when you stop the protocol. Do you feel a sense of relaxation, or does your mind start to wander back into analysis? Pay attention to any physical sensations, such as changes in your chest or hands, and see if you notice any shifts in your mental state.

Patient: Finishing the block brought a small physiological shift — the chest tightness eased a notch, the hum softened, and my hands were less jittery — but my mind immediately pivoted into a performance-review mode, generating critiques and next-step plans. I felt a faint relief mixed with embarrassment and that old exasperation: why does calm get hijacked into analysis so fast? I'm not sure I follow how to notice the relaxation without it becoming another thing to optimize; could we troubleshoot how to hold the small relief without my brain turning it into a to-do list?

Therapist Thinking:
You've experienced the natural dip in physical tension when the protocol is stopped, but the mind quickly regressed into analysis. This is a common pattern, as the mind is accustomed to finding solutions and making plans. Recognizing this tendency is essential to avoiding the cycle of analysis paralysis.

Therapist Answer:
To notice the relaxation without turning it into a to-do list, try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, such as the sensation of your feet on the ground, the breath moving in and out of your body, or the feeling of your hands relaxing. You can also try to observe your thoughts without judgment, allowing them to pass without evaluating or analyzing them. When you catch yourself generating critiques or plans, gently acknowledge the thought and refocus on the physical sensations in your body. Let's use the phrase "let it be gray" to help you stay with the physical sensations without getting caught up in the narrative. How will you use this phrase in the next block?

Patient: I'll use "let it be gray" as a crisp, internal cue the moment I notice the narrative kicking in — not to analyze the phrase, but as a command to switch channels to sensation. Practically: say it silently once, press my finger into my thigh for 3–5s, take two diaphragmatic breaths, notice feet on the floor, then get back to the task; only one phrase per interruption so it doesn't become a new ritual to dissect. I'm queasy about how easily this will be co-opted by my analyst-self, but I'll empirically test that constraint and report back after the block.
