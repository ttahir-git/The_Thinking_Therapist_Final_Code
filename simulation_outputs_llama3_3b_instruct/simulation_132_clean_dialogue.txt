Patient: Honestly, I've been stuck in this loop where whenever I get anxious about something small I keep asking people — friends, family, even strangers — for reassurance just to feel okay for a minute. It feels like numbing; I know it isn't solving anything but I can't stop, especially after losing someone close, everything got louder. I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried talking and breathing exercises and they didn't change much, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you think of a specific situation where you've asked for reassurance recently, and it didn't provide the relief you were looking for in the moment? What was it about that moment that made you reach out for reassurance, even though you acknowledged earlier that it didn't solve the underlying anxiety?

Patient: Last week I applied for a job and then spent the evening texting a friend every time I imagined I sounded desperate in the cover letter — they kept saying I was fine but it didn't stick. I reached out because I needed that quick certainty to quiet my head; since I lost someone, small things feel huge and I panic faster. I've tried breathing and talking it out before and it doesn't work, so how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: I can see that you're looking for a way to quiet your anxiety, and talking about it might feel like a familiar way to cope. Can you think of something that, even though it's hard, you value about yourself or your life that might help you feel more grounded when you're anxious, even if it doesn't solve the immediate problem?

Patient: I care a lot about being reliable and staying connected — I want to be someone people can count on and to keep trying even when things are rough. Sometimes reminding myself "I've handled stuff before" does calm me a little, but in the moment it feels hollow and the panic just drowns it out. How is thinking about values supposed to actually quiet the rush when my chest tightens?

Therapist: Can you notice what happens in your body when you think about being reliable and staying connected, and yet the panic is still there? For example, is there a specific physical sensation that comes up when you try to remind yourself of those values?

Patient: When I try to tell myself I'm reliable or that I've handled things before, my chest tightens, my stomach drops, and my hands get jittery like I need to do something right now — usually I grab my phone and start texting someone for reassurance. My head goes fuzzy and I can't focus on the thought, it just feels like noise under the panic. I get that you're asking me to notice it, but how is just noticing supposed to help when I physically feel like I can't breathe?

Therapist: Instead of focusing on the physical sensations or trying to avoid them, can you try to notice the thoughts as thoughts, without judgment or attachment? For example, can you say to yourself, "Ah, my mind is having this thought 'I need to do something right now'?" or "There's this idea that I've handled things before, but it's not stopping the panic"?

Patient: Alright, I'll try: "My mind is having the thought that I need to do something right now." Saying it out loud for a second makes the urge to text feel a bit less urgent, but my chest is still tight and within a minute I'm reaching for my phone. How is labeling a thought supposed to stop that physical shove to do something?

Therapist: Can you think of a situation where you felt anxious and acted on a urge to take action, and afterwards, did you actually feel a sense of relief or accomplishment? What was it about that experience that was meaningful to you, and how might that value be connected to your current anxiety and urge to text for reassurance?

Patient: Yeah — like with that job application: I texted my friend all evening and got a few “you’re fine” replies, and for ten minutes I felt calmer, then it came back worse and I felt kind of stupid. Once, a few months ago, I forced myself not to text and went out and fixed a problem at my old neighbor’s house instead — afterward I actually felt proud and steady for the first time in a while. That pride felt real because it matched my value of being useful and reliable, not just looking ok to other people, so I guess when I text it’s trying to buy that same feeling fast. But I’m still stuck on this — how is pointing that out supposed to stop the reflex when my chest tightens?

Therapist: Can you imagine, in the moment when your chest tightens and you feel the urge to text, what would need to happen for you to feel like you're taking care of yourself and being reliable, without needing external reassurance? What would it take to make you feel like you're moving towards that value of being useful and reliable, even if it means not texting immediately?

Patient: I think I'd need a really concrete, short plan I can do in the moment that actually feels like work — like set a 20‑minute "no texting" timer, do one small helpful task (even washing dishes or fixing something for a neighbor), then check in with myself and write one sentence about what I did. That would line up with being useful and reliable instead of fishing for someone else's approval. But I'm doubtful — when my chest tightens I need something that changes my body, not just my brain, so I'd want a physical thing (a walk, carrying groceries, or fixing something) I can grab onto — though honestly, how is any of that supposed to stop me from picking up my phone when it feels urgent? Can we try picking one of those to practice now?

Therapist: Let's try a small, low-stakes experiment: can you imagine taking a 5-minute walk around the block right now, just focusing on the sensation of your feet touching the ground and the movement of your body? Notice what happens when you start walking, and what happens when you pause or take a few deep breaths. Sometimes, simply paying attention to our physical presence can help us feel more grounded and less reactive to urges to act.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to imagine it. I feel my feet hitting the ground, the rhythm pulls my attention away from the loop in my head, my shoulders drop a bit and my breath eases for like thirty seconds. But the moment I stop moving the tightness comes back and I can already feel my hand itching for the phone — how is a walk supposed to be enough when my body is yelling for immediate action? I’m willing to try an actual five‑minute walk if you’ll help me stick to it—can you give me something specific to focus on or a way to keep me accountable while I do it?

Therapist: Let's try a 5-minute walking exercise with a specific focus: I'd like you to notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This can help ground you in the present moment and distract you from the urge to text. Let's make a deal: I'll check in with you in 2 minutes to see how you're doing, and we can see if this helps.

Patient: Okay, I'm walking and did the 5-4-3-2-1: I saw a red mailbox, a kid's drawing in a window, cracked pavement, our neighbor's cat, and a delivery van; I touched my jacket zipper, a cool metal railing, my shoe sole, and rough tree bark; I heard a distant lawnmower, someone laughing, and my breath; I smelled fresh bread and wet soil; I tasted mint. My chest eased and my shoulders dropped for maybe thirty seconds, but the pull to check my phone is creeping back already. How is this supposed to stop me from grabbing the phone when it feels urgent—what do I do in the moment it spikes again?

Therapist: When you feel the urge to text again, I'd like you to bring your attention back to your breath. Inhale for a count of 4, hold it for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and then pause for a count of 2. Then, take a small action, like touching the object you were holding, or noticing the sensation in your feet. This pause can help you regain control and build a sense of agency over your actions.

Patient: Okay—I tried the 4-4-4-2 breathing like you said: my chest loosened and my shoulders dropped for maybe twenty seconds, my jaw unclenched a bit, but the itch to grab my phone is still there and my head's yelling at me to do something. How is pausing on my breath supposed to stop that shove when it feels like I'm going to burst? Touching the mug in my hand helped a little — can we make a concrete plan for the next spike, like a short timer plus a specific replacement task I actually want to do so I don't just drift back to texting?

Therapist: Let's create a plan for when you feel the urge to text. You'll set a 5-minute timer on your phone, and when it goes off, you'll engage in a specific, small task that aligns with your value of being useful and reliable. For example, you could say, "When the timer goes off, I'll start washing the dishes in the sink for 2 minutes." Having a clear, tangible task to focus on can help you build momentum and make progress, rather than retreating to texting.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try that — but I’m worried about using my phone as the timer because that’s exactly what I reach for. Can I put the phone in another room or use a kitchen timer instead, and when it goes off I’ll do 2 minutes of dishes or fix that squeaky hinge? I’m still skeptical — when my chest spikes I want the instant hit, not a plan — so if it spikes in the 5 minutes I’ll do one round of the 4‑4‑4‑2 breath and touch something solid. Can you check in with me in 5 minutes so I don’t bail?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try this. When the timer goes off, take a moment to acknowledge that the urge to text has spiked, and then engage in the task you've chosen. Don't worry if you feel like you're "cheating" or if it doesn't feel like a perfect solution – the goal is to build confidence and momentum. I'll check in with you in 5 minutes, and we'll see how it goes. In the meantime, I want you to repeat to yourself, "I can handle this" or a similar phrase that feels meaningful to you.

Patient: Alright — I'll put my phone in the other room and use the kitchen timer. I'll try repeating "I can handle this," but honestly it already feels hollow and I'm not sure it'll stick. If it spikes I'll do the 4‑4‑4‑2 breath and touch something solid, and I want you to check in in 5 minutes so I don't bail. Also — how is this actually different from the other "tricks" I've tried that didn't work?

Therapist: This approach is different from previous "tricks" because it's not just about trying to distract yourself or change your thoughts, but rather about building a direct connection between your body and your values. By engaging in a tangible, meaningful task, you're creating a new pathway for your nervous system to respond to anxiety, rather than relying on mental tricks that might not be as effective. This approach also acknowledges the importance of your physical sensations and allows you to act on them in a way that feels authentic and connected to your values.

Patient: Alright — I hear you, but I'm still skeptical; it sounds a lot like other tricks I've done that faded fast. I'll put the phone in the other room, use the kitchen timer, do the 4‑4‑4‑2 breathing and touch something if it spikes, and when the timer goes off I'll do two minutes of dishes or fix the hinge. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about it — can you check in with me in 5 minutes like we agreed so I don't bail?

Therapist: I'll check in with you in 5 minutes. Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that's a sign that you're on the verge of growth. Take a deep breath, and try to approach this moment with kindness and curiosity. When I check in, I want you to report exactly what you're feeling and what you did when the timer went off. Let's see how this unfolds.

Patient: Okay — I did it. I put the phone in the other room, set the kitchen timer, did the 4‑4‑4‑2 when it spiked, touched the counter, and washed dishes for two minutes when it went off. It steadied me for maybe thirty seconds, then the tightness and this desperate pull to check the phone came back and now I'm jittery and distracted again. I get that it helped a little, but how is this supposed to make any real difference when the urge just keeps returning? Can you stay with me and help me try another one right now?

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'm not leaving. It's okay to acknowledge that the urge has come back, and that's not a failure. Instead, I want to ask: What would you do with your hands if you weren't washing dishes? What's one small, tangible thing you can do in this moment to build momentum and move away from the urge to text? We can explore that together.

Patient: I could do something with my hands—like fold a towel, squeeze a stress ball, or scrub a dish—but right now my hands are shaking, my heart's racing, and my head is all over the place. Folding a towel for two minutes feels doable, but honestly — how is that supposed to stop this urgent pull to check the phone when my chest feels like it's burning? Can you coach me through two minutes of folding right now so I don't bail?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. I want you to focus on your hands and the sensation of folding the towel. Start with one small fold, and notice the sensation of your hands moving, the sound of the fabric, and the feeling of the towel becoming more compact. As you fold, I'll guide you through a gentle, calming phrase: "I can tolerate this" (pause) "for two minutes" (pause) "and find a way to move forward" (pause). Repeat this phrase with me, and let's work through the task together.

Patient: Okay… I’ll try. I fold one corner — my hands are shaking, the towel feels rough under my fingers, and my heart’s pounding. "I can tolerate this… for two minutes… and find a way to move forward." Saying it calms me a little, but the itch to check the phone is loud — can you keep guiding me, like count the folds or prompt me so I don’t bail?

Therapist: Let's count the folds together. I'll guide you: "One, two, three... your hands are folding the towel again. Four, five, six... the fabric is getting neater. Seven, eight, nine... you're getting the hang of it. Ten, eleven, twelve... you're halfway there." As you continue folding, I want you to pay attention to the sensation of your hands and the sound of the towel. When you're ready, take a deep breath in and out, and let's add the next phrase: "I can tolerate this... and find a way to move forward." Keep counting and folding together.

Patient: One… two… three — my hands are still shaky but they're moving. Four… five… six — my heart's pounding, but the counting pulls my head away from the phone for a second. Honestly, it helps for like thirty seconds and then the itch comes back hard — can you keep counting with me up to twenty and remind me to breathe between every five folds? I'm nervous and skeptical about this, but I don't want to bail right now.

Therapist: Let's keep counting and folding. I'll guide you up to twenty: "Seven, eight, nine... your hands are steady now. Ten, eleven, twelve... you're getting the hang of it. Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... the towel is getting neater. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen... you're doing great. Nineteen, twenty..." As you reach twenty, take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... and let's add the phrase: "I can tolerate this... and find a way to move forward." (pause) Now, I want you to notice the sensation in your hands and the sound of the towel. Remember to breathe in and out, and take another deep breath in... (pause) and out... when we get to the next fold. Keep counting and folding.

Patient: Twenty — I breathed in and out. My hands are a bit steadier and the towel looks neater, but my chest is still tight and the itch to check the phone is creeping back already. Can you keep counting with me up to forty and cue the 4‑4‑4‑2 breath every five folds? Also — honestly, how is folding then breathing supposed to stop this in the long run? I’ll keep going if you keep guiding me.

Therapist: Let's keep counting and folding. I'll guide you up to forty: "Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three... you're doing great. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six... the towel is almost done. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine... you're almost there. Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two... keep going. Thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five... you're really close. Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight... twenty-nine, thirty... forty!" (pause) Now, take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... when you reach the end of the towel. As you're folding, I want you to think about what you value most, and what would happen if you were able to take care of yourself and move forward, despite the anxiety. What's one small, concrete step you can take next to move towards that value?

Patient: Alright — one small concrete step I can take next is to spend the next 20 minutes fixing that squeaky hinge in the hall; it’s a real, hands-on thing that would actually feel useful. My chest’s tight and my hands are still shaky and I’m worried it won’t be enough when the urge spikes, so can you stay with me and keep prompting my breaths and check in while I do it? I don’t know if this will work, but I’ll try if you keep guiding me.

Therapist: I'll stay with you and guide you through the task. As we begin, I want you to take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... and start fixing the hinge. I'll count with you: "One, two, three... you're tightening the screw. Four, five, six... it's getting tighter. Seven, eight, nine... you're making progress. Ten, eleven, twelve... it's almost done." (pause) Now, take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... as you tighten the last screw. As you step back to admire your handiwork, I want you to notice how you feel, and then we'll check in and see how the urge to text is behaving.

Patient: Okay — I tightened the last screw and stepped back. My hands are steadier and I actually feel a little proud, like that was real for a second. But my chest is still tight and the urge to check my phone just spiked hard — I'm jittery and panicked again. Can you stay with me and keep prompting the 4-4-4-2 breaths while I resist for another minute? And honestly, how is fixing things like this supposed to stop the pull long-term?

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'll continue to guide you through the breaths. Let's count together: "One, two, three... your body is responding to the anxiety. Four, five, six... you're getting the urge again. Seven, eight, nine... take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... as you stand there. Now, I want you to notice that your hands are still warm from fixing the hinge. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sounds around you. You are still standing, still alive, and still capable of taking care of yourself. Take another breath in... (pause) and out... and let's keep going." Remember, this is not about eliminating the anxiety, but about building a sense of self-awareness and context that can help you navigate it.

Patient: Okay... I can do the breaths and I did feel a tiny bit proud fixing that hinge, but my chest is still tight and my thoughts are racing — the urge to check the phone feels like a physical shove. I don't really buy that this will fix things long-term — how does repeating breaths and doing chores actually rewire that reflex? Can you guide me through two more rounds of the 4‑4‑4‑2 now and then help me make a concrete plan for when it spikes again later today?

Therapist: Let's do two more rounds of the 4-4-4-2 breaths. I'll guide you through them: "One, two, three... your body is responding to the anxiety. Four, five, six... you're getting the urge again. Seven, eight, nine... take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... Now, take another breath in... (pause) and out... and focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground." As we complete the last round, I want you to notice how you feel, and then we'll talk about creating a plan for when the urge spikes again.

(Note: We're not trying to "rewire" the reflex in the classical sense, but rather build a new pathway through repetition and mindfulness. By acknowledging and accepting the anxiety, you're creating space for a different response to emerge.)

Patient: I did the two rounds — they slowed me a little, my hands steadied and my breath eased for a few seconds, but it fizzles fast and I'm jittery again and kind of on edge. I need a clear, step-by-step plan for later today when it spikes: like put the phone in another room, use a kitchen timer, do the 4‑4‑4‑2, then a 20‑minute hands-on task (fixing the hinge or dishes), then write one sentence about it before I can text anyone — can you help me lock that into a concrete script I can follow? And honestly, how is doing the same breathing plus chores supposed to change the reflex long-term if the relief keeps bouncing back? Can you stay with me and help me troubleshoot what to do if it spikes again in 10 minutes?

Therapist: Let's craft a concrete script for when the urge spikes again: "When I feel the urge to text, I'll put my phone in another room, set a 5-minute timer, and use the 4-4-4-2 breathing. If the urge persists, I'll engage in a 20-minute hands-on task, such as fixing the hinge or dishes, and take a few deep breaths. After completing the task, I'll write one sentence about what I accomplished, focusing on the value of being reliable and taking care of myself. If the urge is still strong, I'll take a few more deep breaths and remind myself that I've done everything I can to take care of myself. I'll also ask myself, 'What's the worst that could happen if I don't text right now?' and try to reframe my thinking."

Regarding the long-term effectiveness, it's not about eliminating the anxiety entirely, but about building a new pathway for responding to the urge to act. By consistently practicing the 4-4-4-2 breathing, engaging in hands-on tasks, and reframing your thoughts, you're creating a sense of self-awareness and self-compassion that can help you navigate the anxiety.

As for troubleshooting what to do if it spikes again in 10 minutes, I'll be here with you. When the timer goes off, I want you to take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... and report exactly what you're feeling and what you did. If you're still feeling anxious, we'll explore other options together.

Patient: Okay — my chest's pounding, my hands are shaking, and even though the phone's in the other room I can feel the pull to get it. I set the timer and tried a breath but my head's scattered and I'm suddenly way more anxious and distracted than a few minutes ago; I don't really trust this will hold. Can you stay with me and guide another 4-4-4-2 right now, and tell me exactly what to do if the urge hits harder before the timer goes off? Also — seriously, how is this going to change the reflex long-term when it keeps bouncing back like this?

Therapist: I'm here with you, and I'll guide you through the breaths. Take a deep breath in... (pause) and out... "I'm feeling anxious right now, and that's okay. My body is reacting to the urge to text, but I'm also feeling frustrated with myself for not being able to control it. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough. If the urge hits harder before the timer goes off, I'll take a few more deep breaths, notice the sensation in my body, and remind myself that I've done everything I can to prepare for this moment. If I need to, I'll also say to myself, 'This too shall pass,' and acknowledge that this feeling will pass, even if the urge persists."

Regarding the long-term effectiveness, it's true that this approach might not eliminate the anxiety entirely, but it's not supposed to either. The goal is to develop a greater sense of self-awareness, self-compassion, and self-acceptance, which can help you navigate the anxiety and develop more adaptive coping strategies. This process is not a quick fix, but a journey towards greater psychological flexibility.

If you're ready, we can try another round of the 4-4-4-2 breathing, or we can explore other options together. What would you like to do?

Patient: Okay — let's do another 4-4-4-2 now. My chest's tight and my hands are shaking, so I need you to count me through it and then say, step‑by‑step, exactly what to do if it spikes before the timer (phone in other room, set 5‑min kitchen timer, one 4‑4‑4‑2, touch something solid, start a 2‑minute task, then wait to text). Stay with me and prompt the breaths so I don't bail — and be blunt: tell me the script I should say to myself in the moment.

Therapist: Let's start the 4-4-4-2 breathing. Inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) now, take another inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4...

Now, if the urge spikes before the timer goes off, here's what you'll do:

"Ah, my body is responding to the anxiety again. I acknowledge the feeling, and I remind myself that I've done everything I can to prepare for this moment. I put my phone in the other room, set the 5-minute timer, and get a solid object to touch, like my chair or the counter. I take a few more deep breaths, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of my body. Then, I start a 2-minute task, like washing a dish or fixing a small thing. As I work, I focus on the sensation of my hands and the task at hand. When the timer goes off, I take a few more deep breaths and remind myself, 'I can tolerate this moment, and I'll wait to text when I'm ready.'"

Repeat that script to yourself, and let's continue with the breathing exercise. Remember, I'm here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I said the script out loud during the breaths and it helped for maybe twenty seconds, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking. I'm feeling overwhelmed and skeptical — can you count me through five more 4-4-4-2 rounds and remind me to touch something solid each time? After that, help me pick one replacement task I actually want to do if this spikes again, because I keep thinking, seriously, how is repeating this any different from the other tricks when the urge keeps coming back?

Therapist: Let's do five more rounds of the 4-4-4-2 breathing. I'll count with you: "One, two, three... your body is responding to the anxiety again. Four, five, six... take a deep breath in... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) now, take another inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) inhale for a count of 4... (pause) hold... exhale for a count of 4... (pause) notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body."

As we continue, I want you to touch something solid, like your knee or the chair leg, to help ground yourself. When you feel the urge to text again, you'll put your phone in the other room, set the 5-minute timer, and do the 4-4-4-2 breathing. If the urge persists, you'll touch something solid and start a replacement task.

Now, let's talk about replacement tasks. What is one small, meaningful task that you would actually enjoy doing if you weren't feeling anxious about texting? Something that aligns with your values and makes you feel useful and connected?

Patient: Fixing small stuff — like that squeaky hinge, tightening a loose doorknob, or doing a quick patch on the wall — actually gives me that real, useful feeling. Right now I'm jittery and my chest's tight just thinking about resisting the phone, so I'm skeptical: how is choosing that over texting actually going to stop the shove when it hits? Can you stay with me and help me make a one‑line script to say and a step‑by‑step plan I can follow the instant the urge spikes?
