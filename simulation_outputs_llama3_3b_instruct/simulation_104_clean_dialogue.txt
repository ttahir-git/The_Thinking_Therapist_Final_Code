Patient: I'm a senior software developer who just moved, and lately I've been avoiding get-togethers because social situations make me unbearably anxious. My mind immediately jumps to the worst — I'll say something stupid, they'll laugh or cut me off, they'll stop inviting me, I'll end up completely alone and my life will just fall apart, and I can't seem to stop picturing that as if it's certain.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens in your mind when you start to imagine yourself in social situations, and this catastrophic scenario unfolds?

Patient: The moment I picture a social thing, my brain starts narrating a play in terrible detail — I trip over a sentence, someone snickers, others look away, the conversation dies, and by the end of the night I'm the joke everyone repeats. From there it jumps: they stop inviting me, I stop trying, I get rusty, people forget me, and I wind up totally isolated — like within weeks it's this irreversible downhill. My chest tightens, I feel hot and stupid in my head, and the images feel so convincing I can't treat them like just possibilities; they feel like the only outcome, so any alternative just seems... unrealistic.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of social interactions making you feel like a failure and being forgotten is deeply connected to your value of being liked and appreciated by others. Can you think of a time when you felt seen, heard, and valued in a social setting, and what that felt like for you?

Patient: Yeah — once, at my last job, I presented a design and a couple of people actually said it was smart and asked me follow-up questions; I remember feeling seen and surprisingly relaxed for the first time in ages. But the moment that image pops up now, I can also see it unraveling: somebody finds a bug or disagrees, they quietly stop asking me things, the compliments turn into awkward silence, and pretty quickly I’m back to being invisible and the “they liked me” story feels like a one-off that’s bound to be erased. I know that sounds bleak, but that’s exactly how my mind plays it out every time.

Therapist: That pattern of narrative unfolding is indeed bleak, but is it possible that, in this moment, you're perpetuating the very thing you want to avoid? Are you allowing yourself to be defined by the possibility of being ridiculed or ignored, rather than being open to the possibility of success and connection?

Patient: I get what you're saying, and I do try to tell myself the nicer story, but it never sticks — the minute I imagine being liked, my brain rewrites it into how someone will find a flaw, laugh, and everyone will quietly stop inviting me. It doesn't feel like I'm choosing to be defined by fear; it feels like I'm being hijacked by this relentless highlight reel of the worst possible outcome, and imagining anything else just seems... unrealistic. I'm trying not to be stuck in it, but honestly it's exhausting and I don't know how to make it stop.

Therapist: It can feel like being stuck in this cycle, but what if, instead of trying to avoid this hypothetical scenario, you started to focus on what would be like to experience being in social situations without the weight of this catastrophic thinking? What would it feel like to be present, to engage with others, and to take small risks without the constant worry of being ridiculed or ignored?

Patient: I can kind of picture it—feeling lighter, actually following a conversation, maybe even laughing without panicking like that one time at my old job. But the moment I let that image stay, my brain races straight to the worst: I say one awkward thing, someone laughs, people start whispering, invites stop, I withdraw, and within weeks I'm erased again—so the "calm present" scenario just feels like a setup for the inevitable, and imagining anything else feels unrealistic.

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath and, for just a moment, imagine that your thoughts are just thoughts, rather than reality? Allow yourself to see that the idea of being in a social situation and having an awkward moment is not the end of the world. Can you give yourself permission to experience the discomfort of uncertainty, without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I did take a breath like you asked, and for a couple of seconds it loosens the tightness, but then the movie starts again: I say something stupid, someone laughs, people stop inviting me, I get rusty, they forget me, and suddenly I'm completely alone and everything's falling apart. Letting myself feel uncertain just feels like opening the door to that whole collapse—it's hard to treat it like "just a thought" when it plays out in such vivid, inevitable detail. I'm trying, but honestly it's exhausting—can we slow down?

Therapist: Can we try to gently challenge the idea that the worst-case scenario is inevitable? Instead of focusing on the catastrophic outcome, what if, for just a moment, we consider the possibility that the opposite might be true? What if, in a social situation, you were able to connect with others, find common ground, and have meaningful conversations, without it falling apart?

Patient: I hear you, but that opposite scenario just doesn't land for me — my brain turns it into a different, inevitable script: I start okay, someone pokes a hole in what I say, a couple of people smirk, the conversation peters out, invites dry up, and within weeks I'm out of the loop and forgotten. It feels like a fact, not a possibility, and trying to picture anything else just gets swallowed up by that collapse. I'm really tired of this loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and explore this further. Can you describe what it would feel like to let go of the need to control the outcome of a social situation? What would it feel like to allow yourself to be uncertain, without trying to script out every possible scenario? Imagine you're standing at the edge of a forest, and you don't know what's on the other side. What would you do?

Patient: I'd freeze at the edge, heart pounding, and my mind would start scripting the disaster: I take one step, trip on a root, get lost, night falls, nobody notices I'm gone, and that becomes proof I should never go in. So I'd probably turn away and replay that collapse in detail instead of exploring—it's exhausting. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Imagine you're standing in front of a body of water, and you're not sure what's on the other side. Instead of focusing on the potential dangers, what if you were to approach the water's edge with a sense of curiosity? What would it feel like to dip your toes in, to see what happens?

Patient: I can imagine stepping up and feeling a tiny calm when my toe hits the water, like maybe it would be okay for a second. Then my brain fast-forwards: a wave knocks me, I splutter, people see me struggle, they laugh or look away, invites stop, and pretty soon I'm erased — so even trying feels like setting myself up to fail. It's a lot to push through — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. Can you take just one tiny step towards the water's edge, without any expectations or concerns about the outcome? Just place one foot in front of the other, and focus on the sensation of your foot touching the ground. Don't think about what might happen next, just be with the sensation of your foot on the ground.

Patient: I put my foot down — it's solid for a beat and that actually feels... faintly okay. Then the movie kicks in: I trip, people laugh or look away, invites stop, and before long I'm erased — it feels like proof I shouldn't even try. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for just a moment. As you stood there with your foot on the ground, what was the sensation like? What was happening in your body? Can you acknowledge that feeling without judgment, without trying to push it into a particular narrative?

Patient: My foot felt steady for a beat, my breath shallow, chest tight, stomach knotted and my shoulders heavy — it was all just... small, physical. I try to hold that without the story, but my head flips straight to the movie — one awkward breath, somebody laughs, people stop inviting me, I'm erased — I'm not sure I follow how I'm supposed to notice the feeling without it turning into that, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try to gently coax your attention to the physical sensations, without immediately jumping into the narrative. Can you allow yourself to simply notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to do anything or change anything? No judgment, no evaluation, just observation.

Patient: My breath's shallow and kind of barely there — for a moment I can feel it in my chest, like a tiny rhythm. Then my head kicks into the movie: I fumble a line, someone laughs, people stop inviting me, I get rusty, and pretty soon I'm erased. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing the breath stops that loop — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together (pause) and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you find a single point of contact within the sensation of your breath, a tiny anchor that feels like "this is happening"? If you can find that anchor, we can start to explore it further, without immediately jumping into the narrative.

Patient: There's a faint coolness at my nostrils and a little lift in my chest — it's small and steady if I watch it. But as soon as I try to hold that, my brain slides right back into the movie: I fumble a line, people laugh, invites stop, and I'm erased. I don't really see how that anchor helps — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to hold onto the anchor, can you allow it to arise and pass away on its own? Imagine that it's a small, fleeting thing, like a cloud in the sky. Can you watch it come into being, stay for a moment, and then gently drift away, without trying to grasp or hold onto it?

Patient: I can notice the breath coming and going, like that cloud you said—it's faint and then it's gone. But as it drifts away my head immediately jumps to the movie: I fumble a line, people laugh, invites stop, I'm erased, and I don't really see how just watching the breath stops that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and consider what's driving this need for control and avoidance. What's the underlying value or goal that's driving your desire to prevent the worst-case scenario? Is it the fear of feeling rejected, or the desire to be liked and appreciated? Can we explore this value together, and see if we can find a way to connect with it that's not tied to the narrative of catastrophic failure?

Patient: I think it's mostly that I really don't want to be rejected — I want to feel competent, useful, and like I belong. So I end up avoiding because, in my head, avoiding is the only thing that prevents that inevitable movie: I slip up, people laugh, invites stop, and I'm erased. I want to find another way to honor that need, but separating it from the catastrophe feels unrealistic — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's explore a different way to connect with this value. Instead of trying to avoid rejection, what if you allowed yourself to experience rejection in a way that's not catastrophic? What if you could feel the sting of rejection as a signal that you're taking risks and being vulnerable, rather than a sign of failure? Can you imagine yourself being rejected, but still feeling like you're being true to yourself and your values?

Patient: I get why you want me to try that — belonging matters to me — and I did try to picture taking a hit and still feeling alright. But it immediately flips: they tolerate me at first, then stop inviting me, I show up less, my skills feel rusty, people forget me at work and socially, and pretty soon I'm alone and everything's falling apart. Honestly, that exercise just feels like rehearsing the collapse I'm trying to avoid — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause and take a deep breath together. Can you acknowledge that it's okay if the exercise didn't work as intended? Can you allow yourself to feel the physical sensations in your body, like the feeling of your breath moving in and out, without trying to control or change them? We're not trying to achieve a specific outcome, but simply being with the present moment.

Patient: I tried that — the breath is just a faint in-and-out, my shoulders slack for a moment, my chest lightens a bit. But it hardly sticks before the movie kicks in: I say something stupid, people laugh or look away, invites dry up, I get forgotten and everything unravels. I can try to stay with the feeling, but it's really wearing me down—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to observe your thoughts or feelings, can you try to simply be with the physical sensations in your body, without judgment or analysis? Can you focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out? No trying to change or control anything, just being present with what is.

Patient: Okay—my feet feel grounded, the air's cool on my skin, and my breath is small and steady for a beat. Then the movie kicks back in: I blurt something, people laugh or look away, invites stop, I'm forgotten, and it just drains me. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a small step towards creating a more compassionate relationship with your thoughts. Can you notice what happens right before the movie starts playing, before you feel anxious or catastrophized? What is the physical sensation in your body that signals the start of this narrative? Is there a specific thought or phrase that sets off the catastrophic chain reaction?

Patient: Usually it starts as a small tightness in my chest and a lump in my throat — my breath gets shallow, my stomach drops, my hands feel clammy and my vision kind of narrows. Then one awful phrase shows up, like “I’m going to say something stupid and they’ll laugh,” and that line instantly launches the whole movie of being erased; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a small step towards acting on your values. What would it mean for you to take a tiny step towards social interaction, despite your anxiety? Would it be as simple as sending a message to a colleague or acquaintance, or making a phone call to a friend? What would that small action look like, and how would it feel to take it, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: Maybe a tiny step would be sending one short message to a colleague or an old friend—something like “Hey, how’ve you been?”—just to see what happens. Even picturing it makes my chest clamp up and then the movie starts: they ignore it or answer once and never again, invitations dry up, I get rusty and forgotten, and it all spirals into being completely alone—so even that small step feels like setting myself up to fail. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's explore what's driving your need for connection and social interaction. What does it mean to you to feel connected and valued by others? Is it about feeling seen and heard, or is it about feeling competent and worthy? Can you think of a time when you felt deeply connected to someone or something, and what was that experience like for you?

Patient: Connection for me means being seen and useful — like what I do matters and I belong somewhere. I remember that presentation at my old job where people asked follow-ups and I felt calm and noticed, but my brain always fast-forwards: someone points out a flaw, the praise evaporates, invites stop, I get rusty and forgotten, and it all collapses — that outcome feels certain, not just possible. I'm worn out by this pattern — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's explore the idea that being useful and seen doesn't require being liked or accepted by everyone. Can you think of times when you've been helpful or contributed to a group or project, and felt a sense of pride and accomplishment? What was it about those experiences that made them valuable to you?

Patient: Yeah — there were times: mentoring a junior who later told me my advice really helped, or patching a nasty production bug before a release and getting a quiet nod from the lead — those moments felt real, useful, and proud. But almost as soon as I feel that, my mind runs the tape: someone later finds a flaw, they blame me, people stop asking for my input, invitations dry up, I get rusty and forgotten — it all feels like it's just a short walk from praise to being erased. It's a small relief when it happens, but it never lasts long and it's wearing me down — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the feeling of pride and usefulness that you mentioned earlier. Can you stay with that feeling, just for a moment, without trying to analyze it or push it away? What would it be like to simply be with that feeling of pride and usefulness, without the catastrophic thinking that's trying to undermine it?

Patient: I can hold that warmth of pride for a beat — it feels quiet and steady, like something honest and useful. But the second I linger, the movie kicks in: someone spots a flaw, the praise evaporates into awkward silence, invites stop, I get rusty and then I'm erased. I'm trying to stay with it, but it's slipping away and I'm worn out—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to hold onto the feeling of pride, what if we focus on the physical sensation of being in that state? Can you notice the sensation of your body relaxing, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Can you stay with those sensations, without trying to analyze or change them, and just be with them?

Patient: My feet feel planted and my breath is small and steady for a beat, my shoulders a little looser. Then the movie kicks in: I mess up a line, someone snickers, invites dry up, I get rusty and forgotten — it feels inevitable and it just drains me. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try to approach this situation with a sense of curiosity and openness. What if, instead of trying to avoid the movie, we were to simply observe it without judgment? Can you imagine yourself watching the movie, without trying to stop it or change it, but simply allowing it to play out as it is? What would that feel like for you?

Patient: If I try to watch it, it doesn't feel detached — it's like I'm inside the replay, counting the steps: I fumble a line, someone laughs, invites stop, I pull back, my skills get rusty, people forget me, and it's over. Observing just makes the collapse feel more inevitable, not less. I don't really know how to sit with it without getting pulled back in — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and explore what's driving your need to avoid social interactions. What is it about being in social situations that feels so precarious to you? Is it the fear of being judged, evaluated, or rejected? Can you think of a time when you felt truly seen and valued in a social situation, and what was it about that experience that felt so different?

Patient: Mostly it's the fear of being judged and rejected — I tie my worth to being useful and seen, so any social moment feels like a test where one small mistake will prove I'm not worth keeping around. I can recall that presentation where I felt seen, but my brain hijacks it: someone spots a flaw, the compliments stop, people stop inviting me, I withdraw, get rusty, and pretty soon I'm erased — it feels like a chain reaction that's inevitable. I'm already worn thin just talking about it—can we slow down?
