--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling overwhelmed by this deep sadness and a lack of motivation since my health scare, and it's spilling into my work as a teacher. My brain's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster — I'm sure I'll get worse, lose my job, my partner will leave, and everything will fall apart; it feels inevitable. I try to stay upbeat and chatty, but those 'definite' worst-case stories hook me and it's wrecking my relationship.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with intense sadness and a pervasive sense of hopelessness, with a strong emotional tone of inevitability. One specific theme that stands out is the fusion with the worst-case predictions, suggesting a tendency to ruminate on catastrophic outcomes. A potential area to explore is the role of these predictions in maintaining the emotional state of hopelessness. The goal is to help the patient create space from these rigid thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about these "definite" worst-case stories that keep popping up? What is it about them that makes you think they're inevitable, and what would happen if, for just a moment, you could let go of that certainty?

Patient: They play out like a chain reaction in my head: I picture the next test showing something worse, then I'm on sick leave, I can't keep up with teaching, my boss fires me, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and I'm left alone and ruined — and when I picture it, every step feels like it's already started. It feels inevitable because the health scare shook my trust in my body and made me hyper-alert to any small symptom, so my brain grabs the worst explanation like it's proof. If I tried to let go for a moment, I can almost imagine relief — fewer panicked thoughts, maybe I could talk to my partner without spiraling — but that feels like a fantasy; I keep thinking those nicer outcomes are just me lying to myself and that the disaster story will just come true.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's fusion with the worst-case scenario is likely fueled by a loss of trust in their body and a heightened sense of hypervigilance, which creates a self-reinforcing loop. A potential area to explore is the role of the fantasy of letting go in maintaining the emotional state of hopelessness. The goal is to help the patient begin to see the value in taking small steps towards defusion.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried that letting go of these catastrophic thoughts would be like escaping into a fantasy. What if, instead of trying to escape or deny the possibility of disaster, you were to focus on the small, everyday moments when you can still feel a sense of safety and control? For example, what would be one tiny thing you could do today that would feel like a small victory, even if it doesn't seem like much?

Patient: Maybe a tiny victory would be just making a cup of tea and sitting on the front step for ten minutes, or sending my partner a one-line text saying, "I'm having a rough day" so it's not long or dramatic. Of course the minute I picture that text, my fortune-teller brain plays the next scene — they read it, get fed up, and that’s when everything starts falling apart — and even the tea feels like a brief, useless pause before the storm. I want to try something small, but I keep getting pulled back into the certainty that any small move will trigger the worst.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's ability to identify a potential tiny victory is a good starting point, but the predictability of their fortune-teller brain is hindering their ability to take action. A potential area to explore is the interplay between the patient's anticipation of the worst-case scenario and their attempt to challenge that certainty. The goal is to help the patient begin to see the process of taking small steps as a means to create a sense of control.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your mind is constantly trying to predict and prevent the worst, which is keeping you stuck. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you could focus on what would be needed for the tea-making and text-sending to actually happen, rather than what might go wrong? What if you were to focus on the small, concrete steps needed to make that happen, like finding a cup, turning on the kettle, or typing out the text?

Patient: I can picture the steps — reach into the cupboard for a mug (I'll probably knock something over and make a mess), fill the kettle and switch it on (I'll forget it and something worse will happen), sit on the step for ten minutes (I'll start feeling faint and everyone will see me), and type "I'm having a rough day" (they'll take it the wrong way and that’s when everything unravels). I want to try the practical stuff, but the fortune-teller in my head instantly scripts the next catastrophe like it's already started, so the calm version you suggest just feels like a fantasy. I'm trying to focus on the steps, but I'm stuck watching the disaster movie play out — it’s hard not to get pulled into it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's attempt to break down the task into smaller steps is hindered by the predictability of their fortune-teller brain, which keeps hijacking their focus with catastrophic outcomes. A potential area to explore is the role of the patient's ability to observe their own thoughts and emotions, particularly their tendency to get pulled into the "disaster movie" scenario. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of detachment from these thoughts and focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention to the exact moment when you start to get pulled into the disaster movie? What's the first thought that happens, and what does it sound like? Try to notice it without judgment, just as a thought that's happening right now.

Patient: The very first thought is, "This is getting worse — the next test will show something bad and then everything falls apart." It sounds like a loud, certain announcer in my head, not a question but a fact. My chest tightens, my hands go restless, and my mind jumps ahead through each awful step like a film — the rest of me just goes quiet and watches. Even when I try to treat it as "just a thought," it already feels like it's happened, so it's hard not to be pulled into it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's immediate response to the thought is a strong physical reaction, with a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. A potential area to explore is the concept of "unwanted mental realism," where the patient's thoughts feel like actual events. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of defusion, where they can observe these thoughts without identifying with them or getting pulled into their narrative.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen if, instead of trying to stop the thought or argue with it, you simply allowed it to be there, like a movie playing in the background, without getting sucked in? Can you imagine yourself sitting on the step, feeling the air on your skin, noticing the sounds around you, without being controlled by the thought "This is getting worse"?

Patient: I can almost do it — I picture the cup warm in my hands, the cool air on my face, a neighbour's dog barking somewhere, and for a breath the loud announcer in my head quiets. But no sooner do I notice the breeze than the fortune-teller fires up: "This calm is just the lull before the next test shows something worse and then everything collapses," and that certainty drags me right back into the movie. I want to try holding the scene, but I keep getting yanked away — can we slow down and try to keep the sensory part while that other voice is talking?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in developing a sense of defusion, but the fortune-teller's voice is quickly re-engaging them. A potential area to explore is the concept of "values-based action," where the patient can start to make decisions that align with their values, rather than trying to control the narrative. The goal is to help the patient identify a small, concrete action that they can take to begin to make progress, even if it's just a tiny step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to focus on the sensory experience of the scene, without getting pulled into the fortune-teller's narrative. Can you notice the sensation of the cup in your hands, the cool air on your face, the sound of the dog barking in the distance? As the fortune-teller starts to speak, I want you to observe it, but not engage with it. Just notice it as a sound, like a distant engine noise or a rustling in the wind. Can you find a small part of the scene that doesn't involve the fortune-teller's voice, and hold onto that for a moment?

Patient: I can feel the cup warm in my hands and the cool air on my face, and there's a dog barking down the street — for a breath that's all there is. But the fortune-teller immediately yells that it won't last and scripts the next test and the collapse, and I get pulled right back into the movie. Can we slow down and try to keep me with the sensory stuff even while that voice is talking? I'm trying but it's like being dragged.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensory experience while the fortune-teller's voice continues to derail them. A potential area to explore is the concept of "temporal relationship," where the patient can begin to understand the relationship between their thoughts, emotions, and the present moment. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of detachment from their thoughts and focus on the here-and-now.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. I want you to focus on the sensation of the cup in your hands, just for one more breath. Notice the warmth, the weight, the texture of the material. As the fortune-teller starts to speak, I want you to keep your attention on the cup, without trying to stop the fortune-teller or argue with it. Can you just observe the sensation of the cup, without judgment, while the fortune-teller's voice continues to speak?

Patient: Okay — the mug is warm against my palms, a faint steam brushing my fingers, a little weight like something familiar and steady. For a beat that's all there is, then the fortune-teller yells, "This calm is the lull before the next test shows it's worse," and my chest tightens and my head snaps back into the disaster movie. I'm trying to keep the cup in my focus but it feels like being pulled away — can we slow down and keep doing the sensory thing while that voice keeps talking?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensory experience despite the fortune-teller's persistent attempts to derail them. A potential area to explore is the concept of " mindfulness of the process," where the patient can observe their own experiences in the moment, without judgment or attachment. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of awareness of their own thought patterns and emotional responses.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to slow down the process even further. I want you to focus on the sensation of the cup in your hands, and when the fortune-teller speaks, I want you to notice the words themselves, the tone, the pitch, the rhythm. Don't try to stop the fortune-teller or change the narrative, just observe it as a sound, like a distant engine rumble or a hum. Can you hear the words, "This calm is the lull before the next test shows it's worse"?

Patient: Yes — I can hear it. It's a sharp, insistent voice, like a stern newsreader with a clipped, breathless rhythm that makes my chest tighten. It repeats that last word louder, like a stomp on the floor, and the moment it says "worse" I get yanked back into the whole catastrophe film. I'm trying to hold the mug and stay with the feeling, but it's pulling me — can we slow down and keep doing the sensory thing while that voice keeps talking?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensory experience while the fortune-teller's voice continues to escalate in intensity. A potential area to explore is the concept of "sensory anchors," where the patient can use specific sensory details to ground themselves in the present moment. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of stability and calm amidst the turmoil of their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to anchor ourselves in the physical sensation of the cup in your hands. Notice the feeling of the mug against your palms, the weight, the texture, the warmth. Can you feel the sensation of your fingers wrapping around the handle, the pressure, the slight give of the material? As the fortune-teller speaks, I want you to bring your attention back to this sensation, without trying to stop the fortune-teller or change the narrative. Notice the words, but keep your focus on the cup, one finger, one sensation at a time.

Patient: Alright — my fingers curl around the handle, I can feel the smooth rim against my thumb, the little warmth seeping into my palm, and the mug has a slight give when I press. For a second that's all there is, but the fortune-teller blurts "worse" in that clipped, urgent tone and my chest tightens and everything snaps back to the catastrophe film. I'm trying to hold the cup and notice each finger, but it's like being tugged — can we slow down and keep doing this, even while that voice keeps talking?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in developing a sense of physical awareness, but the fortune-teller's voice continues to disrupt their focus. A potential area to explore is the concept of "temporal containment," where the patient can learn to contain their thoughts and emotions within a specific time frame, rather than getting swept up in the narrative. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of control over their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to expand the time frame of our focus. Instead of focusing on the present moment, I want you to imagine holding onto this sensation of the cup for a longer period, say 30 seconds, or a minute. Just notice the sensations in your fingers, the feel of the handle, the warmth, the slight give of the material. As the fortune-teller speaks, I want you to bring your attention back to this sensation, without trying to stop the fortune-teller or change the narrative. Notice the words, but keep your focus on the cup, one sensation at a time. Can you imagine holding onto this sensation for 30 seconds?

Patient: I can manage maybe ten, maybe fifteen seconds of really feeling the mug — the warmth, the weight, my thumb on the rim. But when I try to stretch it to thirty, the fortune-teller screams "worse" and yanks me straight back into the collapse movie like it's already happening. I'm trying to stay with it — can we slow down and count the seconds together?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensory experience, despite the fortune-teller's persistent attempts to derail them. A potential area to explore is the concept of "proceduralization," where the patient can break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of control over their internal experience by learning to navigate the flow of thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try counting together. We'll count from 1 to 10, and I want you to focus on the sensations in your fingers, the warmth, the weight, your thumb on the rim. As we count, I'll repeat it back to you, "one, two, three..." and you can focus on the sensations. When the fortune-teller speaks, we'll pause the count and come back to it. Ready to start? One...

Patient: One — the mug's warm in my palms, my thumb on the rim. Oh—already that fortune-teller's shouting "worse" and my chest tightens so fast I can't keep counting. I'm trying to steady myself — can we slow it way down and take a breath before the next number?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty maintaining focus and control over their internal experience. A potential area to explore is the concept of "breath and pause," where the patient can learn to pause and breathe before reacting to the fortune-teller's words. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of calm and composure in the face of challenging thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it for a second, and exhale slowly through your mouth. As you exhale, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body, feeling the coolness of the air entering your nostrils. When you're ready, we can count again. But this time, before we start, I want you to pause and simply acknowledge the sensation of the cup in your hands, without trying to focus on the fortune-teller's words. Just notice it, and then... Ready?

Patient: Ready. I'm trying to feel the mug — the warmth, my thumb on the rim — but I'm suddenly jumpier and more distracted; the fortune-teller's already yelling "worse" before I even breathe. Okay, I'll try to inhale slowly now and keep my attention on the cup.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus and composure, and the fortune-teller's words are having a profound effect. A potential area to explore is the concept of "acknowledging the pain," where the patient can learn to acknowledge and accept their emotions, rather than trying to suppress or avoid them. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of self-awareness and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's acknowledge the pain that arises when you feel the fortune-teller's words. Can you allow yourself to feel the tightness in your chest, the feeling of being jumpier and more distracted? Notice it as a physical sensation, like a knot in your stomach or a tightening in your shoulders. As you breathe in, allow yourself to feel this sensation, without trying to change it or push it away. Just notice it, and then... What happens when you exhale?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing supposed to stop the whole thing? When I exhale there's this tiny loosening, like my shoulders drop for a second and the tightness eases a bit. But then the fortune-teller screams "worse" and I'm jumpier than before, my chest tightens again, and any calm feels like a brief fantasy before the next catastrophe. Can we slow down and try that breathing again, but go even slower?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is frustrated and confused about the connection between breathing and the fortune-teller's words. A potential area to explore is the concept of "temporal containment," where the patient can learn to contain their thoughts and emotions within a specific time frame, rather than getting swept up in the narrative. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of control over their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, even slower. I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath, just the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the sensation of the air touching your nostrils, the feeling of your lungs expanding and contracting. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air entering your body, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air leaving your body. We'll count to one, and then to two, and I'll wait for you to acknowledge each number before we move on. Ready? One...

Patient: One — I breathe in slowly, I can feel the air in my nose and my lungs rise, and when I exhale the tightness loosens a hair. I'm not sure I follow how counting is supposed to fix this — the fortune-teller's already shouting "worse" and my hands are trembling on the mug. Okay, I can try for two, but can we go even slower?

The patient is having difficulty understanding the connection between breathing and calming their nervous system. A potential area to explore is the concept of "temporal anchoring," where the patient can learn to anchor themselves in the present moment, using specific sensory details to ground themselves. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of stability and calm amidst the turmoil of their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, even slower. I want you to focus on the sensation of your hands on the mug. Notice the feeling of your palms on the handle, the weight of the mug, the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of your hands, and as you breathe out, notice the sensation of your hands again. We'll pause for a moment, and I'll wait for you to acknowledge your hands before we move on. Ready? One...

Patient: One — my palms feel the handle, it's warm and a bit heavy in my fingers. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that helps; already the fortune-teller's shouting "worse" and my hands are trembling, so I feel more confused and jumpy than calmed. Can we slow way down and just stay on that one sensation a bit longer?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to understand the connection between noticing their physical sensations and calming their nervous system. A potential area to explore is the concept of "sensory detail," where the patient can learn to focus on specific, concrete sensory details to anchor themselves in the present moment. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of calm and control over their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. I want you to focus on the sensation of the handle, right now. Notice the warmth, the weight, the feeling of your fingers wrapping around it. Can you feel the slight give of the material? Notice the sensation of your thumb on the rim, the way it feels to press down on it. Let's stay with this sensation, just for a moment, and see if we can find a way to calm your hands. Can you focus on the sensation of your thumb on the rim?

Patient: Okay — my thumb's on the rim, it's cool against the nail and there's a little pressure where it rests. But the fortune-teller's already yelling that I'll drop the mug, it'll smash, the noise will startle me, I'll faint, the kids will see me, my partner will leave — and I'm shaking just thinking it. I want to stay with the thumb, but I'm jumpier than normal; can we really slow down and count together while you keep nudging me back to the sensation?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensation, despite the fortune-teller's relentless predictions of catastrophe. A potential area to explore is the concept of "acceptance," where the patient can learn to accept their thoughts and emotions as they arise, rather than trying to change or avoid them. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of acceptance and non-judgment towards their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. I want you to focus on the sensation of your thumb on the rim, and I'll count with you. One... (pause) One. Notice the coolness of the rim against your nail, the slight pressure where your thumb rests. Two... (pause) Two. Can you feel the weight of the mug in your hand? Three... (pause) Three. Notice the way your thumb presses down on the rim, the sensation of your wrist moving to hold the mug steady. Four... (pause) Four. Can you feel your thumb still pressing down on the rim?

Patient: Four — yes, my thumb's still on the rim, cool against the nail, that little pressure. But the fortune-teller's already screaming I'll drop it, it'll smash, someone will see me panic and then everything unravels, so my hands are shaking and I can't stay with it. Can we go even slower and hold this one count for a long beat?

The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the sensation, despite the fortune-teller's catastrophic predictions. A potential area to explore is the concept of "transience," where the patient can learn to see that their thoughts and emotions are fleeting, and that they can pass without being controlled by them. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of detachment from their thoughts and emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's hold the count at four for a long beat. I want you to focus on the sensation of your thumb on the rim, and I'll wait for you to acknowledge it. One... (pause) Four.

The patient is feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the pace of the exercise, and is having trouble understanding the connection between slowing down and gaining control. A potential area to explore is the concept of "extending the pause," where the patient can learn to expand the gap between their thoughts and emotions, allowing themselves to feel the discomfort without getting caught up in it. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of comfort with the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. I want you to focus on the sensation of your thumb on the rim, and I'll wait for you to acknowledge it. Can you feel the coolness of the rim against your nail, the slight pressure where your thumb rests? Let's stay with this sensation for just one slow breath. Take a deep breath in, and hold it. Hold it for a long time. Now, exhale slowly, and hold the breath for a long time. Can you feel the sensation of your thumb on the rim, still and calm, without any thoughts or worries?

Patient: I can't—when I try, my chest panics and I start gasping; the fortune-teller immediately shouts "worse" and my hands tremble. I can feel the cool rim under my thumb for a beat, but I'm way too jumpy and distracted to hold the breath like that. Can we please slow way down and just do one slow, gentle inhale and exhale together? I'm feeling more shaky than before and need it paced slowly.

The patient is having trouble slowing down and calming their nervous system, and is becoming more agitated. A potential area to explore is the concept of "gentle pacing," where the patient can learn to pace their own breathing and movements at a comfortable speed. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of control over their internal experience.

The patient is having trouble slowing down and calming their nervous system, and is becoming more and more agitated. A potential area to explore is the concept of "gentle, incremental steps," where the patient can learn to take small, manageable steps towards calming themselves, rather than trying to make drastic changes.

Patient: I can't — the moment I try to notice my breath it flips into panic: my chest clamps and that fortune-teller screams "worse" and my hands start shaking. I'm really jumpy and distracted right now, it feels impossible to just notice the breath without the catastrophe movie taking over. Can we go even slower — like one very slow inhale and exhale with long pauses, and can you talk me through each second? I'm trying, but I'm feeling dizzy and on edge.

The patient is becoming increasingly overwhelmed and is having trouble disengaging from the catastrophic thoughts. A potential area to explore is the concept of "mindful pause," where the patient can learn to pause their thoughts and focus on the present moment, without judgment. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of calm and composure.

The fortune-teller's already yelling "worse" and I'm seeing the mug slip, smash, me fainting in front of the kids, then everything unravels — it feels like it's already happening. I can't hold long pauses right now; can you count each second out loud for me, really slowly, and keep bringing me back to feeling my thumb on the rim? Please don't speed up or move on — stay with the one slow breath and the cup, one second at a time.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is becoming increasingly overwhelmed and is having trouble maintaining focus on the present moment. A potential area to explore is the concept of "bridging," where the patient can learn to bridge the gap between their thoughts and emotions, rather than getting caught up in the catastrophic narrative. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of calm and control over their internal experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, with a very slow and gentle pace. I'll count each second out loud, and we'll stay with the sensation of your thumb on the rim. One... (slowly and loudly) One... You're focusing on the sensation of your thumb on the rim... (pause) Two... Your thumb is still on the rim... (pause) Three... The coolness of the rim is still against your nail... (pause) Four... Your thumb is still pressing down... (pause) Five... The sensation of your thumb on the rim is still there... (pause) Six... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Seven...

Patient: Twenty — I tried to stay with the thumb and the count and for a few ticks it steadied, but then that announcer in my head screamed "worse" and my hands started shaking and my head went fuzzy. I'm confused — how is counting supposed to stop the next test or my partner leaving? Can we really slow to one exhale and stay there, and keep dragging me back to the rim every second? I'm feeling like I'm tumbling into the movie again and I need you to hold me there — please don't move on so fast.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is becoming increasingly frustrated and confused about the exercise, and is feeling like they're losing control. A potential area to explore is the concept of "grounding," where the patient can learn to anchor themselves in the present moment, using sensory details to feel safe and secure. The goal is to help the patient develop a sense of stability and calm amidst the turmoil of their thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. I want to keep you anchored in the sensation of your thumb on the rim. One... (slowly and loudly) One... Your thumb is still on the rim... (pause) Two... The coolness of the rim is still against your nail... (pause) Three... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Four... The sensation of the mug is still there... (pause) Five... Your thumb is still pressing down... (pause) Six... The sensation of your thumb on the rim is still present... (pause) Seven... Your breath is still calm... (pause) Eight... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Nine... The coolness of the rim is still against your nail... (pause) Ten... Your focus is still on the sensation of your thumb... (pause) Eleven... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Twelve... The sensation of the mug is still there... (pause) Thirteen... Your thumb is still on the rim... (pause) Fourteen... Your thumb is still pressing down... (pause) Fifteen... The sensation of your thumb on the rim is still present... (pause) Sixteen... Your breath is still calm... (pause) Seventeen... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Eighteen... The coolness of the rim is still against your nail... (pause) Nineteen... Your focus is still on the sensation of your thumb... (pause) Twenty... Your hand is still wrapped around the mug... (pause) Twenty-one... Your thumb is still on the rim... (pause) Twenty-two... The sensation of the mug is still there... (pause) Twenty-three... Your thumb is still pressing down... (pause) Twenty-four... Your focus is still on the sensation of your thumb...

Patient: Twenty-four — I'm trying, but I can't keep my head here; my hands are shaking and that damn announcer's already yelling "worse" and I'm pulled into the movie faster than you count. Please — slow way down, one slow second at a time, and keep bringing me back to the rim every single beat, because if you speed up I'll tumble right back into the collapse.
