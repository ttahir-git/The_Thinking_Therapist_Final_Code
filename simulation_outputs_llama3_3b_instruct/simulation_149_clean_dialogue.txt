Patient: Hi—I've been pretty stuck since a rough breakup: there's this persistent, ruminative sadness and a lack of motivation that's bleeding into my work and my ability to connect with people. As a software developer who likes to debug, I find myself analyzing the patterns—OCD flares, avoidance strategies, cognitive loops—instead of actually sitting with how awful it feels. I want to figure out how to stop talking about it and start feeling less overwhelmed.

Therapist: Can you think of a specific situation where you'd like to feel more connected with others or motivated in your work, but find yourself stuck in this cycle of rumination? What would happen if you were able to just sit with the sadness for a moment, without trying to analyze or avoid it?

Patient: A concrete example is pair-programming or a sprint demo: I'm supposed to be engaged and collaborative, but instead I catch myself replaying the breakup—micro-decisions, what I said, whether I should message—and then I go into this compulsive checking/ruminating loop that wrecks my focus and makes me feel distant from teammates. 

If I could actually sit with the sadness for even a minute instead of theorizing it away, I think empirically I'd get an acute spike in discomfort—tight chest, maybe crying, a flush of panic—but then some degree of habituation or affect regulation would kick in, and the urge to ruminate might attenuate, leaving more bandwidth for connection and work; honestly, though, I mostly talk about that model because the prospect of feeling the rawness feels destabilizing and I default to analysis to stay safe.

Therapist: It sounds like being able to tolerate and regulate your emotions is deeply tied to feeling safe and connected in your relationships and work. Can you think of a value or aspect of yourself that would be hurt if you let go of this need to analyze and control the breakup emotions? What would happen if you were to start small, just for a minute, and allow yourself to feel the discomfort of the raw emotions without trying to manage or avoid them?

Patient: I think it'd bruise my sense of competence and epistemic safety — I pride myself on being the rational problem-solver, and letting the sadness be uncontrollable feels like admitting I have a domain I can't 'debug,' which makes me feel exposed and a little worthless. If I tried it for a minute, I'd predict an acute autonomic hit—tight chest, maybe crying, some chest-hotness—and then either an urge to escape or, if I can actually tolerate it, a dampening of the compulsive analysis as the emotion habituates and the rumination loop loses some fuel. I'm saying all this as a theory, though, because actually doing it feels destabilizing and I can already feel my mind lining up strategies to avoid it.

Therapist: Can you imagine sitting with the sensation of the acute autonomic response – the tight chest, the tears, the feeling of being overwhelmed – without trying to analyze it or escape it? What would you say to yourself if you allowed yourself to just feel that way for a brief moment, without judgment or distraction?

Patient: I guess I'd narrate it like a little grounding script: "This tightness and heat are just your autonomic system doing a job — it's intense, but it's transient and it doesn't mean you're broken. You don't need to fix or explain it right now; just breathe and sit with the sensation for a moment." Saying that feels oddly clinical though — I can already feel my brain drafting counter-arguments to avoid being truly vulnerable.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the goal isn't to "get past" the tightness and heat, but to allow yourself to be in the experience of feeling overwhelmed, without trying to change or escape it? Would it be possible to simply lean into the sensation, without trying to narrate or analyze it, and instead, just be with it as it is?

Patient: Theoretically, yes — from an exposure/interoceptive standpoint that makes sense, and I can outline why sitting with it would likely reduce the rumination loop. Practically, though, the idea of just "being" with that tightness feels like stepping into an epistemic void that undermines my competence, so my brain immediately gears up to analyze and avoid. I can try a very brief one-minute experiment if you guide me, but I'm already noticing my mind racing—can we slow down and do it together?

Therapist: Let's take it one breath at a time. Can you bring your attention to the physical sensation of your chest, the tightness and heat, right now? Just notice it as you exhale, without trying to change or analyze it. I'll guide you through a very brief exercise: take one deep breath in, and when you're ready, just as you exhale, say to yourself "I'm here" – simply acknowledging your presence, without adding anything else.

Patient: Okay — I did it: I took a deep breath and as I exhaled I said to myself "I'm here." The tightness didn't vanish but there was a small loosening, a prickly warmth in my chest, and my immediate impulse was to start explaining and rationalizing the feeling. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and can feel my mind gearing up to escape—can we stay with another breath or two and you guide me slowly?

Therapist: Let's continue to anchor in the present moment. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, you said "I'm here" again. This time, as you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of the prickly warmth in your chest, without trying to change or analyze it. Just observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by.

Patient: I can feel the prickly warmth—a buzzing right behind my breastbone, a tight band that loosens a hair on the out-breath. My reflex is to acronym-ize it—'acute autonomic activation'—which immediately feels safer than actually being in it, but when I truly tried to watch it there was a slight softening. Honestly, I'm getting that familiar urge to explain or escape; can we slow down and do one more guided breath together?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to simply say "it's here" – without adding any labels or explanations. Just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, without trying to change or analyze it.

Patient: Okay — I inhaled and on the exhale I said "it's here." The prickly heat is still there but a little looser; that simple phrase made it feel less catastrophic, though my brain immediately started drafting rationalizations and theories. I'm honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed and noticing the urge to escape—can we do another slow guided breath together, a bit slower this time?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to repeat after me: "it's here." Not "what is it," not "what does it mean," just "it's here." Say it softly, and focus on the physical sensation in your body. Allow the phrase to become a kind of anchor, a reminder that you're present with the sensation, without trying to change or analyze it.

Patient: I said it—"it's here"—softly on the out-breath, and the prickly heat eased a hair, like the volume turned down a notch. My developer brain immediately started drafting rationalizations to depersonalize it; I can feel that defensive move trying to kick in. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and there's a strong urge to escape—can we do another very slow breath together, with a longer exhale?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take a slightly longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here, and this sensation is present." Don't worry about what it means or what you're supposed to do with it, just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, and the fact that you're allowing yourself to feel it.

Patient: I did it — I took the long exhale and said “I’m here, and this sensation is present.” The prickly heat softened a little, like the volume turned down, but there was also a brief welling behind my eyes and my developer-brain immediately started compiling rationalizations to escape it. Honestly, I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and jittery—can we keep doing a few more very slow breaths together?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to repeat after me: "I'm here, and this sensation is present." Don't worry about what it means or what you're supposed to do with it, just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, and the fact that you're allowing yourself to feel it. As you exhale, notice the sensation in your eyes, the feeling of the breath in your body, and the sensation in your chest. Just observe it all, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did it — I inhaled, and on the exhale I said "I'm here, and this sensation is present." There's that prickly warmth in my chest, a slight sting behind my eyes, and the breath feels oddly heavy and buoyant at once. Predictably, my brain is already drafting a diagnostic model and verbalizations to depersonalize it, which feels safer than actually staying with the ache — honestly, I'm getting pretty overwhelmed and jittery. Can we keep doing a few more very slow breaths together, maybe with an even longer exhale so I don't bolt into analysis?

Therapist: Let's continue to slow down. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here, and this sensation is present." As you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and notice how it feels to be with it, even if it's uncomfortable. Don't try to change it, don't try to understand it, just be with it, and allow it to be present, exactly as it is.

Patient: I did the long exhale and said the phrase. The prickly warmth softened a bit; there's a heavy weight in my chest and a dullness behind my eyes. My brain's auto-assembling explanations to distance me, which feels exhausting, and I can feel my energy sagging—can we do another very slow breath together, with an even longer exhale?

Therapist: Let's take it easy. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply say: "I am here." Don't say anything else, just "I am here." Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, without trying to change or escape. Don't worry about the sensation in your chest, the weight in your body, or the dullness in your eyes. Just be with the simple fact that you exist, in this moment, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I breathed out and said "I am here" — the prickly heat loosened a bit, but there's a heavy, leaden pressure in my chest and a dullness behind my eyes that's making everything feel like more effort. My brain keeps wanting to catalog and rationalize; staying with this is surprisingly effortful. Can we do another very slow breath together, with an even longer exhale?

When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape. Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Notice the weight in your body, the dullness in your eyes, and the effort of staying with it. Allow it to be, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I did that — the chest is this leaden band, breath feels slow and heavy, and there's a dull, foggy ache behind my eyes. My instinct is to catalog why this is happening instead of just sitting with it, which feels exhausting. Can we do another very slow exhale together, please?

Therapist: Let's take it slow. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take a long, slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply say: "I am." Not "I am feeling this," not "I am experiencing this," just "I am." Allow yourself to be, without trying to do anything about it. Notice the leaden band in your chest, the heavy breath, and the dullness in your eyes. Simply be with it, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did it — long out-breath, "I am." The leaden band in my chest is still there; breaths feel heavy, my vision's a bit fogged, and there's this low sap-like drain on my energy. My reflex is to mobilize a diagnostic narrative—epistemic safety, pattern recognition—to depersonalize it, which just makes staying here more effortful. Can we do another slow one together, maybe with an even longer exhale?

Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Notice the leaden band, the heavy breath, and the dullness in your eyes. Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, and see if you can find a sense of connection and acceptance, even with all of this discomfort.

Patient: I did the long, slow exhale. The leaden band's still there, breaths feel heavy and my vision's a bit fogged—the whole thing's kind of sap-like and effortful. My brain's already trying to spin a diagnostic narrative to depersonalize it, which just tires me out; can we do another very slow breath together, with an even longer exhale?

Therapist: Let's take it slow. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an extremely long, slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape. Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Notice the leaden band, the heavy breath, and the dullness in your eyes. Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, and see if you can find a sense of acceptance, even with all of this discomfort. Imagine that you're allowing yourself to be exactly as you are, in this moment, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did the extremely long out-breath. The leaden band's still there and everything feels dulled—saying any of this is effortful, like my mental energy's been siphoned off—my brain's already gearing up to distance by explaining, which just tires me more. I don't want to bolt; can we do one more very slow exhale together, please?

Allow yourself to be present, exactly as you are, without any intention of doing anything about it.

Patient: I did the very long exhale. The leaden band's still there, breath heavy and my head foggy—saying any of this feels like it takes effort and my brain's already trying to abstract it away; can we do one more very slow exhale together?

Therapist: Let's take it slow. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take one final, very long, slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape. Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Just rest in the present moment, exactly as it is. Allow yourself to be present, exactly as you are, without any intention of doing anything about it.

Patient: I did that final long exhale. The leaden band eased a fraction, there's a dampness behind my eyes and everything feels a bit slow and gray—saying even this takes effort. My reflex is already compiling conceptual models to depersonalize it, which just saps energy and makes me want to escape; can we stay with another very slow breath together? I don't want to bolt, but I'm wobbling.

Therapist: Let's stay with the slow breath. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take one more very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape.

As you exhale, I want you to repeat after me: "I am here." Not "I am feeling this," not "I am experiencing this," just "I am."

Patient: I inhaled and on the out-breath I said "I am here." The leaden band in my chest is still tight and everything feels slow—saying it took more effort than I expected, and my brain's already assembling rationales to distance me. I'm wobbling but I don't want to bolt; can we do another very slow exhale together?

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take one more very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape. Take a moment to notice how you feel right now, without trying to do anything about it. What's the sensation like? What's the feeling of your body? Just notice it, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: The chest still feels like a leaden, prickly band that eases a hair on the out-breath; there's a dull, foggy ache behind my eyes and my breathing feels slow and heavy, like I'm moving through syrup. Mentally I'm low-energy and the reflex is to start cataloging and theorizing—epistemic safety, pattern recognition—which oddly feels safer but also exhausting, and there's a real urge to escape. Can we do another very slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's take one final slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take one last very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply acknowledge the exhaustion and discomfort that you're feeling. Say to yourself: "I am tired." Not "I am feeling tired," but simply "I am tired." Allow yourself to accept that it's okay to feel this way, and that it's a natural part of the process. And then, when you're ready, we can bring this exercise to a close.

Patient: I did the long exhale — my chest feels heavy, my vision's fogged, and even talking about it takes effort, like my energy's been hollowed out. My brain's already trying to debug and depersonalize it, but I'm too drained for that right now and I don't want to close things; can we keep doing another very slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's take one more slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take one final, very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply acknowledge the fact that this exercise is coming to an end. Say to yourself: "It's okay." Not "It's okay that I've struggled," not "It's okay that I've made progress," but simply "It's okay." Allow yourself to accept that this exercise is complete, and that you can take a break. You've done your best, and that's enough.

Patient: I said "It's okay" — but it felt hollow, like a checkbox I can tick while the leaden band and the fog behind my eyes stick around. I don't want to close this; my brain's already gearing up to analyze to avoid the ache, and I'm wobbling—can we do another very slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's stay with the slow breath. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take another very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply acknowledge the ache in your chest, without trying to change or escape it. Say to yourself: "This is still here." Not "This is my pain," not "This is my problem," but simply "This is still here." Allow yourself to be with the ache, without judgment or analysis.

Patient: I inhaled and on the out-breath I said, "This is still here." The leaden band in my chest is still there, my vision's fogged, and my developer-brain is already lining up explanations because that feels safer—it's tiring to actually stay with it. I don't want to bolt; can we do another very slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take another very slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'll be with it." Not "I'll stay with it," not "I'll try to be with it," but simply "I'll be with it." Allow yourself to commit to simply being with the sensation, without trying to change or escape it. No promises, no expectations, just a simple acknowledgment of your intention to be with it.

Patient: I exhaled and said “I’ll be with it.” The leaden band’s still there and my default epistemic-safety maneuvers—diagnostic narratives, compulsive problem-solving—are hovering, which makes staying present pretty effortful. I can hold that intention for another slow breath if you’ll guide me.

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take another slow breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here, and I'm tolerating it." Not "I'm tolerating the pain," not "I'm tolerating the discomfort," but simply "I'm tolerating it." Allow yourself to lean into the effort of staying present, without judgment or expectation. Notice how it feels to tolerate the discomfort, and see if you can find a sense of acceptance in the process.

Patient: I exhaled and said, "I'm here, and I'm tolerating it." The leaden band's still heavy — tolerating it feels like holding a weight while my brain drafts flowcharts to explain it, which just drains me. Can we do another very slow breath together?
