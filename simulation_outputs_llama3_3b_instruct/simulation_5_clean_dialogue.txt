Patient: I'm an older accountant who just started a really demanding new job, and lately I've been diving into hobbies to numb all the uncomfortable stuff that comes with the change. I don't know, it keeps me busy but then I feel guilty like I'm avoiding the real problems. I guess talking about it feels awkward and I don't always know where to start.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "numb all the uncomfortable stuff" – what's the thing that makes you feel like you're avoiding? Is it the job itself, the change, or something else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's a bit of everything. The job's just... intense, new systems, long hours, and I keep worrying I won't measure up, which makes me tense and irritable. So I dive into hobbies to escape that worry because sitting with it feels too hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform in your new role. Can you think of one area where you'd like to feel more confident or capable, even if it's just for a small part of your day?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd like to feel more confident with the new accounting software and just keeping up with deadlines. If mornings didn't feel so panicky and I could get through a day without worrying I messed up, that would help. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge what's causing you distress. Can you thank your mind for bringing up those feelings and worries about mornings? What if, instead of trying to avoid them, you started by taking a few deep breaths and noticing what's happening in your body right now, just for the next 5-10 minutes?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try a couple of deep breaths, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and it all feels awkward. Can we slow down and start with just a minute instead of 5–10?

Therapist: One minute can be a great starting point. Let's begin with just one minute of deep breathing together, right now. As we take a breath in and out, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sounds around you. When your mind wanders, gently acknowledge it without judgment, and bring your focus back to the breath. We'll take it from there.

Patient: I did it — I don't know, it felt weird and a little exposing. After a few breaths my chest stayed tight and my mind sprinted to deadlines and that new software, so it didn't really calm me much. I guess feeling my feet helped a tiny bit, but this is awkward — can we maybe try something more concrete, like one small morning routine I could actually do?

Therapist: That's completely okay that the mindfulness exercise wasn't as calming as you hoped. One small concrete step is to start your mornings by doing one thing that brings you joy, like making a cup of coffee or reading a chapter in a book. What's one tiny thing you could do this morning that would make you feel a little more awake and engaged, without feeling overwhelmed by the new job or software?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could make a proper cup of coffee and sit on the porch for five minutes with the paper, or play one upbeat song while I get dressed. It feels awkward to plan it, but maybe that tiny ritual would keep my brain from sprinting straight to deadlines.

Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Committing to a tiny ritual like that can make a big difference. Let's make a deal – what's the one thing you can do to make your morning coffee ritual happen, no matter what? Is it prepping the coffee the night before, or finding a specific playlist to play while you get dressed?

Patient: I guess I could prep the coffee the night before so it's ready — that's probably the easiest. Or make a little playlist to autoplay while I get dressed; I don't know which I'll actually keep up with, maybe start with the coffee and see how it goes. It's awkward to promise, but I'll try to do that tomorrow morning.

Therapist: That's a great start! Committing to prepping the coffee and making a playlist are both achievable and enjoyable. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to your commitment – instead of promising to do it "tomorrow morning," let's aim to make it a habitual part of your daily routine for the next 7 days. Can you agree to do that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try to do it for 7 days. I'll prep the coffee tonight so it's ready and set a playlist to autoplay while I get dressed; that feels doable. I'm nervous I'll slip back into old habits though, and it still feels awkward to talk about promising this.

Therapist: Let's acknowledge that it's natural to worry about slipping back into old habits. But by taking small, concrete steps like prepping the coffee and setting a playlist, you're showing up to your new morning routine with intention. Instead of focusing on "not falling back into old habits," let's focus on building momentum. Can you tell me what you hope to achieve or feel in the next 7 days if you stick to this new morning routine?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I can keep it up for a week I'd like mornings to feel less frantic and for that tightness in my chest to ease a bit. Maybe I'll feel a little more in control and less like I have to bury myself in hobbies to avoid the worry. It's awkward to admit, but I also hope it gives me a tiny boost of confidence so the new software and deadlines don't loom as large.

Therapist: That's a wonderful insight. It sounds like you're not just looking for a quick fix, but rather a sense of control and confidence that will allow you to tackle the challenges of your new job and software. What's one value that you think would be important to hold onto, even on days when things feel overwhelming, and how can you tie that value to your morning routine?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the value is taking care of myself, or being steady and reliable for my own sake. I can tie it to the morning ritual by treating the prepped coffee and playlist as a non-negotiable five-minute check-in — a small, consistent act of self-care that reminds me I'm worth showing up for. It's awkward to say, but that feels right, I guess.

Therapist: That's a powerful connection to make. By framing the morning ritual as a non-negotiable act of self-care, you're reminding yourself that your worth and reliability are worth showing up for, even on the toughest days. Can you imagine how that would feel to approach the day with a sense of "I'm showing up for myself, and that's enough"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it'd feel a bit lighter, like a tiny win that loosens the tightness in my chest. But part of me also thinks it's silly, like it won't be enough and I should be fixing the bigger problems instead. I'm worried I'll still reach for hobbies the minute stress spikes — what do I do in the moment when that urge hits? I don't know, sometimes I just try to change the subject or busy myself and it doesn't help.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way, but it's also great that you're recognizing that the small wins can add up. One strategy to try in the moment when you feel the urge to reach for hobbies is to pause and ask yourself, "What would it mean to take care of myself right now, even if it's just for a few seconds?" This can help you connect with the value of self-care and find a sense of ease. Let's practice that together: What would it mean to take care of yourself right now, in this moment, when stress spikes?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would mean something tiny and simple: put the hobby down, make a cup of tea or water, and just sit for thirty seconds and notice my feet on the floor. It feels like a lot right now and my thoughts are fuzzy, so maybe just letting myself pause for a minute would help. I don't know… can we stay with that a bit?

Therapist: That's a great starting point. Let's take it one step further. Can you imagine what your body would feel like if you sat with your feet on the floor for a full minute, without any agenda or expectation? What sensations would you notice in your body, and how might that feel?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest would stay tight and my shoulders would feel heavy, like there's something pressing down, and my breath would be shallow. My feet might feel oddly solid against the floor and maybe my breathing would slow a little, but I'm kind of drained and it's awkward to trust that it helps.

Therapist: Those are some powerful physical sensations. Can you notice that your body is trying to hold onto tension, but your feet are actually anchoring you in the present moment? What if, instead of trying to change or avoid these sensations, you simply acknowledge them as they are, without judgment? What might happen if you allowed yourself to be with these feelings, rather than trying to push through or escape them?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually let myself sit with it the sharp edge might dull a bit, or maybe I'd just feel stuck. It's a lot to even try right now, so could we go over one concrete thing I can do when the urge to escape hits?

Therapist: Let's take it one tiny step further. Instead of trying to sit with your bodily sensations, what if you simply acknowledged the thought "I'm feeling stuck" when the urge to escape hits? Can you imagine what that thought might look like, and what it might feel like to say it out loud to yourself, without judgment or action?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the thought would be just that, "I'm feeling stuck," said plain and small. Saying it out loud would feel weird, my voice probably low and my chest tight, like I'm admitting something I don't want to. Maybe if I said it without trying to do anything else the urge to escape would ease a little, but I'm kind of worn out and it's awkward to keep at this.

Therapist: It sounds like saying the thought "I'm feeling stuck" out loud might be a small act of courage. Can you imagine what it would be like to say it to yourself, without trying to do anything else, and simply allowing the thought to exist in the present moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually said "I'm feeling stuck" it'd come out quiet, like I'm swallowing it. My chest would feel heavy and my voice low, and maybe naming it would take the edge off for a moment. It's awkward and I'm kind of worn out — could we also go over one small, concrete thing I can do when the urge to escape hits?

Therapist: Let's summarize: you've identified a small, concrete action for acknowledging your bodily sensations (sitting with your feet on the floor), a thought (saying "I'm feeling stuck" out loud), and now a small, concrete action for managing anxiety (acknowledging the thought without trying to escape). One final thing you can do when the urge to escape hits is simply to notice where you are in your body, noticing the sensations in your feet, the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you imagine doing that for just one second, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can imagine doing that for a second. My feet would feel sort of solid and my breath might slow a tiny bit, even if my chest stays tight. It feels a bit silly to focus on just one second and I'm kind of drained, so can we stick with that and the "I'm feeling stuck" line for now instead of adding more?

Therapist: That's a great place to land. Let's commit to practicing noticing where you are in your body for just one second, and also using the thought "I'm feeling stuck" when the urge to escape hits. For now, that's a small but meaningful step.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try that: notice my feet for one second and say "I'm feeling stuck" when the urge hits. It feels... thin, but maybe doable when I'm drained. I'm worried I'll forget in the moment though; could we pick a tiny, simple cue I could use to remind myself?

Therapist: Let's create a tiny reminder that you can use to cue yourself to notice your feet and say "I'm feeling stuck". How about we choose something small, like touching the hem of your sleeve or a specific spot on your wrist? Can you think of a small, private spot that's easy to notice when you need to remember?

Patient: I don't know — I guess touching the hem of my sleeve could work. I fidget with it already and it's private, so maybe that'll remind me to notice my feet and say "I'm feeling stuck." I'm kind of worn out, so I can't promise it'll stick, but I'll try.

Therapist: That's a great start. Remember, it's not about making a promise to yourself, but about taking small, incremental steps towards change. If you don't remember to touch your sleeve, that's okay. Just acknowledge the thought and try again when you need to. Let's leave it here for now, and we can check in with you soon to see how things are going.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try, but I'm kind of drained and this feels like a lot. Can we stay a bit longer and talk about one concrete thing I can do tonight if I start reaching for hobbies?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on just one tiny thing you can do tonight to support your progress. Can you think of one small thing you can do in the next 5-10 minutes, even if it's just sitting quietly and noticing your feet, that would make you feel like you're moving in the right direction?

Patient: I don't know — I guess in the next 5–10 minutes I could sit quietly and notice my feet for a minute, touch the hem of my sleeve as the cue, and then make a cup of tea instead of reaching for a hobby. It feels kind of thin and I'm pretty drained, but maybe that'll stop the urge long enough; can we stick with that for now?

Therapist: That's a great plan. Let's make a small pact: in the next 5-10 minutes, you'll sit quietly, notice your feet, touch the hem of your sleeve, and then make a cup of tea instead of reaching for a hobby. Remember, it's not about grand gestures, but about tiny moments of consistency. We'll check in with each other in 5-10 minutes to see how it went.

Patient: I did it — I guess I sat for a minute, noticed my feet, touched my sleeve, and made a cup of tea instead of diving into a hobby. It felt thin — my chest was a little less tight but my thoughts stayed fuzzy and I kept wanting to get up. I don't know — can we talk about what to do if that doesn't help or if the urge hits harder tonight?

Therapist: That's a great start. It's not uncommon for progress to feel thin or fragile, especially when we're starting out. If the urge to escape hits harder tonight, can you remember to touch your sleeve and say "I'm feeling stuck" before acting on the urge? If that doesn't work, we can try something else. What if, instead of trying to stop the urge entirely, you try to say "I'm feeling stuck" and then take a small, gentle step back? For example, you could pause for a second, take a few deep breaths, or notice your feet again?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'll try saying "I'm feeling stuck," pause, take a few slow breaths, and notice my feet. If that doesn't help, maybe I'll stand up and make tea or step outside for a minute, but I'm kind of worn out and not sure that'll work — can we pick one fallback to try tonight so I don't have to decide in the moment?

Therapist: Let's choose a fallback plan that feels more concrete. Instead of trying to pause or take slow breaths, what if you simply take one small step towards taking care of yourself? For tonight, let's aim to make a cup of tea, even if it's just a small cup. This can be a gentle, non-judgmental way to take care of yourself and give yourself a break from the urge to escape.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try making that small cup of tea tonight instead of jumping into a hobby. It feels thin and I'm pretty worn out, so I'm worried I'll still fidget or go back to the hobby after the tea. If that happens, can we pick one very small next step I can do so I don't have to decide in the moment?

Therapist: That's a great plan. One very small next step you can take if you find yourself fidgeting or wanting to go back to the hobby after making the tea is simply to sit back down and take another sip of your tea. That's it – just sitting back down and taking another sip. No need to try to do anything more, just focus on the sensation of the tea in your cup and the present moment.

Patient: I can try to sit back down and take another sip. I don't know — my hands will probably still fidget and it might not be enough, but maybe noticing the warmth of the cup could anchor me a bit. I'm kind of worn out and it's awkward, so can we pick one tiny step I can do if the second sip doesn't stop me?

Therapist: Let's choose a tiny step that builds on the idea of noticing the warmth of the cup. If your hands start fidgeting again, can you try to notice the sensation of the warmth spreading through your hands as you hold the cup? It's a small, concrete thing to focus on, and might help you stay grounded in the present moment.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'll try noticing the warmth and take another sip. I'm pretty drained and my hands will probably still fidget, so if that doesn't help maybe I'll step outside for thirty seconds or just stand and take three slow breaths. Can we keep those as my fallbacks tonight?
