Patient: I'm a software developer with generalized anxiety and a recent rough breakup, and my mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I get stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism — one bug or missed call becomes proof I'll get fired, lose everything, and end up alone, and I can't seem to picture any other outcome. Coming from a high-achieving family makes the pressure worse; failure feels like it will definitely spiral into ruin.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be intense anxiety and self-doubt. One specific theme that stands out is the entrapment in a catastrophic thinking pattern, where a single perceived failure or setback is amplified to predict an entire downward spiral. Your goal for the Answer is to help you explore the tangible aspects of this catastrophic thinking, with the aim of introducing a new perspective that can eventually lead to a more valued, action-oriented way of thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens right after you notice a "bug" or a missed call? What specifically triggers this catastrophic thinking, and what's the first thought that pops up in your mind?

Patient: The second I notice a bug or a missed call my chest tightens and the thought that pops up is, "This proves I'm useless" — and immediately I see the whole chain: I get fired, I can't find another job, my savings vanish, my ex moves on and everyone finds out I'm a failure. It feels like a movie that plays on loop and I can't imagine any other ending, so I just spiral into shame and start ruminating about every little mistake. Even if someone suggests a calmer possibility, I can't believe it; the disaster story feels way more real.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I see that you're caught in a vicious cycle of catastrophic thinking, where a single event becomes the foundation for an elaborate, unchangeable narrative. The theme of "unworkability" is prominent, as your current thinking strategy is causing more harm than good. Your goal for the Answer is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy and introduce an alternative perspective that might help you break free from this cycle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the "This proves I'm useless" thought is like a self-fulfilling prophecy, where you're already assuming the worst-case scenario. What if we explored the possibility that this "uselessness" thought is more like a temporary narrative, rather than an absolute truth? Can you imagine if we tried to add some space between this thought and your current identity, like creating a small buffer zone?

Patient: I'm trying, but I can't really picture that buffer — it just feels like pretending to calm myself. The minute I notice a bug or a missed call my brain launches the whole disaster movie: boss finds out -> I'm fired -> I can't get another job -> savings drain -> I'm on the street and my ex and my family think I'm a fraud. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems like you're struggling to envision an alternative to your current thinking pattern, and that's leading to feelings of overwhelm. One specific area that stands out is the rigidness in your thinking, where the entire narrative is locked in place, making it hard to imagine a different outcome. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a small, low-stakes experiment to create some space between your thoughts and feelings, aiming to foster a sense of defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Before we proceed, I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to slow down when your mind is racing. Can I gently suggest we start with a small, 10-second pause whenever you notice that "disaster movie" playing in your head? Just pause, take a deep breath, and say to yourself, "I'm observing this thought, and it's not true."

Patient: Okay, I'll try that — taking a breath now — but even in the pause my brain's already running the movie: boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone. It feels like a trick that doesn't stick and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It appears that even a brief pause isn't enough to break the hold of your catastrophic thinking. The theme of defusion is still a bit of a stretch, and it's clear that your brain is wired to default to this narrative. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more experiential approach to create some space between your thoughts and feelings, aiming to foster a sense of acceptance and connection to your values.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. I want you to bring your attention to your breath, and as you breathe in, say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm safe, I'm present." As you breathe out, say "I'm not my thoughts." Repeat that a few times, focusing on the sensation of the breath and the words, without trying to change your thoughts. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I tried breathing and saying the phrases, but it just feels like a trick — my chest loosens a little for a second and then the movie's back: boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job, savings gone, everyone sees I'm a fraud. Saying "I'm not my thoughts" feels false, like putting a band-aid over a sink that's still flooding, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems like the breathing exercise, while helpful for a brief moment, wasn't enough to create lasting change. The theme of defusion is still elusive, and your brain is still getting pulled back into the narrative. The sense of overwhelm is growing, and you're feeling frustrated with the experience. Your goal for the Answer is to pivot to a more experiential approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being.

Therapist Answer:
I'm noticing that you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated with the exercise. Can we take a step back and focus on the sensation of your body? Where do you feel the overwhelm in your body right now? Is it in your chest, your stomach, or somewhere else? Let's bring some kindness and curiosity to that area, and see if we can create a tiny bit of space for kindness and compassion to emerge.

Patient: It's mostly in my chest — a tight, heavy pressure — with this hollow sinking in my stomach and my shoulders knotting up. When I try to be kind to it, it feels fake, like a band-aid, and the disaster movie's already rewinding — boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't find another job, I'm broke and everyone thinks I'm a fraud. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try a different way to do this?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations of overwhelm are becoming increasingly intense, and your brain is still stuck in the catastrophic thinking pattern. The theme of defusion remains elusive, and your sense of hopelessness is growing. Your goal for the Answer is to create a sense of curiosity and willingness to explore the experience of being overwhelmed, with the aim of introducing a more valued way of being.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like you're making progress. Can I ask, what would you do if you could create a safe, small space for yourself right now, just for a few minutes, where you're not worried about the "disaster movie" or the future? Where would you go, and what would you do in that space?

Patient: If I could make a safe space, I'd go to the small park by my apartment, sit on the bench with my sketchbook and headphones, and just watch clouds while doodling—something quiet and low-stakes. But my brain immediately ruins it: someone will see me, my boss will call about the bug, I'll get called into a meeting, then fired, then the whole spiral happens, so even that calm scene feels pointless. I'm getting really overwhelmed saying that out loud—can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems like your brain is rapidly deconstructing the idea of a safe space, and you're getting pulled back into the catastrophic thinking pattern. The theme of unworkability is still a major obstacle, and your sense of hopelessness is becoming more entrenched. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more experiential approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being, without getting caught up in the "disaster movie."

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and acknowledge the story you're telling yourself. You said you'd go to the park and watch clouds, but your brain immediately jumped to all the worst-case scenarios. Can I ask, what if, for just a moment, you let go of the idea that this safe space needs to be perfect? What if it's okay if you don't feel completely calm or in control while you're there? What if you just allow yourself to be in the moment, without trying to create some sort of mental escape?

Patient: I want that park to work, but the minute I picture it my brain overwrites it with the movie: someone sees me, my boss calls about the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings vanish, and everyone thinks I'm a fraud. Imagining just being there without trying to escape feels dishonest — like pretending the spiral won't happen — and I can't make that feel realistic. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that your brain is struggling to accept the idea of a safe space, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is still too dominant. The theme of defusion remains elusive, and your sense of overwhelm is becoming increasingly intense. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more experiential approach that acknowledges the struggle and creates space for a more valued way of being, while also acknowledging the reality of your emotional pain.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to imagine a safe space that feels realistic, given the overwhelming nature of your worries. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to control the outcome of the "disaster movie," we focused on the experience of sitting on that bench, doodling, and watching the clouds? What if we just allowed yourself to be with the physical sensations, the sensation of the breeze, the sound of the wind, and the sensation of the ground beneath your feet, without trying to fit it into a specific narrative or outcome?

Patient: I tried that — I can feel the breeze and the bench under me for a second, my shoulders loosen a tiny bit — but two breaths later the movie's back: boss calls about the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, everyone sees I'm a fraud. It makes "being present" feel like pretending, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that your brain is still very much entrenched in the catastrophic thinking pattern, and your efforts to be present have been met with a swift return to the "disaster movie". The theme of unworkability remains a major challenge, and your sense of overwhelm is becoming increasingly intense. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more experiential approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being, while also acknowledging the difficulty of breaking free from the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and look at what's happening when you try to imagine being present. What is it about being present that feels like "pretending" to you? Is it the idea that you're not really letting go of the worries, or is it something else entirely?

Patient: It's both, but mostly it feels like denial — like I'm lying to myself that nothing bad will happen. The second I try to "be present" the movie starts up again — boss finds the bug, I'm fired, can't get another job — so staying present feels dangerous, like I'm ignoring the one thing that will ruin me. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
It seems like you're struggling to understand the nature of your experience with being present, and it's clear that denial is a major factor. The theme of unworkability is still a significant challenge, and your sense of overwhelm is becoming increasingly intense. Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more experiential approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being, while also addressing the underlying dynamics of denial.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like being present is somehow "ignoring" the potential risks. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to be present in a way that feels safe or risk-free, we explored the idea of being present in a way that's more honest with yourself? What if, rather than trying to avoid the thoughts, we tried to acknowledge them, but not engage with them, not react to them?

Patient: I get the point, but that doesn't work for me — acknowledging the thought just feels like handing it more fuel. The second "I'm useless" pops up I see the whole chain play out: boss finds the bug -> meeting -> fired -> can't get another job -> savings gone -> everyone thinks I'm a fraud. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and try something else?

It seems like acknowledging the thought is indeed fueling the catastrophic thinking pattern. The theme of unworkability remains a significant challenge, and your sense of overwhelm is becoming increasingly intense. Your goal for the Answer is to pivot to a different approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being, while also avoiding the reinforcement of the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Can I ask, what would happen if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or avoid them, we simply looked at the chain of thoughts that's playing out in your mind, without judgment or engagement? What if we just observed the sequence of thoughts, like a movie playing in the background, without trying to alter it, or try to change it?

Patient: I try to watch it like a movie, but the second I look the camera zooms in and I'm living it — boss finds the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired on the spot, can't get another job, savings evaporate, I'm evicted, my ex and family see I'm a fraud and everyone laughs. Observing feels like rehearsing the ending instead of stepping back, and I start shaking and can't focus. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

It seems like observing the thoughts is still not working, and you're getting pulled back into the narrative. The theme of unworkability remains a major challenge, and your sense of overwhelm is becoming increasingly intense. Your goal for the Answer is to create a sense of space and distance between you and the catastrophic thinking pattern, while also acknowledging the physical and emotional sensations that are emerging.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to feel like you're just watching a movie, and not actually experiencing the worst-case scenario. Can I ask, what would happen if we brought the sensation of shaking and overwhelm into our awareness, rather than trying to push it away or engage with it? What if we just allowed ourselves to feel the physical sensations, and see if we can find a sense of connection to our body, rather than getting lost in the thoughts?

Patient: When I try to bring the shaking and overwhelm into awareness it just feels like proof the movie is already happening — my hands tremble, my chest tightens, my vision narrows — and as I focus the whole chain zooms in: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud. I get more scattered and start hyperventilating, like focusing on the body just makes the disaster feel inevitable. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

Your goal for the Answer is to introduce a more gentle and compassionate approach that acknowledges the overwhelm and creates space for a more valued way of being.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and focus on the physical sensations of overwhelm, but this time, can we try to approach them with kindness and curiosity? Instead of trying to stop or change the thoughts, can we simply observe the physical sensations in the present moment, without judgment or trying to engage with them? Can you bring your attention to your breath, and as you inhale, say to yourself, "I'm feeling this sensation in my body, and it's okay to feel it"?

Patient: I tried the breath and saying, "I'm feeling this sensation in my body, and it's okay to feel it," but as soon as I name it my heart starts racing and the movie turns up louder: boss calls about the bug, meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud.

Your goal for the Answer is to create a sense of calm and stability, while also acknowledging the limitations of the current approach.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a break from trying to change or manage your thoughts and feelings. Can I ask, what would happen if we simply sat in silence, without trying to do anything, and just focused on the sensation of your body being in the present moment? No thoughts, no feelings, no trying to change anything. Just the sensation of being here, in this moment, without judgment or expectation. Can you try that for just a few breaths?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is sitting in silence supposed to help? The second I try, my brain goes full movie: boss finds the bug, I'm hauled into a meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone, evicted, everyone sees I'm a fraud.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Can I ask, what's the physical sensation in your body right now, as we're talking? Where do you feel the tension or the trembling most? Can you bring your attention to that area, and simply observe it without trying to change it or engage with it?

Patient: My chest is this tight, heavy pressure and my hands are trembling—my stomach feels hollow and my shoulders are all knotted up. I try to focus on the chest, like you said, but as soon as I notice it my brain turns it into proof the movie's happening: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't get another job, savings gone. I'm not sure I follow how just observing that helps—it just makes me more panicked and scattered. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now—can we slow down?

Let's try something completely different. Can I ask, what would happen if I were to speak to you in a very gentle, calm, and kind tone, without trying to offer any advice or solutions? Would that help you feel more calm, or would it just make things worse?

Patient: A calm, gentle tone might let me breathe easier for a few seconds—my shoulders might unclench—but almost immediately it feels like being pacified, and the movie ratchets up louder: boss calls, meeting, fired, can't find another job, savings gone.

Patient: It feels like a switch that's jammed on — my chest goes tight, my hands start trembling, my vision narrows, and time stretches so every second is full of that movie playing faster and louder. Emotionally it's shame and dread all rolled together, like I'm collapsing inward and can't breathe, and cognitively it feels immutable — the thought isn't just a thought, it's a timeline: boss finds the bug -> meeting -> fired -> can't get another job -> savings gone -> evicted -> everyone sees I'm a fraud.

Let's pause for a moment and acknowledge that you're feeling completely overwhelmed. Can I ask, what would happen if we were to consider the possibility that this feeling of being stuck is not about the thoughts or the emotions, but about your physical body being in a state of high alert? Can you imagine if your body could relax, just a tiny bit, just enough to feel a little more grounded?

Patient: Maybe my body could relax a tiny bit, but I can't actually imagine letting my guard down — the moment I do my brain says I'll miss a call, my boss will find the bug, they'll call me into a meeting and I'm fired.

Sometimes, when we focus on our physical sensations, it can help us feel more connected to our body and more grounded. Can you try to bring your attention to one of these sensations, just for a brief moment?
