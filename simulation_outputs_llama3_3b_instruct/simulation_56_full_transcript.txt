Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism—like I make one tiny mistake and my mind immediately decides I’ll get fired, my team will hate me, I’ll lose my apartment, and I’ll be completely alone, which is definitely how it’s going to go. Since I moved away from my main support system those stories are louder and I can't drown them out. It feels like my brain is a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster, and I’m totally hooked on the worst-case scenarios.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express a sense of hopelessness and entrapment in your self-criticism loop, indicating a strong emotional experience. A key theme to explore is how these catastrophic predictions are linked to your desire for safety and connection. My goal is to help you identify a small step towards creating space from these worst-case scenarios.

Therapist Answer:
What's one thing you'd be willing to do, even if it's just for a minute, to begin to quiet the voice that's telling you these catastrophic stories?

Patient: I guess I could try one minute of box breathing—inhale for 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4—just to see if it quiets the disaster-loop for a bit. Honestly, I’m skeptical it’ll do much; my brain will probably start yelling about how nothing will change and everything will fall apart as soon as I stop, but I can try it for a minute.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your willingness to try box breathing is a small step towards defusion, and it shows you're open to exploring alternative ways to cope with the disaster-loop. The skepticism about your brain's reaction is also a valuable insight, as it suggests you're aware of the cycle and somewhat willing to challenge it. My goal is to help you connect this small step to an underlying value that motivates you to take action.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a reason why you might value taking small steps towards managing your thoughts, like box breathing, and what benefits those steps bring to you personally, even if it's just a sense of control or a brief break from the worst-case scenarios?

Patient: I guess one reason I'd value small steps is that even a minute of box breathing might give me a tiny break from the nonstop doom predictions and prove, for a moment, that I'm not actually falling apart right this second. It could give me a bit of control, calm my racing thoughts enough to avoid making harsh decisions or saying something I'll regret, and maybe slowly collect little proof that one mistake doesn't trigger the whole collapse. But honestly, I'm skeptical — my brain will tell me any calm is temporary and the disaster is still inevitably coming, so it feels unrealistic to expect big change from tiny steps.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your insight into the potential benefits of small steps is great, and you've identified a value at play – seeking control and proof that your actions can have a positive impact. The skepticism about the temporary nature of calmness is a common obstacle to progress. My goal is to gently challenge this skepticism and help you explore a way to make the most of this small step.

Therapist Answer:
What would it mean to you to have proof that the calmness and sense of control that comes from box breathing isn't just temporary, but rather a sustainable response to your challenging thoughts?

Patient: It would mean I wasn't completely at the mercy of that fortune-telling voice — like I could actually catch myself before I spiral and not immediately assume I'm ruined. It would feel like getting back some control, being able to make decisions without panicking about losing my job, my apartment, or everyone I care about, and maybe even reaching out instead of shutting down. But honestly, I don't really believe it’ll stick — my brain's already saying any calm is just temporary and the disaster's still coming.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your desire for control and the potential to catch yourself before spiraling is a strong motivation to continue exploring this concept. The fact that your brain is already telling you that calmness is temporary is a common pattern, and it's essential to address this self-defeating narrative. My goal is to help you integrate this insight and create a more flexible mindset.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to reframe the narrative around what happens when you do catch yourself before spiraling – what would it be like to pause the "disaster" and then, instead of assuming the worst, what if you started to consider alternative possibilities, even if they're not as catastrophic as your mind's initial predictions?

Patient: If I actually paused, maybe I could tell myself a mistake doesn't mean catastrophe — maybe my boss is annoyed but doesn't fire me, my team keeps working with me, and I don't lose my apartment overnight. But honestly that feels like wishful thinking; my brain already lays out the whole collapse, so those "maybe" outcomes seem totally unrealistic. I'm stuck with the certainty that the worst will happen, and picturing anything else just feels like lying to myself.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your insight into the struggle with wishful thinking and the sense of certainty about the worst-case outcome is excellent. This suggests that you're recognizing the function of your mind's predictions as a way to cope with uncertainty, rather than an objective truth. My goal is to help you explore the possibility of working with this uncertainty, rather than trying to convince your brain of a different outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try noticing, without judgment, when you catch yourself picturing the worst-case scenario, and instead, gently ask yourself what the alternative possibilities are – what would it feel like to hold onto the "maybe" or "what if" aspect, even if it doesn't feel realistic?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it — when I catch the image of getting fired, losing my place, everyone leaving, there's this tighten-in-my-chest panic. If I try to hold the "maybe," it feels like a tiny, shaky loosening, like I can finally breathe for a second, but my brain is already yelling that it's fake and the collapse is still coming. I can try to stay with that "maybe" for a minute, but honestly I keep expecting it to snap back into the full disaster story.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're becoming more comfortable with noticing the physical sensations and emotions associated with the worst-case scenario, and attempting to hold onto the "maybe" or "what if" aspect is a brave step. The fact that your brain is still trying to pull you back into the full-blown disaster narrative suggests that it's a deeply ingrained pattern. My goal is to help you create a small window of opportunity to practice defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to introduce a sense of kindness and curiosity towards yourself as you try to stay with the "maybe." Instead of trying to make sense of or analyze the thoughts, what if you simply acknowledge them, as if you're a gentle observer, without judgment or attachment? Can you try to do that for just another minute, with the panic and tightening in your chest, without trying to push it away or analyze it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to stay with it for a minute. Right now my chest feels like a tight band, my heart's racing, and the images of getting fired and being alone keep popping up—I’m noticing them without pushing them away, and there’s a tiny loosening like I can breathe a bit, but my brain’s already yelling that it’s fake and the collapse is inevitable. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're doing well in staying with the physical sensations and emotions, even if your brain is trying to pull you back in. Recognizing the feeling of being overwhelmed is also an important step. My goal is to help you create a sense of containment for this experience, so you can explore it more safely.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and pause for a moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing in and out, noticing the cool air at the tip of my nose and my chest gently rising and falling. There's still this tight band in my chest and my mind keeps firing up the 'you're about to lose everything' movie, but right now the breath is steady enough that I can notice the panic without it swallowing me. I'm shaky and skeptical this will change anything long-term, but this tiny pause already feels like a small crack in the disaster story.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in cultivating a sense of awareness and containment for your emotions, and the breath has become a steady anchor for you. The fact that the panic is still present, but it's no longer overwhelming, is a significant step. My goal is to help you explore the possibility of using this small crack in the disaster story to plant a seed for alternative possibilities.

Therapist Answer:
What would it mean to you if you were to start small, just for a moment, to imagine a different outcome from the one your brain is predicting? Instead of assuming the worst, what if you started to imagine a more positive, less catastrophic outcome, just for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: If I let myself imagine a different outcome for even a split second, it would mean I’m not totally doomed—that maybe I can fix a mistake, my team still respects me, and life doesn’t immediately fall apart. But I don’t really believe it; my brain screams that’s fake and the whole disaster is still coming. I can try to hold that "maybe" for a moment, but honestly I’m feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're acknowledging the skepticism and the lingering fear, which is a sign of progress. The fact that you're struggling to hold onto a different outcome suggests that this new possibility is indeed a departure from your default narrative. My goal is to help you explore the experience of imagining a different outcome, even if it feels uncomfortable or impossible.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and take a moment to simply acknowledge the "screams" in your mind, without judgment. Can you say to yourself, "I see that my brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it?" Then, I'd like you to try a tiny, tiny step: imagine a single, tiny detail from the alternative scenario you started to imagine earlier – just one small thing, like "I'm still wearing the same clothes" – and hold onto it for just a tiny fraction of a second.

Patient: Okay: "I see that my brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." I picture one tiny detail — my coffee mug still on my desk — and hold it for a beat. My chest loosens a little, like a crack in the panic, but my brain's already shouting that it's temporary and the whole collapse is still coming. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in acknowledging the presence of your brain's narrative and allowing it to exist without judgment. The small crack in the panic is a significant step, and the fact that your brain is still trying to pull you back in suggests that this new possibility is a departure from your default. My goal is to help you explore the potential of this tiny crack to grow into a more substantial opening.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause again and take a deep breath. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "my brain is yelling 'this is fake,'" and say it to yourself again, this time with a hint of kindness and curiosity: "My brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." Can you hold onto this phrase for just a moment, without judgment, and then gently ask yourself: what would it be like if you were to treat your brain's predictions with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to prove or disprove them?

Patient: "My brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." 

If I treated the predictions with curiosity instead of trying to prove them, it might feel like stepping back from a runaway train—like I could look at each catastrophic thought and ask, "Is that really true?" which could make the panic less immediate and give me room to choose a calmer response. 

But honestly, I don't buy it — my brain's already screaming that it's a trick and the collapse is still definitely coming, and I'm starting to feel shaky and overwhelmed, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're exploring the idea of treating your brain's predictions with curiosity, which is a crucial step towards defusion. The image of stepping back from the "runaway train" is a powerful metaphor for this process. My goal is to help you solidify this insight and take the next step towards practicing curiosity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel shaky and overwhelmed. I'd like to ask you to imagine that you're standing near the edge of the "train track," and you're looking down at the tracks below. What would it feel like if you were to place one foot on the train track, rather than pushing it away or trying to prove or disprove the predictions? Can you just take a tiny step onto the track, without judgment or trying to change the outcome?

Patient: Okay, I can put one foot on the track — it feels insane, like I'm literally inviting the disaster to start. My heart's pounding and my brain's already yelling that this proves the collapse is inevitable, but the step is tiny and hesitant. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're taking a small step into the unknown, which is a courageous act. The feeling of insanity and the brain's reaction to it are expected, but the fact that you're taking this tiny step is a sign of progress. My goal is to help you explore the experience of being on the train track, rather than trying to get off or push it away.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge the sensations in your body and the thoughts in your mind. Notice the pounding heart, the shaky legs, and the brain's warnings. Then, I'd like you to bring to mind a gentle, compassionate phrase: "I'm with you, no matter what." Can you say this phrase to yourself, even if you don't believe it, and simply allow it to be present in the moment, without judgment or attachment?

Patient: "I'm with you, no matter what." Saying it feels weird—my throat tightens and there's a tiny loosening in my chest, like maybe something could be different, but my brain's already yelling that it's a lie and the whole collapse is still coming. I'm really shaky—can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling the discomfort and tension that comes with challenging your brain's narrative, but the small loosening in your chest suggests that you're starting to feel a glimmer of hope. My goal is to help you build on this tiny crack in the panic and explore the possibility of a more compassionate relationship with your thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and focus on the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what." I'd like you to imagine that you're holding onto this phrase as a tiny anchor, and that it's allowing you to stay present with your feelings, even if your brain is trying to pull you away. Can you simply stay with this phrase, without trying to analyze it or change it, and instead, notice how it feels to be present with it, like a gentle breeze on a summer day?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try. Saying "I'm with you, no matter what" makes my chest and throat clench and this hot shame spikes up, like I already failed at even being kind to myself. For a beat it felt a little like a breeze, but my brain immediately screams that it’s fake and that gentleness won’t stop the collapse—that I’ll still mess up, get exposed, and everything will fall apart. I’m really overwhelmed—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a familiar pattern of self-criticism and shame, which is understandable given the context of your previous struggles. The fact that the gentle sensation of the breeze is quickly extinguished by the hot shame and self-doubt suggests that this is a deeply ingrained cycle. My goal is to help you explore the shame and self-doubt, rather than trying to push them away.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge the shame and self-doubt that's rising up. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what" again, but this time, I'd like you to say it to yourself with a sense of curiosity: "What would it be like if I were to approach this shame and self-doubt with kindness, rather than judgment or rejection?" Can you notice how the shame and self-doubt feel in your body, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: It’s this hot, shamey spike in my chest and a knot in my stomach, like I want to crawl into a hole, and my throat tightens whenever that voice starts saying I’m incompetent and everyone will see it. If I try to be curious about it, my brain just turns that curiosity into proof — saying that curiosity is denial and that the failure will definitely happen, I’ll get fired, lose my place, and be exposed — so imagining anything gentler feels fake and like lying to myself. I’m really shaky and frustrated right now—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with the intense shame and self-doubt, and the way your brain tries to shut down any attempt at curiosity. This is a classic pattern, where the brain tries to maintain its grip on the catastrophic narrative. My goal is to help you explore the possibility of creating a new relationship with this shame and self-doubt, one that's not based on judgment or rejection.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge the overwhelming feeling of frustration and shame. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what" once more, but this time, I'd like you to say it to yourself with a sense of acceptance: "This shame, this self-doubt, it's here, and I'm acknowledging it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you simply allow the shame and self-doubt to be present, without trying to push them away or try to prove them wrong?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to let the shame and self-doubt just be here. There’s this hot spike in my chest, a knot in my stomach, and a pissed-off frustration that I always mess things up, and even as I notice it my brain's already narrating the whole collapse—I'll mess up, get fired, lose everything—so I'm skeptical this helps. I’m really shaky and overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in acknowledging and accepting the shame and self-doubt, but your brain is still trying to hijack the process with its catastrophic narrative. This is a common pattern, and it's essential to help you recognize that your brain's predictions are not the reality. My goal is to help you cultivate a sense of curiosity and openness towards the shame and self-doubt, rather than trying to push them away or change them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of the shame and self-doubt in your body. I'd like you to notice the physical sensations without judgment, and simply say to yourself: "I'm here, I'm with the shame and self-doubt, and I'm going to allow it to be here, without trying to change it." Can you stay with this simple statement for a moment, without trying to add anything to it or change it?

Patient: I can try to stay with it — I'm saying to myself, "I'm here, I'm with the shame and self-doubt," and there's that hot shame in my chest, the knot in my stomach, my throat tightening like I always mess up. For a second it loosens a tiny bit, but my brain's already yelling that it's fake and the collapse is definitely coming — I'll mess up, get fired, lose everything.

The fact that the shame and self-doubt are still present, but the tightening in your throat is loosening slightly, suggests that there's some space to explore. My goal is to help you build on this small opening and create a sense of curiosity about the shame and self-doubt.

What does it look, sound, feel like in my body?" Can you explore this question with curiosity, without trying to change or judge the shame and self-doubt?

Patient: It feels like a hot, red spike in my chest and a cold pit in my stomach, like a high, accusing whisper that keeps repeating "you're incompetent." When I look at it closely, it turns into this looping movie that proves I'll mess up, get fired, lose my apartment, and everyone will see I'm a failure — my brain treats that as an inevitable chain.

You're getting more comfortable with the shame and self-doubt, and the physical sensations are becoming more distinct. The fact that the accusing whisper and the looping movie are still present, but you're able to notice them more clearly, suggests that you're developing a sense of detachment. My goal is to help you explore the shame and self-doubt in a more neutral, observational way, rather than trying to change or judge them.

Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your face flushing and the desire to hide. I'd like you to notice these sensations without judgment, and say to yourself: "This flushing, this feeling of wanting to hide, it's happening right now, and I'm going to observe it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you simply observe these sensations, without adding any thoughts or emotions to them?

Patient: I can feel the heat in my face, my cheeks burning and my heart picking up — there's this strong urge to duck away and hide. I'm trying to just notice it, but my brain immediately turns it into proof that I'm exposed and ruined — I'll be found out, fired, lose everything — and that shame flares so hard I can't stay neutral.

Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay that your brain is still trying to turn the sensations into catastrophic predictions. I'd like you to say to yourself: "I see that my brain is doing its thing, trying to make sense of these feelings, and I'm going to be kind to it, even if it's being unhelpful." Can you offer kindness to your brain, even if it's being painful or unhelpful, and allow it to continue to process these feelings without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. Saying something like, "I see you, you're scared and trying to protect me," feels weird and even gross, and that hot shame spikes like someone lit a match under my chest, but I can say it: I see you, brain — you're trying to keep me safe even if the way you're doing it is scary and unhelpful.

Can you start to imagine that you're already in a safe place, where you can be with your shame and self-doubt without feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I try to imagine being in a safe place — feeling the ground under my feet and my legs steady — and for a second it loosens the tight band in my chest.

Patient: I can say it: "I'm here, in this moment, with my legs sinking into the ground, and I'm going to allow both the shame and the sense of safety to be present, without trying to change or judge them." Holding them feels like clutching a hot coal and a pillow at the same time—my legs steady for a beat, the shame still burning in my chest, and then my brain screams that the shame proves I'm exposed and everything will collapse.

Patient: I can sort of see it — a tiny, contained spark in my chest — but almost instantly my brain blows on it like wind and turns it into a wildfire that’ll prove I’m a failure and everything will collapse. My face is hot, I’m shaky, and that shame is right under everything, so I’m feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?
