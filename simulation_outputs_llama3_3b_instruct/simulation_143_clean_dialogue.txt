Patient: I've been feeling stuck and directionless lately—like my whole identity has narrowed down to just "data scientist" and I don't know what matters beyond that. My mind immediately jumps to the worst: if I don't figure this out I'm going to mess up at this new, demanding program, they'll notice I'm incompetent, I'll get sidelined or fired, my personal life will unravel, and I'll end up miserable and isolated with nothing to show for it. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop predicting that chain of events—any suggestion that something else could happen just feels unrealistic.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically keeps you awake at night about this new program? Is it the fear of not meeting expectations, not feeling challenged enough, or something else entirely?

Patient: Mostly it's the fear of being exposed as incompetent—like I picture myself fumbling a presentation or failing a project review, them noticing, my confidence collapsing, projects getting reassigned, and before I know it I'm sidelined or even fired. There's also this dread that even if I technically succeed, I'll still feel directionless and realize I've wasted years chasing a job that doesn't mean anything to me, and that'll make everything feel pointless. I try to reason myself out of it, but those disaster scenarios feel like the only realistic forecasts, and they replay in my head all night.

Therapist: Can you think of a time when you felt truly fulfilled and engaged in your work as a data scientist? What was it about that experience that felt meaningful to you, and what has changed since then that's led you to feel stuck?

Patient: Yeah—there was a time I felt really engaged when I led an analytics project that actually changed how clinicians scheduled follow‑ups and we saw readmissions drop; it mattered because the impact was concrete and I could see people benefiting. Since then, the new program feels politicized and siloed, the impact is vague, and I'm overloaded so I don't get that cross‑functional collaboration anymore. But even that memory gets undercut by my brain: it insists those wins were flukes and that soon someone will find a flaw, they'll trace it back to me, they'll call me out as a fraud, and everything will unravel—any suggestion that things could turn out differently just seems unrealistic.

Therapist: I want to gently challenge the idea that your past success was just a fluke. Can you consider the possibility that your role in leading that project was more significant than you're giving yourself credit for? What would it be like to revisit that experience and acknowledge the value you brought to it?

Patient: I can see on paper that the project mattered and that I actually did the heavy lifting—designing the model, coordinating clinicians, pushing through the messy data work so the change stuck. But the moment I try to accept that, my brain flips into forecasting mode: someone will find a flaw, they'll trace the problem back to me, they'll call me out, and everything unravels. So even that success just feels like a one-off that won't protect me next time. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. Can you notice when you're starting to think about all the ways things could go wrong, and pause for just a moment? Take a deep breath and say to yourself, "This thought is just a thought." Just acknowledge it, and then let it go. No judgment, no evaluation – just letting it pass. Can you try that with the thought about your past success?

Patient: Okay—I tried it. I took a breath and told myself "this thought is just a thought," and for maybe two or three seconds it felt like a tiny crack in the loop. But then my brain immediately snapped back: someone will find a flaw in that project, they'll trace it to me at the review, they'll call me out, I'll be sidelined or fired, and everything I've done will be pointless. I'm frustrated because the pause only lasted a beat and I don't know how to make it hold.

Therapist: I'm impressed that you noticed the brief pause and were willing to try to hold onto it. Let's try to build on that. Can you imagine, instead of trying to completely let go of the thought, what if you allowed it to coexist with the understanding that it's just a thought? That is, can you find some small space to hold both the thought and the understanding that it's just a thought?

Patient: I tried that — I can get a tiny sliver where I tell myself "it's just a thought" and hold it next to the fear, but within seconds the disaster story takes over: they'll spot a flaw, call me out in the review, my projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, and everything I built collapses. Holding both feels impossible — the "just a thought" is like a whisper that gets drowned out. I'm frustrated and don't know how to make that little space actually stick.

Therapist: Let's try something a bit different. Can you imagine, instead of just noticing the thought, what if you were to literally place the thought in a mental box, like a small container? The thought would be the object in the box, and you would observe it from outside, as if it's just a thing. Can you try that for just one more second, and see if that helps to create some space?

Patient: I tried putting the thought in a mental box — for a second it felt like I could look at it from the outside, like maybe it wasn't me for once. But then my brain ripped the lid off and the story started again: they'll find a flaw, trace it to me at the review, call me out, my projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, and everything falls apart. The box felt like a flimsy prop that doesn't hold; I'm frustrated and honestly don't know how to make any of these tricks stick.

Therapist: Let's try something that might feel a bit more experiential. Can you imagine yourself in a situation where you're working on a project, and you're feeling confident and competent, and you're making progress? What does that feel like? What values are being expressed in that situation? Can you take a few deep breaths and imagine yourself in that situation right now, and see if you can tap into those values and express them in your current situation?

Patient: I tried to imagine being confident and competent—there's a tiny physical hint of it, like steadier breathing and a sense that curiosity and responsibility are actually guiding my work. But almost immediately my brain turns it into a horror script: I do well, someone later finds a flaw, they call me out in the review, projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, and everything falls apart—so the confidence just feels like a setup for disaster. I know that sounds paranoid, but I can't seem to let the values stick; they get drowned out by the forecast and it's really frustrating.

Therapist: Let's try something a bit more concrete. What's one small, valued action you could take right now, in this moment, that feels connected to your values of curiosity and responsibility? It doesn't have to be a big change, just a tiny step. Can you identify something you could do, like checking a project's status, or sending a message to a colleague, or even just taking a few more deep breaths?

Patient: I could send a one‑sentence status update to my lead — just the current metric and one blockage so it’s factual and small. My brain already says that will backfire: someone will spot a tiny inconsistency, it'll be pulled into a review, they'll call me out, my projects get reassigned, and I'm sidelined. It feels like a big lift to even do that, but I could try to draft it now.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling a lot of resistance, but I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to even consider taking that small action. It's not easy to face the possibility of potential criticism or backlash. Can I offer you a small piece of encouragement? You're taking a small step towards your values, and that's something to be proud of, regardless of the outcome. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that.

Patient: Yeah... I could draft that one‑line status, but even imagining doing it feels draining. The moment I picture sending it my head jumps to: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it sparks a review, they call me out, my projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined—so it's hard to push send. Maybe I can try drafting the sentence here for now, just to see if that feels doable.

Therapist: Let's try something small. Why don't you draft that one-sentence status update right here, in this moment, without thinking about the potential consequences? Just focus on getting the sentence down on paper. We can worry about the rest later. Can you start with the words "I'm updating my project status as follows..."?

Patient: I'm updating my project status as follows: current model validation AUC 0.82, deployed feature pipeline pending cleaned labels from Clinical Team (blocker), ETA for next update: tomorrow after data refresh. 

But if I actually send that, my brain says someone will spot a tiny inconsistency, escalate it in the review, they'll trace it back to me, call me out, my projects will get reassigned, and I'll be sidelined—so it feels like a risk I can barely face right now.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're taking a risk, but I want to challenge the idea that sending the update is a risk. What if, instead of seeing it as a risk, you saw it as an opportunity to demonstrate your attention to detail and commitment to your work? Can you try to reframe it in that way, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I tried to reframe it as showing attention to detail, but the second I do my mind shoots back: someone will nitpick a number, escalate it in the review, they'll trace it to me, I'll be blamed, projects reassigned, and I'm out. Holding the "opportunity" angle feels naive and slips away almost instantly—I don't know how to make that shift stick.

Therapist: Let's try something different. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you were to ask yourself what you can learn from this experience, regardless of what happens? Can you imagine you're on a journey of exploration, where the goal is to learn and grow, not to achieve a specific outcome? What might you learn from sending this update, and what might you discover about yourself in the process?

Patient: Maybe I'd learn that I can communicate clearly, that flagging blockers actually moves things forward, or that I can take feedback without falling apart. But the second I picture that, my brain insists someone will spot a tiny inconsistency, escalate it, trace it back to me, call me out, my projects will be reassigned and I'll be sidelined — so the idea of "learning" just feels like a setup, and it's a huge effort even to consider trying.

Therapist: Let's take a step back. What would it be like if we didn't worry about the outcome at all? If we simply focused on the act of sending the update, without any expectation of what might happen? Can you imagine taking that first step, without any attachment to the outcome?

Patient: I try to picture just hitting send and focusing on the action, but as soon as I see it go out my chest tightens and my brain runs the tape: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me in the review, I'm blamed, projects reassigned, and I'm sidelined or fired. Maybe in theory I could do it, but thinking nothing bad will happen feels naive and unrealistic right now — it just drains me to even imagine trying.

Therapist: I can see that it's hard to muster the energy to even consider taking the action right now. Can we try something small? What if, instead of focusing on the potential consequences, we just acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed and that it's okay to feel that way? Can you take a deep breath and say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's okay to feel that way"?

Patient: Okay... I breathed in and said it: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's okay to feel that way." 

It barely sticks — two seconds later my head's already running the tape: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it back to me in the review, I'm blamed, projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, everything collapses. 

I don't really get how saying it's okay is supposed to help — I'm not sure I follow; it just feels like a thin bandage on a leak and I'm too drained to keep patching it.

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that saying it's okay to feel overwhelmed might feel like a temporary patch, but it's not just about patching up the surface. It's about acknowledging that your emotions are valid and present, and that you're willing to explore them. Can you try to expand on that feeling of overwhelm? What does it feel like, physically and emotionally, when you're feeling overwhelmed? Can you explore that with me?

Patient: Physically it feels like my chest is tight and my breathing gets shallow, my stomach knots, my jaw and shoulders tense up, and my head goes foggy so I can't focus on the next step. Emotionally it's this hot knot of dread and shame—like I'm waiting to be exposed—and underneath that there's this tired, numb resignation that I should be doing more but can't. Then the fortune‑teller starts up: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated in a review, they trace it to me, I get blamed, projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, and everything collapses. It all just drains me so fast I can't see past the loop or figure out how to act without it feeling like a setup.

Therapist: I can see that the physical sensations of overwhelm are closely tied to the emotional experience of shame and dread. And it's understandable that the catastrophic thinking is reinforcing those feelings. Can you try to explore what might happen if, instead of trying to push through or avoid the emotions, you were to approach them as if they were a neutral, observed experience? That is, can you try to observe the physical sensations and emotions without judgment, without trying to change or avoid them?

Patient: I try. I name the sensations: tight chest, shallow breaths, a knot in my stomach, jaw and shoulders tense. For a second they feel like things I can look at, but then the fortune‑teller kicks in and the loop starts again—someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me, I'm blamed, projects reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired. Observing them doesn't make the story quieter; it just feels like cataloging symptoms while the disaster tape keeps playing, and honestly it's wearing me out.

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can you imagine that the catastrophic thinking is like a voice in a different room? You're sitting in your current room, observing the thoughts and physical sensations, and you're also imagining that the voice is in another room, telling a story that's not necessarily true. Can you visualize that?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — a muffled voice in the next room — and for a second it feels distant. But it never stays put: it barges back in with the same script — someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it’s escalated, they trace it to me, they call me out, projects get reassigned, I’m sidelined or fired — so moving the voice feels pointless. I don’t know how to make that image actually quiet the predictions; my head's too scrambled to hold it.

Therapist: Let's try to bring some curiosity to that image. Instead of trying to silence the voice, can you imagine what might happen if you were to lean into the voice, and listen to its story? What would you hear if you were to really tune in? Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: If I really lean in it's just that full disaster tape on loop: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me, they call me out in the review, my projects get reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, and everything — career, relationships — collapses. It sounds so detailed and factual in my head that I get pulled in and my chest tightens and my thoughts go shaky; other outcomes feel impossible and naive. I don't know how to listen without getting sucked into believing it's definitely going to happen.

Therapist: Let's try to add a note of skepticism to the story. Can you imagine that you're listening to the voice, and at the same time, you're thinking, "Wait a minute, this is just a story. Where's the evidence that this outcome is certain?" Can you try to hear that voice, and also hold that skeptical tone?

Patient: I tried to hold that skeptical tone, I really did — I even asked myself "where's the evidence?" — but my head immediately answers: last sprint had weird data that slipped through, the lead already made that passive comment about standards, I botched a small thing in a code review last month, and politics here mean one mistake gets magnified. So the skepticism just sounds like denial to me; those facts line up and make the disaster story feel inevitable, and my chest tightens thinking about it. I don't know how to make the doubt stick without it feeling like wishful thinking.

Therapist: Let's try to connect with a value that's at stake in this situation. What's one thing that's important to you, personally, that might be impacted by this outcome? Is there something that would make you feel more secure, or valued, or fulfilled? Can you think of one thing that might be at stake here?

Patient: Honestly, what's at stake is my sense of competence and security — I want to feel like I'm actually good at what I do and that my work matters. But my head immediately goes: if that slips, they'll reassign my projects, I'll be sidelined or fired, my relationships will fray, and I'll be left with nothing, so it all feels terribly fragile and overwhelming.

Therapist: I can see that your sense of competence and security is really important to you. Now, I want to ask you something. What would it mean to you to take the action of sending that update, not as a guarantee of success, but as a way to show up to your work and be honest about the challenges you're facing? Can you imagine taking that small action, not because you're trying to avoid the worst-case scenario, but because it feels like the right thing to do in the present moment?

Patient: I hear that — sending the update would mean I'm showing up, being responsible, and not hiding blockers, which is what I want to be. But the second I picture hitting send my head goes straight to the tape: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me in the review, I'm blamed, projects get reassigned, and I'll be sidelined or fired — so it feels less like showing up and more like walking into a trap. I want to do the right thing, but I'm jittery and distracted and don't know how to risk it right now; maybe I can draft and sit on it, but even that feels precarious.

Therapist: Let's try to reframe the situation in a more positive light. What if, instead of seeing the update as a risk, you saw it as an opportunity to practice something that's really important to you? What if you saw it as a way to demonstrate your responsibility, your attention to detail, and your commitment to your work? Can you imagine that taking the small action would be a way to show up to yourself and your work, rather than just a way to avoid the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I can kind of picture it as practice—showing responsibility, practicing attention to detail—and for a beat that feels okay. But then my brain screams the same tape: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me, I'm blamed, projects reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired, everything collapses. Imagining it as practice just makes me more jittery and drained; maybe I could draft it and not send, but even that feels risky and heavy.

Therapist: Let's try to take a small, tiny step. Can you draft the sentence, just one tiny step, without even thinking about the outcome? Just focus on the physical act of typing, and the sound of the keyboard. Can you do that for just one sentence?

Patient: I'm updating my project status as follows: current model validation AUC 0.82; deployed feature pipeline pending cleaned labels from Clinical Team (blocker); ETA for next update: tomorrow after data refresh. 

But even typing that feels like a risk—my head's already yelling someone will spot a tiny inconsistency, escalate it, trace it back to me, and I'll be sidelined.

Therapist: Let's try to focus on the process, not the outcome. Can you imagine that the sentence you just drafted is just a small experiment, a tiny step towards taking care of your project and showing up to your work? What would it feel like if you were to "experiment" with taking action, and see what happens?

Patient: I get the idea of treating it as an experiment, but that image just makes my chest tighten — it feels like I'm setting up a tiny test I'm going to fail. If I actually send it my brain runs the tape: someone spots a tiny inconsistency, it gets escalated in the review, they trace it to me, I'm blamed, projects reassigned, and I'm sidelined or fired. Maybe I could save it as a draft and sit with it, but even that feels like stalling and it drains me.

Therapist: Let's try to shift the focus back to the process. What if, instead of worrying about the outcome, you were to focus on the sensations in your body as you're typing? Can you notice how your body feels as you're sitting here, typing, and your fingers on the keyboard? Notice the sensation of your breath, the feeling of your feet on the ground, and the sound of the keyboard. Can you stay with those sensations for just a few more moments?

Patient: Okay... breathing's shallow, chest tight, shoulders hunched, feet planted but kind of numb, and my fingers feel clumsy on the keys. I can hold that for a beat, then the tape starts again—someone spots the inconsistency, it gets escalated, they trace it to me, I'm blamed, projects reassigned, I'm sidelined or fired—and the sensations get drowned out. This is wearing me down; can we slow down or try something different?
