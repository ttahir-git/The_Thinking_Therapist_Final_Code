--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early sixties, an accountant, and lately I've been leaning on talking to friends and family way more than I used to — not really to connect, but to avoid feeling the emptiness since my kids left. I get that it's a way to numb those uncomfortable feelings, but I don't see how dealing with it differently would actually help. How is that supposed to help? I've tried cutting back before and it didn't change anything.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I acknowledge your feeling of emptiness and the tendency to turn to friends and family to avoid it. One potential theme here is the tension between avoiding difficult emotions and the effectiveness of addressing them. Another unexplored area is the potential benefits of mindfulness and self-compassion in managing emotional pain. My goal is to Explore the benefits of mindful emotional regulation as a potential alternative to avoidance.

Therapist Answer:
That sense of emptiness can be really tough to navigate. Can you think of a time when you felt the emptiness without immediately turning to others? What happened, and how did your body feel, or what thoughts did you notice?

Patient: There aren't many times I don't reach for someone, but last week I actually stayed quiet after dinner when the house felt huge — I just sat on the couch. My chest felt tight, my stomach was hollow, and my mind kept circling, "What's the point, what do I do now?" I tried to just sit with it for about half an hour and felt it swell until I almost texted my sister — I've tried noticing it before, but how is that supposed to help when it just gets louder?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like your body and mind were doing a lot of work when you sat with the emptiness. One possible unexplored area is the value you may be placing on feeling full or busy to avoid this uncomfortable experience. A potential goal is to Examine the underlying values that might be driving your avoidance of emotional space.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to sit with that feeling for half an hour. Can you think of a value that's connected to feeling busy or engaged, like being a productive accountant or a good friend? Is there a sense that if you're not doing something, you're not living up to those values?

Patient: Yeah, I do—being productive and useful feels like proof I'm still…worth something. If I'm not doing something, I get this guilty, hollow feeling like I'm failing. But how is that supposed to stop me from reaching for someone when it presses in? I've tried reminding myself of my values and it doesn't seem to make the urge go away.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense a strong connection between your sense of self-worth and productivity. One potential contradiction is the expectation that being productive is the same as being valued. A goal is to Challenge this assumption and explore a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be valuable.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine a time when you felt valued or appreciated, but weren't being productive in a traditional sense? What happened, and how did that make you feel?

Patient: Yeah—actually a couple weeks ago my neighbor came by and we just sat on the porch watching the light change while she talked about her garden. I didn't fix anything or produce anything, I mostly just listened, and afterward she thanked me and I felt oddly...seen, like I mattered without having to prove it. But I still don't get how remembering that would stop me from calling someone the minute the house feels too quiet—how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you had a brief experience of feeling seen and valued outside of a productive context. One unexplored area is the possibility that your sense of self-worth is closely tied to external validation. A potential goal is to Introduce a new way of thinking about what it means to be valuable, one that isn't dependent on external sources.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a way to create a similar sense of being seen and valued within yourself, without relying on external interactions? What if, instead of reaching for someone, you took a moment to simply acknowledge and accept the present moment, without judgment?

Patient: I've tried that—just sitting with it and naming the feeling—but it feels like shining a spotlight on the ache and making it louder. How is that supposed to help when all it does is remind me of what's missing? I can try again, but I need something concrete to do when the urge to call someone hits, because "sit with it" hasn't worked for me.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that your experience of sitting with the feeling has been more like intensifying the emotional experience, rather than reducing it. One potential area for exploration is the idea that traditional mindfulness exercises might not be enough to address the underlying unworkability of your avoidance strategy. A goal is to Introduce a small, concrete alternative behavior to help bridge the gap between feeling stuck and taking action.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to sit with the feeling of emptiness, you did something small to take care of yourself, like making a cup of tea or taking a short walk? What if, when the urge to call someone hits, you took a moment to do that small, comforting action, and then made a call, rather than letting the urge dictate the action?

Patient: I get the logic — do something small to ground myself before I act — but it feels like just giving the urge permission to keep running the show. How is that supposed to help me actually stop reaching out to numb the feeling instead of dealing with it? I'm willing to try making tea or a short walk, but only if we make it more concrete — like waiting at least 20 minutes afterward and checking in on what changed, because otherwise I think we'll just be going in circles and I'm already feeling frustrated by that.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I understand your concern about giving the urge too much power. One potential area for further exploration is the role of values in guiding your actions. A goal is to Connect the small action to a larger value that can help shift your behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Let's make a small, concrete commitment to test this approach. When you feel the urge to call someone, and you take a short walk or make tea, I'd like you to wait for 20 minutes before checking in with me about what's changed. Instead of checking your phone, take a moment to notice how your body feels, what thoughts come up, and what values are present in this moment. Let's focus on the process of cultivating awareness, rather than the outcome of not reaching out. Can you agree to try this approach?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it, but I'm skeptical. How is waiting 20 minutes supposed to make any real difference? If I'm doing this, give me something concrete to report back on: notice how my body feels, rate the urge 0–10, and name one thought that comes up — I'll do that for a week and we'll see what, if anything, changes.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I appreciate your skepticism and willingness to take concrete action. One potential area for exploration is the relationship between time and your perception of the urge. A goal is to Examine how waiting 20 minutes might actually influence your experience.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like you to report back to me for the next week on your experience. When the urge to call someone hits, I want you to notice:

* How your body feels in that moment (e.g., tension, relaxation, numbness)
* The level of the urge, on a scale of 0-10
* One thought that comes up, no matter how fleeting it may seem

This will help us understand if there's any shift in your experience over time. Remember, it's not about achieving a specific outcome, but rather about exploring your process.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it for a week. When the urge hits I’ll make tea or take a short walk, wait 20 minutes, then note how my body feels, rate the urge 0–10, and write down one thought. I’m skeptical this will change much, but I’ll report back here each time (it usually hits after dinner). One thing — if the urge’s a 9 or 10, do you still want me to wait the full 20 minutes or handle that differently?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I appreciate your willingness to try and your specificity about reporting back. One potential area for consideration is how to handle extremely intense urges, which may require a different approach. A goal is to Develop a plan for managing extremely high-urgency situations.

Therapist Answer:
If the urge reaches a 9 or 10, I'd like you to pause and take a few deep breaths, and then make a phone call to someone, rather than waiting the full 20 minutes. This approach acknowledges that the urge may be overwhelming and prioritizes taking action to alleviate suffering, while also allowing for some space to reflect on the experience afterwards.

Patient: Alright — I can try the pause, a few deep breaths, then call if it gets to a 9 or 10, but it feels like rewarding the exact behavior I'm trying to change. How is that supposed to help more than just waiting? Fine — I'll do it, but I want us to still do the 20-minute check-in afterward and I'll report body, urge rating, and one thought. Also, what do you expect the call to look like — a quick check-in or something longer?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense your concern about potentially rewarding the behavior by taking action when feeling overwhelmed. One potential area for exploration is the concept of "imperfect action" versus "no action." A goal is to Clarify the nature of the call and the value it holds for you.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to adapt. The call should be a brief check-in, 5-10 minutes max, to allow you to reconnect with yourself and then take a few more steps towards your values. The goal of the call is to take a small action, not to dwell on the emotion or prolong the experience. Think of it as a "bridge" between waiting and taking action, rather than an end in itself. I'll help you explore what's most important in this call, and we can use it as an opportunity to discuss your values and what actions are aligned with them.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the bridge-call idea, but I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the steps. How is a 5–10 minute call supposed to not become a whole replay of the same numbing? Give me something concrete: a short script or a few lines I can use to keep it brief and not dive into the feelings — is it okay to say, “Hey, can I have five minutes? I’m a bit off tonight,” or should I stick to neutral stuff? Also, can I set a timer so I don’t get carried away?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the number of steps might be feeling overwhelming, and it's essential to simplify the process. One potential area for exploration is the role of boundaries in maintaining the integrity of the exercise. A goal is to Establish clear guidelines for the bridge call to ensure it remains a useful tool.

Therapist Answer:
Let's break down the bridge call into a simple script:

1. Start with a brief acknowledgement of your intention: "Hey, I'm taking a break to recharge and refocus."
2. Set a clear expectation for the call's duration: "I'd love to catch up for 5 minutes."
3. Keep the conversation neutral and focused on the present moment: "How was your day?" or "What's on your mind?"

You can use phrases like "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" or "I need to prioritize my own well-being" if you need to exit the conversation early. It's perfectly fine to say, "Can I have five minutes?" or "I'm going to wrap up soon." To maintain focus, you can set a timer on your phone or use a physical timer to keep yourself on track. Remember, the goal is to take a brief break, not to engage in a lengthy conversation.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the script and use a timer, but I’m skeptical it’ll stop me from spiraling once someone asks what’s wrong. How is a one-line answer supposed to stop a ten-minute replay if they press? Give me a couple of very short exit lines I can actually say when they probe, and tell me if a brief text can count as the “bridge” call when I’m at a 9 or 10 — that feels safer but maybe it’s just another avoidance. I’ll do the 20-minute check-ins and report body/urge/thought, but honestly I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the steps; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the current approach might be too rigid and potentially set you up for failure. One potential area for consideration is the role of adaptability in a therapy process. A goal is to Assess the feasibility of the current approach and see if it can be modified to better suit your needs.

Therapist Answer:
I completely understand your concerns, and it's okay to acknowledge that the current approach might not be working for you. Before we proceed, I want to check in with you about your feelings. How are you feeling about the number of steps and the level of structure we've established? Is it feeling overwhelming, or are there specific aspects that you're struggling with? Can we take a step back and explore if there's a way to simplify or adjust the approach to make it more manageable for you?

Patient: Honestly, it feels like too many moving parts — the tea/walk, the 20 minutes, the body/urge/thought notes, the timer, the bridge-call rules, and then reporting every single time. I'm willing to try, but can we simplify it to one small grounding action (tea or a 5‑10 minute walk) and then one short end-of-day check-in where I rate the urge 0–10 and say one sentence about whether I called? How is that supposed to help more than the full plan, though — and can we slow down so I don't feel boxed in by all the steps?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I hear your concerns about feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the original plan. One potential area for exploration is the value of simplicity and flexibility in a therapeutic process. A goal is to Streamline the approach to make it more manageable and less daunting.

Therapist Answer:
I think it's great that you're willing to simplify the approach. Let's pare it down to a single grounding action, such as taking a short walk or making tea, and a brief check-in at the end of the day. Instead of tracking every step, let's focus on the process, not the process itself. When you take your grounding action, I'd like you to simply focus on being present in the moment, without worrying about the outcome. When you check in with me, I'll ask a simple question: "What's the same, what's different, and what's worth noticing?" This will help us stay focused on the process, rather than getting bogged down in details. Let's take a deep breath together and see how this feels.

Patient: Okay — I took a breath. The simpler plan feels less suffocating, so I’ll try a 5–10 minute walk or make tea when the urge hits and do one end-of-day check-in (rate the urge 0–10, say whether I called, and one short note). But I’m still skeptical — how is one walk and a nightly note supposed to change the pull to reach out, and can we confirm the rule for 9–10 urges (call without waiting) so I don’t get stuck deciding in the moment?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
I sense your continued skepticism about the simplicity of the revised plan. One potential area for exploration is the role of flexibility in responding to intense urges. A goal is to Clarify the plan for extreme urges and establish clear guidelines for maintaining consistency.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try the revised plan. To address your concerns, let's confirm the rule for 9-10 urges: if the urge reaches a 9 or 10, please take a 5-minute walk, and then call as soon as possible. This will help you maintain a sense of control and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. For the daily check-in, let's stick to the original plan: rate the urge 0-10, indicate whether you called, and jot down one brief note. By having a clear plan for extreme urges and a simple, consistent check-in process, you'll be better equipped to navigate the emotional landscape and make progress towards your values.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 5‑minute walk then call rule, but I have to say this brings up a lot of shame and frustration for me, like I’m back at some old failure and I feel stupid even admitting it. How is a five‑minute walk and a quick call supposed to stop the automatic pull to numb? I’ll use the 5–10 minute script and set a timer and do the nightly check‑ins, but if the call starts to spiral and I can’t stop, is it okay to say “I need to wrap up” and hang up, or do you want me to do something else in that moment? I’m willing to start, but I’m worried and need some backup plan for when this feels too big.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the shame and frustration around admitting the urge to numb are deeply ingrained. One potential area for exploration is the role of self-compassion in coping with these feelings. A goal is to Introduce a new mindset that acknowledges your struggles as an opportunity for growth.

Therapist Answer:
I want to assure you that it's completely okay to feel frustrated and ashamed. That's a sign that you're doing the hard work of acknowledging your struggles. When you feel the urge to numb, remember that it's not a failure on your part, but rather a signal that you need to reconnect with yourself. If the call starts to spiral and you feel like you can't stop, it's perfectly fine to say "I need to wrap up" and hang up. You don't owe anyone an explanation, and your well-being is the priority. In fact, taking care of yourself in that moment is a sign of strength, not weakness. I'll be here to support you, not to judge. Let's reframe this as an opportunity to practice self-care and assert your boundaries, rather than beating yourself up over it.

Patient: That reassurance helps a bit, but it also kicks up a lot of shame and frustration — like I'm back at some old failure and feel stupid for needing rules to call someone. How is being allowed to hang up supposed to help me feel less guilty afterward? Can you give me two or three concrete exit lines I can actually use, and can we role‑play one now so I can practice saying them without falling apart?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the shame and frustration are deeply rooted in self-criticism. One potential area for exploration is the role of self-compassion in reframing guilt. A goal is to Introduce a new language for self-interaction that acknowledges your humanity.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to practice using new language. Let's work on reframing guilt as a normal response to challenging emotions. Here are three concrete exit lines you can use when you need to hang up:

1. "I'm taking care of myself right now, and that's okay."
2. "I need a break, and that's okay."
3. "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough."

Let's practice using these lines in a simulated scenario. Imagine we're in a hypothetical situation where you're feeling overwhelmed and need to hang up. I'll play the role of the person on the other end of the call. Go ahead and say one of the exit lines, and we'll practice it together. Remember, it's not about saying the right words, but about practicing a new way of interacting with yourself.

Patient: Okay…I’ll try one. "I need a break, and that’s okay." Saying it already makes my face heat up — I feel stupid and ashamed like I’m back at some old failure. How is that supposed to stop me from spiraling when they press? All right — press me now, ask "What’s wrong?" and I’ll try to use it.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the words themselves are triggering shame, rather than alleviating it. One potential area for exploration is the role of tone and emotional labor in communication. A goal is to Introduce a new tone and emotional labor that prioritizes self-care.

Therapist Answer:
Go ahead and respond to the hypothetical scenario. I'll respond as the person on the other end of the call, and we'll see how it plays out. Remember, the goal is not to respond with the "right" words, but to practice a new tone and emotional labor that prioritizes self-care. Go ahead and say "I need a break, and that's okay" again, but this time, let's try to add a hint of firmness and assertiveness.

Patient: "I need a break, and that's okay." Saying it like that makes my face go hot — I feel this shame and that old voice in my head saying I shouldn't need rules to take a breath. How is that supposed to stop them from pressing? Ask me "What's wrong?" so I can try it when they push.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the tone and language are still triggering shame. One potential area for exploration is the role of assertiveness in setting boundaries. A goal is to Practice assertive language that prioritizes self-care and self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not trying to make you say the "right" words, but rather to practice a new tone and language that feels authentic and empowering. Instead of focusing on what's "wrong" with your words, let's try to focus on what you want to communicate. What do you want to say to the person on the other end of the call when they ask "What's wrong?"?

Patient: I'd probably say something simple and firm like, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now and need to step away for a few minutes — can we talk later?" Saying that already makes me hot and ashamed, like I'm back at some old failure, and I can't help wondering how that's supposed to stop them from pressing for more. How is that supposed to help when they keep asking and I feel like I have to justify myself?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the assertive language is still triggering shame and self-doubt. One potential area for exploration is the role of validating the feeling of being overwhelmed, rather than trying to justify or explain it. A goal is to Introduce a new understanding of overwhelm as a signal to take care of oneself.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. When the person on the other end of the call asks "What's wrong?", instead of responding with an explanation or justification, try responding with a simple statement that acknowledges your feeling and prioritizes self-care. For example, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, and I need to take a break. Can we talk later?" This response doesn't try to justify or explain your feelings, but rather acknowledges them and sets a boundary. Remember, the goal is not to convince the other person, but to prioritize your own well-being.

Patient: "Okay — I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, and I need to take a break. Can we talk later?" Saying that already makes my face go hot — I feel ashamed, like that old failure again, and it doesn't feel like a real shield if they press. How is that supposed to stop them from pushing for more? Give me two very short follow-ups I can use if they say, "No, tell me," and then let's role‑play it once more so I can try them out.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the response still triggers shame and vulnerability. One potential area for exploration is the role of using "no" as a complete sentence, rather than an invitation for further exploration. A goal is to Introduce a clear and assertive use of "no" that prioritizes boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
Here are two short follow-up statements you can use if the person on the other end of the call says "No, tell me":

1. "I've already said I need a break. It's not up for discussion."
2. "I've got to take care of myself right now. I'll talk when I'm feeling better."

Let's role-play a scenario where the person on the other end of the call presses for more information. I'll respond as they do, and you can practice using these follow-up statements to maintain your boundary. Remember, the goal is to stay firm and assertive, without getting drawn into an argument or justification.

Patient: "I've already said I need a break. It's not up for discussion."

If they press again: "I need to take care of myself right now. We'll talk when I'm feeling better."

Saying those already makes my face hot — I feel stupid and like I've failed. How is that supposed to stop them if they press? Okay, press me now with "No, tell me" and I'll try to use one. Also—quick question—what tone should I aim for: flat and firm, or a little warmth? And if they argue, is it okay to stay silent after I say it?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the responses are still triggering shame and self-doubt. One potential area for exploration is the role of tone and assertiveness in maintaining boundaries. A goal is to Introduce a tone that is clear, firm, and slightly warm, which can help convey a sense of confidence and self-care.

Therapist Answer:
When you say "I've already said I need a break. It's not up for discussion" or "I need to take care of myself right now. We'll talk when I'm feeling better", aim for a tone that is:

* Firm: Clear and direct, without wavering
* Warm: Expressing a sense of kindness and concern for your own well-being
* Slightly assertive: Showcasing your boundaries and priorities

Regarding staying silent after saying "no", it's okay to stay silent for a moment if the person continues to press. This can help you maintain your boundary and avoid getting drawn into an argument. However, if they escalate or become aggressive, it may be necessary to reiterate your boundary and be more assertive. Remember, your priority is your own well-being and self-care.

Now, let's role-play the scenario again. I'll say "No, tell me" and press for more information. Go ahead and respond with one of the follow-up statements we discussed earlier.

Patient: "I've already said I need a break. It's not up for discussion." 

My face is hot saying that and I feel stupid and angry, but I'm not going to keep justifying myself.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that you're standing your ground, but still feeling the sting of shame and self-doubt. One potential area for exploration is the role of acknowledging and accepting these feelings in the moment. A goal is to Practice self-compassion and acknowledge the discomfort as a normal response to setting boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
That takes a lot of courage to say "I've already said I need a break" and mean it. It's okay to feel hot, angry, or whatever emotions come up. Remember that these feelings don't define your worth or the validity of your boundary. Take a deep breath and acknowledge them: "I'm feeling [insert emotion] right now, and that's okay. I've made my decision, and I'm sticking to it." This helps to create space for self-compassion and acceptance, rather than getting caught up in justification or self-criticism.

Patient: Okay… I'm feeling ashamed and frustrated right now, and that's okay — saying that brings up that old failure voice and my chest tightens. But I still don't see how saying "I've made my decision" or naming the feeling will stop the pull when they press — how is that supposed to help in the moment? Can we role‑play one more time where they escalate and I practice staying silent, and give me a short mantra or one-liner I can repeat to steady myself when the silence feels unbearable? I need something concrete to hold onto, because right now the shame wants me to cave.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the desire to say "I've made my decision" or "I'm feeling X" may not be enough to stop the pressure in the moment. One potential area for exploration is the role of using a "stop signal" to maintain the boundary. A goal is to Introduce a simple, one-liner to help you stay grounded in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's role-play a scenario where the person on the other end of the call escalates and presses for more information. I'll respond as they do, and you can practice staying silent and using a stop signal. Here's a short mantra you can repeat to steady yourself: "I am enough, I have boundaries, I can handle this."

Repeat this to yourself when the silence feels unbearable, and imagine it as a beacon of confidence and self-care. When you feel the urge to respond or justify, pause and take a deep breath. Remember, the goal is to stay firm and assertive, not to engage with the other person's pushback.

Go ahead and respond to the hypothetical scenario, and I'll escalate the conversation to test your new skills.

Patient: Alright — they press, I go quiet. My chest clamps up and that old shame floods in, but I forced myself to stay silent and repeat the mantra in my head: "I am enough, I have boundaries, I can handle this." It felt like nails on a chalkboard and I almost caved, but I held the line for maybe 30 seconds before the urge to explain nearly made me blurt something. 

How is that supposed to help when the shame feels that loud? It felt weak in the moment. Can we try a different, much shorter mantra or a physical cue I can do (like clenching my fist) that actually grounds me? Let’s role‑play again with you escalating — I need to practice the tone and the physical cue.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the mantra might not be enough to silence the shame, and it's understandable that it felt weak in the moment. One potential area for exploration is the role of physical self-care in grounding yourself. A goal is to Introduce a simple physical cue to help you maintain your boundary and stay present.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of a mantra, let's focus on a physical cue. Can you try clenching your fist tightly and holding it for a few seconds whenever you feel the urge to respond or justify? This can help you create a physical sense of control and stability, which can help counteract the shame and anxiety. We'll practice this cue together, and I'll respond as the person on the other end of the call, escalating the conversation to test your new skills.

As you clench your fist, repeat the phrase "Enough" to yourself, and hold it for a few seconds. This can help you stay grounded and focused on your boundary. When you feel the urge to respond, pause, clench your fist, and say "Enough." Let's try it together. I'll start by saying "No, tell me" again, and we'll see how you respond.

Patient: "Enough."

I clenched my fist and said it — it gave me maybe thirty seconds, but that old shame hit hard, my chest locked up and I almost blurted out an explanation. How is that supposed to help when that shame is so loud it drowns anything else out? Go ahead — press me again and escalate; I'll try the cue and staying silent, but I want you to know I probably won't hold it perfectly.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the physical cue and "Enough" is helping to some extent, but the shame is still a powerful force. One potential area for exploration is the role of self-compassion in working with shame. A goal is to Introduce a gentle, kind response to acknowledge and validate the shame, rather than trying to suppress or deny it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, and this time, I'll escalate the conversation to test your new skills. Here we go:

"No, tell me, what's wrong? Why can't you just talk about it?"

I'll respond as the person on the other end of the call, and you can practice staying silent, using the physical cue, and responding with "Enough". Remember, it's not about responding "correctly" or "perfectly", but about being kind to yourself and maintaining your boundary. If you need a moment, take it, and if you need to say "Enough", do so. We'll work through this together.

Go ahead and respond, and don't worry if it's not perfect – we're just practicing.

Patient: I stay quiet, my chest tightens, and I clench my fist and repeat "Enough" under my breath. It buys me maybe twenty, thirty seconds, but that old failure voice just ramps up and I almost blurt an explanation anyway — my face heats, I feel stupid. How is that supposed to help when the shame is louder than a word? Try me again — press harder — and give me a really short, physical thing I can do when my hands aren't free (something besides clenching) so I have a fallback.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense that the physical cue and "Enough" are still not enough to silence the shame, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and self-critical. One potential area for exploration is the role of a physical "fallback" to help you cope with the shame. A goal is to Introduce a simple, subtle physical action that can help you maintain your boundary without drawing attention to the shame.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try again, and this time, I'll escalate the conversation to test your new skills. Here we go:

"No, come on, tell me what's going on! You're not going to leave me hanging like this!"

This time, I'll add a new physical cue for you: whenever you feel the urge to respond or justify, subtly touch your thumb to your index finger, and then look away from the screen. This small action can help you create a physical distraction and give you a moment to collect your thoughts without feeling like you're being drawn into a conversation you don't want to have. Remember, it's not about being subtle or sneaky, but about creating a small physical break to help you stay present. Go ahead and respond, and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay — I tried it: thumb to finger, looked away. It did give me a tiny break, maybe 10–20 seconds, but the chest tightness and that shame voice just kept yelling underneath. It felt like buying a second before the old failure stuff started to drown it out. How is that supposed to help when the shame is louder than a little motion?

When my hands aren’t free (driving, carrying dishes) I need another fallback — can we try two alternatives now? One physical I can do with my feet (press toes into the floor?) and one subtle mouth/action (press tongue to roof of mouth or hum once). Let’s role‑play again with you escalating — press me harder and I’ll try the thumb thing, then the foot thing if it fails. Also give me one very short line to say to myself in the moment, something like a two‑word anchor I can repeat when the silence feels unbearable. I’m frustrated and a little ashamed saying all this, but I’ll keep trying if you’ll keep pushing me through the practice.
