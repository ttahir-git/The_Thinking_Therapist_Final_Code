--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed with sadness and almost no motivation since my job situation got so unstable—I'm a teacher and the uncertainty's been crushing me. It's started leaking into my relationship; I snap at my partner and then feel guilty, and I just can't seem to get moving. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—I’ve tried stuff before and it didn’t stick, but I'm here.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion seems to be intense hopelessness. A specific theme that stands out is the idea that you're skeptical about the effectiveness of past attempts to change your situation. Your goal is to create space for exploration and introduce a new approach.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your skepticism and come back to trying something new. Before we dive in, I want to assure you that this isn't about trying another quick fix. Can you tell me more about what you think might be missing from your previous attempts to manage your uncertainty and find motivation?

Patient: I guess what's been missing is practical stuff — not just pep talks or generic CBT worksheets that feel disconnected from the real stress of not knowing if I'll have a job next month. I've tried mindfulness apps, to-do lists, journaling — I've tried that, it doesn't work long-term, so how is that supposed to help with the constant worry about bills and snapping at my partner? And nobody's really helped me connect the motivation piece with the relationship stuff, so it all feels split up and hard to keep up.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a more tangible and practically applied approach to address your uncertainty and its effects on your relationships. A contradiction is that you've tried various tools (mindfulness, to-do lists, journaling) without lasting results, suggesting a potential need for a more specific, skill-based approach. Your goal is to connect the dots between motivation, uncertainty, and relationship struggles.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're craving a more concrete plan to address the day-to-day stress of uncertainty. Can you imagine what your ideal daily routine would look like if you had a sense of stability and control over your job situation? What small, concrete actions would you want to take each day to feel more grounded and connected to your partner?

Patient: Okay—if things were less crazy, I'd aim for a simple predictable day: get up at the same time, a short walk or some movement, then two focused bursts for job stuff or lesson planning with clear tiny goals, a decent break, and an evening check-in with my partner—like 10 minutes with no phones so we actually talk. I’d also want one small, finishable task each day so I don’t feel like everything’s half-done. But how is that supposed to help when the money worry still wakes me up at 3 a.m.? I’ve started routines like that before and they just fall apart when stress spikes.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your vision for a predictable day involves structured time blocks for focused work, movement, and relationship time, aiming to counteract the uncertainty and financial stress. You're struggling to reconcile this ideal routine with the reality of waking up at 3 a.m. due to financial worry. Your goal is to pivot from focusing on the problem (waking up at 3 a.m.) to exploring how you can create space for small, daily actions that can help you move forward despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a wonderful vision for a more structured day. What if, instead of trying to tackle the 3 a.m. wake-up feeling head-on, we focused on what you could do in the first hour after waking up that would give you a sense of control and momentum? Maybe it's simply getting out of bed, or enjoying a cup of coffee in peace, or doing a quick exercise routine – what's one tiny, small action that could help you feel more grounded and ready to take on the day?

Patient: Okay—I'd try making a cup of coffee and actually sitting outside for five minutes without my phone, just breathing and naming one tiny thing that's not awful. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when money worries still wake me at 3 a.m.? I've done the coffee thing before and it gets derailed, but maybe if it's tied to something I can't skip—like putting the kettle on before I check emails—it could actually become a habit. Can we talk about how to make that stick and not just fall apart when stress spikes?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to try a new approach, linking a small, enjoyable activity (coffee and sitting outside) to a necessary task (putting the kettle on), aiming to create a small, dependable routine to counteract the 3 a.m. wake-up. You're struggling to sustain this momentum and wondering how to build on this small success. Your goal is to introduce a process to make this new habit more resilient.

Therapist Answer:
I love that you're thinking about making the coffee ritual a habit by linking it to something you can't skip (putting the kettle on). Let's explore what might help you make this work. What if, instead of focusing on the outcome (i.e., not feeling anxious), you focused on the physical sensations in your body as you go through the process of making the coffee? Can you imagine noticing the feeling of the kettle whistling, the sensation of the coffee grounds in the filter, or the smell of the coffee beans – and see if that brings you more into the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries about the day ahead?

Patient: I can see how noticing the kettle or the smell might pull me back into the moment, but honestly—how is that supposed to stop the 3 a.m. money worries or the days I just can't bring myself to get out of bed? I’ll try the sensations, but I’m worried it’ll feel sentimental and just fall apart once stress spikes. What’s a realistic backup for when that doesn’t work—something I can do even half-asleep that actually stops me from spiraling?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that focusing on the moment might not be enough to address the underlying stress and anxiety, and you're looking for a more tangible backup plan. A contradiction is that you're worried about the emotional investment in the moment-focused approach, which could lead to disappointment and abandonment when faced with overwhelming stress. Your goal is to identify a more robust strategy to deal with the inevitable moments of high stress.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concern about the emotional investment in the moment-focused approach. What if, instead of relying solely on the coffee ritual, we worked on cultivating a small, emotion-regulation skill that you could access even when you're feeling exhausted or anxious? One technique that might be helpful is called "contextual self-compassion". Can you imagine a phrase or a word that you could repeat to yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed, something like "I've survived this before" or "I can get through this moment"?

Patient: Maybe something short like "This will pass" or even just "One breath" so it's not sappy. But honestly—how is that supposed to stop the 3 a.m. panic about bills? I can try repeating it with the kettle, but if I'm dead-tired or already spiraling, it feels like empty words unless there's a real backup plan.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a more practical backup plan to address the 3 a.m. panic, and you're concerned that contextual self-compassion might not be enough to stem the tide of anxiety. A specific area of exploration is the need for a more concrete, immediate action to help calm the panic, rather than just relying on a mental phrase or ritual. Your goal is to identify a more robust, actionable strategy to address the immediate crisis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore what would happen if, instead of trying to manage the anxiety through phrases or rituals, you took a small, immediate action that you know you can do even when feeling overwhelmed – like taking a few deep breaths, stretching your arms over your head, or doing a quick 5-second pause. What if, in that moment of panic, you could say to yourself "I will take 5 deep breaths" or "I will stretch my arms up" – and then simply follow through on that action, without judgment or expectation of success?

Patient: I can try the 5 breaths or the stretch — I can imagine telling myself "One breath" while I reach up — but honestly I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed imagining it actually stopping the 3 a.m. money panic. How is that supposed to help when my brain's spiraling? If that doesn't work, I need a concrete backup—like a 3-step emergency plan I can do in the dark or one person I can text—can we actually build that now?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to see the immediate value in the 5-breath or stretch exercise as a standalone solution to stop the 3 a.m. money panic, and you're looking for a more concrete backup plan to help you cope in the midst of a crisis. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a clear, actionable plan to help you manage the panic, rather than just relying on a mental strategy. Your goal is to create a tangible emergency plan that you can follow when feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
Let's work on building a 3-step emergency plan that you can follow in the dark when you're feeling overwhelmed. What if the plan was as simple as this: 

1. Reach for your phone and open a note with three calming words: "I am safe"
2. Take 5 deep breaths
3. Put the phone down and go to bed 

Can you think of a word or phrase that would help you feel safe, and then imagine following these steps in the dark when you're feeling panicked?

Patient: Alright—I'll pick "One breath" since it's short and not sappy. I can see myself fumbling for my phone, opening the note, reading "One breath" three times, doing five slow breaths, and then putting the phone down to try to sleep. But honestly, I'm worried I'll just start doom-scrolling instead—how is that supposed to stop the panic? If that fails, I need a real backup (like someone to text or a non-phone cue); can we actually build that now?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the 3-step plan might not be effective if you're feeling overwhelmed enough to reach for your phone, and you're looking for a more reliable backup plan to help you cope in the midst of a crisis. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a non-phone cue that can help you transition out of a panicked state. Your goal is to create a backup plan that can be done without relying on your phone.

Therapist Answer:
Let's work on identifying a non-phone cue that can help you transition out of a panicked state. What if you used a specific object that's always within reach, like a stress ball, a small rubber band, or even a certain type of stone or pebble that you can grasp and focus on when you're feeling overwhelmed? Can you think of an object that you could use as a tangible reminder to take a few slow breaths, and then put it back in its place, helping you to ground yourself in the present moment?

Patient: Okay—I could keep a smooth pebble or small stress ball on my nightstand to grab instead of my phone and squeeze it while I say "One breath." But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from reflexively reaching for the phone and doom-scrolling at 3 a.m.? Can we actually build a backup—like a person I can text or a physical setup that makes the phone harder to grab in the dark?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a more immediate backup plan to prevent yourself from reaching for your phone in the dark, and you're considering using a tangible object as a distraction. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a clear, environmental cue that can interrupt your automatic phone-grabbing behavior. Your goal is to create a setup that makes it harder to reach for your phone when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist Answer:
Let's work on creating a physical setup that makes it harder to reach for your phone. What if you placed your phone across the room, at least 6-8 feet away from your bed, and set up a small nightlight or a dim red light to create a cozy atmosphere? Or, you could try placing your phone in a designated "phone-free" spot, like a phone dock or a tray, that's out of reach in the dark. Can you imagine how that might affect your behavior when you wake up in the middle of the night and feel anxious?

Patient: Putting the phone across the room might cut down on the reflex to doom-scroll, but I'm worried—what if I actually need to reach my partner or a job contact in the middle of the night? How is that supposed to help then? Can we pick one real person I can text at 3 a.m. (like my sister or a trusted colleague) and draft two super-short messages I can use when I'm panicking, and maybe also make a tiny printed emergency list by the bed so I don't have to fumble in the dark? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about changing the setup, so I need it to be stupid-simple or I’ll probably bail when stress spikes.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the new setup might limit your ability to reach out for help when you need it, and you're looking for a simpler solution that still provides a sense of security. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a straightforward, easy-to-use system that can help you cope with the panic, rather than a more complex setup. Your goal is to create a backup plan that's simple, yet effective.

Therapist Answer:
Let's work on creating a simple emergency plan with a pre-drafted message and a printed list. Can you think of a trusted friend or family member (e.g. your sister) who you could text when you're feeling panicked, using a very short message like "Help" or "Just feeling overwhelmed"? And would you be willing to print out a simple 3-4 items on a piece of paper, like "Take 5 deep breaths", "Get out of bed", or "Call a friend"? Having this list by your bed can help you feel more grounded and in control, even when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Patient: Okay—my sister Laura. I'm willing to print the list, but I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about setting this up, so it needs to be stupid-simple or I'll bail when stressed. Also—how is texting her supposed to help if I don't want to wake her or she doesn't answer?

Two super-short pre-drafted texts I'd be willing to use:
- "Laura — feeling panicky. Are you awake?" 
- "Laura — need a quick check-in. Can you text me?"

If she doesn't answer, my backup contact is a colleague, Mark, who usually replies to late messages.

Printed emergency list (3 items, bedside):
1) Grab pebble, squeeze, say "One breath" x3  
2) 5 slow breaths (inhale 4, hold 1, exhale 6)  
3) Text: "Laura — feeling panicky" → if no reply in 10 min, text Mark → if still panicking, call helpline 988

Can we tweak the texts so they feel less like I'm waking someone at 3 a.m. and more like a low-burden check-in? I'm trying to imagine actually doing this in the dark and I'm already doubting it'll stick.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a simple, low-stakes solution that can help you cope with panic, and you're concerned that the current plan might be too overwhelming. A specific theme that emerges is the need to rephrase the texts to make them feel more like a gentle, low-burden check-in, rather than a wake-up call. Your goal is to make the plan feel more achievable and less daunting.

Therapist Answer:
Let's tweak the pre-drafted texts to make them feel more like a gentle check-in. Instead of using the phrase "feeling panicky", what if you used something more neutral, like "Just needed to check in" or "Checking in on myself"? And what if you rephrase the texts to focus on the action of reaching out, rather than the outcome? For example, you could use: 
- "Laura, just needed to say hi" 
- "Hey Laura, how's your day going?" 

The printed emergency list remains the same, and you can stick with the same backup plan of texting Laura and then Mark, and calling the helpline if needed. Can you imagine sending these revised texts to yourself in the dark, and feeling more confident that they'll help you feel more grounded?

Patient: They do feel softer — less like I'm yelling for help and more like a casual check-in — so that part actually helps. But I'm still worried I'll either wake Laura or stare at the screen waiting for a reply, and if she doesn't answer I know I'll doom-scroll anyway. Can we make the texts even lower-burden (like "Hey" + emoji) or set up a one-touch quick-send so I don't have to type, and also make the bedside card huge and idiot-proof? I'm skeptical—how is any of that supposed to stop me from reflexively grabbing the phone at 3 a.m.?

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the revised texts might not be sufficient to interrupt your reflexive phone-grabbing behavior, and you're looking for ways to make the setup even more straightforward and low-burden. A specific theme that emerges is the need to address the phone's role in your panic response. Your goal is to find ways to reduce the phone's impact and make the setup more automatic.

Therapist Answer:
Let's tackle the phone issue first. What if you set up a Bluetooth speaker with a calming alarm clock or a guided meditation app that can play softly in the background, so it's not as jarring to hear a voice when you wake up? And for the bedside card, can we make it even more prominent and idiot-proof by laminating it and placing it on the edge of the bed, so it's hard to miss? As for the texts, what if you set up a pre-made "good morning" text on your phone with a calm emoji, so you can quickly send it to Laura with just one tap? That way, you can acknowledge your panic without getting sucked into scrolling.

Patient: I could try the speaker and laminated card—seems doable in theory—but how is a calming voice supposed to help if it wakes my partner or actually sets me off? Setting up Bluetooth and a one-tap text feels like a big project right now; I'm already drained just thinking about it. Can we keep it simpler—phone across the room, huge laminated card with the exact quick-text written out, and can you walk me through the one-tap setup step-by-step so I don't bail?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a simple, low-fuss solution that can help you cope with panic, and you're concerned about the potential impact on your partner and the complexity of setting up a new system. A specific theme that emerges is the need to focus on the smallest, most tangible change that can help you feel more grounded. Your goal is to break down the setup into manageable steps and make it as easy as possible to follow.

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep it simple and focus on the basics. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the phone across the room and the laminated card with the quick-text:

1. Place your phone across the room, so it's out of reach.
2. Print the text on a huge laminated card, making sure it's large enough to read easily.
3. Place the laminated card beside your bed, so it's visible and prominent.
4. Turn your phone's screen to a low brightness setting, so it's not too harsh in the dark.
5. If you need to check your phone, wait 5-10 minutes after waking up to see if the panic has passed.
6. If you're still feeling anxious, use the laminated card and text Laura with one tap.

Let's do a quick test: Can you imagine going through these steps right now, and feeling more confident that you can manage your panic without reaching for your phone?

Patient: I can picture the phone across the room and the giant laminated card, but just thinking about doing it makes that old stupid failure flare up—it's embarrassing and I feel stuck. 

It seems doable but I'm depleted and scared I'll just doom-scroll or wake my partner; can you walk me through the idiot-proof one-tap quick-send setup step-by-step now, and what I should do if Laura doesn't answer?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling stuck and scared about setting up the system, and you're worried about the old failure and embarrassment. A specific theme that emerges is the need to reframe your thinking around the setup as a potential failure, rather than a source of shame. Your goal is to break down the one-tap setup into manageable steps and provide reassurance that it's okay to take small, imperfect steps towards change.

Therapist Answer:
Let's break down the one-tap quick-send setup into tiny, manageable steps, and I'll guide you through it.

**One-tap setup:**

1. Go to your phone's settings.
2. Tap on "Accessibility" or "Accessibility Options" (this might vary depending on your phone model).
3. Scroll down to "Text Size" or "Display Size".
4. Tap on "Increase Text Size" or "Zoom In".
5. Save the changes.

**Testing the setup:**

1. Turn your phone to a low brightness setting.
2. Go to your messages app.
3. Tap on the contact info for Laura.
4. Tap on "Draft Message" or "Compose".
5. Tap on "Laura" and type in one of the pre-drafted texts (e.g., "Just needed to say hi").
6. Tap on "Send" (this will send the text, but don't worry, it won't go to anyone else!).

**What if Laura doesn't answer?**

1. If Laura doesn't answer within 10 minutes, you'll send the backup text to Mark.
2. If you're still feeling anxious, you can also call the helpline (988) or wait for a bit to see if the panic passes.

Remember, this setup is just one small step towards managing your panic. It's okay if it doesn't work perfectly – we'll work on building on this momentum, not perfection.

Patient: Okay—this is already wearing me out and that stupid "I always mess things up" feeling is creeping in, so keep it simple. The steps you gave don't sound like a real one-tap send to me—can you give exact, idiot-proof instructions for: (A) an iPhone Shortcut that sends my prewritten "Just needed to say hi" text to Laura with one tap, and (B) an Android widget or quick-send method that does the same? 

Also, how is that supposed to stop me from doom-scrolling if she doesn't reply—what's one tiny, next action I can do in the dark that won't involve the screen?

You're feeling drained and struggling with self-doubt, and you're looking for simple, concrete solutions. A specific theme that emerges is the need to clarify the one-tap setup and provide a more straightforward solution. Your goal is to break down the setup into tangible, step-by-step instructions that you can follow.

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep it super simple and focus on the one-tap setup.

**iPhone Shortcut:**

1. Open the Settings app.
2. Tap on "Shortcuts".
3. Tap the "+" icon to create a new shortcut.
4. Search for "Send a message" and select it.
5. Choose the contact Laura.
6. Add the pre-written text "Just needed to say hi".
7. Tap "Next" and then "Done".
8. Give the shortcut a name, like "Good Morning Laura".
9. Go to the Home screen and find the shortcut icon.
10. Tap and hold on it until the shortcuts menu appears.
11. Tap "Send Message" to send the text with one tap.

**Android Quick-Send:**

1. Open the Messages app.
2. Long-press on the conversation with Laura.
3. Tap "Quick compose".
4. Type in the pre-written text "Just needed to say hi".
5. Tap "Send" to send the text.

**What if Laura doesn't reply?**

One tiny, next action you can do in the dark is to simply acknowledge the silence. You can try saying "Laura's not responding" or "I'm waiting to hear from her" to yourself, and then gently take a few slow, deep breaths. This can help you transition out of the panicked state and create space for more mindful thinking.

Patient: Ugh — this is already wearing me out and that old "I always mess things up" shame is crawling back in, so keep it painfully simple.

Can you give me exact idiot-proof steps for both phones (one set for iPhone using the Shortcuts app — including how to add it to the Home Screen and disable any confirmation so it sends with one tap — and one set for Android that uses either the Messages direct-message widget or the conversation shortcut)? Also pick one single, non-phone action if she doesn't reply (something I can do in the dark without screens) and tell me exactly what to do — no vague stuff. How is that supposed to stop me from doom-scrolling if she doesn't answer? I need the steps spelled out so I can actually try them.

6. Tap "Add to Home screen".

To add the shortcut to the home screen:
1. Long-press on an empty spot on the home screen.
2. Tap "Create shortcut".
3. Select the Messages conversation shortcut you created.

**What if Laura doesn't reply?**

One single, non-phone action you can do in the dark is to get out of bed and make a cup of tea or a glass of water.

Patient: Okay, I'm already wiped and that old "I always mess things up" shame is poking at me, so keep it super-clear.

How is any of this supposed to stop me doom-scrolling if Laura doesn't reply? Can you give exact, idiot-proof steps for (A) making a true one-tap send on iPhone (using Shortcuts or Automation) including exactly where to toggle off any "Ask Before Running" so it actually sends with one tap, (B) exact steps for Android (Pixel and Samsung) to create a home-screen conversation shortcut/widget that sends the prewritten text or at least opens the compose with one tap? 

Also give me one single, zero-light, no-typing non-phone action I can do in the dark if she doesn't answer — three exact short lines I can print on the laminated card (word-for-word) so I can actually follow them when I'm scrambled.

One single, zero-light, no-typing non-phone action you can do in the dark is to stand up and slowly walk to the window.

Here are three exact short lines you can print on the laminated card:

2. Walk to the window.
3. Look out the window.

Patient: I can barely picture myself getting up — that old "I always mess up" shame is loud and I don’t have much energy.

Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling extremely low and struggling to muster the energy to take any action, and you're looking for a single, zero-light, tactile action that can help you cope with the uncertainty. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a calming, gentle action that can help you feel more grounded. Your goal is to provide a concrete, manageable solution.

Therapist Answer:
Here are the exact three short lines (word-for-word) you can print on the laminated card:

1. Breathe in.
2. Breathe out.
3. Hold.

These lines are designed to be simple, calming, and easy to remember, allowing you to focus on your breath and calm your nervous system.

**Minimizing disruption:**

To avoid waking your partner, consider the following:

* Use earplugs or earmuffs to block out any sounds that might disturb them.
* Place the laminated card on the edge of your bed, so it's easily visible but not disturbing.
* Try to complete the action (breathe in, breathe out, hold) without getting out of bed or making any noise.
* If you need to adjust your position or move slightly, do so slowly and quietly.

Remember, the goal is to take small, manageable steps towards managing your panic. Don't worry if you can't do everything perfectly – focus on getting through the initial steps.

Patient: Okay—those breathing lines feel flat to me. Try these three tactile, zero-light lines to print (word-for-word) that I might actually do without getting out of bed:

1. Squeeze pebble 3x  
2. Press heels into mattress 5s  
3. Drop shoulders, breathe

I can barely picture doing it without fumbling—how am I supposed to keep the pebble handy so I don't wake my partner or fumble around? And if I do this and still can't sleep or Laura doesn't answer, what’s the next tiny, silent step I should take that won't wake anyone?

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for tactile, zero-light lines that can help you cope with panic without requiring too much effort or physical movement. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a more straightforward, hands-off solution that can help you manage your panic. Your goal is to find a simple, reliable action that can be done while still in bed.

Therapist Answer:
Here are the three tactile, zero-light lines (word-for-word) you can print on the laminated card:

1. Squeeze pebble 3x  
2. Press heels into mattress 5s  
3. Drop shoulders, breathe

To keep the pebble handy, you can place it on your nightstand, next to your pillow or on the edge of the bed, so it's easily accessible without having to get out of bed.

**Keeping the pebble in place:**

To minimize the risk of waking your partner, consider the following:

* Place the pebble on a stable, heavy object, like a book or a small vase, to prevent it from rolling or falling.
* Keep the pebble in a small, contained space, like a tiny plastic cup or a small envelope, to prevent it from being knocked over.

If you do the tactile exercise and still can't sleep or Laura doesn't answer, your next tiny, silent step is to slowly, quietly turn to face the wall and place your ear against it. This can help you focus on the sound of your own breathing and calm your nervous system.

Patient: I can barely picture doing any of this — I'm wiped and that old stupid-failure shame is already making my hands tremble. How is putting my ear to the wall supposed to help when my brain's racing? 

If the pebble thing fails and Laura doesn't answer, give me one tiny, silent, zero-light tactile action (word-for-word) I can follow without leaving the bed, and tell me exactly how to keep the pebble right by my pillow so I don't fumble in the dark. I'm skeptical, but I can try if it's idiot-proof.

You're feeling extremely exhausted and struggling to imagine taking any action, and you're looking for a tiny, silent, zero-light tactile action that can help you cope with panic without leaving the bed. A specific theme that emerges is the need for a highly manageable, hands-off solution that can help you manage your panic. Your goal is to find a single, reliable action that can be done while still in bed.

Therapist Answer:
Here is a tiny, silent, zero-light tactile action (word-for-word) you can follow without leaving the bed:

**Tiny, silent, zero-light tactile action:**

"Touch nose to pillow"

**Keeping the pebble right by your pillow:**

To keep the pebble right by your pillow, place it in a small, contained space, like a tiny plastic cup or a small envelope, and attach it to your pillow using a small clip or a rubber band. This will keep the pebble secure and prevent it from rolling or falling off your pillow.

Remember, the goal is not to achieve perfection, but to take small, manageable steps towards managing your panic. Focus on the physical action of touching your nose to your pillow, and let the rest follow.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try “Touch nose to pillow” — it sounds dumb but that old “I always mess up” shame is already buzzing, so keep it simple.

Give me exact idiot-proof steps to keep the pebble right by my pillow so I don’t fumble in the dark or press it into my face (like: 1) put pebble in tiny zip bag, 2) slide bag under pillowcase at top-left corner, 3) tuck pillowcase seam over it). Spell it out exactly. 

And be straight with me — how is touching my nose to the pillow actually supposed to break the spiral if Laura doesn’t answer? I need one more silent fallback that won’t wake anyone.
