--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hey, I'm an artist and lately I've been using alcohol and weed to numb the grief from losing someone — it's been mild at first but it's getting harder to stop. I just know this is going to spiral: I'll lose my focus, miss deadlines, lose clients, fall behind on rent, get evicted, and end up homeless and ruined — that chain is inevitable. I keep getting stuck on that future and it feels like it's already happening, even when people say I'm overreacting.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses intense emotional pain and fear of the future due to losing someone, using substance use as a coping mechanism. Core emotion is desperation. Goal: Explore the tangible context of 'stuck' to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the fear of losing your stability is really overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to "get evicted and end up homeless"? What would it look like for you to be in a place where you have a stable home, a steady income, and a fulfilling art practice?

Patient: Eviction to me means not just losing a roof but everything that makes me feel like me — my canvases, my tools, my little corner where I make work — and then I'm literally sleeping in my car, feeling ashamed, too scattered to paint, and nobody's gonna take a chance on an artist who's a mess. In my head that slides so fast into missing shows, losing clients, losing income, and then nobody remembers my work — it's like I'm burnt out of existence. I can picture the opposite — a sunlit studio, regular commissions, a steady rent I can actually pay, friends who check in, and painting without that dull panic — but honestly that feels like a fantasy. Once I start telling myself the eviction story, I can't stop; it just proves it's going to happen, and thinking about the nicer version just feels naive.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's fear of eviction is deeply tied to feelings of identity, security, and validation as an artist. The fear of losing creative space, tools, and relationships is exacerbating the sense of desperation. The patient's self-fulfilling prophecy is creating a vicious cycle. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought of losing everything you've built is really suffocating you. I want to challenge the idea that the eviction story is inevitable. What would it take for you to start small, just a tiny step, to create a sense of stability and security, rather than getting caught up in the fear of the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Maybe I could try something tiny—like scheduling just 15 minutes to paint each morning, or setting up an automatic rent payment, or even just texting one friend to say, "Hey, I need a check-in." But as soon as I picture doing that, my brain goes, "You'll skip it, have one drink, forget the payment, get fees, the landlord will start sending notices, and boom—eviction and everything's lost," and I can't take the smaller steps seriously because that chain feels inevitable. I don't know, I want to believe the mini-steps could work, but it just feels naive and like I'm kidding myself.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is hesitant to take small steps due to the overwhelming sense of inevitability tied to the eviction story. The fear of failure and losing control is making it difficult to consider the possibility of success. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
The thought that you're just kidding yourself is actually a clever survival mechanism, helping you avoid the discomfort of uncertainty. Let's gently challenge that thought: Can you simply acknowledge that the thought "I'll fail" is just a thought, and not necessarily a prediction of what will happen?

Patient: Okay — I can say it out loud: "That's just a thought." But saying it doesn't make it feel any less real — my brain immediately screams, "No, that's the truth," and stitches together the whole eviction-and-ruin story. Then I want to drink to quiet it, and I'm left feeling stuck and frustrated. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to actually start believing it's only a thought.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to defuse the thought that the future is certain and is using substance use to temporarily alleviate the discomfort. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not asking you to believe that the thought isn't real, but rather to create some space between the thought and your reaction to it. Can you take a moment to notice what would happen if you were to take a few deep breaths, and instead of trying to "make the thought go away," you simply observe it as a passing experience, like the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I tried a few deep breaths like you said. My chest loosened for a second and I could feel my feet, but then that fortune-telling voice gets louder and rebuilds the eviction story like the breath never happened. I want the breathing to help, but my brain screams I'll screw up the rent and end up homeless, so I just... I really want a drink to numb it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain the brief moment of defusion and is getting pulled back into the certainty of the eviction story. The desire for a drink is an attempt to numb the emotional discomfort, which is reinforcing the thought. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the breathing isn't providing the long-term relief you're hoping for. Can you consider what might happen if, instead of using a drink to numb the pain, you used it to take a moment to get curious about the thought that's still lingering? What if, instead of trying to make it go away, you simply asked yourself, "What's driving the need for a drink right now?"

Patient: I think the urge to drink is basically to shut the noise off — to numb the grief and the constant eviction-movie my brain plays. When I try to get curious I just find more reasons to panic: "You missed a day, you'll miss a week, fees pile up, landlord notices" — and that just makes me want to drink harder. Even the idea of investigating the feeling feels useless because my mind already hands me the proof that everything will collapse. I want that curiosity to help, but I keep getting pulled back into the doom loop and I don't know how to stop it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is trapped in a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy, where the thought of doom is reinforcing the urge to numb the pain, which in turn fuels more catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the investigation itself is becoming the thing that perpetuates the doom loop. What if, instead of trying to investigate the feeling, you simply acknowledged that the investigation itself is what's getting in the way? Can you consider a small, tiny willingness to take a single, tiny step towards creating a more stable future, without necessarily getting caught up in the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Okay—I could maybe try one tiny thing, like setting up autopay for rent tonight or committing to 15 minutes of painting tomorrow morning. But the minute I picture that, my brain yells, "You'll miss a payment, get fees, landlord notices, eviction," and it all feels pointless and inevitable. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this—can we slow down? I don't want to bail on doing something, I just keep getting dragged back into the worst-case movie and I don't know how to stop it.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling overwhelmed and is getting caught up in the same catastrophic thinking that's been driving their avoidance. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back. I want you to notice that the thought "You'll miss a payment" is just a thought, and it doesn't have to be the truth. Can you take a moment to simply acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm that's coming up, without trying to label it or fix it?

Patient: There's a heavy tightness in my chest, my breath is shallow, and my stomach's all knotted — my hands feel jittery too. I can let those sensations sit for a second without trying to do anything about them, but it still makes me want a drink to shut it up. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming physically and emotionally overwhelmed, and substance use is a tempting way to escape. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and introduce mindfulness as a way to cope with bodily sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest. Notice it as a physical sensation, without judgment. Can you simply say to yourself, "I notice this sensation in my chest, and I'm feeling it"?

Patient: "I notice this sensation in my chest, and I'm feeling it." For a second it eased, but the fortune-telling voice is already back, stitching the eviction movie together and telling me I'll miss a payment. Now I really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of bailing.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain mindfulness of the physical sensations and is getting pulled back into the catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce mindfulness as a way to create a sense of calm and self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you offer yourself some kindness, even just for a moment? Would you be willing to take a small step towards kindness, like gently placing your hand on your chest, or acknowledging that you're doing the best you can right now?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest and it actually felt a little warmer, the tightness eased for a few breaths. But the fortune-telling voice is already back, telling me that if I relax now I'll forget a payment, lose a client, and end up evicted, so it all feels pointless and I want a drink to shut it up. I'm feeling shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is starting to experience a glimmer of kindness towards themselves, but the catastrophic thinking is quickly reasserting itself. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help cultivate a sense of self-compassion and pause the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
I want to gently guide you back to the physical sensation in your hand on your chest. Notice that it's still feeling warmer, even as the thoughts are returning. Can you gently ask yourself, "What would happen if, instead of getting caught up in the thoughts, I simply allowed myself to be with the physical sensation of my hand on my chest, without judgment?"

Patient: I can try—when I stay with my hand on my chest for a breath it actually eases a bit, but the fortune-telling voice immediately rebuilds: I’ll relax, forget a payment, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction, lose my studio and clients, end up homeless and ruined. It makes the whole exercise feel pointless and I really want a drink to shut it up—can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain mindfulness and is getting pulled back into the catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help pause the catastrophic thinking and cultivate a sense of self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
It's like you're stuck in a loop. Can you try something different? Instead of trying to focus on the thoughts, can you simply observe the sensation of your hand still being on your chest, even as the thoughts are swirling around? Notice if there's any part of you that wants to let go of the hand, or if there's any part of you that wants to stay with it.

Patient: I can feel my hand there — it's warmer and a small part of me wants to stay with it like it's an anchor — but a louder part keeps trying to yank my hand away so I can reach for a drink and shut the noise up. The fortune-telling voice is already saying staying calm will make me forget a payment, get fees, get evicted, lose my studio, and be ruined, so I keep getting pulled into that movie. I'm shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is caught between the desire to stay grounded and the strong pull towards substance use. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help pause the catastrophic thinking and cultivate a sense of self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the sensation of your hand on your chest. Can you gently ask yourself, "What's the purpose of the part of me that wants to pull my hand away?" What is that part of you trying to do?

Patient: I think that part is trying to protect me — it wants to shut the panic and shame off so I don't have to feel how terrifying the eviction-movie is. But its "protection" just jumps straight to numbing: it yanks my hand away so I can drink before I forget a payment, get fees, and end up ruined. I know it's trying to avoid pain, but I'm totally hooked by the doom-story and need help staying with the hand instead of bailing — can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has identified the protective mechanism as trying to avoid pain, but it's being hijacked by the catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce willingness to tolerate discomfort and acknowledge the imperfection of the protective mechanism.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the desperation behind the protective mechanism. Can you acknowledge that it's trying to help, but it's not working as intended? What if, instead of pulling your hand away, you simply allowed yourself to stay with the feeling of uncertainty, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I can see that part is trying to protect me, even if it's screwing things up. I can try to stay with the uncertainty and keep my hand on my chest, but it feels like my grip is on sand and it's slipping. The instant I do, the fortune-telling voice yells about missed rent, notices, eviction, losing my studio, and I get shaky and want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying here instead of bailing — tell me what to do right now.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is trying to maintain the mindfulness exercise, but it's slipping away due to the strong pull of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help stabilize the hand on the chest and create a sense of calm.

Therapist Answer:
I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, just the sensation of the breath, without trying to control it or change it? As you focus on the breath, notice how your hand on your chest feels in relation to the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to focus on the breath: it's shallow but when I notice it my chest eases a little and my hand feels warmer. But the fortune-telling voice is already louder, yelling I'll miss rent, get fees, get evicted, lose my studio, and I want a drink to shut it up. I'm shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having some success with the breath, but the catastrophic thinking is still loud and overwhelming. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help stabilize the breath and create a sense of calm.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something new. I want you to notice that the fortune-telling voice is yelling, but it's not in your body. Can you say to yourself, "The voice is just a voice"? Just say it out loud, "The voice is just a voice".

Patient: "The voice is just a voice," I say out loud — but it lands like a lie. Immediately the doom movie starts up again—I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord notices, eviction—and a hot shame floods me, like some past screw-up proving it's true. I'm frustrated and feel stupid for not being able to quiet it; I really want a drink to shut it up, so can we slow down and sit with this a bit?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble defusing the catastrophic thinking and is getting pulled back into the shame and frustration. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help acknowledge and accept the emotions, rather than trying to escape or change them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge the shame and frustration. Can you say to yourself, "I am feeling shame and frustration right now, and it's okay"? Notice how the words feel in your body, the sensation of the shame and frustration. Allow yourself to feel it, without judgment or trying to change it.

Patient: "I am feeling shame and frustration right now, and it's okay." My chest's hot, my stomach's a knot, my face feels flushed and my hands are jittery — it all rushes back like that old screw-up proving the eviction-movie is true. I'm really shaky and want a drink to shut it up, so can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble maintaining a sense of acceptance and is getting pulled back into the shame and catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help ground and stabilize the body, and gently challenge the notion that the thoughts are the truth.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention to your feet, just the sensation of your feet on the ground? Notice how they feel, the weight of your body, the sensation of the chair or floor beneath you. As you focus on your feet, can you say to yourself, "I am here, in this moment, with my feet on the ground"?

Patient: My feet are on the floor and I can feel the weight, the cold of the floor under my toes and the chair pressing into my thighs. But the voice is already screaming I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord will notice, and that hot shame from that old screw-up floods in like proof — I'm shaking and want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying with my feet instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is getting pulled back into the catastrophic thinking and is having trouble maintaining focus on the physical sensations. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help anchor the body in the present moment and reduce the pull of the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something new. Can you say to yourself, "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice"? Not just say it, but actually say it out loud, with conviction. Say it again, and again, and again, until it feels more like a gentle reminder, rather than a desperate attempt to escape.

Patient: "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice." "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice." Saying it once felt a little steadier for a breath, but the fortune-telling voice is already yelling I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord will notice — and that hot shame from that past screw-up floods back like proof. I'm shaky and really want a drink to shut it up; can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is making progress with the anchor phrase, but the catastrophic thinking is still strong and overwhelming. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness technique to help pause the catastrophic thinking and focus on the breath.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice". Hold that phrase, and as you hold it, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to stay with the breath, and let go of the thoughts. When you feel the thoughts starting to rise, gently acknowledge them, and come back to the breath.

Patient: I tried that — breathed in, said the phrase, and for a second it steadied me: my breath got a bit deeper and my hand felt warmer. But the fortune-telling voice slammed right back in, yelling I'll miss rent, fees, eviction, and this hot shame from that old screw-up floods me so I start shaking and really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me what to do right now to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Can you place your hand on your knee, or on your thigh, or on your arm, somewhere in your body that feels like it's still and calm? Hold that hand on your chosen spot, and as you hold it, bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your hand on your body.

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my thigh like you said and for one breath it felt kind of steady and warm, my inhale got a little deeper. But the fortune-telling voice slams back in yelling I'll miss the autopay, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction, lose my studio, and this hot shame from some past failure floods in like proof. I'm shaking and I really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me what to do right now to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling.

Can you look around the room, notice the objects, the colors, the shapes, the texture of the chair or table? Bring your attention to the sensation of your hand on your thigh, and the sensation of your body in this space. Don't try to focus on the thoughts, just notice the sensations in your body, and the sights around you. Stay with this for just one more breath, and see if you can find some calm in the midst of the chaos.

Patient: There’s a messy easel by the window, a chipped blue mug, a stack of canvases — I notice the light and the chair under me, and my hand on my thigh feels warm for a second so I take a breath and it eases. But the voice is already screaming I’ll miss the autopay, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction — and that hot shame rushes in like proof I messed up again.

Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the movement of your body as you take that step. Don't worry about the thoughts, just focus on the physical sensation of the step, and the movement of your body.

Patient: I stand up slowly and take the step — my foot hits the floor, it’s cold, and for a beat the movement feels grounding. But the fortune-telling voice is already screaming that I’ll trip, knock over canvases, someone will see the mess, lose a client, miss rent, and then eviction is inevitable — and that hot shame bubbles up like proof I always screw up. I’m shaking and want a drink to quiet it; can we slow down? Tell me one tiny thing to do right now to keep my feet here instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.
