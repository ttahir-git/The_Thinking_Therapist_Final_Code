Patient: Lately I've been really anxious in social settings — even small gatherings with friends make me want to disappear, so I usually avoid them. I work as an accountant, and after some job loss and instability I developed PTSD that gets triggered around people; my colleagues are supportive at work, but friends don't really see that side of me. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and it usually doesn't work.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens for you in social settings that makes you want to avoid them? Is it the feeling of being overwhelmed, or is there something specific that triggers your anxiety?

Patient: Usually my chest tightens, my hands shake, and I get this hot flush where I either go quiet or start scanning for an escape route. I'm hyperaware—if someone laughs nearby or asks about work it spikes into shame and panicky memories from losing my job, and sometimes I feel like I'm going to blank out or have to leave. So I just avoid those situations; it's safer — but honestly, how is talking about that supposed to help? I've tried exposure and breathing exercises before and they didn't stick.

Therapist: I understand that it can feel like you're just trying to escape or avoid the feelings of shame and panic, rather than truly connecting with others. What would happen if, instead of avoiding social situations, you could find a way to be present with yourself and others, even when it feels uncomfortable? Would that be a way to start feeling more connected to your values of being a capable and competent person, rather than just trying to avoid your emotions?

Patient: I mean, maybe — in theory feeling present could help me feel more like the capable person I want to be, but in the moment my panic just takes over and I can't access that. How is that supposed to help when my hands are shaking and I'm scanning for exits — what would "being present" actually look like or feel like for me? I've tried mindfulness and grounding before and it didn't stick, so I'd need something concrete I can do when I'm blanking out, not just talk about values.

Therapist: I understand that mindfulness and grounding haven't been effective for you so far. Can I ask, what if, instead of trying to quiet or escape your anxiety, you could use your physical sensations (the shaking hands, the feeling of the floor beneath you) as a signal to pause and notice what's happening in your body? Instead of trying to control it, what if you simply acknowledge the feeling of panic and say to yourself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now"?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When my hands are shaking and my brain blanks, I don't even remember to notice, let alone say "I'm overwhelmed." I've tried labeling and mindfulness before and it just fades when the panic hits — I need something I can actually do in the moment, like pressing my feet into the floor or clenching a small object, something tactile. But honestly, I'm not sure that'll work either — I'm tired of trying tricks that don't stick.

Therapist: I can see that you're exhausted with trying various strategies that haven't worked for you. What if, instead of trying to control your anxiety, you focus on a small, simple act that you can do without thinking, like taking a few deep breaths or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Deep breaths and “notice your feet” are the kind of stuff I’ve already tried and it just fades when the panic hits. If we’re talking simple and tactile — I’d be willing to try pressing my feet into the floor or carrying a small stone to squeeze — but I’m skeptical it’ll become automatic; how do you expect that to stick when my brain blanks out?

Therapist: I understand that you're skeptical about trying new strategies again. Can you tell me what's at stake for you in terms of your values if you were to find a way to manage your anxiety in social situations? What would it mean to you to be able to be present and engaged with others, even if it feels difficult or uncomfortable?

Patient: If I could manage this, I wouldn't miss so many things — I'd show up for friends, date without panicking, and stop feeling like I'm defined by the job loss and anxiety. Right now it's costing me relationships, my confidence, and honestly my sense of normalcy; I keep spiraling into shame when people ask about work. But how is talking about values supposed to help when I'm in the middle of a freeze? I'm tired of trying things that don't stick, but I do want something that actually changes what happens in the moment.

Therapist: I hear that you're willing to try something that can help you break the cycle of avoidance and shame. What if, instead of trying to push through the anxiety, you were to start small and focus on taking one tiny step towards what you value, like saying "hello" to a friend or engaging in a low-stakes conversation? It doesn't have to be a grand or dramatic action; just a tiny one that you can build upon, even if it feels uncomfortable or difficult.

Patient: Maybe I could try saying "hello" — but how is that supposed to help when my chest tightens and I just blank out? If we're doing tiny steps, give me something concrete I can do in the 30 seconds when panic hits — like pressing my feet, squeezing a stone, or a phrase I can actually remember. I'm tired of tricks that don't stick, so be straight with me: how would we make this automatic, not just another thing I forget under pressure?

Therapist: I can see that you're looking for something concrete to do in the moment to help bridge the gap between the anxiety and a valued action. One approach that might be helpful is to use a physical action, like pressing your feet into the floor or clenching a small object, and then immediately following it with a simple, assertive phrase, like "I'm here" or "I'm okay." This can help create a small pause in the panic response, allowing you to refocus and regain control. Can you try that for just 30 seconds, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay, I'll try it now — I'm pressing my feet into the floor and saying "I'm here" under my breath. My chest's still tight, but my hands stopped shaking for a second and I took a slightly fuller breath, so it did something. I'm skeptical it'll stick in a real social setting — I blank out and forget even simple things. How do we make this automatic or routinize it so I don't feel like I'm doing something ridiculous in front of people? I'm tired of trying tricks that don't last.

Therapist: I hear that you're looking for a way to make this simple action feel more automatic and less ridiculous in social situations. One way to approach this is to think of the phrase "I'm here" as a kind of " anchor" that helps you regain your footing in the moment. What if, over the next few days, you repeated this phrase to yourself before each social engagement, like a kind of "pre-game" routine? This could help you build confidence in the action, and reduce the feeling of doing something ridiculous in front of others. Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try a pre-game routine and repeat "I'm here" before social stuff, and I can carry a stone to squeeze. But how's that supposed to make it automatic when my brain blanks — what concrete steps help it become a habit I don’t have to remember? Also, I need tips for doing this discreetly so it doesn’t feel ridiculous in front of people.

Therapist: To make the pre-game routine more automatic, try to make it a habitual part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. For example, start by repeating the phrase "I'm here" as soon as you wake up, and then carry the stone with you throughout the day. This can help your brain start to associate the phrase with the action of being present, making it more likely to happen automatically. As for discretion, you can start by repeating the phrase to yourself in private, like in your car or in a quiet room, and then gradually increase the volume and visibility as you become more comfortable. Additionally, try to focus on the physical sensation of pressing your feet into the floor or squeezing the stone, rather than the words themselves, to help you stay present and focused.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the pre-game routine and carry the stone, but how is that supposed to help when my brain actually blanks? How long do I have to do this before it stops feeling like a conscious, ridiculous thing — a week, a month? And in a noisy bar or when I start to dissociate, how do I squeeze or press my feet without people noticing, and if I do begin to detach do I leave or is there a discreet way to ground back? I’m tired of tricks that don’t stick, so give me a clear, realistic step‑by‑step I can actually follow.

Therapist: Let's break down the steps to help you integrate the pre-game routine into your daily life. First, commit to doing the pre-game routine for the next 2 weeks, starting with 5-10 minutes a day. During this time, pay attention to your physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts. When you feel yourself blanking or dissociating, try to bring your attention back to the sensation of pressing your feet into the floor or squeezing the stone. As you get more comfortable, you can increase the duration and frequency of the routine.

To discreetly ground yourself in public, try using the stone or pressing your feet in a way that doesn't draw attention. For example, if you're in a crowded bar, try pressing your feet against the bottom of the chair or against the floor, rather than trying to squeeze the stone in front of others. If you do start to dissociate, take a few deep breaths and bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. You can also try to find a quiet moment to step outside for a few seconds, or focus on a nearby object, like a chair or a table, to help you refocus.

To manage dissociation, remember that it's not a sign of failure, but rather a signal that you need to take a break and reground. Take a few deep breaths, and try to bring your attention back to the present moment. If you feel like you're in a situation where you need to leave, it's okay to excuse yourself and take a break. Prioritize your own well-being and safety.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the two‑week pre‑game, but honestly I’m skeptical it’ll stick. How is that supposed to help when I’m already panicking and blanking? Give me a concrete, foolproof sequence for the 30 seconds of panic — like: press feet, say phrase once, three slow breaths, then what? Also, what’s a discreet exit line if it’s not working and I don’t want to make a scene, and how do I routinize this so it becomes automatic (phone alarms, stone on my keys, practice at my desk?)? I’m tired of tricks that don’t last, so can we slow down and make a really simple checklist I can actually follow in real life?

Therapist: Let's create a simple, foolproof sequence for the 30 seconds of panic:

1. Press your feet into the floor for 3-5 seconds
2. Say the phrase "I'm here" once, in a calm and assertive tone
3. Take 3 slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body
4. As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the floor or the feeling of the stone in your hand
5. Repeat the phrase "I'm here" once more, if needed, to reinforce the sense of presence

As for the exit line, you can use a simple phrase like "Excuse me, I need some fresh air" or "I'm feeling overwhelmed, can I take a break?" This can help you exit the situation without drawing attention to yourself.

To routinize this sequence, try the following:

* Set a daily reminder on your phone to practice the pre-game routine at the same time every day (e.g., when you wake up or before a social engagement)
* Place the stone on your keys or in a visible spot as a reminder
* Practice the sequence at your desk or in a quiet space, so you can become familiar with the physical sensations and the phrase
* Gradually increase the duration and frequency of the practice over the next 2 weeks, so you can build confidence and automaticity

Here's a simple checklist to follow:

**Pre-Game Routine Checklist**

* Press feet into floor for 3-5 seconds
* Say phrase "I'm here" once, in a calm and assertive tone
* Take 3 slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body
* Bring attention to the sensation of feet on floor or feeling of stone in hand
* Repeat phrase "I'm here" once more, if needed
* Use exit line: "Excuse me, I need some fresh air" or "I'm feeling overwhelmed, can I take a break?"

Remember, the goal is to make this routine automatic, so try to focus

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the two‑week thing, but honestly I’m skeptical — how is that supposed to help when my brain actually blanks? Can you give me a tiny, memorized 4‑step script I can do in 30 seconds that I can actually rehearse until it’s automatic (like exactly what to do and say, no fluff)? Also, I need a couple of discreet exit lines for a bar, a friend’s house, and a work event, and a realistic plan for making this habit stick (exact times/alarms to practice, how often at my desk, where to keep the stone) — can we slow down and map that out step‑by‑step?

Therapist: **Tiny, Memorized 4-Step Script:**

1. "Inhale, feet down. [pause for 1 second]"
2. "Exhale, eyes down. [pause for 1 second]"
3. "Inhale, shoulders down. [pause for 1 second]"
4. "Exhale, I'm here." [pause for 1 second]

Repeat the phrase "I'm here" once more if needed.

**Discreet Exit Lines:**

* Bar: "Excuse me, I need some fresh air."
* Friend's house: "Hey, can we take a break and get some fresh air outside?"
* Work event: "Excuse me, I need to step outside for a minute."

**Realistic Plan for Habit Formation:**

1. Set your alarm for 10 minutes before each social engagement to practice the pre-game routine.
2. Practice the routine at your desk for 5 minutes, 3 times a week, for the next 2 weeks.
3. Place the stone on your keyboard or a nearby surface as a reminder.
4. Review the script and exit lines daily, and repeat them to yourself several times a day.
5. As you get more comfortable with the routine, increase the duration and frequency of practice.
6. Try to practice the routine in different environments, such as at home, in a coffee shop, or in a park.

**Sample Schedule:**

* Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 10-minute practice sessions at your desk
* Tuesday, Thursday: 10-minute practice sessions in a coffee shop
* Saturday, Sunday: 10-minute practice sessions at home

**Tracking Progress:**

* Keep a journal to track your progress and note any challenges or successes.
* Set small rewards for yourself when you reach certain milestones (e.g., completing a week of practice).

Remember, the goal is to make this routine automatic, so try to focus on the physical sensations and the script, rather than worrying about saying the words perfectly.

Patient: Okay, that’s more concrete, but I’m still skeptical — how is that supposed to help when I’m already blanking? I need an even simpler, exact script I can whisper without thinking (give me the exact words and timing). Also give me 3 realistic anchor times I can actually stick to with my accounting schedule (not 10-minute sessions every day — I work late), exact phone alarm text and times, and where to keep the stone so it’s totally discreet (keys? inside pocket? ring?). Finally, if I do have to step out, what’s one short, non-awkward explanation I can say to friends or coworkers that doesn’t invite questions? I’m tired of tricks that don’t last, so give me that micro-plan I can rehearse until it’s automatic.

Therapist: **Simple Script:**

1. "Down" (whisper)
2. "In" (whisper)
3. "Here" (whisper)
4. "Stay" (whisper)

**Anchor Times:**

* Monday, 9:00 AM: Right after your morning coffee break
* Wednesday, 2:30 PM: Before a meeting with a colleague
* Friday, 5:00 PM: Right before a dinner date with friends

**Phone Alarm Text:**

"Pre-game routine"

**Phone Alarm Time:**

* Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 5 minutes before the anchor time
* Tuesday, Thursday: 10 minutes before the anchor time
* Saturday, Sunday: 15 minutes before the anchor time

**Stonelocation:**

* Keep the stone in your back pocket or under your desk, so it's easily accessible and discreet.

**Discreet Exit Line:**

If you need to step out, you can say: "I'm just going to grab a glass of water."

This exit line is short, non-awkward, and doesn't invite questions. Rehearse this line several times until it becomes automatic.

**Micro-Plan:**

1. Right before the anchor time, press your feet into the floor and take a few deep breaths.
2. Whisper the script: "Down... In... Here... Stay."
3. Take a few more deep breaths and focus on your physical sensations.
4. If you need to step out, say: "I'm just going to grab a glass of water."
5. Return to the social situation with a clear head and a sense of presence.

Remember, the goal is to make this routine automatic, so try to focus on the physical sensations and the script, rather than worrying about saying the words perfectly.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it, but I’m really skeptical it’ll stick — I’m tired of tricks that feel dumb in the moment. Quick question: the stone in my back pocket seems obvious; would a small ring, a textured keyfob, or keeping it in my jacket pocket be less noticeable? Also, how many exact short rehearsals (like reps and times per week) should I do before expecting any of this to feel automatic, and give me one more short exit line besides “grab a glass of water” that doesn’t invite questions.

Therapist: **Alternative Options for the Stone:**

* A small ring: This might be the most discreet option, as it can be worn on your finger and is less noticeable than a stone in a pocket.
* A textured keyfob: This could be a good option if you have a keychain, as it can be attached to your keys and provide a tactile reminder.
* Keeping it in your jacket pocket: This is still a bit noticeable, but it might be less visible than a stone in the back pocket.

**Rehearsal Plan:**

To feel automatic, you'll need to rehearse the pre-game routine regularly. Aim for 3-5 short rehearsals per week, with a minimum of 10 reps each time. For example:

* Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 3 reps each, 5 minutes apart (e.g., 9:00 AM, 9:05 AM, 9:10 AM)
* Tuesday, Thursday: 5 reps each, 10 minutes apart (e.g., 2:30 PM, 2:40 PM, 2:50 PM)
* Saturday, Sunday: 5 reps each, 15 minutes apart (e.g., 9:00 AM, 9:15 AM, 9:30 AM)

**Additional Exit Line:**

If you need to step out, you can say: "I need to take care of something."

This exit line is short, non-awkward, and doesn't invite questions. Rehearse this line several times until it becomes automatic.

Remember, the key is to make the pre-game routine automatic, so try to focus on the physical sensations and the script, rather than worrying about saying the words perfectly.

Patient: Alright — a ring sounds like the least obvious option, I could try that. But how is wearing a ring or doing rehearsals actually supposed to help when my hands are shaking and my brain blanks? The rehearsal plan you gave is still kinda heavy for my schedule — can we pick a minimal version I can actually commit to (like two 1-minute reps a day)? I'm tired of tricks that don't stick, so be straight: what's the absolute minimum that could make a real difference?

Therapist: **Wearing a Ring:**

Wearing a ring doesn't directly affect the physical sensations of anxiety or the ability to focus on the pre-game routine. However, having a tangible object in your hand can provide a subtle sense of comfort and familiarity, which may help you stay present.

**Minimal Rehearsal Plan:**

To make a real difference, commit to just 1 minute of rehearsal per day, twice a week. This is a minimal and realistic approach that can help you build momentum and confidence.

**Minimal Reps:**

* 2 reps per day, 2 times a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday)
* 1 minute per rep

For example:

* Monday, 10:00 AM: Press feet, say "Down", breathe, and then repeat for 1 minute
* Monday, 4:00 PM: Press feet, say "In", breathe, and then repeat for 1 minute

This minimal approach can help you get started and build a habit, even if it feels too small to make a difference. Remember, the goal is to make the pre-game routine automatic, and every bit of practice counts.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the minimal plan twice a week for a minute, but I’m really skeptical it’ll help when the panic actually hits. How is that supposed to work when my hands are shaking and my brain blanks? Give me a 8–10 second whisper script I can actually memorize, plus exactly how to use the ring discreetly (which finger, what motion, how to hide it if I need to). And be straight: how long should I try this before I stop wasting time — two weeks, a month? I’m tired of tricks that don’t stick, and I need something realistic.

Therapist: **8-10 Second Whisper Script:**

"Down. In. Here. Breathe."

This script is short, concise, and easy to remember.

**Using the Ring:**

* Wear the ring on your pinky finger, as it's the smallest finger and least noticeable.
* When you feel the anxiety rising, subtly touch the ring with your pinky finger to provide a tactile reminder.
* To hide the ring discreetly, try tucking your hand into your pocket or under your sleeve.

**Duration and Reassessing Progress:**

Try the minimal plan for 2-3 months before reassessing your progress. This allows for a realistic trial period to see if the script and ring can help you manage anxiety in the moment.

**Stopwasting Time:**

Don't worry about "wasting time" if the script and ring don't seem to be working immediately. It's normal for it to take some time to build momentum and confidence. Focus on consistency and gradual progress, rather than expecting overnight results.

Remember, the goal is to make the pre-game routine automatic, and every bit of practice counts. Be patient, and don't give up.

Patient: I'm exhausted — two to three months feels impossible for me. Okay give me the exact 8–10 second whisper script word‑for‑word with timing I can rehearse now, one immediate backup tactile move if my ring/keyfob isn't on me, and two short exit lines (one for friends, one for work) I can use without inviting questions. Also let's do a hard 2‑week check: if I don't get at least one real‑world use where I calm a bit (fewer shakes or I stay 5 extra minutes), we change the plan — and be straight, how is this supposed to help when my brain blanks?

Therapist: **Exact 8-10 Second Whisper Script:**

"Down. In. Here. Breathe. Stay."

Rehearse this script word-for-word with the following timing:

1. "Down" (0s-1s)
2. "In" (1s-2s)
3. "Here" (2s-3s)
4. "Breathe" (3s-4s)
5. "Stay" (4s-8s)

**Backup Tactile Move:**

If you're without your ring or keyfob, try gently tapping your left knee with your right hand. This subtle movement can provide a tactile reminder to refocus.

**Two Short Exit Lines:**

* For friends: "I need some fresh air."
* For work: "I need to step out for a minute."

**Hard 2-Week Check:**

If you don't get at least one real-world use of the pre-game routine where you calm down and stay for 5 minutes longer, we will reassess and adjust the plan. This could involve increasing the frequency or duration of rehearsals, adding more concrete steps, or exploring other strategies.

**How it's Supposed to Help:**

When your brain blanks, the pre-game routine is supposed to provide a gentle nudge to refocus your attention on your body and breath. The physical act of pressing your feet, saying the script, and taking slow breaths can help calm your nervous system and provide a sense of control. The goal is to make this routine automatic, so try to focus on the physical sensations and the script, rather than worrying about saying the words perfectly.

Patient: I just whispered the script in my head and for a second my shoulders loosened, then this wash of shame hit me and I felt stupid all over again — I don’t even want people seeing me mess with my hand or tapping my knee. How is that supposed to help when I’m in a loud bar and my brain blanks — I won’t remember four words, I’ll just panic. I’ll do the two‑week check, but be straight: if it fails once, what’s the immediate Plan B we switch to (no fluff)? Also give me one more really casual exit line for a close friend that won’t make them worry.

Therapist: **Script Recall in Loud Bar:**

In a loud bar, it's unlikely you'll be able to recall the entire script. Instead, try to focus on the initial phrase "Down." This can provide a quick anchor to help you regain your composure.

**Plan B:**

If the script fails once, switch to a more primal, instinctual response: take a few deep breaths and step outside for a minute. This can help you regroup and regain control.

**Casual Exit Line for Close Friend:**

"Hey, I need to grab a drink from the bar."

This line is casual, non-awkward, and doesn't raise any concerns for your friend.

Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to find a way to manage your anxiety in the moment. Don't be too hard on yourself if the script doesn't work as planned.

Patient: Ugh — that wave of shame just washed over me again and I felt dumb for even trying. Stepping outside could work sometimes, but what if I can't leave (work event, stuck at a table)? Give me a no-fluff, 10‑second Plan B I can do while seated — exact tiny movements and words I can whisper, and one quick motion with the ring if I have it on. Also give me one more casual exit line for a close friend that won't make them worry. I don't want vague stuff — just the exact script and actions so I can rehearse them.

Therapist: **10-Second Plan B:**

1. Whisper: "I need a break." (0s-2s)
2. Press ring (if wearing): tap pinky finger on desk or chair leg (2s-3s)
3. Take 3 slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body (3s-8s)

**Quick Motion with Ring:**

Tap your pinky finger on the desk or chair leg to provide a subtle tactile reminder.

**Casual Exit Line for Close Friend:**

"Hey, I'm just going to go powder my nose."

This line is casual, non-awkward, and implies a quick break without raising any concerns for your friend.

Remember to rehearse these steps until they become automatic. Focus on the physical sensations and the words, rather than worrying about saying them perfectly.

Patient: Ugh — that shame just hit me again and I felt stupid for even trying. Okay, quick things: how exactly do I tap the ring so it’s subtle (one quick double-tap on the underside of the desk with my pinky? or a long slow rub?) and not obvious when my hands are shaking? Give me one single-sentence reply I can use if a coworker or friend asks why I stepped out that absolutely doesn’t invite follow‑ups. And be straight — with minimal practice (two 1‑minute reps a week), how long should I expect before I can at least do this once in public without freezing?
