Patient: Lately I'm stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little mistake feels like proof I'm failing, and it ties back to a history of difficult relationships and the loss I went through. I'm a data scientist and the burnout at work just makes everything feel impossible to focus on. But honestly, how is talking about this supposed to help? I've tried stuff like this before and it didn't work.

Therapist: Can you think of one recent situation where you felt like you were failing, but you didn't let it define you? What happened when you allowed yourself to acknowledge that feeling, without judgment, and instead focus on what you could learn from the experience?

Patient: Yeah — like last week I pushed a change to a model that ended up skewing a client dashboard, and my first thought was “I’m useless, I’ll never get this right.” Instead of spiraling, I admitted to myself I was pissed and tired, told my teammate what happened, and we rolled back and fixed it together. I tried to note what led to the mistake (rushed testing, not asking for help sooner) and made a tiny plan to add one more checkpoint next time. But, honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? It felt okay in the moment, but the self-criticism still sneaks back in the next day.

Therapist: What's one small, specific action you could commit to taking this week to improve your workflow and reduce the likelihood of similar mistakes in the future?

Patient: Okay — I’ll commit to a concrete, tiny change: before any model change goes live this week I’ll run a short smoke-test checklist and get a 15–30 minute peer review, and I’ll block time on my calendar to do that at least twice. I’ll try it, but honestly it feels like extra overhead — how is that supposed to help with the self-criticism when things still go wrong? I’ll still do it, though, and we can see if it actually reduces the screw-ups and the fallout that triggers the spiral.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if you were to accept that it's okay to make mistakes, and that the act of taking that 15-30 minute smoke-test, even if it feels like "extra overhead," is an act of care and a commitment to doing your best, rather than a guarantee against failure?

Patient: If I actually accepted that making mistakes is okay, it'd feel like permission to be human — like the constant knot of shame might loosen a bit. Framing the smoke-test as an act of care would make it feel less like busywork and more like protecting myself from spirals, turning mistakes into data instead of proof I'm worthless. But I'm still skeptical — how is being kinder to myself supposed to shut up that inner critic that keeps yelling I'm useless? Honestly, I'm tired of trying things that sound nice on paper and then don't change the voice in my head, so I'm bracing for that to happen again even as I try the checklist.

Therapist: What would it be like if you were to observe the inner critic as you normally would a stranger in a public place - without judgment, without trying to silence it, but rather with curiosity - and see if that changes the way it speaks to you?

Patient: I guess it would be like watching someone across a cafe mutter the same ugly lines — noticing the tone, the exact words it uses, and when it shows up (usually tired or after something goes wrong). Maybe that distance would make it feel less like me and more like data I can study, but honestly how is that supposed to help? I've tried watching my thoughts before and it just quiets for a minute and then gets louder; I'm willing to try noticing it, but I'm bracing for it to feel useless unless we do something practical with what I notice.

Therapist: Can you think of a small value-based action that you've been wanting to take or explore in your work, and that feels meaningful to you, that would be a potential outcome of noticing the critic and accepting it for what it is, without necessarily trying to change it?

Patient: Maybe I try something small and value-driven: at the next team meeting I’ll take 5–10 minutes to share the dashboard incident as a “lessons learned” — focus on what went wrong, what we changed, and one concrete step I’ll take to prevent it. It feels aligned with being honest and helping others learn instead of hiding mistakes, but honestly how is that supposed to help my inner critic? I’m willing to do it, though — partly to see if making mistakes useful to others makes them feel less like proof I’m worthless.

Therapist: What would it be like for the critic to hear you share the story in a way that focuses on the lesson learned, and not on its perceived failure, and how might that affect its tone or the way it speaks to you?

Patient: Maybe it would throw the critic off — hearing me calmly lay out the mistake and the fix might make it sound less like a judge and more like a nitpicky bystander. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? My critic usually ignores logic and comes back louder later, so I'll try sharing it at the meeting, but I'm bracing for that to feel temporary unless we do something different with how I respond.

Therapist: Can you think of a small, everyday moment where you're already responding to the critic in a way that's not as self-critical, such as by labeling the thought as "Ah, I'm noticing myself getting a bit critical again" or "My mind is jumping to conclusions," and then taking a few deep breaths or stepping back - what would be the benefits of continuing that pattern?

Patient: Usually it’s when I get a terse Slack about a bug — I notice the immediate “I’m an idiot” thought, tell myself “okay, I’m getting critical,” take a couple deep breaths, and step away for five minutes. Doing that cools me down enough to fix the issue, not snap at a teammate, and sleep a bit better that night. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? It helps in the moment, but the critic still comes back later and I’m tired of these little bandaids.

Therapist: What do you think might be driving the critic's persistence, and what might be the underlying values or needs that it's trying to meet, such as feeling in control or feeling seen, and how might addressing those needs in a more direct way lead to a longer-term reduction in self-criticism?

Patient: I think the critic’s persistence comes from fear — fear of being judged, abandoned, or exposed as incompetent — and from a need for control after the loss and messy relationships I’ve had. It’s like it preempts rejection by attacking me first so I don’t have to feel surprised or helpless later. If I address those needs more directly — build predictable systems at work, ask for regular feedback so I feel seen, and actually sit with my grief instead of bottling it — there might be less uncertainty and shame for the critic to latch onto. But honestly, how is that supposed to shut it up? I’m skeptical, though I can try treating these as small experiments and see if the critic quiets over time.

Therapist: Can you think of a small, concrete action you could take this week to build predictability and a sense of control at work, such as implementing a regular feedback loop with a trusted colleague or colleague, and how might that affect the critic's tone or frequency?

Patient: Alright — concrete plan: I’ll set up a recurring 30‑minute midweek check‑in with one trusted teammate (Sam) where I run planned changes, recent pushes, and one quick smoke‑test together; I’ll email a two‑point agenda beforehand so it stays short and focused. That regular feedback should make things more predictable, catch mistakes earlier, and give me external data so the critic has less uncertainty to feed on — maybe it’ll lower the frequency or intensity of the attacks. But honestly, how is that supposed to quiet the inner voice long-term when it keeps ignoring evidence? I’ll try it anyway, though I’m bracing for it to feel like a temporary fix unless we also tackle the critic itself.

Therapist: Can you think of a small, concrete way to cultivate self-compassion towards yourself, perhaps during or after the weekly check-ins with Sam, such as writing down three things you appreciate about yourself or taking a few deep breaths before sharing your experience, and how might that affect your relationship with the critic over time?

Patient: Okay — small concrete thing: after the midweek check‑in with Sam I’ll spend two minutes doing a breathing reset and write down three specific things I appreciate about myself that week (one skill I used, one effort I made, one way I showed up for someone). Doing that might slowly build a counter‑story to the critic — little evidence that I’m competent and cared for, so its attacks have less purchase. But honestly, how is that supposed to shut it up for good? I’m tired of quick fixes, so I’ll try this and see if it helps more than the last few things I’ve done.

Therapist: What would it be like if, over the course of several weeks, you continued to practice self-compassion and notice that the critic's voice is becoming less frequent, less intense, or less influential in your thoughts and feelings, and how might that affect your sense of identity and confidence over time?

Patient: If that actually happened, I think I'd feel a lot lighter — less defensive, more willing to try risky stuff at work, and less paralysed by the fear of being exposed. Over time I could start to see myself as someone who learns from mistakes instead of being defined by them, and that would probably nudge my confidence and identity in a quieter, steadier direction. But honestly, I'm skeptical — I've seen small wins fade before, so what do we do when the critic inevitably comes back?

Therapist: Can you think of a small, everyday moment where you notice the critic coming in, but instead of trying to push it away or silence it, you could observe it as a natural part of your experience, perhaps even noticing that it's a signal that you're feeling stressed or uncertain, and take a few deep breaths, and then gently return to your values-driven work?

Patient: Usually it's when I get a terse Slack or a blunt code review — my immediate thought is “I’m an idiot,” and I can feel the critic tightening my chest. I can try naming it (“okay, that’s the critic”), take three slow breaths, step away for two minutes, then come back and focus on the checklist or the values behind the change instead of the panic. It helps me not snap or make worse mistakes in the moment, but honestly — how is that supposed to stop it from coming back later? I'm getting tired of these little fixes.

Therapist: What would it be like if, instead of trying to manage the critic with your usual strategies, you were to simply observe it as a natural part of your experience, without judgment or attachment - simply noticing it arises, and then gently returning to your values-driven work, without trying to stop it or silence it, and how might that affect your relationship with the critic over time?

Patient: If I just noticed it — like seeing a storm roll in instead of jumping into the mud with it — it might stop feeling like a personal attack and more like a signal that I’m stressed or overwhelmed, so I could step back and do the task that actually matters. That might slowly weaken its power because I wouldn’t be feeding it with frantic attempts to fix or prove myself, but honestly how is that supposed to help when the critic ignores logic? I’m tired of short-term fixes, so I’ll try noticing it as a signal and returning to my values — but what do we do when it predictably gets louder anyway?

Therapist: Can you think of a situation where you've already acted in alignment with your values, despite the critic being loud or critical, and how did that feel - was it uncomfortable, but also empowering, and how might continuing to act in that way, even when the critic is loud, affect your sense of identity and confidence over time?

Patient: Yeah — like at that post‑mortem after the dashboard mess, the critic in my head was basically yelling “you screwed up,” but I still stood up and walked through what went wrong and what we changed. It felt really uncomfortable — my heart was racing and I kept tripping over words — but afterward I felt oddly proud and relieved, like I hadn’t hidden and the team actually benefited. Doing that more often could slowly shift how I see myself — from someone who hides mistakes to someone who learns and helps others learn — which might blunt the critic’s power. But I’m suddenly really anxious and distracted right now, and honestly… how is repeating that supposed to shut the critic up for good? I want to try, but I’m bracing for it to feel temporary unless we do something different.

Therapist: What would it be like if, over time, your values-based actions and the way you tell yourself about yourself became the dominant narrative - that you're a capable, competent, and valued person who makes a positive impact, rather than someone who's constantly being criticized - and how might that affect your sense of identity and confidence, and could that potentially quiet the critic for good?

Patient: Maybe it could — if I keep doing those values-based actions and actually update my internal story, those examples might add up and make the critic less believable. I can imagine feeling steadier, more willing to take risks, and more like someone who learns instead of hides. But honestly, how is that supposed to make the critic stop forever? I'm feeling jittery and distracted right now, so I want concrete, practical steps for when it inevitably comes roaring back.

Therapist: What would it be like if, when the critic starts to rise up, you were to say to yourself "Ah, I've been here before" and recall times when you've successfully navigated similar situations, and how might that help you regain your footing and stay focused on your values-based actions?

Patient: I think saying “Ah, I’ve been here before” could actually steady me — it points to specific times I survived the spike (the rollback, the post‑mortem) and reminds me panic isn’t proof I’m broken. I’m pretty jittery and scattered right now, though, so I’m skeptical that remembering wins will stick when the critic gets loud — how is that supposed to help long‑term? Can we come up with a tiny, concrete script or step I can use in the moment so I don’t just freeze?

Therapist: What would it be like if, when the critic starts to rise up, you were to say to yourself "Ah, I've been here before" and then add "I've got this" - a simple, compassionate phrase that acknowledges your uncertainty, but also affirms your ability to handle it, and how might that help you stay focused on your values-based actions and reduce the critic's influence?

Patient: Saying “Ah, I’ve been here before — I’ve got this” could actually help — it names the pattern and reminds me I’ve survived it, which might lower the panic enough to act instead of freeze. Right now I’m really jittery and distracted, so I’m skeptical it’ll stick when the critic gets loud — how is a phrase supposed to change my body? Maybe a tiny in‑the‑moment script would help: “Okay — I’ve been here before. I’ve got this. Breathe 4 counts. Do the next 2‑minute task,” and I can put that on a sticky note by my keyboard. I’ll try it, but I’m bracing for it to feel temporary unless we make it more concrete or practice it somehow.

Therapist: What would it be like if, over the course of the next week, you practiced the script "Okay — I've been here before. I've got this. Breathe 4 counts. Do the next 2-minute task" several times a day, without judgment or expectation, and noticed how your body and mind responded to it, and could that lead to a more lasting shift in your relationship with the critic?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it: I’ll put a sticky note by my keyboard, set two phone reminders (mid‑morning and mid‑afternoon), and run the script a few times when I notice the chest tighten. I can see it calming me enough to do the next small task, but I’m jittery and honestly skeptical this will rewire the critic — how is repeating a phrase supposed to change the body and the habit long‑term? Can we make a tiny accountability plan (I’ll check in midweek or log a quick note after I use it) and pair it with a concrete breathing practice so it’s not just words?

Therapist: What would it be like if, over the course of the next few weeks, you continued to practice the script and breathing practice, and also scheduled regular check-ins with yourself to reflect on your progress and challenges, and how might that lead to a more lasting shift in your relationship with the critic, and could that be enough to help you feel more confident and in control?

Patient: Maybe — I can see how the script + breathing + regular reflection could slowly chip away at the critic, make me more steady. Right now I’m jittery and distracted, though, so I’m skeptical it’ll stick without structure: can we make a tiny accountability plan? I’d try: sticky note + two daily reminders, a one‑sentence end‑of‑day log when I use the script, and a 15‑minute weekly check‑in (self or with you) to review patterns — that feels practical enough to test. I’m willing to try it, but honestly I’m bracing for the critic to come roaring back, so how do we handle those moments when the script just feels like empty words?

Therapist: What would it be like if, when the script feels like empty words, you were to say to yourself "Ah, I've been here before - I've used this script many times before, and it's helped me in the past. I'm doing the best I can in this moment, and that's enough" - and then gently return to the script, rather than getting frustrated or discouraged, and how might that help you maintain momentum and confidence in the practice?

Patient: If I actually used that line when the script felt empty, I think it could soften the frustration enough to keep me from abandoning the practice — it reminds me I've done this before and that I'm allowed to be imperfect in the moment. Right now I'm jittery and distracted, so I’m skeptical it’ll stick when the critic's yelling, but having that gentler reminder could help me slide back into the concrete steps instead of spiraling. Can we brainstorm a quick fallback for when the phrase feels hollow — like a tiny physical anchor (5 breaths, stand up and stretch) or someone to ping — and maybe practice one now so it feels less like empty words?

Therapist: Let's brainstorm some potential physical anchors together. What are some physical sensations or actions that you can do when you feel like the phrase is hollow, such as taking a few deep breaths, stretching, or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground? For example, you could try "5 deep breaths in, 5 deep breaths out, and notice the sensation of my feet on the chair" or "Stand up, stretch my arms over my head, and take a moment to notice the space around me". Let's practice one of these anchors now and see how it feels.

Patient: Alright—some anchors that might work for me: 5 slow breaths (in 4, out 6), notice feet flat on the floor and the chair under me, press my palms together and feel the pressure, stand up and stretch my arms overhead, or do a quick 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.). I’ll try the breath + feet one now: doing 5 slow breaths and really feeling my feet on the floor...okay, my chest’s still tight and I’m jittery, but it’s a little calmer — not magic, though. How is that supposed to help when the critic’s yelling full force? Can we try one more anchor together so I can see which sticks?

Therapist: Let's try a different anchor together. What if, when the critic starts yelling, you were to notice that your body is responding with tension and your mind is racing, and instead of trying to silence the critic, you were to say to yourself "Ah, my body is telling me that I need some support" and then use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique? This might help you focus on the present moment and take care of yourself, rather than getting caught up in the critic's narrative. Can you try it with me?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it now: “Ah, my body is telling me that I need some support.” Five things I see: my monitor, a sticky note, a coffee mug, the window, my keyboard. Four I feel: feet on the floor, chair under me, tension in my shoulders, my phone buzzing in my pocket. Three I hear: humming AC, distant typing, my own breathing. Two I smell: coffee and hand‑soap. One I taste: stale gum. 

My chest is a bit less tight and I’m marginally calmer, but I’m still really jittery and my mind keeps jumping — honestly, how is this supposed to help when the critic is full‑on? Can we try a shorter, faster anchor I can use in meetings, or a backup when this feels hollow?

Therapist: Let's try a shorter, faster anchor. What if, when you feel the critic rising up, you were to use a simple phrase like "Notice, breathe, respond" - noticing your thoughts, taking a few deep breaths, and then responding to the task at hand? Alternatively, we could try a backup anchor like "Calm, check, create" - calming yourself, checking in with your values, and creating a plan to move forward. Which one of these anchors resonates with you, or do you have a different idea for a backup anchor?

Patient: “Notice, breathe, respond” feels more realistic for meetings — short and not cheesy. Right now I’m really jittery and my heart’s racing, so I’m skeptical it’ll work when I’m panicking, but I’ll try pairing it with a quick tactile anchor (press thumb and forefinger together) so it’s something physical I can do without looking stupid. Wanna try it with me now so I can see how it lands?

Therapist: Let's try it together. As we're in this conversation, I'll say "Notice, breathe, respond" and you can press your thumb and forefinger together as you hear me. Go with the flow and see how it feels. Don't worry about how it looks, just focus on the sensation of your thumb and forefinger touching. When you feel yourself starting to get anxious or panicky, just bring your attention back to the phrase and the physical sensation of your thumb and forefinger together. How does it feel?

Patient: Okay — pressing my thumb and forefinger together and saying “Notice, breathe, respond” did ground me a little; my chest loosened for a few seconds and I could focus on the next breath. But I’m still really jittery and my mind keeps jumping — it feels helpful in the moment, not magic. How am I supposed to remember and actually do that in a heated meeting when the critic’s roaring? Can we practice an even subtler version I can use on calls or when I’m mid‑panic?

Therapist: Let's try a subtler version. What if, instead of saying "Notice, breathe, respond", you simply said "Breathe" - just a single word - and then pressed your thumb and forefinger together? This is a very small and simple anchor that might help you remember to take a deep breath and calm down, even in the midst of chaos. Can you try it?

Patient: Okay — I tried it: pressed my thumb and forefinger and whispered “Breathe.” It eased my chest for a few seconds but I’m still really jittery and my mind keeps flitting away. How is a tiny gesture supposed to work in the middle of a heated meeting when my heart’s already pounding? Maybe we need a concrete hookup — like pairing the word with hitting the Zoom mute button or a subtle watch vibration, and rehearsing it a few times now so it becomes automatic; can we try practicing that?
