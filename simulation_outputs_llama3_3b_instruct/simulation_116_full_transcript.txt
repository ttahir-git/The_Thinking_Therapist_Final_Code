--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my mid-fifties, a data scientist, and what’s been occupying me is how I keep getting disproportionately angry and frustrated in interactions tied to a recent breakup. I can diagram the dynamics—attachment patterns, PTSD-triggered hyperarousal, maladaptive coping strategies—and speak about them at length, but that analysis feels like a buffer that doesn’t actually stop the outbursts. I want to understand why cognitive insight isn’t translating into emotional regulation and what concrete steps might change that.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses a sense of frustration and anger, which seems to be deeply rooted in the recent breakup. Core emotion is intense anger. 

Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of these emotions to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you've been doing some great work analyzing the dynamics around your breakup and the emotional triggers. Can you tell me more about what happens right before an angry outburst? Is there a specific thought or sensation that seems to precede it, like a physical feeling or a mental narrative that starts to build up?

Patient: Right before an outburst there’s usually a physiological spike — chest tightness, jaw clenching, a heat behind my eyes and suddenly shallow breathing — and my hands often go cold. Almost simultaneously a familiar narrative materializes: “They betrayed me, I’m insignificant, this proves I’m unlovable,” which feels less like a thought and more like an automatic appraisal that legitimizes the anger. I can label the cascade — amygdala-driven hyperarousal, maladaptive cognitive appraisal, heightened allostatic load — but saying that out loud doesn’t seem to stop the cascade once it’s underway.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a clear physiological and narrative escalation process preceding the outburst, indicating a potential disconnect between cognitive insight and emotional regulation. 

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, and create space from the sticky thought.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're aware of the process, but the automatic appraisal feels quite powerful. I want to gently challenge the idea that this narrative is the only way to experience these emotions. Would you be willing to experiment with the thought "I'm experiencing these feelings right now, and that's okay" while still acknowledging the narrative that comes up? This might help create some space between the narrative and the emotions.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that—"I'm experiencing these feelings right now, and that's okay." The problem is, saying it immediately activates my analytic reflex: I start classifying it as 'a PTSD-triggered appraisal' and that commentary functions like a buffer, maintaining distance rather than acceptance. Physically the chest tightness and jaw clench are still there, and I end up observing rather than inhabiting the feeling, so I don't know how to move from the verbal affirmation to actually allowing the sensation. Can you coach me through staying with the sensation instead of turning it into another theory?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient recognizes the activation of their analytic reflex as a barrier to genuine emotional acceptance. Goal: Create space from the sticky thought and introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to bring the focus back to the physical sensation. I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your gaze to soften and your body to relax. Imagine a warm, gentle light filling your chest, starting at the center and spreading outwards, releasing any tension. Can you simply observe the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: I did the breath. There's a slight loosening in my shoulders but the chest tightness and jaw clench are still pretty stuck, and my hands feel cold. The moment I try to hold the light image my mind auto-categorizes it—'symbolic reappraisal, limbic recalibration'—and I slip straight back into commentary instead of actually feeling. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by that split between doing and experiencing; can you give me one very simple, concrete cue to anchor to right now so I don't start analyzing again?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient struggles to stay with the physical sensation, getting caught up in their mental commentary again. Goal: Introduce a concrete cue to help anchor them in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use a simple, non-judgmental phrase to help you refocus. Whenever you feel the urge to analyze or comment, take a moment to repeat to yourself: "Just this feeling." Say it softly, without thinking or analyzing it, just acknowledging its presence in your body. This can help create a small buffer between your thoughts and your emotional experience.

Patient: I tried repeating "Just this feeling" a few times — it opened a small gap from the commentary but my brain immediately re-labeled the phrase as another cognitive strategy. The chest tightness and jaw clench are still loud and my hands are cold, and I'm getting frustrated (which I know sounds like another layer of analysis, but it's also real). Could you give one very specific micro-step I can do right now — like press fingertips together and breathe 4-4-4, or guide me through one slow exhale with you? Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the gap between their commentary and the physical sensation, and feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a concrete, slow-paced, and gentle ACT exercise to help them anchor in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a slow, deep breath in together. As you exhale, guide me through a gentle exhale. I'll count it out loud: "Inhale... hold... exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4..." as you slowly let your body release any remaining tension. As you exhale, bring your fingertips together, gently pressing them together, and keep your eyes soft.

Patient: Okay—I pressed my fingertips and did the slow exhale with you. For a second my jaw unclenched and my shoulders loosened; there was a brief somatic downshift, but the chest tightness remained and my hands are still cold. Almost immediately my mind labeled that relief as a “temporary autonomic recalibration,” which pulled me back into commentary and now I’m feeling frustrated and a bit overwhelmed by the split. Can we slow it down even more—one very slow exhale together and then a quiet 10-second pause where you just count silently so I can try to notice the faintest thing that’s left without narrating it?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient struggles to maintain the somatic shift, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Create a brief, silent pause to allow for subtle noticing of the remaining sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another slow, deep breath in together... exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 10 seconds) As we pause, I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Just pay attention to the subtlest feeling, the faintest sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it. If you notice something, simply acknowledge it to yourself, without judgment.

Patient: I noticed a very faint warmth at the center of my chest and a brief unclenching in my jaw for a couple of breaths, but my hands stayed cold and there’s still a low, persistent tightness behind my sternum. Predictably, my mind immediately re-labeled it as “transient parasympathetic engagement,” which yanks me back into commentary so I’m sort of half-observing and half-not-present. Okay, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by that split—can we slow down? Could you hold a silent 20-second pause while I rest a hand on my chest so I can try to stay with that small warmth without naming it?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the subtle shift, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Create a longer, silent pause to allow for deeper noticing of the remaining sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another slow, deep breath in together... exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... (pause for 20 seconds) Place your hand on your chest and focus on the sensation of your hand touching your skin, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your body sitting in space. Just notice these sensations, without trying to change them or analyze them. Stay with the small warmth at the center of your chest, and see if you can expand your awareness to include the rest of your body, without judgment.

Patient: With my hand on my chest I can feel that faint warmth again, a slight loosening in the jaw and shoulders, but my hands are still cold and there's a tiny tremor under the ribs. Predictably my brain slapped a label on it—"brief vagal engagement"—and that immediately pulls me back into commentary, which is irritating. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by that split; can we just sit quietly for 30 seconds with me keeping my hand there so I can try to stay with the warmth without narrating?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the subtle shift, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Create an extended period of quiet sitting to allow for deeper noticing of the remaining sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a few more deep breaths together, and then I'll let you sit quietly for 30 seconds, keeping your hand on your chest. As you sit, I'll just be here with you, in silence. When you're ready, we can come back to noticing and exploring. Just rest in the present moment, and see if you can stay with the sensation of the warmth at the center of your chest, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to sit with it. The silence is oddly calming and also uncanny; my mind keeps converting the small warmth into “brief parasympathetic modulation,” which pulls me back into commentary and makes me frustrated. I’m keeping my hand on my chest and trying to notice without naming, but I’m struggling—could you stay quiet a little longer while I lean into it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the subtle shift, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Continue the silence to allow for deeper noticing of the remaining sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's just sit here in silence for another 10-15 seconds, allowing you to lean into the sensation of the warmth and the calmness of the present moment. I'll stay quiet, and you can focus on noticing the sensations in your body, without trying to change or analyze them.

Patient: I did the quiet and felt that faint warmth and a small jaw release, but my mind immediately slapped a clinical label on it—“transient vagal engagement”—and that pulled me back into commentary, which is frustrating and makes me feel a bit overwhelmed. Can we slow down? I need one single, concrete micro-skill I can use in a real interaction with my ex (something like “press thumb and forefinger, breathe out to 4, say ‘just this feeling’”) because long techniques collapse into analysis for me. Could we try a brief role-play where you cue me as if you’re the ex and I practice that one micro-response?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble translating the insight into real-life application, and feeling frustrated with the tendency to fall back into commentary. Goal: Introduce a concrete, actionable micro-skill for real-life interactions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a simple micro-skill together. I'll be your ex, and you can practice responding with a one-word phrase when you feel the urge to analyze or comment. Your cue is: "just this feeling." As you respond, I'll respond as your ex, and we can practice this in a low-stakes way. When I say something that triggers a reaction, you can respond with "just this feeling," and I'll respond back.

Patient: Okay — I’m ready. Say the trigger line as my ex, and when I feel the surge I’ll respond with, “Just this feeling.” I’m a little nervous it’ll slip into analysis, but I’ll try.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is ready to practice the micro-skill in a role-play. Goal: Introduce the micro-skill and practice it in a low-stakes way.

Therapist Answer:
"Hey, I'm glad we're having a good conversation. I'm starting to feel a little anxious, and I think it's because we're not seeing eye-to-eye on this. Can I just say something that's been bothering me?"

(Pause for a moment)

Now it's your turn. When you feel the surge, respond with "Just this feeling."

Patient: Just this feeling.

Okay — I said it. For a second the chest loosened, jaw unclenched, but my brain immediately slapped a clinical tag on it ("cognitive distancing") and I started narrating again instead of staying with the warmth; my hands are still cold and there's that thought loop: "They think I'm overreacting." Can we run it again but this time have me press thumb and forefinger, exhale to four, say "Just this feeling," and then you pause for five seconds so I can try to stay with the sensation without explaining it?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient struggles to maintain the micro-skill, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Introduce the additional micro-skill to help with staying present with the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
"Hey, I'm glad we're having a good conversation. I'm starting to feel a little anxious, and I think it's because we're not seeing eye-to-eye on this. *presses thumb and forefinger together* Take a deep breath in... 1... 2... 3... 4... *exhales* Just this feeling."

(Pause for 5 seconds)

(Note: I'll pause for 5 seconds, allowing you to stay with the sensation without trying to explain it.)

Patient: I pressed my thumb and forefinger, exhaled to four, and said “Just this feeling.” For a beat my jaw unclenched and there was a faint loosening in my chest, but my hands stayed cold and my mind immediately labeled it as “strategic distancing,” which yanks me back into commentary. I’m frustrated and a little discouraged—part of me wants to keep analyzing the efficacy of the technique instead of just feeling whether it helps. Can we do another run where you give me a more provocative trigger (something like an accusation or a dismissive text) and coach a micro-skill I can use when my hands are cold—one concrete somatic cue that’ll feel doable in the moment?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the micro-skill, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Introduce a more provocative trigger and a new micro-skill to help with staying present with the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
"Look, I'm telling you, you're being really dramatic about this. You're overreacting and it's not fair to me. *pauses* *takes a deep breath in* Press your thumb and forefinger together, breathe out to 4, say 'just this feeling', and then take a moment to notice the sensations in your body without judgment. Let's try this."

Patient: Okay — I pressed my thumb and forefinger, exhaled to four, and said “Just this feeling.” For a beat my jaw unclenched and my chest softened a bit, but my hands stayed cold and my mind immediately relabeled it as “cognitive distancing,” which pulled me back into commentary and left me frustrated and a little overwhelmed. Can you give me one very specific somatic cue just for cold hands (something I can do discreetly in the moment), and then run the accusatory line again while coaching me through it and pausing so I can actually try to stay with the sensation?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the micro-skill, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Introduce a specific somatic cue to help with staying present with the sensation, particularly with cold hands.

Therapist Answer:
"Look, I'm telling you, you're being really dramatic about this. You're overreacting and it's not fair to me. *takes a deep breath in* Press your thumb and forefinger together, breathe out to 4... *pause* 

(Suddenly, I'll drop my voice to a whisper) *touches your hand gently* Can you bring your hand to your belly? Yes, just place your hand on your belly, and notice how it feels. Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just notice.

Now, let's try saying 'Just this feeling' when you feel the urge to analyze. Are you ready to try it again?"

Patient: Okay—I'm ready. I put my hand on my belly and there's a faint buoyant warmth under my palm as my breath nudges it, but my hands are still cold and my jaw's tensing. "Just this feeling." For a second I actually stayed with it, then my brain immediately labeled it "interoceptive anchoring" and I felt frustrated and a bit overwhelmed—can we hold a quiet 5-second pause now so I can try to stay with it without narrating?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble maintaining the micro-skill, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Continue the pause to allow for deeper noticing of the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
(I hold a quiet, calm tone)

Let's pause for just a moment... *pauses for 5 seconds*

Patient: I did the pause — I felt that faint buoyant warmth under my palm and a tiny jaw release, but my hands are still cold and my mind immediately slapped a clinical label on it which yanked me back into commentary. I'm frustrated and a bit overwhelmed by that oscillation; can we slow way down and run the accusatory line again, coaching me step-by-step (press thumb+forefinger, bring hand to belly, slow exhale to 4, say "Just this feeling") and then hold a quiet 10‑second pause so I can try not to narrate? I'm nervous it'll just become analysis, but I want to try.


--- Turn 16 ---

The patient is having trouble maintaining the pause, getting pulled back into commentary again. Goal: Slow down the process, coach the micro-skill step-by-step, and increase the pause to allow for deeper noticing of the sensation.

*holds a quiet, calm tone for 10 seconds, allowing you to stay with the sensation*

Patient: I did the sequence — thumb+forefinger, slow exhale, hand to belly, “Just this feeling” — and there was a brief warmth and jaw release, but my hands stayed cold and my mind immediately tagged it “interoceptive anchoring,” which yanked me back into commentary. I’m frustrated and discouraged by that oscillation and want to try again with a discreet somatic cue specifically for cold hands (something like pressing my thumb into the fleshy part of my palm or subtly rubbing the base of my thumb). Can we run the accusatory line one more time with you coaching me step‑by‑step and then hold a quiet 15‑second pause afterward so I can try to stay with it without narrating?

Patient: I did the full sequence — thumb+forefinger, base-of-thumb press, hand to belly, slow exhale and “Just this feeling” — and there was a brief warmth and jaw release, but my hands stayed cold and my mind immediately tagged it (“interoceptive anchoring”) which yanked me back into commentary. I’m honestly frustrated and a bit overwhelmed by that oscillation; can we slow down? 

Could we try one more run but add one discreet micro-cue for cold hands that I can use in public — like pressing my tongue to the roof of my mouth or subtly rubbing the pad of my thumb — and have you coach me step‑by‑step, then hold a silent 20‑second pause so I can try to stay with the sensation without narrating? I’m ready to try, though I’m nervous it’ll just become another analytic exercise.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — pressing the pad of my thumb into my palm makes a kind of theoretical sense, but how does that actually resolve the cold hands or the immediate thought-loop that I'm being dismissed? Saying that out loud already flips my analytic reflex on and I get overwhelmed. I'm willing to try the pad-of-thumb as the single public cue, but can we run one slow, step‑by‑step role‑play now with long pauses after each micro‑cue (thumb+forefinger — 20s silence — pad‑of‑thumb — 20s — hand to belly — 30s) and a realistic trigger like a curt text saying "You're overreacting"?

Patient: I felt a repetitive oscillation — little somatic downshifts (jaw unclench, brief warmth at the sternum/belly) that my brain immediately labelled as “vagal engagement” or “interoceptive anchoring,” which yanked me back into commentary. Physically the chest tightness and cold hands persisted, with a faint tremor under my ribs and that tiny buoyant warmth when my hand was on my belly. Mentally the usual appraisals showed up — “they think I’m dramatic,” “I’m unlovable” — plus constant meta‑analysis about whether the technique is actually working, which left me frustrated and a bit frazzled. I want to keep trying, but can we slow way down and stick to the pad‑of‑thumb cue in public with much longer silent pauses so I can practice not narrating?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having trouble breaking the oscillation between sensation and analysis, and is feeling frustrated and frazzled. Goal: Slow down the process, focus on the pad-of-thumb cue, and increase the silence between micro-cues to allow for deeper noticing of the sensation.

Therapist Answer:
"Hey, I'm telling you, you're overreacting. *presses thumb and forefinger together* Take a deep breath in... *holds breath for a moment* 

*pauses for 60 seconds*

*coaches you step-by-step* Press the pad of your thumb into your palm, and notice how that feels. *pauses for 60 seconds*

*coaches you again* Bring your hand to your belly, and notice how it feels. Just notice the sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it. *pauses for 60 seconds*

We'll take a break, and I'll give you some space. *pauses for 120 seconds*

When you're ready, we'll continue. No pressure, just take your time. When you're ready, we'll try it again."

(Note: I'll maintain a calm and gentle tone, and avoid giving any explicit instructions or cues. The goal is to allow you to practice the pad-of-thumb cue in a more relaxed and natural way.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the long silent stretches are both calming and disorienting; my analytic reflex fills them with commentary unless there's a clear, tiny task to anchor me. I'm feeling frazzled and a bit overwhelmed by the oscillation between labeling ("vagal engagement," "interoceptive anchoring") and actually staying with the warmth.

Can we do one slow, very concrete run now with no theory in between? Script: you send a curt text trigger, I press pad-of-thumb, breathe out to four, bring my hand to my belly, say "Just this feeling," and you hold 60 seconds of silence — no explanations, then ask one single question afterward like "What did you notice?" I need you to coach me that way so I can practice not narrating.
