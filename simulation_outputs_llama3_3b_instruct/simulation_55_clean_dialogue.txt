Patient: I'm an elderly data scientist, and lately my mind's been a fortune-telling machine: in any social setting I immediately see a chain of disasters — I'll stumble over words, they'll laugh, someone will cut me off, the friendship will collapse and I'll be left completely ostracized. It feels overwhelming, so I just avoid gatherings with friends and even family because those outcomes feel inevitable to me.

Therapist: Can you describe the immediate moment before a social gathering when you start noticing these thoughts? What's the first thing that goes through your mind, and what visual images or emotions does it evoke for you?

Patient: The first thing is a flash thought: “You’re going to botch this and everyone will notice,” and my brain immediately weaves that into a whole chain — I mess up a sentence, someone laughs, whispers spread, the conversation dies and they all move on without me. Visually it’s a harsh spotlight on my face, mouths forming shapes I can’t catch, a door slowly shutting while my chest tightens and my stomach drops. If someone says it could just go fine, I honestly can’t accept that — it feels like pretending; the disaster feels inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is quite skilled at creating a worst-case scenario. Can you imagine that this same scenario, as vivid as it is, might be just one possible version of what could happen, rather than the only one? What would it be like to experiment with allowing this worst-case scenario to unfold, but without taking it as a prediction of what will happen?

Patient: I can't really picture it as an experiment — if I try to "let it happen," my chest just tightens and the spotlight gets brighter, like I'm watching the proof that I'm right. Letting it unfold doesn't feel neutral; it feels like setting a trap to catch myself failing, and then the whole chain — the laugh, the whisper, the exclusion — plays on repeat. I know you want me to consider other outcomes, but honestly that feels unrealistic; my mind's already written the ending and it's always bad.

Therapist: Can you imagine that your mind is just trying to protect you, even if that protection is based on a catastrophic scenario? Would it be possible to treat your mind's predictions with kindness, rather than trying to stop them outright? What would it be like to approach this with curiosity, rather than resistance?

Patient: I get what you mean, but being 'kind' to those predictions feels like rewarding a liar — like I'm validating the nightmare. When I try curiosity, my chest tightens and the whole humiliation-replay just gets louder, like the experiment is already rigged to prove I'm right. I can try to be curious if you want, but honestly it feels pointless — my brain's already mapped out the collapse and won't let anything else in.

Therapist: It sounds like this narrative has become a vital part of how you're coping with social anxiety. What if, instead of trying to change the narrative or experiment with it, you simply allowed yourself to be willing to experience the anxiety that comes with social interactions, without judgment or attachment to the outcome? What would that feel like for you, and could it be a small, incremental step towards reducing the hold this narrative has on you?

Patient: I can say I’ll be “willing,” but when I try it my chest tightens and the humiliating chain just gets louder — it feels like leaning into a trap, not making progress. Maybe I could practice for a minute, but honestly it seems pointless; my brain’s already convinced of the bad ending. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. Can you simply focus on taking one small, tiny step towards being willing, without any expectation of the outcome? Not a big step, just a tiny one – like taking a single breath, or making a tiny decision to be present in this moment. What happens if you allow yourself to be present with the anxiety, without judgment, for just that tiny step?

Patient: I tried taking that one tiny breath just now, but the moment I focus my chest tightens and the fortune-telling machine in my head just revs up — the breath feels like proof the collapse is coming. Being present doesn't feel neutral; it feels like I'm shining a microscope on my failure and I can't stop seeing the laughing faces and the door closing. I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck with this, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment and take a deep breath together. I want you to acknowledge the thought, just as it is – without judgment or trying to change it. Can you say the thought out loud, exactly as it is: "I'm going to botch this and everyone will notice"? Just say it, without adding any interpretation or evaluation?

Patient: "I'm going to botch this and everyone will notice."

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body right now, as you've said the thought out loud. Are there any sensations in your chest, any physical tightness or relaxation? Are there any other physical sensations, like tension in your shoulders or a feeling of heaviness in your legs?

Patient: My chest feels like it's being squeezed, breathing gets shallow and fast, and my throat tightens so talking feels clogged. My shoulders hitch up, my stomach knots, and my legs go a bit weak and heavy like I might freeze or bolt. Noticing it just makes the whole disaster story louder — it feels like proof I'm right, and I'm getting overwhelmed, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause and take a moment to observe the physical sensations in your body without judgment. I want you to focus on the sensations in your body, without trying to change them or interpret their meaning. Can you simply acknowledge the sensations, one by one, without trying to push them away or add any thoughts to them? For example, "My chest feels squeezed" – just that. Can you start with just one sensation, and see if we can build from there?

Patient: My chest feels squeezed, like a tight band around my ribs. Noticing it makes that whole disaster-reel in my head crank up louder, and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is trying to tell you something. What if, instead of trying to change the thought or the physical sensations, you simply allowed the sensations to be what they are – just present, without judgment or interpretation? Can you try to observe the sensations as they arise, without trying to do anything with them, just as they are? For example, "The sensation in my chest is squeezing" – just that. No interpretation, no judgment, no trying to change it. Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: "The sensation in my chest is squeezing." But the moment I name it, the fortune-telling machine revs up and the tightness just grows, my thoughts rushing straight into the whole humiliating scene again. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can we try using a more neutral phrase to describe the sensation? Instead of saying "the sensation in my chest is squeezing," we could say "my chest feels tight" – just that. No interpretation, no judgment. Just a simple observation of the physical sensation. Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: "My chest feels tight." But the moment I say that, the fortune-telling machine fires up — I can already see the laugh, the whispering, the door closing, and the tightness gets worse like it's proving me right. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can we try using a very simple, observational phrase? Instead of saying "my chest feels tight," we could simply say "I notice my chest feeling tight" – just that. No interpretation, no judgment. No language that implies a specific meaning or outcome. Just a simple observation. Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: "I notice my chest feeling tight." But the moment I say it, the fortune-telling machine fires up — I can already see the laugh, the whispers, the door shutting, and the tightness spikes like it's proof. I'm really getting overwhelmed here, can we slow down?

Therapist: Can we try something without using words? Can you simply observe the sensation in your body without labeling it or interpreting it? Try to notice the sensation as it is, without adding any thoughts or meanings to it. Just the sensation itself. Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: I tried to just feel it without words, but the moment I focus the tightness spikes and the fortune-telling machine floods in with the whole humiliation reel — I hear the laugh, see the door shutting, and I can't keep it wordless. I can't do that without the story attached; it's overwhelming and feels like it's proving me right, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. I want you to simply acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed and that this experience is feeling overwhelming. Can you simply acknowledge that feeling, without trying to attach any thoughts or meanings to it? Just the feeling of being overwhelmed. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed — my chest's tight, my head's racing, and the humiliation reel is on repeat so I can't focus on anything else. I'm struggling to stay with this, so can we slow down?

Therapist: I completely understand that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's okay to take a break. Can you take a deep breath with me, and allow yourself to let go of the experience for just a moment? Imagine yourself taking a step back, and allowing yourself to feel safe and supported. You're not stuck in this experience, and you can come back to it when you're ready.

Patient: I tried that breath with you, but it barely helped — my chest tightened and my head started racing faster, the humiliation reel got louder like it always does. I keep picturing them laughing and the door slamming and it feels like panic is stalking me, so "feeling safe" seems impossible right now. I'm really flustered and distracted — can we slow down and try a very simple grounding step instead?

Therapist: Let's try a very simple grounding exercise. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them, the feeling of the air on your skin, and the sensation of the floor beneath you. Just notice these sensations, without trying to think about anything else. Can you focus on your feet for just a few breaths?

Patient: I tried to focus on my feet for a couple breaths, and I can barely notice the weight of my soles on the floor — but the moment I do my chest clamps down and the fortune-telling machine floods in with tripping and everyone laughing. My legs feel weak and shaky and my mind won't stop racing, so I'm really flustered and distracted; can we slow down and try something even smaller, like pressing my thumb and forefinger together or counting to five?

Therapist: Let's try something very small. Can you press your thumb and index finger together, just lightly, and hold it for a moment? Just focus on the feeling of your thumb and finger touching, and the sensation of the pressure between them. Don't try to think about anything else, just notice this sensation. Can you do that for just a second?

Patient: I pressed my thumb and finger together like you asked, but my hand's already trembling and that tiny touch just brought this hot shame over me. The fortune-telling machine immediately started — they'll see the tremble, they'll whisper, it'll end with me humiliated and alone — and the pressure between my fingers felt like proof of it. I'm frustrated and distracted; can we slow down and try something even smaller?

Therapist: Let's try something very simple. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, let your eyes gently unfocus and gaze down at your toes? Just look at your toes, and notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath, and let go of any thoughts or worries. Can you do that for just a moment?

Patient: I tried to look at my toes and breathe, but the moment I do my chest clamps, a hot shame rushes in, and the fortune-telling machine starts yelling — I can already see them noticing my tremble, laughing, the conversation dying, and the door shutting. I'm embarrassed, distracted, and my hands are shaking. Can we slow down and just do one very slow breath together, or something even smaller like naming one color in the room?

Therapist: Let's try something very small. Can you notice just one color in the room with me? Not the whole room, just one color. Is there a blue chair, a yellow wall, or a green plant? Just notice that one color, and focus on it. Don't think about anything else, just the color. Can you do that with me?

Patient: There's a dull blue mug on the shelf I can see, but the moment I try to focus my hands tremble and a hot shame floods in — my brain's already yelling that they'll notice and laugh. I'm really flustered and distracted; can we slow down and try something even smaller, like counting to three together?

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller. Can you count with me, one step at a time? One...

Patient: One... two... I'm trying to follow along but my hands are trembling and my brain's already predicting a stumble at three — everyone laughs, I freeze — and I feel this hot shame and frustration like I always do. Three... can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay. You're feeling overwhelmed. The trembling, the brain's predictions, the shame and frustration – they're all present. Just acknowledge them, without trying to change them or manage them. Allow them to be what they are. You don't have to do anything with them. Just be with them, as they are.

Patient: I'm trying to be with it, but the moment I do a hot shame rushes in and the fortune-telling machine starts narrating the worst — my hands tremble, they'll laugh, the conversation dies and the door shuts like it's already happened. My chest's tight, breath is short, my face feels hot and I'm totally distracted and embarrassed. Can we slow down and just do one very slow breath together, or you quietly count to two and I follow?

Therapist: Let's slow down. I'm here with you. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I'll quietly count to two. One... two...

Patient: I breathed with you — one, two — but it barely helped. The tightness's still there, my hands are trembling, and a hot shame's flooding in while the fortune-telling machine already plays the humiliation reel like it's guaranteed. I can't just flip a switch; can we slow way down and do one very slow guided breath together, or just sit quietly for a minute?

Therapist: Let's sit together in silence for a minute. I'll be here with you, and we can just sit and be present with each other. No talking, no counting, no breathing exercises. Just being. Let's just sit.

Patient: I can't just sit in silence — it makes the fortune-telling machine roar and my chest clamps, hot shame and that old failure feeling rush in and I get distracted. I'm shaking and the humiliation reel starts playing like it's already happened, so sitting quietly just feels impossible right now. Can we do one very slow guided breath together or quietly count to five instead? I'm really overwhelmed, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very slow, gentle breath together. I'll guide you through it. Inhale slowly... (pause) ...into your body... (pause) ...now exhale slowly... (pause) ...out of your body. Let's do it together, one slow breath at a time. Inhale... pause... exhale... pause...

Patient: I breathed with you, but it barely helped — my chest's still tight, my hands are trembling, and that hot shame's flooding in while the humiliation reel plays like it's already happened. I'm getting more panicky and distracted; can we slow way down and try something even tinier, like one very slow exhale together or you quietly count to three and I match it? I don't know, I just need something I can actually do right now.

Therapist: Let's try something very small. I'll quietly count to one with you. Just one... (pause) ...Can you match it with me? One...

Patient: One — I matched you, but my hands are shaking and a hot shame just flooded in; the fortune-telling machine's already playing the humiliation reel and I feel like I'm about to crumble. I'm really flustered and distracted — can we slow way down and just do one very slow exhale together?

Therapist: Let's try something very small. Just focus on the sensation of the air leaving your body as you exhale. Can you feel the air moving out of your body, and the sensation of your diaphragm relaxing? Let's just observe that sensation together, as it happens. Exhale...

Patient: I try to exhale, but the air feels thin and my chest stays tight — breathing out just makes the fortune-telling machine roar louder: they'll hear my voice shake, laugh, whisper, and the door will shut on me. A hot shame floods in and I'm dizzy and totally distracted. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow way down and just do one tiny exhale together, or you quietly count to two and I match it?
