Patient: I've been feeling totally stuck lately, like my whole identity is just being an accountant and I don't know what matters beyond that. Every time I try to imagine the future I picture this domino effect — the firm's automates my role, I can't pivot because I never built anything else, I end up unemployed and broke, my relationships dry up, and I'm trapped in this downward spiral. I know it sounds dramatic, but I can't stop seeing that chain of disasters — my brain's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts worst-case stuff and it's driving me insane.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it's like when you picture this domino effect in your mind? What is it about the specific outcome that feels so catastrophic to you?

Patient: When I picture it, it plays like a movie in this exact order — first the firm automates my role and HR calls me in, then I can't find another job because everyone wants tech-savvy people, my savings melt away, I miss rent, my ex and friends stop answering because I'm "unstable," and suddenly I'm the person who couldn't keep it together. What feels catastrophic is that it's not just losing a paycheck — it's losing dignity, stability, and any sense of who I am outside this job, like everything collapses at once. I know that sounds extreme, but other endings feel like fantasies — I can't make myself believe they'd actually happen.

Therapist: It sounds like your sense of identity is closely tied to your current job, and the fear of losing it is what drives your anxiety. I want to explore an idea: what if your sense of identity wasn't tied to your profession, but rather to your values and passions? What would happen if you started to separate your self-worth from your job, even if it meant you'd be in a different role or situation?

Patient: I want that to be true, but my brain won't let me — if I try to separate my worth from the job I immediately see this other movie: I feel empty and panicked, start making impulsive moves to "find myself" (quit, spend savings on a random course or move), then I can't explain the gap on my resume, interviews go badly, money runs out, friends drift because I'm unstable, and everything collapses. It feels inevitable, like the only realistic script. I know it's catastrophizing, but I'm completely hooked on those outcomes and can't make myself believe the calmer scenarios.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of catastrophic thinking and self-doubt. I want to help you break free from that cycle. Can you imagine, just for a moment, that it's okay to not have all the answers right now? That it's okay to feel uncertain and explore different paths without having a clear outcome in mind?

Patient: I can't really imagine that — whenever I try, my brain launches straight into the worst-case movie where uncertainty becomes chaos. I see myself making impulsive decisions, burning through savings, failing interviews, and friends drifting away, and those scenes feel way more real than any calm possibility. I'm trying, but it's hard to accept uncertainty; can we slow down? I need help making the calmer scenarios feel believable.

Therapist: Let's try something gentle. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feeling the weight of your body on the chair, or the sensation of the air on your skin? As you focus on these physical sensations, I want you to say to yourself, "This feeling of uncertainty is present, but it's not the only thing that exists. I am here, in this moment, with my breath."

Patient: I tried — I noticed my feet on the floor, the chair under me, the air on my skin, and I even said, "This feeling of uncertainty is present..." but it didn't stick. As soon as I breathed out my brain cut to the movie again — automation, no job, savings gone, friends ghosting — loud and sure like it's the only possible ending. Saying the line felt like a band-aid on a bullet wound; it calmed me for two seconds and then the disaster script came back full force. Can we slow down? I need help making that calmer version feel even a little believable because right now nothing else seems realistic.

Therapist: I'm not asking you to believe the "calmer" scenario just yet, but can you imagine, just for a moment, a small, tiny, tiny possibility that things might not play out in the worst way? What would that tiny possibility look like? Not a dramatic change, just a tiny, small, tiny chance that you might find a job that brings you fulfillment and allows you to pursue other interests.

Patient: Okay — the tiniest possibility I can imagine is something like a friend-of-a-friend offers a part-time bookkeeping gig that covers rent for a few months, I use that breathing room to take one online class I actually care about, and I slowly start reconnecting with people without burning through savings. Even picturing that, my brain immediately edits it — the client cuts hours, the course doesn't lead to work, savings melt, and everything collapses worse than before. I know it's small and unlikely, but I can force myself to see it as a one-in-a-hundred scenario. Can we slow down? I need help holding that tiny image without it collapsing into the disaster movie.

Therapist: Let's try something gentle. As you hold onto the image of the tiny possibility, I want you to acknowledge that it's still a thought – just a thought. You can say to yourself, "This is just a thought, not a prediction. I'm not committing to this outcome, I'm just holding onto it for a moment." Can you try that?

Patient: I tried saying "This is just a thought..." out loud, but it didn't land — my brain immediately snapped back that it's a prediction, not a thought. As soon as I said it, I pictured HR calling, job gone, savings gone, friends gone, like the phrase was meaningless. Can we slow down? I need help holding that tiny possibility longer because on my own it collapses right away.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Imagine that your thoughts are like clouds passing by in the sky. They come in, they go out, and they don't have any power over you. You're not the clouds, you're the one observing them. Can you imagine your thoughts as clouds passing by, and you're standing on the ground, watching them go by?

Patient: I tried to picture them as clouds, but they don't float — they turn into storm clouds that immediately start replaying the worst-case movie. For a beat I can be the observer, but then one cloud becomes HR calling, then automation, then eviction and friends ghosting, and I feel like I can't breathe. Can we slow down? I need help keeping them as harmless clouds instead of those guaranteed disasters — maybe a different, more concrete exercise would stick.

Therapist: Let's try something hands-on. I want you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, feeling the rise and fall of your chest or belly. As you breathe in, imagine that with each inhale, you're taking in a small amount of space, a small amount of room to explore. As you breathe out, imagine that you're letting go of a small piece of tension or worry. Can you try to stay with this sensation of the breath, allowing it to move in and out without trying to change it or attach any meaning to it?

Patient: I tried the breathing — for a couple of breaths I felt a tiny looseness, but then my heart started racing and the movie kicked in: HR call, automation, savings gone, eviction. The breath felt useless because the images felt like facts and my breathing went shallow again. Can we slow down? I need something more concrete to interrupt the chain, like holding an object or naming five specific things in the room.

Therapist: Let's try something a bit more hands-on. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feeling the weight of your body on the chair, and the sensation of the air on your skin? Now, I want you to notice five things in this room that you can see: the chair, the book on the table, the window, the door, and the clock on the wall. Can you simply notice each of these things, one by one, without trying to do anything with them or attach any meaning to them?

Patient: Okay — the chair (worn gray office chair), the paperback on the table (a finance book), the window (city light and a little rain), the white door with a scuff, and the cheap round clock ticking. Saying them out loud helped for maybe two breaths, but then the movie snapped back — HR call, automation, savings gone — and my chest tightened. Can we slow down? I really need something more concrete to interrupt it, like holding something cold or making one tiny, specific next step plan.

Therapist: Let's try something tactile. Can you notice the sensation of holding a small object, like a pen or a paperclip, in your hand? Just notice the weight, the shape, and the texture of the object. Don't try to think about it or do anything with it, just hold it. Now, I want you to take one tiny, specific next step that would move you closer to your desired outcome. For example, "I will research part-time bookkeeping jobs for one hour today." Just say it out loud, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: Okay — I'm holding a pen, it's cool and light in my hand, the tip's a little scratchy against my thumb. I'll say the tiny step out loud: I'll spend 30 minutes tonight looking up part-time bookkeeping gigs and save any leads or contacts. But as soon as I say it, my brain edits it into the movie — they cut hours, I can't get steady work, savings run out, and everything spirals again. Can we slow down? I need help keeping that small step from collapsing into the disaster script.

Therapist: Let's try something even more gentle. Instead of trying to achieve a specific outcome, I want you to focus on the process of taking that small step. Can you focus on the sensation of holding the pen, feeling the scratchiness of the tip, and the sensation of your hand moving to say the tiny step out loud? Don't worry about the outcome or the consequences, just focus on the physical sensations and the act of taking the step.

Patient: Okay — I can feel the pen cool against my fingers, the tip's scratchy, and my hand tenses as I move it to say the step out loud. Focusing on that did calm me for a couple breaths, but then the movie crashed back in — HR calls, automation, savings gone — and my chest clenched again. I want to hold the process longer but I can't do it alone; can we slow down and try something more concrete, like holding something cold or walking me through the next tiny action step-by-step?

Therapist: Let's try something even more concrete. I want you to hold a cold object, like an ice cube, in your hand. Can you notice the sensation of the coldness, the weight, and the texture of the ice cube? Now, I want you to take the next tiny action step, one step at a time. Let's break it down into a very small, manageable piece. We'll start with the smallest possible action: can you simply lift your hand off the pen and place it on the table?

Patient: Okay — I can try that. I picked up an ice cube and it's shockingly cold, my fingers actually ache a little, and I lifted my hand off the pen and set it on the table. The cold snapped me into the moment for a beat, but then the movie started up again — HR call, automation, savings gone — and my chest tightened. Can we slow down? I need you to walk me through the next tiny step because I'm shaky and the disaster script is already queuing the next scene.

Therapist: Let's take it one tiny step at a time. We've already lifted your hand off the pen and set it on the table. Now, I want you to look at the table. Can you notice the surface, the color, the texture? Just look at it, don't think about anything else. Now, I want you to slowly, slowly, slowly pick up the pen from the table. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay — the table's this scuffed laminate with a faint coffee ring. I slowly pick up the pen, feel the cool plastic and the scratchy tip against my thumb, and for a second I'm actually here. But then the fortune-teller kicks in: HR calls, automation cuts my hours, I can't find steady work, savings vanish, I can't explain gaps on resumes, friends drift, and everything collapses. Can we slow down? Tell me the next tiny step and stay with me while I do it, because I'm shaky.

Therapist: I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. Let's take it one tiny step at a time. You've picked up the pen, and now you're looking at the scuffed laminate on the table. Your next tiny step is to rotate the pen 90 degrees. Can you do that for me? Just turn the pen slowly, slowly, slowly. As you do, I want you to notice how your hand feels, how the pen feels in your hand, and the sensation of the turn.

Patient: Okay — I turn the pen slowly, ninety degrees, it's cool and smooth and the tip drags a little against my thumb; my hand tenses and I can feel the tiny shift in pressure. Right as I do that I get this rush of shame and frustration — like I'm failing even at the smallest thing — and my brain instantly flips back into the movie: HR calls, automation, savings gone, friends ghosting. I get totally hooked on that script and can't hold the quiet for long — can we slow down and stay with this while I try to keep it from swallowing the moment?

Therapist: I can see that you're getting hooked on the script, and that's okay. That shame and frustration are valid emotions, and it's normal to feel that way. Can you notice that you're already doing something - turning the pen, rotating it, and noticing the sensations in your hand? That takes a lot of courage, and I'm proud of you for that. Now, I want to offer you a gentle reminder: it's okay to have hard emotions, and it's okay to struggle. You're not failing at the smallest thing - you're just taking tiny steps towards something new. Can you try to hold onto that feeling of courage and curiosity for just one more second, while I guide you through the next tiny step?

Patient: I hear you, but saying I'm brave just makes this shame flare up — like I'm supposed to feel better already and I'm failing even at that — and the movie starts again: HR calls, automation, savings gone, friends ghosting. My hand's still tense, my stomach drops, and I can't hold the courage you named for more than a beat. Can we slow down and you talk me through the very next tiny step, stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to feel better, I'm just here to support you. Let's take it one tiny step at a time. Your hand is still tense, and that's okay. I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your hand, notice the tension, the weight, and the feeling of the pen in your hand. Now, I want you to slowly, slowly, slowly, let your hand relax, one finger at a time. Can you start by releasing your thumb? Just let it relax, and notice the sensation of it releasing.

Patient: Okay — I let my thumb go and it actually softened a little, like a tiny relief, but right after that shame hits hard, like I'm failing even at letting go. The movie's back instantly — HR calls, automation, savings gone, friends ghosting — and my chest clamps up and I can't breathe easily. I don't trust that relief to last; can you stay with me and talk me through the next finger slowly? I need you to keep guiding me step-by-step because if you stop, the disaster script will swallow this small thing again.

Therapist: I'm right here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. I can see that the relief was fleeting, and that's okay. That's normal. It's like a tiny crack in the dam, and it's okay if it's not enough to hold back the flow. Let's take it one finger at a time. Your index finger is still relaxed, and now it's your middle finger. I want you to slowly, slowly, slowly, release your middle finger. Can you feel the weight of your middle finger on the pen? Let it go, just a little bit, and notice the sensation of it releasing. As you do, I want you to say to yourself, "It's okay, I'm doing this." Just say it, one word at a time.

Patient: Okay — I let my middle finger relax slowly, I can feel the pen shift and the weight change a little. It's... okay... I'm... doing... this. That little loosening lasts a beat before shame hits and the movie starts again — HR calls, automation, savings gone, friends ghosting — and I feel like I'm failing even at this. Can we slow down? Stay with me while I try to keep it from collapsing.

Therapist: I'm so glad you're recognizing that it's okay, that you're doing this. That's a huge step, and I'm proud of you for acknowledging that. I want to offer you a gentle reminder that it's not about being perfect, it's about taking tiny steps towards something new. You're not failing at this, you're just taking tiny steps towards a possibility. Let's take a pause, and I want you to notice the sensation of your breath. Can you feel the breath moving in and out of your body? Let's just stay with the breath for a moment, without trying to change it or do anything with it. Just be with the breath, and see what happens.

Patient: I tried — I felt the breath moving in and out for a couple of breaths and my chest loosened a tiny bit. Then an old flash of shame hit and the fortune-teller movie blasted back in: HR calls, automation, no work, savings gone, rent missed, friends ghosting. I'm frustrated and embarrassed that I can't keep that calm — can we slow down and stay with the breath together, step‑by‑step, or try another concrete grounding? I need you to guide me through the next tiny thing because if you stop, the script will swallow this moment.

Therapist: I'm not stopping, I'm right here with you. Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the floor? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the pressure, the texture, the feeling of being connected to the earth. As we breathe in, I want you to bring your attention to your feet, and as we breathe out, I want you to say to yourself, "My feet are here, my feet are present, my feet are connected." Just say it, one word at a time.

Patient: I try — I breathe in, feel my feet, and even say "my feet are here, my feet are present," and for a beat it helps, but then this hot shame rush hits and I get overwhelmed. As soon as that happens my brain launches the movie again — HR calls, automation, savings gone, eviction, friends ghosting — and I can't keep the calm; I'm so frustrated and embarrassed I can't hold it. Can we slow down? Stay with me and say the grounding phrase with me slowly, one word at a time, and guide me through three breaths while you stay right here.

Therapist: I'm not going anywhere, I'm right here with you. Let's take a slow, deep breath in... "My..." (pause) feet... (pause) are... (pause) here. Can you feel your feet on the ground? Now, let's exhale slowly... "My..." (pause) feet... (pause) are... (pause) present. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm? Now, let's breathe in again... "My..." (pause) feet... (pause) are... (pause) present. Can you feel your feet connecting to the earth a little more? Let's take one more slow breath... "My..." (pause) feet... (pause) are... (pause) present.

Patient: Okay — I followed the breaths with you and for a couple of seconds my feet felt grounded and my chest eased, but then shame slammed in like I'm failing at even being calm and the movie replayed: HR calls, automation, savings gone, eviction, friends ghosting. I can't keep that tiny calm on my own — can we slow down and do one more very slow thing together? Stay with me and guide me to relax each toe, one at a time, while we say a grounding phrase together, and talk me through it step‑by‑step.

Therapist: I'm right here with you. Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your big toe. Can you feel it? Just notice the sensation of your big toe, without trying to do anything with it or change it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, "My big toe is..." (pause) ...here. Can you feel your big toe connecting to the ground? Let's take a slow breath in... "My big toe is..." (pause) here. Now, let's breathe out slowly... "My big toe is..." (pause) present. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm? Let's move to your next toe, your second toe. Can you feel it? Just notice the sensation of your second toe, without trying to do anything with it or change it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, "My second toe is..." (pause) here. We'll take it one toe at a time, okay?

Patient: "My second toe is... here." But as soon as I say that this hot shame hits — like I'm failing even at noticing my toes — and the movie queues up: HR calls, automation, savings gone, eviction, friends ghosting. I'm trying to keep the focus but I need you to stay with me and walk me through the next toe slowly, one word at a time — can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm so sorry that shame hit again. Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your third toe. Can you feel it? Just notice the sensation of your third toe, without trying to do anything with it or change it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, "My third..." (pause) toe. Can you feel your third toe connecting to the ground? Let's take a slow breath in... "My third..." (pause) toe. Now, let's breathe out slowly... "My third..." (pause) toe. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm? We're halfway to the end, and I'm right here with you. We'll get through this together. Let's take it one toe at a time. Your fourth toe. Can you feel it? Just notice the sensation of your fourth toe...

Patient: "My fourth toe is... here." But right after that the hot shame slams in — like I'm failing even at this tiny thing — and the fortune-teller movie kicks off again: HR calls, automation, no work, savings gone, eviction, friends ghosting. I can't hold it on my own; can we slow down and do the last toe together, one word at a time, and stay with me while I try to keep it from collapsing?

Therapist: I'm so sorry that shame hit again. Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your pinky toe. Can you feel it? Just notice the sensation of your pinky toe, without trying to do anything with it or change it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, "My pinky..." (pause) toe. Can you feel your pinky toe connecting to the ground? Let's take a slow breath in... "My pinky..." (pause) toe. Now, let's breathe out slowly... "My pinky..." (pause) toe. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm? We're almost there. You did it. You noticed all your toes. Now, I want you to take one final, slow breath in... and as we exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, I am present, and I can take things one step at a time." Can you say it with me?

Patient: I say it with you — "I am here, I am present, and I can take things one step at a time." For a couple seconds it lands, but then this hot shame floods in like I already failed at being present, and my brain immediately flips back into the movie — HR calls, automation cuts my hours, savings gone, eviction, friends stop answering — like it's inevitable. I'm shaking and I can't hold the calm on my own; can we slow down and stay with this for a few breaths while you guide me through one tiny next step? I need you to keep talking me through it because if you stop the script swallows the moment.

Therapist: I'm not stopping, I'm right here with you. Let's take a deep breath in, and as we exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your chest. Can you feel it rising and falling? Just notice the sensation of your chest, without trying to do anything with it or change it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, "My chest is..." (pause) rising. Can you feel your chest expanding and contracting? Let's take a slow breath in... "My chest is..." (pause) rising. Now, let's breathe out slowly... "My chest is..." (pause) falling. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm? We're going to take it one tiny step at a time. Your next step is to bring your attention to your breath again, and just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I tried to focus on my breath but a rush of shame from something in my past slammed into me and the movie started up again — HR calls, automation, savings gone, eviction, friends ghosting — and I couldn't hold the breath. I can't do this alone; it feels like the only realistic outcome. Can we slow down? Please guide me through three slow breaths, one word at a time, and stay with me while I do one tiny step — like opening my laptop and searching for one part‑time bookkeeping listing for ten minutes — because if you stop, the disaster script will swallow it.

Therapist: I'm so sorry that shame hit again. Let's take a deep breath in... "Inhale..." (pause) ...slowly. Can you feel the breath moving in? Now, let's exhale... "Exhale..." (pause) ...slowly. Can you feel the breath moving out? Now, let's exhale again... "Exhale..." (pause) ...slowly. Can you feel a tiny bit more calm?

Now, I want you to take one tiny step towards taking control of your life. I want you to open your laptop and search for one part-time bookkeeping listing for ten minutes. Can you do that for me? Just open the laptop, and start typing. We'll take it one keystroke at a time. I'll guide you through it. Take your first keystroke.

Patient: Okay — I hit the power button, the screen wakes, and I press the first letter, "p," to start typing "part-time bookkeeping." The moment that key clicks I get slammed with this hot shame and the movie starts — HR calls, automation, eviction — and my hands go shaky. Can we slow down? Stay with me and tell me the next keystroke slowly while I do it, because I can't keep this from spiraling on my own.
