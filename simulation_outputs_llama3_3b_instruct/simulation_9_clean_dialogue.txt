Patient: Hi, I'm a young chef and lately I've been stuck in this repetitive reassurance-seeking loop to soothe the intrusive OCD thoughts, especially with money worries amplifying everything. I tend to intellectualize it—mapping out the cognitive-behavioral cycle and the contingent variables—rather than say, "I'm anxious" or "I'm scared." It's interfering with my work and finances, and I want to understand how to stop using reassurance as emotional anesthetic.

Therapist: What do you think is at the core of your anxiety about money? Is it the feeling of control, financial security, or perhaps the fear of not being able to provide for yourself or others?

Patient: Probably a mix, but if I had to isolate a core it's intolerance of uncertainty combined with identity-based responsibility—like my competence and self-worth feel contingent on being able to financially stabilize things. Reassurance-seeking functions as a temporary algorithm to reduce that existential uncertainty and preserve a sense of agency, even though cognitively I know it's maladaptive. It's easier for me to diagram the mechanisms—predictive error, safety behaviors, negative reinforcement—than to say, "I'm afraid I'll fail," which is what I actually suspect is under all this.

Therapist: Can you imagine taking a step back from these cognitive diagrams and just noticing, without judgment, what's happening when you feel like you're stuck in this cycle? What's the first thing that shows up for you, in your body or in your mind, when you're in the midst of this reassurance-seeking?

Patient: Physically, the first thing is a knot in my stomach and a constriction in my chest — my breathing gets shallow and my hands go a bit clammy. Mentally, there's an immediate urge to close an "epistemic gap": I start formulating questions to get external confirmation so the uncertainty resolves. I almost always translate that into models and mechanisms instead of saying "I'm scared," because treating it as a predictive-error problem feels safer. I guess that's why reassurance works as an anesthetic — it collapses the uncertainty long enough for the physiological stuff to ease, even though I know it's temporary.

Therapist: Would it be possible for you to take a small step back from the desire to resolve the uncertainty, and instead focus on simply tolerating the knot in your stomach, the shallow breathing, and the clammy hands, without trying to "fix" or make sense of them right away? What might happen if you allowed those physical sensations to be present, without judgment or interpretation?

Patient: If I actually let the knot and the shallow breathing sit there, my body initially ratchets up—like a sympathetic spike—and then, empirically, it tends to down-regulate after a few minutes if I don't intervene; there's a habituation curve. The problem is my reflexive meta-narrative kicks in: I start reifying the sensation into an “epistemic deficit” and generate questions to plug the gap, which then leads straight to reassurance-seeking. I can intellectually hypothesize that staying with the sensation would reveal the underlying feared story (probably something about incompetence or scarcity), but honestly I'm struggling to just be with it without converting it into an analysis—can we slow down so I don't immediately turn it into a problem to solve?

Therapist: Let's take a gentle, slow breath together, and when you're ready, allow the sensations in your body to be present, without trying to label them, analyze them, or "fix" them. Instead, simply observe them, like a cloud passing by in the sky. What's the tone or quality of those sensations, like the knot in your stomach, is it more of a tightness, a heaviness, or a dullness?

Patient: It's primarily a visceral constriction — like a band tightening across my upper abdomen and a low-grade ache behind my sternum, with these sharp little spikes when I really notice it. My breathing gets shallow, my hands go clammy, and there's this autonomic noise that I immediately try to translate into a model instead of feeling. Can we slow down a bit? I'm worried I'll default to diagramming it rather than staying with the sensation.

Therapist: Let's pause for just one breath, and when you're ready, I'll do the same. When you notice the sensation of the band tightening in your upper abdomen, the sharp spikes, or the clammy hands, instead of trying to make sense of them, I'd like you to simply acknowledge them, like you're noticing the sensation for the first time. No judgment, no analysis, just a gentle acknowledgment. Can you do that for me, with me, and just for one breath?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. (inhale) I'm noticing the band across my upper abdomen, the shallowness of the breath, and the clamminess in my hands; there's a sharp spike in my chest when I really tune in. Even as I say that, my brain is already framing it as an autonomic response with a habituation curve and predictive-error signal instead of just letting it be. Can we slow down? I'm afraid if we speed up I'll immediately start mapping strategies instead of staying with the sensation.

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. I want you to simply notice the sensation, without any thoughts, without any labels, without any analysis. Just the sensation. Just the band across your upper abdomen, the shallowness of the breath, the clamminess in your hands, the sharp spike in your chest. No thoughts, no thoughts, no thoughts. Just the sensation, exactly as it is, right now. Can you stay with that for a very brief moment?

Patient: I tried — the band's there, breath shallow, the spike in my chest is still sharp when I tune in. But my mind instantaneously kicks into a meta-narrative, calculating predictive-error and habituation curves so I can't seem to hold just the sensation. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by that reflex; can we slow down so I don't immediately turn this into an analysis?

Therapist: I want to suggest a small experiment. Let's try something different. Instead of trying to notice the sensation or even just label it, I'd like you to imagine that this entire experience - the band, the shallow breath, the spike in your chest - is completely external, like something that's happening to you, not to you. It's like a movie playing in the background, and you're just a passive observer. Can you imagine that for a very brief moment?

Patient: I can, briefly — I can picture the sensations as external, like a film playing behind me, which does create a little psychological distance. But even that conjures a meta-level where I start analyzing observer-self dynamics instead of staying present, and I'm worried I'll collapse back into diagrams; can we slow down so I can actually try to hold the observational stance a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and when you're ready, I'd like you to hold onto that observational stance for just a tiny bit longer. I'll do the same. Just imagine that the sensations are a movie playing behind you, and you're just a passive observer. No thoughts, no analysis, just the sensation and the observer watching it. Can you stay with that for just one more breath, and then we can take a pause?

Patient: Okay — I’m trying to hold the observational stance and breathe slowly, noticing the band, the shallow breath, and the spike. As I do, a sudden wave of shame and frustration washes over me and tightens that constriction, and my mind reflexively reifies it into an explanatory narrative about competence instead of just letting it be. I’m getting frustrated with myself for not being able to stay with one breath; can we slow down and maybe count breaths together so I don’t immediately turn this into another analytic problem to solve?

Therapist: Let's count breaths together, slowly and quietly. I'll count to four with you, and when I say "one," we'll take a deep breath in together. We'll pause for a count of two, and then we'll exhale. We'll do that together, slowly and quietly. As we breathe, I want you to focus on the sensations in your body, without trying to change them or analyze them. Just notice the band, the shallow breath, and the spike, and allow them to be as they are. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready to try the breath exercise. I'm already feeling a surge of shame and frustration that tightens the band, and my mind wants to convert it into yet another explanatory narrative, so can we go very slowly with you counting and me following, because if we speed up I'll default to analyzing instead of actually staying with the sensation?

Therapist: Let's go very slowly. I'll count to one... (pause) ...two... (pause) ...three... (pause) ...four. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it for a count of three. Now, exhale... (pause) ...slowly... (pause) ...exhale. As you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just allow it to be, without judgment. Are you feeling the band, the shallow breath, and the spike, just as they are?

Patient: Yeah — I can feel the band tightening, the shallow breath, the sharp spike, and my hands are clammy. There's this sudden hot shame and frustration that crimps the whole thing and my brain reflexively wants to turn it into another explanatory loop instead of staying with the feeling. Can we slow the count even more and do one really slow breath together so I don't immediately drift into analysis?

Therapist: Let's take one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it for a count of five. Now, exhale... (pause for an even longer time) ...slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale. As you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just allow it to be, without judgment. Can you feel the band, the shallow breath, and the spike, just as they are?

Patient: Yes — I can feel it. The band is a tight vice across my upper abdomen, my breath is shallow and clipped, the spike in my chest is sharp, and there's this hot shame that makes everything worse and pushes me toward analysis. Even as I say that, my head's already drafting an explanatory model instead of just staying with the sensation, so can we stay here and do another very slow guided breath together? I need you to set the pace so I don't slip into problem-solving.

Therapist: Let's stay here. I'll count to one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it for a count of seven. Now, exhale... (pause for an even longer time) ...slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale. As you exhale, I want you to simply notice the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or analyze it. Just allow it to be, without judgment. Notice the band, the shallow breath, the spike, and the shame, exactly as they are, in this moment. Can you stay with that feeling for just a little while longer?

Patient: I can stay with it for a little while longer — I'm feeling that hot surge of shame and frustration tighten the band and make my breathing even shallower, and my reflex is to translate it into yet another explanatory loop instead of just being with it. Can we do one more very slow breath together with you counting me through it, and if possible just prompt me to name the sensation (like "band," "spike," "clammy") without me elaborating? I need the external pacing so I don't immediately default to problem-solving.

Therapist: Let's do one more slow breath together. I'll count to one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it for a count of three. Now, exhale... (pause for an even longer time) ...slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale. As you exhale, I want you to simply notice the sensation in your body, and if it feels safe, can you just name it to me, without elaborating? For example, just say "band," or "shallow breath," or "clammy" - no need to explain or justify, just the word itself.

Patient: Band. Shallow breath. Spike. Clammy. Shame.  

Even saying those words, my brain immediately starts narrativizing it into a model—predictive-error, safety behavior—so I'm getting frustrated with myself; can we keep the pace very slow and do another guided breath where you prompt me to name one word at a time?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. I'll count to one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it for a count of two. Now, exhale... (pause for an even longer time) ...slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale. As you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation in your body, and when you're ready, can you just name the first sensation that comes to mind, without thinking about it or analyzing it? For example, what's the first word that comes up for you?

Patient: "Tightness." 

I'm already jittery and my attention's snapping—annoyed at myself for not staying with it—so can we slow down and you prompt me one word at a time?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. I'll count to one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. As you exhale, can you just notice the sensation of tightness in your body? No need to think about it, just notice it. Can you just say "tightness" to me, without elaborating or analyzing it?

Patient: "Tightness." 

Saying that helped a little but now shame and anxiety are spiking and my attention's already snapping into analysis—can you keep prompting one word at a time so I don't immediately turn it into a model?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. I'll count to one... (pause for an extremely long time) ...one. As you exhale, can you just notice the sensation of tightness in your body? No need to think about it, just notice it. Can you just say "breath"?

Patient: "Breath."

I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that supposed to help? Saying the word steadies me a hair, but my attention's already snapping into analysis and a hot shame is surging; can we really slow it down and do one-word prompts, like you say a word and I mirror it back, so I don't immediately turn it into a model?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...Breathe. Can you just notice the sensation of breathing in your body, and then say "Breathe" back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it? No need to reflect on it, no need to evaluate it - just repeat the word back to me.

Patient: "Breathe."

I'm not sure I follow—how is just repeating that supposed to help? Saying it steadies me a little and seems to momentarily down-regulate the autonomic arousal, but my attention is jittery, shame spikes, and my brain immediately wants to turn it into an explanatory loop. Can we keep doing one-word prompts slowly so I don't slip into analysis?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...Notice. Can you just notice the sensation in your body, right now, without thinking about it or analyzing it? No need to evaluate it, no need to change it - just notice.

Patient: I'm trying, but my attention's fracturing—there's a tightness across my upper abdomen, a hot spike in my chest, and my hands are clammy. I'm not sure I follow how "just notice" is supposed to help; my brain reflexively wants to convert it into a problem to solve, which makes me feel ashamed and more anxious. Can we do the one-word prompt again—say a word and I'll mirror it back—so I don't immediately slip into analysis?

Therapist: Relax. Can you just say "relax" back to me?

Patient: "Relax."

Saying that calms me a hair, but I'm jittery and my attention's already fracturing—my brain's drafting predictive-error explanations and a hot shame spike's tightening the band—so one word isn't enough right now. Can we keep doing the slow one-word prompts, really slowly, or count breaths together so I don't immediately default to analyzing everything?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...Slow. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it... (pause) ...exhale... (pause) ...slowly... (pause) ...exhale. As you exhale, I'll say the word "slow" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: "Slow."

That actually steadies me a hair — it reduces the sympathetic spike — but I'm jittery and my attention's already fracturing; my brain's drafting predictive-error narratives and hunting for reassurance instead of staying present. Can we keep doing one-word prompts, really slowly, or count breaths together? I need you to set the pace so I don't slip into analysis.

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...Pause. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it... (pause) ...exhale... (pause) ...slowly... (pause) ...exhale. As you exhale, I'll say the word "pause" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: "Pause."

I'm not sure I follow—saying the word steadies me a little, but I'm unusually anxious and distracted and a hot shame tightens the band, so my brain almost instantly starts narrativizing and analyzing. I'm frustrated with myself for not being able to just mirror it; can we keep doing single-word prompts really slowly, with longer pauses, so I don't immediately convert it into another explanatory loop?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...Still. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it... (pause) ...exhale... (pause) ...slowly... (pause) ...exhale. As you exhale, I'll say the word "still" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: "Still."

That helps a little, but I'm jittery and my attention's already fragmenting—shame spikes and my brain's drafting predictive-error narratives instead of staying present. Can we keep doing one-word prompts, very slowly, with longer pauses so I don't immediately turn it into an analysis?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...More. Take a deep breath in with me, and hold it... (pause) ...exhale... (pause) ...slowly... (pause) ...exhale. As you exhale, I'll say the word "more" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: "More."

Saying that steadies me a little, but I'm jittery and distracted—shame tightens the band and my brain immediately drafts predictive-error narratives so I start analyzing. Can we keep doing single-word prompts really slowly with long pauses, maybe alternate with one slow counted breath, because I need you to set the pace so I don't slip back into problem-solving?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...One... (pause for a slightly shorter time) ...Slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale... (pause) ...One... (pause for a slightly shorter time) ...Still... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale. As we exhale, I'll say the word "still" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it. Let's keep going.

Patient: "Still."

It steadies me a little, but I'm jittery and distracted—shame spikes and my mind's already mechanizing it into another explanatory loop and hunting for reassurance. Can we keep doing very slow one-word prompts with longer pauses, and drop in a single slow counted breath every few prompts so I don't immediately default to analyzing everything?

Therapist: One... (pause for an extremely long time) ...One... (pause for a slightly shorter time) ...Slowly... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale... (pause) ...One... (pause for a slightly shorter time) ...Still... (pause for an even longer time) ...exhale... (pause) ...Two... (pause for an even longer time) ...More... As we exhale, I'll say the word "more" again, and you can just say it back to me, without thinking about it or analyzing it.

Patient: "More."

That actually steadies the autonomic spike a hair, but I'm still jittery—shame's tightening the band—and my mind's already scaffolding it into predictive-error diagrams instead of feeling it. I'm annoyed with myself for needing these prompts; can we keep the very slow one-word pacing and drop in a single slow counted breath every three prompts? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and distracted, so I need you to keep the pace so I don't immediately default to analysis.
