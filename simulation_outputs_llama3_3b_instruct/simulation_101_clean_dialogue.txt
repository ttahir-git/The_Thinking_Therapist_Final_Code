Patient: I'm a senior data scientist and lately I can't stop worrying about my performance at work — I replay every code review and presentation and then procrastinate so everything piles up. It's been eating at me, especially with ongoing family conflict, but I'm skeptical this will help because I've tried similar things before and it didn't change much. How is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you replay those code reviews and presentations in your mind? What is it about those thoughts that keeps you from moving forward with your work?

Patient: When I replay them I keep seeing the moments I fumbled an explanation or missed a question, and then my head goes to everyone noticing and thinking I'm falling apart. It tightens my chest and fogs my thinking, so I avoid the hard parts and busy myself with low-value tasks instead of starting the work. I know it's probably blown out of proportion, but the fear of being judged or exposed makes starting feel like a risk, so procrastination feels safer. I've tried scheduling and breaking tasks down before and it doesn't stick—how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you think of a moment when you've faced a difficult situation in your past where you stepped out of your comfort zone and took action, despite feeling uncertain or scared? What value or sense of self did that experience give you?

Patient: A couple years ago I had to lead a cross-team model deployment—I was terrified I’d miss something in front of execs, but I prepared obsessively, fumbled a bit during Q&A and still got good feedback afterward. It gave me a sense that I can handle pressure and figure things out when it matters, like I’m not as fragile as I fear. But honestly, that memory doesn’t quiet the chest-tightening now—I've used past wins to pep-talk myself before and it doesn't stick, so how is that supposed to help? What would you have me actually do with that memory—I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: Let's explore the idea that your fear of missing something or being judged might not be about the specific outcome, but about the story you're telling yourself about it. Instead of focusing on "I'll be a failure," what if you could say "I'm doing my best, and that's enough"? Can you imagine repeating that to yourself as you're working on the task, rather than getting caught up in the fear of not meeting expectations?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I mean, I get the sentiment, but when I'm in the middle of it my chest tightens and that kind of rational phrase is the last thing I can reach. I'm tired of pep-talks that sound nice on paper and vanish when a deadline shows up. If you want me to try it, give me something concrete—exact words, when to say them, and how to make it stick when the physical panic is already in charge.

Therapist: Can you commit to repeating the phrase "I'm doing my best, and that's enough" to yourself exactly 3 times in the next 10 minutes, as soon as you feel that physical tension starting to rise in your chest? As you say it, I want you to notice your body's physical sensations and acknowledge them without judgment – "My chest feels tight, and I'm saying 'I'm doing my best, and that's enough.'"

Patient: Okay — I'll try that when I feel the tightness: say "I'm doing my best, and that's enough" out loud three times. I doubt it'll calm me, but I'll at least notice the chest and put my hand on it so there's something concrete to do. If it doesn't help, I'm going to tell you it didn't work and we figure something else — I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to experiment. Before we continue, I want to check in with you about what's most important to you in this moment. What's the one thing you'd like to accomplish or feel more confident about in the next 24 hours that would make a meaningful difference to you?

Patient: Honestly, I'd like to get a first pass on the model report—an outline and at least one section written—so it stops feeling like this enormous, unavoidable thing. If I could actually do 45–60 minutes of focused work without spiraling, that would matter. But I'm skeptical it’ll stick—how is that supposed to help if I can’t keep the focus once the tension starts?

Therapist: Can you imagine your model report as a series of small, incremental steps – like taking a deep breath, writing one sentence, and then another – rather than a massive, insurmountable task? As you start working on the outline, I want you to say to yourself, "I'll work on this for just 5 minutes, and then I'll check in with myself and decide what to do next." What would you say to yourself in those 5 minutes?

Patient: I'd tell myself to do the smallest possible concrete thing: "Open the report, write one blunt sentence: 'Objective: evaluate model X on metric Y and outline next steps.' Don't edit—just get one line down." Then start a 5-minute timer, take three slow breaths, put a hand on my chest and, if the tightness comes, say aloud, "My chest is tight, I'm still doing this." But seriously—how is that supposed to help when the panic's already in charge? I'll try it and tell you if it falls apart.

Therapist: Let's explore the value behind wanting to get a first pass on the model report. What's the sense of importance or significance that you're driving your desire to accomplish this task? What would you value more – the sense of completion, the satisfaction of a job well done, or something else?

Patient: I think it's less about the report and more about proving I still know what I'm doing — wanting to feel competent and dependable so the worry quiets down. Finishing even a rough first pass would give relief from the constant guilt and a little pride that I can still deliver, which might stop the loop of second-guessing. But how is that supposed to help me actually sit down when my chest tightens and I freeze? I'm tired of mapping out the reasons—I'm trying to see how that actually gets me moving in the moment.

Therapist: Let's try a small, low-stakes experiment. As soon as you feel that tightness in your chest, I want you to pause and look around the room. Say to yourself, "I'm willing to sit with this discomfort for 10 seconds, without trying to push through or escape it." Then, slowly and deliberately, take one step towards the task, such as picking up the pen or mouse. What happens when you do this small action?

Patient: When I actually try it, the ten seconds are brutal but survivable — the tightness doesn't explode, it just sits there like a heavy weight. If I force myself to pick up the mouse and open the file, I can usually type one blunt sentence, but then my head starts listing reasons to stop and I end up doomscrolling or cleaning my desk. It feels like the small step breaks the initial paralysis, but it doesn't carry me through; how am I supposed to turn that one sentence into sustained work without the panic hijacking me again?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. When you feel yourself getting caught up in negative self-talk or catastrophic thinking, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm having a thought that's not my friend. Thank you, mind, for that thought, but I'm going to let it go. I'll choose to focus on the sentence I wrote earlier: 'Objective: evaluate model X on metric Y and outline next steps.'"

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying, "I'm having a thought that's not my friend... thank you, mind, but I'm going to let it go," and then refocus on the sentence. In my experience that kind of labeling gives a tiny space, but the chest stays tight and my brain immediately lists reasons to stop and do something safe instead. How is that supposed to help me go from one blunt sentence to actually sustaining 45–60 minutes of focused work — give me a concrete, step-by-step ritual I can do right after that first sentence when the panic is loud. If it doesn't work, I'll tell you it failed and we figure something else, because I don't want to just keep circling.

Therapist: Let's try a 5-minute " Pause and Breathe" ritual. Right after writing your sentence, take 5 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, say to yourself, "I am present." As you exhale, say, "I am capable of taking small steps." When your mind starts to wander, gently acknowledge the thought and say, "That's a thought. I'll acknowledge it and let it go." Take another deep breath, and then say, "I will work on this task for the next 5 minutes, without any distractions or self-judgment." Will you commit to trying this ritual when you feel the panic rising?

Patient: Alright. I'll try it — after the one-sentence start I'll take five slow breaths, say the lines you gave, and set a 5-minute timer to work without distractions. I doubt it'll carry me past those first few minutes; my chest usually drags me back to safe tasks. If it falls apart, I'll tell you it didn't work and we need a different plan — how is that supposed to help me sustain 45–60 minutes?

Therapist: Let's talk about what you'd like to achieve in the next 24 hours, not just during our session. What's one small, specific action you can take after the 5-minute work session to move closer to your goal of completing the report?

Patient: Okay. After the 5-minute burst I'll immediately write two bullets—one for results, one for next steps—and then set a 25-minute timer to turn the first bullet into a paragraph. I doubt it'll hold, but I'll try it, and if it falls apart I'll tell you so and we figure something else.

Therapist: Let's explore the value behind taking this small step. What is it about writing two bullets and expanding the paragraph that gives you a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction? Is it the feeling of making progress, the sense of being more organized, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's mostly about proof — two bullets and a paragraph would feel like evidence that I'm actually moving forward, which quiets that looping self-doubt for a bit. It also makes the work concrete and less like an amorphous, terrifying thing, so I feel a little more organized and less scattered. But honestly, I'm not convinced that small wins will hold off the chest-tightening when it matters — how does that actually help me stay there for the longer stretch?

Therapist: Let's try a " Values-Driven Commitment" exercise. Imagine you're in a situation where you're 10-15 minutes away from the point where you usually get stuck or panicked. What would you value most about moving forward then? What would be the most important outcome, or the sense you'd be gaining, that would make it worth continuing? What specific words or phrases would you use to describe that value to yourself, and what actions would you commit to taking in those next 10-15 minutes?

Patient: If I'm 10–15 minutes from the point I usually freeze, what I'd value most is something tangible I can point to — proof I'm moving, however small. The phrases I'd tell myself: "This is progress," "One step at a time," and "I can handle a messy first draft." In those next 10–15 minutes I'll set a 15-minute timer, write one results bullet and one next-step bullet, start the first paragraph, and if the chest tightens I'll put a hand on it and take three slow breaths while saying those phrases. But honestly—how is that actually going to keep me there when the panic kicks back in?

Therapist: Let's try a "Values-Based Identity" exercise. I want you to take a moment to imagine that you are already the person who has successfully completed the report, and that you're feeling a sense of pride, competence, and confidence. What does this person look like, feel like, and think like? What words or phrases would this person use to describe themselves, and what values would they be living in alignment with? As you imagine this identity, I want you to repeat those words and phrases to yourself, and commit to embodying that sense of self in the next 10-15 minutes.

Patient: Okay. I picture the finished-report me as someone a little worn but steady, hunched over the keyboard with a messy draft up, feeling competent enough to tolerate imperfection rather than freeze. The lines I'd repeat are "Progress over perfection," "One step at a time," and "I can handle a messy first draft" — values: reliability, clarity, showing up. I'll try to embody that for the next 10–15 minutes and use those phrases if the chest tightens, but honestly — how is that supposed to keep me from spiraling? I'll try it and tell you what happens.

Therapist: Let's try a "Mindfulness of Values" exercise. I want you to take a few deep breaths, and as you breathe in, I want you to say to yourself, "I am [your name], and I am moving forward with the intention of showing up with reliability, clarity, and a willingness to take one step at a time." As you exhale, say, "I am connected to my values, and I trust myself to make progress, even if it's imperfect." Can you commit to doing this for the next 5-10 minutes, and see how it feels to embody your values in the present moment?

Patient: Alright. I'll do it for 5 minutes — breathe in saying my name and the values, breathe out the trust line, hand on my chest, set a 5‑minute timer. I doubt it'll stop the tightness once panic kicks in, but I'll try it and tell you what happens — how is that supposed to help me stay past those first few minutes?

Therapist: Let's talk about what you can do after the 5-minute mindfulness exercise to continue taking consistent action. What small, incremental step can you take after the timer goes off, that still aligns with your values and goals? For example, can you commit to writing one more sentence, or reviewing the next section, or doing a quick calculation?

Patient: After the 5‑minute mindfulness, I'll write one more blunt sentence (turn the results bullet into a line), then set a 25‑minute timer to expand that into a paragraph. If the chest tightens I'll put a hand on it, take three slow breaths, repeat "one step at a time," and if it falls apart I'll restart the short ritual and tell you it didn't work — this feels like a big lift, but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's talk about what would happen if, despite your best efforts, you get stuck or feel overwhelmed again. How would you be kind to yourself in that moment? Would you say to yourself something like, "It's okay, I can come back to this later. I've made progress so far, and I can pick up where I left off." Can you commit to using self-compassion like that, rather than getting frustrated or giving up?

Patient: Alright — I can try swapping the frustration for something concrete like, "This is hard, and it's okay to pause. I did something today and I can come back to it," saying it slow while I take three breaths and put a hand on my chest. I'll promise to try that instead of berating myself, and to actually give myself a short break (10–15 minutes) before returning, so it's not an all-or-nothing collapse. But honestly, I doubt it'll stop the panic when it hits — if it falls apart, I'll tell you it didn't work and we need a different plan.

Therapist: Let's talk about what you can do when the panic returns, and you feel like you're not making progress. Can you imagine yourself in a situation where you're 10-15 minutes away from the point where you usually get stuck? What would you say to yourself in that moment? For example, "I'm doing my best, and that's enough. I can take a break, come back to it later, and try again." Let's practice that phrase together, slow and deliberately, as a way to anchor yourself in self-compassion and flexibility.

Patient: Okay. If I'm 10–15 minutes from freezing, I'd tell myself slowly: "I'm doing my best, and that's enough. I can take a short break and come back." I'll say it three times, hand on my chest, three slow breaths, then set a short timer to keep going — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the spiral? I'll try it and tell you if it falls apart so we can try something else.

Therapist: Let's talk about what you can do to maintain momentum when you've made progress and are close to finishing. What's the smallest, most enjoyable thing you can do to celebrate your progress and keep yourself motivated? Can you imagine doing something that brings you a sense of pleasure or satisfaction, like taking a short walk, making a cup of tea, or chatting with a friend? This can help you stay energized and focused on the finish line.

Patient: Maybe something tiny — make a cup of strong tea and step outside for a five‑minute walk, or play one song I actually like. I'll promise myself that after I turn the results bullet into a paragraph I'll do that; it feels small enough to tolerate and might break the tension. I doubt it'll fix the panic, but I'll try it and tell you if it doesn't help so we can do something else.

Therapist: Let's try a "Treat Yourself" exercise. As soon as you finish writing the paragraph, I want you to take a few moments to acknowledge and celebrate your progress. Look around you and find something that brings you joy, like a plant, a favorite mug, or a piece of artwork. Take a moment to appreciate the small pleasure of having made progress, and then take a sip of that cup of tea or enjoy your favorite song. Can you commit to doing this, and see how it helps you stay energized and motivated?

Patient: Alright — I’ll do it. After I finish the paragraph I’ll look at the mug or the plant, take a slow sip of tea, and play one song while actually noticing I made progress. I’m doubtful it’ll stop the panic long-term, but I’ll try it and tell you if it doesn’t work so we can figure something else.

Therapist: Let's summarize the rituals we've developed together: 
1. Pause and breathe, with a phrase to calm the chest ("I'm doing my best, and that's enough.")
2. Take a short break and acknowledge progress.
3. Celebrate progress with a small pleasure (treat yourself).

I want to thank you for your courage and willingness to experiment with these exercises. It's not about finding a magic solution, but about finding what works for you. Since we've reached a point where you feel more comfortable with these rituals, I'd like to suggest that we focus on putting them into practice in real-life situations, rather than just during our sessions. Are you open to that?

Patient: Alright — I'll try them in real situations: the pause-and-breathe, a 5‑minute start, then the paragraph + small reward. I'm skeptical it'll hold when the panic spikes, but I'll test it tomorrow and tell you what falls apart so we can tweak it. How is that supposed to help me stay past the first 10 minutes?

Therapist: Let's explore the sense of identity and purpose that drives your desire to make progress on the report. What is it about this work that matters to you, and what values do you want to uphold through your actions? For example, is it about delivering quality results, meeting deadlines, or taking care of yourself? Can you imagine yourself as someone who values and demonstrates these qualities, and how would that impact your approach to the task?

Patient: It matters because the report is proof I still know what I’m doing — to my team, and more painfully, to myself when family stuff makes everything feel unstable. I value reliability, clarity, and showing up even if the work’s messy; if I could actually be that person in the moment I’d settle for a draft and keep going instead of freezing. But that feels abstract when the chest tightens — how is that supposed to stop me from shutting down and doomscrolling?

Therapist: Let's try a "Values-Based Body Scan". As you feel the chest tightening, I want you to bring your attention to your physical body, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head. As you scan, say to yourself, "I am reliable." When you reach the chest, say, "I am clear." Continue scanning, saying "I show up" for each part of your body. As you do this, I want you to feel the physical sensation of each word, and notice how it affects your breath and overall sense of being. Can you commit to doing this for 1-2 minutes, whenever you feel the chest tightening?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it for 1–2 minutes when the chest tightens, moving up my body and saying "I am reliable... I am clear... I show up" while keeping my hand on my chest and breathing. I'm worn thin thinking about another ritual though, so how is that supposed to help when the panic's already in charge? If it falls apart I'll tell you it didn't work.

Therapist: Let's try something more concrete. I want you to imagine yourself in a situation where you're 10-15 minutes away from the point where you usually freeze. What would you say to yourself, using your Values-Based Body Scan words, to help you stay focused and motivated? For example, "I am reliable, I am clear, I show up" as you continue working. Can you commit to using these words to anchor yourself in your values and purpose, even when the panic rises?

Patient: Alright — I'll try using "I am reliable, I am clear, I show up" as an anchor when I'm 10–15 minutes from freezing, hand on my chest, breathing through it. I'm worn thin and skeptical — when panic hits those words often feel like background noise; how is that supposed to actually stop me from spiraling into doomscrolling? I'll try it and tell you if it falls apart so we can figure something else.

Therapist: Let's explore the concept of "defusion". Defusion is the process of recognizing that your thoughts, including your anchor phrase, are not the same as your experience of anxiety. Can you imagine that the words "I am reliable, I am clear, I show up" are just thoughts, like clouds passing by, and not a reflection of your true self? As you continue working, I want you to observe these thoughts without judgment, and notice how they affect your breath and overall sense of anxiety. Can you try this for 5-10 minutes, and see if it helps you approach your work with a more detached mindset?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the defusion thing for 5–10 minutes: notice the thought, picture it like a cloud, say "I am reliable, I am clear, I show up" as just words passing, keep my hand on my chest and watch my breath, and set a short timer. I'm worn thin and skeptical — when the panic ramps up, "just observe" feels meaningless, so how is that supposed to help calm the tightness? Also, should I say the phrases out loud or just notice them silently when I'm doing this?
