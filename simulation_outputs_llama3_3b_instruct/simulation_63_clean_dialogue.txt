Patient: I'm an accountant in my late twenties/early thirties and I've been pretty burned out after a big life transition, and lately social gatherings feel impossible. The minute I think about going, my brain insists I'll freeze, say something awful, everyone will judge me, and then I'll never be invited back—so I just don't go. My family's supportive, but I can't shake the feeling that if I try, it'll all go downhill.

Therapist: Can you describe what specifically happens for you when you start thinking about attending social gatherings? What's the first thought or physical sensation that makes you feel like you're going to freeze?

Patient: The first thing is this tightness in my chest and this hollow feeling in my stomach — my hands get clammy and my mind just blanks out. Immediately my brain goes, "You’ll freeze, say something stupid, everyone will laugh, someone will post it, your boss will see it, you'll be judged and never invited again," and I can't get past that story. I know it sounds over the top, but anything else feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a strong connection between your professional identity and social anxiety. What would happen if you were able to show up at a social gathering without the fear of being judged, even if it felt awkward or uncomfortable? What values would you be supporting or connecting with in that moment?

Patient: If I could actually show up, I'd be trying to reconnect, be genuine, and live by values like friendship, bravery, and competence — I want to prove I can handle things even if it's awkward. But the instant I imagine it my brain goes, "You’ll freeze, say something horrible, everyone will laugh, someone will post it, your boss will see it, you’ll get fired and never be invited anywhere again," and that chain feels inevitable. I know you're asking me to consider other outcomes, but honestly, telling myself something nicer just feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of self-compassion and honesty at play when you say you don't want to tell yourself something nicer. Can you consider the possibility that it's okay to doubt yourself in this moment, and that this doubt might actually be a sign that you're being kind to yourself? What would happen if you allowed yourself to hold this doubt, rather than trying to suppress it with catastrophic thinking?

Patient: I'm trying to imagine holding the doubt instead of fighting it, but when I do it just doesn't land — my chest tightens and the worry gets louder. Then the fortune-teller in my head takes over: if I let the doubt sit, it turns into panic, I'll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything goes to crap. I don't want to fake optimism, but I also feel stuck and scared this is just who I am; I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to focus on your breath, and when your mind starts to wander to those thoughts, gently acknowledge them without judgment. Can you say to yourself, "This thought is just a thought, it's not a reflection of reality"? Notice how it feels to allow this thought to exist without trying to push it away or get caught up in it?

Patient: I tried that — took a breath and said “this thought is just a thought,” but it felt hollow; my chest stayed tight and the fortune-teller voice immediately rattled off the whole disaster script: I’ll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, everything collapses. I don’t know, I just keep getting pulled into that story — can we slow down? I’m trying to hold the doubt but it’s turning into panic.

Therapist: I'd like to suggest a small, low-stakes experiment: what would happen if you took just one tiny step towards social interaction this week, without any expectations or outcomes in mind? Would it be okay if you just showed up, even if it felt awkward or uncomfortable? This isn't about trying to avoid the catastrophic thinking, but about exploring what's possible when you approach social interactions with a willingness to be present and uncertain.

Patient: I want to try, but even the tiniest step feels like it will trigger the same chain—if I go for just 15 minutes, my brain says I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and then it's all over. Maybe a smaller step like sending a casual text to one friend sounds safer, but my fortune-teller immediately replies that it'll be misread, they'll think I'm needy, it spreads, and I'll be ostracized. I'm getting overwhelmed just picturing any of this—can we slow down and figure out something even smaller I can tolerate?

Therapist: Let's focus on a tiny, tangible action that doesn't feel as overwhelming. Instead of texting a friend or attending a social gathering, what if you simply sat in a quiet space for 1 minute, noticing your breath without judgment? It's okay if your mind wanders, or you feel anxious – you're simply allowing yourself to be with your thoughts and feelings in this moment, without trying to control or change them.

Patient: I tried that for a minute and it just made everything worse — my chest locked up, my breath got shallow, and the fortune-teller voice immediately jumped in: I’ll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and it all collapses. I couldn’t stay with it; the minute felt endless and panic spiked. Can we slow down? Maybe something even smaller I can tolerate, like 10 seconds or just naming one thing in the room?

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller. Can you simply acknowledge your surroundings, and name one thing in the room that you see, without judgment or trying to change it? It could be a chair, a book, or a picture on the wall. Just say the name of that thing out loud, without thinking about what it might mean or what the future might hold.

Patient: A lamp. Saying it out loud made my chest tighten though, and the fortune-teller immediately started up again—if I just notice this now it’ll somehow lead to me freezing later, saying something awful, someone recording it, my boss finding out, and everything collapsing. I’m getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're on the verge of becoming overwhelmed, and that's okay. Can you allow yourself to feel that sense of overwhelm, without trying to push it away or change it? Notice the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts that are racing, and the emotions that are rising up. Allow yourself to be with this feeling, without judgment, for just a moment.

Patient: Okay — my chest feels tight, my breath's shallow, and there's this hot shame rising like I messed up somehow. The fortune-teller is already running the script: I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, everything collapses, and that just makes me feel like a failure all over again. I'm frustrated with myself for getting pulled into it and it's making me panic — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to feel frustrated with yourself, and it's okay to feel like a failure. But what's interesting is that these feelings of shame and failure are coming up when you're trying to be kind to yourself. Can you connect with the feeling of frustration, but also acknowledge that it's not a reflection of your worth as a person? What would happen if you allowed yourself to feel this frustration, without judgment, and instead focused on what you value about yourself?

Patient: I'll try, but when I really let the frustration sit it turns into this hot shame like I messed up and I'm worthless, and the fortune-teller immediately starts its whole disaster replay: I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything I value gets wiped out. I can say I care about friendship, bravery, and competence, but it feels pointless because that catastrophe feels inevitable. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're looking at a picture of yourself, and it's not the real you. Can you imagine a different picture, one where you're standing in the same room, but with a different story? What if, instead of thinking "I'll freeze, say something awful...", you thought "I'm taking a risk, I'm being brave, I'm showing up"? What would that feel like?

Patient: I tried picturing that, but it feels like putting on a mask — as soon as I try, this sharp shame spikes and the fortune-teller voice gets louder: I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, everything collapses. I want the brave picture to be true, but it just feels impossible and I’m getting panicky — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and explore what's happening when you try to put on the "brave picture". What's the physical sensation in your body when you try to imagine yourself being brave? Is it a sense of expansion, rather than contraction? Can you allow that sense of expansion to grow, without trying to achieve it?

Patient: When I try to imagine being brave it doesn't open up — my chest tightens, my shoulders hunch, my stomach drops, and this hot shame floods in like I messed up again. The fortune-teller just starts its disaster script right away — I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything collapses. Letting any "expansion" grow feels like pretending and it just spikes my panic and frustration — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and explore your body. Notice the sensations in your chest, shoulders, stomach, and any other areas that feel tight or constricted. Can you allow these sensations to exist, without trying to change or push them away? What would happen if you simply acknowledged the physical sensations, without judgment or labeling them as "good" or "bad"?

Patient: Okay—my chest's tight, shoulders hunched up, my stomach's in knots and my hands are a bit clammy; my breath gets shallow and my head feels foggy. I try to just notice it, but the fortune-teller immediately starts yelling the whole disaster script—I'll freeze, blurt something horrible, someone will record it, my boss will see it, everything collapses—and that hot shame from that one screw-up rushes back like proof I can't handle this. I'm really scattered and it's hard to just sit with it without spiraling—can we slow down? I don't know how to let these sensations be without them dragging me into panic.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed. Can you acknowledge the physical sensations in your body, without trying to change them or push them away? Just notice that your chest is tight, your shoulders are hunched, and your stomach is in knots. What would happen if you simply acknowledged these sensations, and allowed them to exist without judgment?

Patient: Okay—my chest's tight, shoulders hunched, stomach in knots, breath shallow. I try to let that sit, but as soon as I notice it the fortune-teller yells the whole disaster—I'll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything's ruined—and that hot shame from that one screw-up just floods back. I feel scattered and worthless and I can't keep the sensations from dragging me into the panic. Can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with this but it's pulling me under.

Therapist: It's okay to feel scattered and overwhelmed. Can you acknowledge that you're struggling to stay with your emotions, and that it's okay to not be able to control your thoughts and feelings? What's the core of your values that might be at stake here? Is it being able to be present with yourself, or being able to show up in social situations? Can you connect with that value, even if it feels like you're not doing it right now?

Patient: I do care about being present and showing up — friendship, bravery, competence feel like the core things at stake. But the moment I try to connect to that, the fortune-teller starts screaming that I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and that proves I'm worthless, so I can't really hold the value without spiraling. I'm scattered, ashamed, and I don't know how to tap into those values without panicking — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to connect with your values, but the shame is getting in the way. Can you try to meet yourself with kindness, even if it feels like you're not worthy? Can you say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? What would happen if you allowed yourself to be kind to yourself, without trying to achieve anything or meet any expectations?

Patient: I try to say that to myself, but it just feels like lying — the second I try to be kind this hot shame crashes in and the fortune-teller starts yelling I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything's ruined. Being kind to myself feels like pretending and it spikes my panic. Can we slow down? I don't know how to actually hold kindness without it turning into proof I'm worthless.

Therapist: It's like you're caught in a cycle of "I need to be kind, but I'm not worthy". Can you consider that kindness and shame might be two sides of the same coin? What if you could acknowledge both of these feelings at the same time, without trying to choose between them? Can you meet with both kindness and shame, and see what happens?

Patient: I want to try, but the second I try to hold kindness and shame together my chest tightens and the shame just drowns out the kindness. Then the fortune-teller starts yelling I'm a failure and that I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything collapses — it feels impossible. I'm frustrated with myself for not being able to do this and it's making me panic. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It's okay to feel frustrated with yourself. Can you acknowledge that feeling, without judgment? What's the thought that's running through your head, "I'm a failure"? Is it true? Would you still be a failure if you let go of this thought? Can you take a step back and see that your worth isn't defined by this one thought, but by your ability to be present and show up in the moment?

Patient: The thought "I'm a failure" just keeps replaying and when I let it sit it lights that hot shame — the fortune-teller voice immediately yells I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything's ruined, so it feels true. I do want to believe my worth isn't defined by this and that I can be present and show up, but every time I try the shame drowns out the kinder voice and I start spiraling. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you consider what would happen if you were to accept that you are already worthy, regardless of your thoughts or actions? What would be the physical sensation in your body if you allowed yourself to feel this sense of worthiness, without trying to achieve it? Can you imagine yourself being present in this moment, with kindness and compassion towards yourself, without judgment?

Patient: I try to imagine feeling worthy, but the second I do my chest clamps, my face goes hot, my stomach knots, and that old shame about that one screw‑up rushes back like proof I'm useless. The fortune‑teller voice immediately screams I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything collapses — so I literally can't let worthiness sit without spiraling. I'm really scattered and distracted and it's hard to stay here; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of shame and anxiety. Can you try to see that the shame is not about you as a person, but rather about the story that you're telling yourself about that one mistake? Can you consider that this story might not be true, and that you are not defined by one mistake? What would happen if you allowed yourself to be present with the shame, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: When I try to be with the shame it just heats up — chest tightens, vision narrows, my thoughts go loud with "I'm a failure," and then the fortune‑teller kicks in: I'll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, I'll lose my job and everyone will abandon me — it's like the shame is proof. I can't keep it sitting there; panic climbs fast and I get furious at myself for not being able to hold it. Can we slow down? I need something even smaller I can tolerate right now.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or push it away? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without judgment. What happens when you focus on the breath, rather than trying to deal with the shame or catastrophic thinking?

Patient: I try to focus on the breath, but it just makes my chest clamp tighter and my mind louder — the fortune‑teller immediately screams the whole disaster and that one screw‑up rushes back like proof I can't handle it. I can't keep the breath here without spiraling; can we slow down? Maybe something even smaller, like guiding me through one slow exhale or naming one color, would help.

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller. Can you focus on one small detail, like the sensation of your feet touching the ground? Just notice the sensation of your feet, without trying to change it or push it away. Or, if that feels too much, can you name one color that you see in this room? Just say the name of the color out loud, without thinking about it. What happens when you focus on the color, rather than trying to deal with the anxiety?

Patient: Blue. Saying it out loud barely helped — my chest tightened, my hands went clammy, and the fortune‑teller immediately screamed the whole disaster: I’ll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything collapses. I’m really scattered and that hot shame floods in like proof I can’t handle this — can we slow down? I don’t know how to stop spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you try to let go of the need to control the thoughts and emotions, and simply be present with what is happening right now? What would happen if you allowed yourself to be with the uncertainty, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I try to breathe with you but it just clamps my chest and my mind floods with the fortune‑teller script — I’ll freeze, blurt something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and everything collapses — and that old shame rushes back like proof I can't handle it. I honestly can't hold the uncertainty; it spirals me into panic and I get so scattered. Can we slow down? Maybe just guide me through one slow exhale, or count to three with me — something tiny I can actually tolerate.

Therapist: Let's start with something very small. I want you to breathe in for a count of one, and then exhale for a count of three. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, can you say to yourself "I am safe"? Just say it quietly, without thinking about it.

Patient: I tried — breathed in for one and tried to exhale for three while saying "I am safe," but it felt hollow and my chest just clamped; the fortune‑teller started yelling I'll freeze, say something awful, someone will record it, my boss will see it, and that hot shame hit like proof I screwed up. I'm really frustrated with myself and it's spiraling — can we slow down? Maybe just guide me through one slow exhale or count with me so I don't have to do it alone.

Therapist: Let's try again, together. I'll guide you through a slow exhale, and you can count with me. Inhale for a count of one, hold for a count of two, and exhale for a count of three. As you exhale, I want you to say to yourself "I am doing the best I can". Just say it quietly, without judgment. Remember, this is not about achieving anything, but about simply being present with the breath.

Patient: I tried that with you — inhaled, held, tried to exhale saying “I am doing the best I can,” but it felt hollow; my chest clamped, the fortune‑teller screamed the disaster script, and that hot shame about that screw‑up rushed back like proof I can't handle it. I'm panicking and getting really scattered — can we slow down? Please just guide me through one very slow exhale and count it with me so I don't have to do it alone.

Therapist: Let's try one more time, together. I want you to take a very slow, deep breath in, and hold it for a count of one. Now, exhale slowly and slowly, counting to four. As you exhale, I want you to repeat the phrase "I am enough" to yourself, without thinking about it. Just say it quietly, without judgment. Let's take it one breath at a time.

Patient: I tried — I took a slow deep breath and tried to say "I am enough," but it felt hollow; my chest clamped, my hands went clammy, and the fortune‑teller immediately screamed the whole disaster about freezing, saying something awful, someone recording it, my boss seeing it, everything collapsing. That hot shame floods in like proof I can't handle this and I can't hold the phrase without spiraling. Can we slow down? Please just guide me through one very slow exhale and count it with me so I don't have to do it alone.
