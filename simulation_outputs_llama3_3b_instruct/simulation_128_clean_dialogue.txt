Patient: I’ve been feeling stuck and directionless — like the only thing that seems to define me is my job as a manager, and everything else feels empty. My mind is this fortune-telling machine that always predicts disaster: if I try to find something else that matters, I’ll fail, my family will blow up at me, my OCD will spiral, I’ll lose my job and end up completely alone. People tell me to consider other outcomes, but I can’t take those seriously — they just don’t feel possible.

Therapist: Can you describe the specific thought or scenario that triggered this fortune-telling machine in your mind, where you predict failure and disaster if you try to find something else that matters?

Patient: It started when my partner casually suggested I take an evening art class to do something for myself. My head instantly spun the worst-case: if I try that, I'll let work slip, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and I'll get reprimanded, then lose my job, my OCD will spiral without that structure, my partner will resent me and leave, and I'll end up alone and bankrupt. I keep replaying that chain like it's a movie I can't turn off, and when people say other things could happen I can't take them seriously.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the narrative of this "doom scenario" and it's hard to consider other possibilities. What would happen if you took a break from that loop and simply acknowledged the story as a story – not a prediction of reality – and allowed yourself to consider what might happen if you did take that evening art class?

Patient: I try to tell myself it's just a story, but the moment I do my brain jumps into that movie: miss a deadline, boss notices, I'm reprimanded then fired, my OCD spirals without work's structure, my partner resents me and leaves, and I'm alone and bankrupt — like it's the only possible ending. Imagining it going okay feels dishonest; I can't take that outcome seriously. It's exhausting and makes me want to freeze. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to move past this.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and pause on this thought for a moment. When you say it feels like imagining a positive outcome feels "dishonest," what's the underlying value that's connected to that feeling – is it a sense of self-respect, connection with your partner, or something else?

Patient: I think it's mostly about control, competence, and responsibility — my self-respect comes from being reliable, so doing something just for me feels like I'm shirking that duty and therefore dishonest. Then my brain immediately jumps to the worst-case: that shirking will lead to missed deadlines, getting fired, my OCD spiralling, my partner resenting me and leaving, so I can't take a positive outcome seriously.

Therapist: What would it be like for you if you were willing to take a small step towards that evening art class, not as a way to prove your reliability, but simply because it feels meaningful to you and brings you joy?

Patient: If I tried that one class I can already see the whole spiral: I'll be distracted, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and I'll get reprimanded, then fired, my OCD will spin out without work's structure, my partner will resent me and leave, and I'll end up alone and bankrupt. Imagining it going okay feels like lying to myself — I can't take that outcome seriously. I'm really overwhelmed by this and I'm not sure how to risk even a tiny step without it turning into that movie; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you try to take just one tiny step towards that evening art class – perhaps just looking up the class schedule online, or checking to see if it's still available? No strings attached, no expectations, just a small, low-stakes exploration.

Patient: Even looking it up feels like pushing the first domino: I'll obsess over it, sign up, get distracted, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and I'll be fired, my OCD will spiral and my partner will resent me — I can't make myself believe a harmless search won't start that whole movie. I don't trust that checking the schedule won't lead to disaster, so I can't take that step right now. I'm feeling really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and look at this from a different angle. What would happen if, instead of trying to avoid checking the schedule, you simply allowed yourself to be present with the thought "I'm curious about that evening art class"?

Patient: I try to be curious, but the minute I allow that thought my brain already writes the whole script: curiosity becomes obsession, I sign up, get distracted, miss a deadline, my boss notices and fires me, my OCD spirals without work’s structure, my partner resents me and leaves — curiosity equals catastrophe. Staying with the thought just makes me feel trapped and sick; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you observe the physical sensation in your body when you're with that thought "curiosity equals catastrophe" – is it tension, nausea, or something else? Sometimes, noticing the physical experience of our thoughts can help us separate them from our sense of self.

Patient: When I pay attention it’s like my chest clamps shut, there’s a hard knot in my stomach, my breath gets shallow and my hands feel cold. The moment I feel that, my fortune-telling machine kicks in — it tells me that this physical stuff proves I’ll panic, miss a deadline, and everything will spiral — noticing it feels like confirmation, not separation. I’m getting really queasy just talking about it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the physical sensations in your body without trying to label them or make sense of them. Can you simply allow the sensations to be present, without judgment, and see what happens to the thought "curiosity equals catastrophe" when they're not trying to be controlled or proven true?

Patient: I try to just sit with the tightness and the shallow breath, and for a few seconds it actually loosens — the knot in my stomach dulls and the thought quiets a little. But then my fortune-telling machine fills the quiet with the whole movie again, like the calm is just the calm before the storm and that only makes the disaster feel more inevitable. I’m really shaky thinking about it — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's explore what would happen if, instead of trying to prepare for the "storm," you simply allowed yourself to be in the calm moment – not as a precursor to something, but as an end in itself. Can you imagine being in this calm state without trying to find meaning or purpose in it?

Patient: For a few seconds I can feel it — breath slows, the knot eases, and it almost feels like just being okay. But my brain says that calm is the trick: it’s the lull before the collapse — I’ll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I’ll be ruined. I’m getting shaky talking about it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to consider a different kind of safety – not from avoiding the thought or the action, but from allowing yourself to be with whatever arises, without trying to protect yourself or prepare for something else. Can you imagine what it would be like to simply be present with whatever is happening, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can be present for a few breathes — the knot eases and it almost feels like okay for a second. But then my mind yells that the calm is a setup: I’ll get careless, miss a deadline, be fired, my OCD will spin out, my partner will leave — I can’t let myself believe the calm is an end in itself. I’m getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a small, tiny step – just for the sake of experimenting – and see what happens if you allow yourself to be present with the thought "I'm calm" without trying to change it or prepare for something else. Can you try to simply observe the thought "I'm calm" without judgment, just as it is?

Patient: Okay... I tried holding "I'm calm" for a few breaths — for maybe five seconds it actually felt real, breathing steadied and the knot loosened. But then my brain screams that it's the setup: if I'm calm I’ll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I'll be ruined. I'm feeling wiped out and shaky — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to observe the process of your mind – the way it takes a calm moment and immediately starts to spin it into disaster. Can you gently follow your breath and notice the sensation of your breath as it comes in and goes out, without trying to change it or prepare for something else? Let's explore the process of your mind, not the content of the thoughts.

Patient: I tried following my breath for a few slow inhales and exhales — for a moment the tightness eased and there was a little space. But as soon as there’s space my mind starts the movie: I’ll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spiral without work holding me together, my partner will resent me and leave, and I’ll be completely alone and ruined. I can’t keep holding this; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different – instead of following your breath, I'd like you to notice the sensation of the space between your thoughts. Can you gently observe the sensation of the pause between your breaths, the pause between thoughts? What happens when you notice this space?

Patient: When I notice that space there's a couple of seconds where things actually feel quieter — like a small relief — but it never lasts. My fortune-telling machine immediately fills the pause with the whole disaster movie — missing a deadline, getting fired, OCD spiraling, my partner leaving — so the calm just feels like a trap. This is wearing me out and I'm shaky; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something called "decentring". I'd like you to imagine a blue dot in front of you. When you notice the thought "I'm calm" or the disaster movie, imagine that the thought is a blue dot on the dot. As the dot gets bigger and more prominent, imagine the blue dot starts to fade, and the calm or disaster thought becomes smaller. What happens to the blue dot as you practice this exercise?

Patient: For a second the blue dot thing works — the dot shrinks and the disaster feels farther away. But pretty quickly the dot balloons back up and the movie starts: miss a deadline, boss notices and fires me, my OCD spins out, my partner leaves, I'm ruined — like that’s the only ending that’s actually real. I’m honestly wiped out just trying this; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach to the blue dot exercise. Instead of focusing on making the dot smaller or larger, I'd like you to imagine the dot as a tiny, small, tiny blue dot – so small that it's almost imperceptible. Can you imagine the dot being so small that it's not even noticeable, and the thoughts and feelings that come with it?

Patient: I made the dot tiny — for a few breaths it almost vanished and things felt a little less loud, like there was room to breathe. But pretty quickly it balloons again and the movie kicks back in: miss a deadline, boss fires me, my OCD spirals, my partner leaves, I'm wrecked. I'm worn out just trying this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the effort you're making in this exercise. Can you gently thank your mind for bringing up the thoughts and feelings, and acknowledge the courage it takes to explore them? What happens to your experience when you approach your thoughts with kindness and compassion, rather than trying to change them or control them?

Patient: Okay... thank you — I can try saying thanks to my mind, like it's trying to keep me safe. That actually made things a little softer for a beat, but then the movie kicks back in: I'll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will fire me, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I'll be ruined. I'm worn out just saying that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. As you exhale, can you say to yourself, "I am kind to myself, exactly as I am right now"? Can you try this phrase, even if it feels a bit awkward or uncomfortable, and see what happens?

Patient: I tried saying it — “I am kind to myself, exactly as I am right now” — just for a breath or two, my voice felt thin and it actually softened the tight knot for a second. Then my head immediately screamed that if I let myself be kind I'll get complacent, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spin out without work holding me together, my partner will resent me and leave, and I'll be completely ruined. I'm jittery and can't keep that phrase with me; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to explore what's behind your desire to hold onto your current approach – what's the value or purpose that you're trying to protect? Can you imagine that the kindness and compassion we've been exploring is actually a way of staying connected to a deeper value, such as self-acceptance or self-care? What might that value mean to you?

Patient: I guess the value I'm clutching is being reliable — control and competence feel like the only proof I matter, so I protect that at all costs. But if I let kindness or self-acceptance in my brain screams that I'll get lax, miss a deadline, be fired, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I'll be completely ruined — my hands are shaking just saying that, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's explore this need for control and competence in a different way. What would it mean to be reliable and competent to you, in a way that is not controlled by fear of failure or catastrophic thinking? Can you imagine a situation where you feel reliable and competent, but it's not because of some grand, dramatic achievement – but simply because you're showing up, doing your best, and being present with yourself and others?

Patient: Maybe reliable would just mean the small, steady things — finishing my tasks, showing up to family stuff, saying sorry when I mess up, letting myself sketch for an hour now and then without grand drama. But as soon as I imagine that, my brain turns it into the same horror movie: one slip, miss a deadline, boss fires me, OCD spirals without the job holding me together, my partner leaves, I'm ruined. I know that's supposed to feel more doable, but I can't really trust it — I'm wiped out trying to hold it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. Can you imagine yourself having a small success, just a tiny one – like finishing a small task or taking a few deep breaths without catastrophizing? What would it feel like to trust that you can do this small thing, without needing to control everything or avoid the possibility of failure? Can you imagine a small, tiny spark of trust that might grow from this tiny success?

Patient: I can kind of picture a tiny success—like finishing a small task or taking a few steady breaths—and for a beat it feels like a little spark. But almost immediately my brain turns it into the same disaster: that spark makes me complacent, I’ll miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spin out, my partner will resent me and leave, and everything collapses. Saying that makes my hands tremble and my chest tighten—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to focus on the physical sensations in your body – specifically, the trembling and tightening in your hands and chest. Can you notice these sensations as they are, without trying to change them or avoid them? And then, can you imagine that these sensations are a sign that you're feeling something – a spark of vulnerability, perhaps, or a glimmer of openness?

Patient: My hands are shaking and my chest is tight—there’s this small, hollow feeling like maybe I’m actually feeling something, like a sliver of vulnerability. For a beat that could feel like openness, but my brain yells that it’s just the setup: that sliver will make me complacent, I’ll miss a deadline, get fired, my OCD will explode without work keeping me together, my partner will resent me and leave, and I’ll be ruined. I’m feeling wiped out and shaky—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the courage it takes to feel vulnerable, and the willingness to explore this feeling. Can you imagine that this vulnerability might actually be a sign that you're willing to take a risk, to be open and present with yourself and others, even if it means not having all the answers? What would it be like to approach this vulnerability as an opportunity, rather than a threat?

Patient: Maybe I can see it as an opportunity for a second — a tiny sliver of openness — but my mind instantly turns it into the same nightmare. I picture getting careless, missing a deadline, my boss noticing and firing me, my OCD spiraling without the job holding me together, my partner resenting me and leaving, and everything collapsing. I'm jittery and wiped out just thinking about it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sensation of your feet making contact with the floor? Try to stay with this sensation for just a few breaths, without trying to think about anything else. Can you allow yourself to simply be present with this sensation, without judgment?

Patient: My feet feel heavy on the floor and the air on my skin is kind of cool — for a couple breaths that actually grounded me and my breathing eased. But then the movie starts again: I get careless, miss a deadline, my boss notices and fires me, my OCD spirals without the job holding me together, my partner resents me and leaves, and I'm ruined. I'm shaky and drained just saying that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something simple: can you say to yourself, "I am here, I am now, and I am with this thought" – exactly as it is? No judgment, no interpretation, just a simple statement of presence? Can you try this with the thought that's just come up, the one that's got you feeling scared and worried?

Patient: Okay... I said it — "I am here, I am now, and I am with this thought." For a breath or two it softened the knot, but then my fortune-telling machine screamed the movie again: I'll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I'll be ruined. I'm jittery and distracted and I can't hold that calm—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try to look at this thought "I'll get careless, miss a deadline, my boss will notice and fire me, my OCD will spiral, my partner will leave, and I'll be ruined" without judgment. Can you simply observe it, as if it's a interesting fact – like a news headline or a piece of trivia? What's the tone of your mind when you're looking at it in this way?

Patient: It's like a breaking-news headline—flat, urgent, and absolute, spoken in this hard, certain voice that treats it as a verdict, not a maybe. Even when I look at it like trivia, it doesn't feel neutral; it still makes my chest clamp and my hands shake, like I'm waiting for the doom to land. I'm really worn thin just holding it—can we slow down?
