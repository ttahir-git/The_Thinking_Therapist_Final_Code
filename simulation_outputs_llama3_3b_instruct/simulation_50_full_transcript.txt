--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling completely overwhelmed by sadness since my loved one died, and I can't find the motivation to do much at work as a nurse or at home. Every time I try to think about the future, my mind jumps straight to the worst — I'll mess up a shift, get reported, lose my job, my partner will leave because I'm useless, and then I'll end up alone and completely ruined. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't shake the certainty that that's exactly what's going to happen.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be intense fear and anxiety. A specific theme that stands out is the intense rumination on worst-case scenarios, indicating a pattern of catastrophic thinking. My goal for the answer is to create space from these "sticky thoughts" and explore a more value-driven approach to motivation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what motivates you to care for your patients at work? What values do you think are at stake in providing compassionate care, and how does that relate to your motivation to do so?

Patient: I care because I value competence and not letting people down — being reliable for my patients is part of who I am. Lately though, that value just feels like a pressure cooker: if I try to keep being compassionate I’ll get drained, make a careless error, get reported, lose my license, and then lose everything else — my partner, my home, my sense of self. I know people say other outcomes are possible, but honestly that chain feels like the only realistic one to me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
A clear contradiction is that you're acknowledging the value of being a reliable and competent nurse, but your thoughts are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of catastrophic failure. This pattern of thinking seems to be fueled by a sense of hopelessness. My goal for the answer is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy and introduce a more flexible approach to motivation.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a really tough and daunting scenario. It's like your mind is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that's hard to break. Can you imagine, for just a moment, that the worst-case scenario isn't actually a certainty? What would it be like to hold that thought without judgment, as if it's just a possibility, rather than a guarantee?

Patient: I tried that, but the second I let "maybe it's not certain" into my head, my brain's like a bad weather app — it immediately flashes the worst forecast and I can't ignore it: I'll make a mistake at work, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave, and I'll be left with nothing. I get that you're asking me to hold it as a possibility, but honestly that feels like pretending — like I'm setting myself up to be blindsided, and I can't make myself believe it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your thoughts seem to be caught in a cycle of rigidity, with a sense of helplessness. The fear of uncertainty appears to be linked to a deeper fear of losing control and identity. My goal for the answer is to introduce the concept of "willful ignorance" to help you create some space from these thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It makes sense that trying to hold onto a more flexible thought is difficult when your mind is already set on the worst-case scenario. Instead of trying to hold onto the possibility, what if you were to focus on what you can do in this moment to take care of yourself and your work? What small, concrete steps can you take today to feel more grounded and prepared for whatever comes up?

Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed, but a few concrete things I could try today are: pick one specific task each shift (like med rounds) and set an alarm plus a quick checklist to double-check. Send my partner a short, honest text asking to sit together tonight so it doesn't fester, and take two 5–10 minute breathing breaks where I write down one small thing I did well before I leave. I can also call the EAP or my supervisor tomorrow about getting some short-term support or a lighter load. I know my brain says alarms will fail, my partner will leave, and EAP won't help — I can't make myself believe otherwise — but I guess I can try these anyway, even if I'm doubtful.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified some small, concrete actions that can help you regain a sense of control and build a more flexible mindset. Recognizing the tendency to doubt your ability to follow through on these actions is a good start. My goal for the answer is to help you cultivate a sense of willingness to take small, imperfect action despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the doubts and still take small steps. What would happen if you were to try one of these actions today, even if you're not sure you'll succeed or if your doubts come up again tomorrow? What's the smallest, most trivial benefit that you could experience by taking this tiny step?

Patient: I guess the tiniest benefit would be a little loosening of the knot in my chest — like finishing one checklist item and being able to tell myself I did one thing right for a few minutes. Maybe my partner actually sits with me for ten minutes and we don't snap at each other tonight, so it doesn't fester. My brain's already shouting that it's temporary and will end up in the same disaster — alarms will fail, I'll still mess up — but I can try it anyway, even if I'm skeptical.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've connected the potential benefits of taking small action to specific, tangible sensations and experiences. Your willingness to take small steps despite your doubts suggests a glimmer of hope. My goal for the answer is to help you integrate this willingness into your daily life.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's okay to hold onto the worst-case scenario, but also recognize that your willingness to take small action is a sign of strength. Can you commit to taking one of these small steps today, not to eliminate all doubts, but just to take that first step, and see what happens in the moment?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the alarm plus a two-item checklist for med rounds today and actually mark it off, and I'll send my partner a short text asking if we can sit together tonight. I'm exhausted and skeptical — my brain's already insisting the alarm will fail and this won't change anything — but I can still try it and let you know how it goes.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made a concrete commitment to take small action, despite your doubts. Recognizing your exhaustion and skepticism is also important, as it acknowledges the current state of your emotional experience. My goal for the answer is to help you introduce the concept of "self-as-context" to better understand your own emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
How do you think your exhaustion and skepticism are showing up in your body right now? Where do you feel the tiredness, and where do you feel the skepticism?

Patient: I feel this heavy, bone-deep tiredness in my chest and behind my eyes, like my whole body wants to fold in on itself — my shoulders and back are tight and my legs feel leaden. The skepticism shows up as a tight jaw and a buzzing in my head; my stomach knots and my hands go clammy whenever the worst-case stories start. It all makes breathing feel harder and kills any tiny bit of motivation, and then my brain jumps in with the disaster script like it's already happened.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've vividly described the physical sensations and emotional experiences accompanying your exhaustion and skepticism. This physical discomfort and mental rumination suggest a strong sense of being "stuck" in your thoughts and emotions. My goal for the answer is to introduce the concept of "being with" your experience, rather than trying to change or escape from it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or push away the discomfort? Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment. Can you find a tiny part of the experience that feels more neutral or even slightly pleasant, like the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, or the sensation of your feet touching the ground?

Patient: I can feel the cool air at the tip of my nose and my feet on the floor — there's a tiny, faint steadiness there for a second. But almost right away my head starts the script: the calm will snap, my breathing will speed up, I'll make a med error, get reported, lose my license, and everything will fall apart. I can try to hang on to that little steady feeling, but I'm already bracing for it to fail and my jaw's clenching.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've been able to briefly experience a sense of steadiness, but it's quickly overridden by the familiar script. This pattern of "bracing for impact" suggests a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "bare exposure" to your experience, rather than trying to control or avoid it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine, for just a moment, that the script is not set in stone? What if, instead of bracing for the worst, you were to simply acknowledge the script as it arises, without judgment or attachment? Can you try to say to yourself, "Okay, the script is here, but I'm not identifying with it"?

Patient: I tried saying that—"the script is here, I'm not it"—but it feels like putting a Band‑Aid on a bomb: the moment I name it my brain answers with the whole chain again — I'll mess up meds, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave, I'll have nothing. I can notice the words, but my jaw tightens and my breath gets shallow and the disaster story grabs me like a magnet. I want to try this with you, but honestly it's overwhelming—can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've acknowledged that attempting to label or dismiss the script has not been effective, and are seeking a slower, more gentle approach. Recognizing the overwhelming feeling is a crucial step towards developing greater tolerance and flexibility. My goal for the answer is to help you create a sense of "groundedness" and connection to your body and breath.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and focus on your physical body. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: Okay — my feet are on the floor and I can feel the weight under my heels; it's... a tiny bit steady. But almost immediately my head's yelling the whole catastrophe again — med error, report, license gone, partner leaves — and I tighten up. I want to try this, but it's hard to stay with the feet without the script dragging me away; can we slow down and keep returning to that grounding for a bit?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've been able to briefly experience a sense of groundedness, but it's again being pulled back by the script. Recognizing the pattern of being "pulled under" by the catastrophic thoughts is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "contextualization", where you can observe your thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to acknowledge the fact that your head is yelling the script again. Can you notice that your thoughts are just that – thoughts – and not a reflection of who you are or what's true? Can you say to yourself, "This is just a thought, not a reflection of my worth or identity"?

Patient: I can say it—"This is just a thought, not a reflection of my worth or identity"—but the second I do my head spits the whole disaster script: I'll mess up meds, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave, and I'll have nothing. When I say the phrase my jaw clamps, my breath gets shallow, and my stomach knots like it always does, so it feels useless and almost insulting. I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and keep coming back to the feet-on-the-floor grounding for a bit?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've had a strong reaction to the thought, and are feeling overwhelmed. Recognizing that the thought is just a thought, and that your physical and emotional responses are automatic, is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "bearing witness" to your experience, without judgment or attachment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in together, and as we exhale, I'd like you to say it one more time, slowly: "This is just a thought, not a reflection of my worth or identity." As we breathe out, can you simply observe the sensation of your body, without trying to change it or get caught up in the thought? Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the feeling of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: Okay—(breath in, out) "This is just a thought, not a reflection of my worth or identity." I can say it, but as I exhale the whole script rushes back — I'll make a med error, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave — my jaw clamps and my breathing gets shallow. I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down and keep returning to the feet-on-the-floor grounding for a bit?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've repeated the phrase, and it's not having the desired effect. Recognizing that the script is still coming up, and your physical responses are automatic, is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "kindness" towards yourself, even in the midst of overwhelming thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that your body is responding in a way that's completely normal. Can you offer kindness to yourself, right now, in this moment, as you're feeling overwhelmed? Can you say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm doing the best I can, even if it doesn't feel like it right now"?

Patient: Okay — "I'm here, I'm present, and I'm doing the best I can, even if it doesn't feel like it right now." Saying it makes my jaw clamp and my brain immediately flashes the whole disaster — I'll mess up meds, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave — and I feel really overwhelmed. Can we slow down and keep coming back to the feet-on-the-floor grounding for a bit?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've attempted to offer kindness to yourself, and it's not having the desired effect. Recognizing that kindness is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and that your body is still being pulled by the catastrophic thoughts. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "temporality", recognizing that your thoughts are passing, and that you can come back to the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to pause, and notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you follow your breath, just for a moment, without trying to change it or get caught up in the thought? Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the feeling of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath. When you're ready, we can come back to the thought, but for now, can you just focus on the sensation of being here, in this moment?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. My feet feel heavy on the floor and I can feel the cool air at my nostrils for a second, like a tiny steady spot. But as soon as I notice it the script snaps back in — I’ll make a med error, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave — and I get overwhelmed and my jaw clenches. Can we slow down and keep coming back to the feet for a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
You've had a brief moment of grounding, but it's again being pulled back by the script. Recognizing that your mind is like a "yo-yoing" between the present moment and the catastrophic thoughts is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "not-trying" to change or avoid your thoughts, and simply being with what is.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another deep breath in together, and as we exhale, can you simply be with the sensation of your feet on the floor, without trying to change it or get caught up in the thought? Can you allow yourself to be with the feeling of your feet being heavy, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or effort?

Patient: Okay... I can feel my feet heavy on the floor and the cool air at my nose for a second, but it slides away fast — my head immediately spits the whole thing: I'll make a med error, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave, and it all just crushes me. I don't have the energy to fight it right now; can we slow down and keep coming back to the feet for a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
You've tried to hold onto the sensation of your feet on the floor, but it's not sticking. Recognizing that you're feeling exhausted and crushed by the catastrophic thoughts is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "exhaustion as an invitation to pause".

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to feel overwhelmed and crushed. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not able to fight or push through right now. Can you take a moment to allow yourself to feel the exhaustion, the weight of the thoughts, and the sense of hopelessness? Can you simply be with this feeling, without trying to change it or push through?

Patient: Okay... I can let the heaviness sit — my chest's tight, shoulders sagging, feet feel like anchors, breath shallow. But I'm not sure I follow how just "being with it" is supposed to help; my brain's still yelling the certainties — med error, reported, license gone, partner leaves — and I don't have the energy to argue with that right now. Can we just stay with the feet-on-the-floor grounding for a while and go slower?

Therapist Thinking:
You've allowed yourself to feel the exhaustion, but are still wondering how this "being with it" will help. Recognizing that you're not ready to engage with your thoughts yet is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "temporal anchoring", where you can find a sense of stability in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's stay with the sensation of your feet on the floor, and I'll guide you through a gentle, slow process. Can you take one tiny step, just one tiny step, towards the sensation of your feet on the floor? Notice the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Take just one tiny step, just for one second, without trying to change it or get caught up in the thought.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try one tiny step. My feet feel heavy and a bit steady for a second, but my head immediately jumps to the whole disaster — med error, reported, license gone, partner leaves — and I get tense and can't focus. I don't have the energy to fight it; can we just stay here with the feet, slowly, for a bit?

Therapist Thinking:
You've taken one tiny step, but the catastrophic thoughts are still dominant. Recognizing that you're not making progress with the "tiny steps" is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "contextual awareness", where you can see the thoughts as a separate entity from your sense of self.

Therapist Answer:
Let's stay with the sensation of your feet on the floor, and I'll guide you through a slow and gentle process. Can you try to notice the sensation of your feet without trying to label or interpret it? Just observe the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Don't try to think about anything else, just focus on the physical sensations in your body, one tiny step at a time.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try. My feet feel heavy and a tiny bit steady for a second, but I don’t really follow how this helps — my head’s already replaying the whole forecast (med error, report, license gone, partner leaves) and my jaw’s clamped, so I’m distracted. Can we just go very slowly and keep bringing me back to the feet every few seconds?

Let's go very slowly, and I'll guide you back to the feet every few seconds. Can you just notice the sensation of your feet on the floor for a moment, without trying to think about anything else? Don't try to push through the thoughts, just be with the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground. When you're ready, I'll gently bring it back to the feet. When you feel yourself getting distracted by the thoughts, just acknowledge the thought, and then come back to the feet. Let's start again, slowly.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try to do that and come back to my feet when the thought pops up. My feet feel a tiny bit steady under me for a second, but then my brain immediately fires the whole forecast — I’ll miss a med, get reported, lose my license, my partner will leave — and I tense up.

Recognizing that your mind is like a "push-and-pull" between the physical sensation of your feet and the thoughts is important. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "temporal containment", where you can contain the thoughts and emotions within a small window of time.

Therapist Answer:
Let's go very slowly, and I'll guide you back to the feet every few seconds. Can you notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, even if it's just for a fraction of a second? Don't try to think about anything else, just be with the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground. When your mind starts to wander to the thoughts, I'll say "Let's come back to the feet" and we'll gently bring it back. We'll start again, slowly. Can you do that for me?
