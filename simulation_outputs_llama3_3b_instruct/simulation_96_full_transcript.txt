--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm an accountant and lately I've been on edge about work—mostly about losing my job or not knowing what's next. I get really angry and frustrated in conversations about it, and I don't know how to stop it from taking over. I don't know, I guess I don't like talking about it much.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling anxious about your job security and frustrated in conversations about it. Core emotion is anxiety. Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're avoiding discussing this topic because it's really uncomfortable for you. What's one conversation where you feel like this anxiety and frustration took over, and how did you react to the situation?

Patient: There was a meeting with my manager a few weeks ago where they hinted my position might be on the chopping block; I got angry, cut him off, said something sharp about how they'd manage fine without me, and walked out. I felt ashamed afterward and tried to apologize, but I don't know, I guess I don't like talking about it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You reacted strongly to a potentially threatening situation, which led to avoidance and feelings of shame. Goal: Explore the avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
That must have been a really difficult and intense experience. Can you notice what you were trying to avoid in that moment - was it the conversation itself, the possibility of losing your job, or something else?

Patient: I think I was trying to avoid facing how replaceable I felt and the panic about not being able to provide or pay the bills. I don't know, I guess admitting any of that makes me feel exposed, so I shut down and lashed out instead.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your avoidance of facing the underlying fears and emotions related to job security is making the situation worse. Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
Those feelings of being replaceable and the anxiety about providing for yourself are closely tied to a value of self-sufficiency and security. What would happen if, for a moment, you could acknowledge those feelings and still be okay with taking action towards your career, rather than avoiding it?

Patient: I don't know. Maybe if I admitted it I could do practical things—update my resume, reach out to former colleagues—rather than snapping at people. I guess the problem is I don't even know where to start and talking about it makes me feel worse.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware that acknowledging and taking action could lead to feeling better, but the anxiety about talking about it is a significant barrier. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is stuck on the idea that you need to have all the answers and a plan before taking action, which is causing more anxiety. Can you imagine taking a small, tiny step towards updating your resume, just for a minute, without any expectations or judgment - would that feel like a tiny act of kindness to yourself?

Patient: I don't know. Maybe spending ten minutes on my resume sounds manageable, I guess, but just saying it makes my chest tight and I start wanting to shut down. Can we slow down? I'm not sure where to begin and I keep worrying I'll get angry again.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that even a small step feels overwhelming due to the anxiety and anticipation of anger. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and focus on the sensation of your chest tightening. Can you notice where it's located, what it feels like, and if it changes at all when you take a few slow, deep breaths, without thinking about the task of updating your resume?

Patient: It's right in the center of my chest, like a heavy tight band, and my breaths get shallow. When I try to breathe slowly it eases a bit at first, but then the tightness creeps back and I start spiraling about bills and losing control, and I don't know, I guess that scares me.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations of anxiety are closely tied to feelings of loss of control and fear. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and explore these feelings. Would you be willing to try a different approach to exploring your career and job security, one that doesn't rely on your ability to "handle" the anxiety, but instead focuses on being present with your feelings, even if they're uncomfortable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but sitting with it feels really hard for me. Maybe just for a minute—like, notice the chest tightness and name it without trying to fix anything? Can we go really slow? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're willing to take a small step towards exploring your feelings, and you want to approach it in a gentle way. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it one breath at a time. Can you simply notice the sensation in your chest, without adding any thoughts or labels, just for this next breath? Just "the sensation in my chest"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. The tightness is still there, right in the middle of my chest, and when I notice it my breaths get shallower but a slow breath helps a bit—then my mind flashes to bills and I feel that hot rush of anger and shame. I don't know, I guess I'm getting a bit restless and overwhelmed—can we stay with this slowly?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the pattern of the tightness, breath, and mental flashbacks, and you're feeling overwhelmed. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
It's like your mind is already getting ahead of you, even in this small moment. Can we try to anchor in the sensation in your chest right now, without judging it or trying to change it, just notice it as it is, with your breath?

Patient: Okay... I'm noticing it—the tight band in the middle of my chest. A slow breath helps for a second, but then my head jumps to bills, getting fired, and I feel that hot rush of anger and shame. I don't know, I guess staying with it makes me jittery—can we slow down some more?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the cycle of tension and mental flashbacks, and it's becoming overwhelming. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. Can you just focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feeling the weight of your body on the chair or floor, without any thoughts or distractions?

Patient: I can kind of feel the soles of my feet, like a dull pressure where they meet the floor, and the weight of my legs in the chair. But my mind keeps jerking away to bills and that meeting and I get jittery—I don't know, I guess I'm having trouble staying with it. Can we keep it really slow?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the physical sensations in your body, but your mind keeps drifting back to the thoughts that are causing discomfort. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's keep the focus on your breath, and I'll guide you gently. Can you notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils, without trying to control it or change it?

Patient: Okay... I can feel the air at my nostrils—cool in, warmer out—and it calms me a beat. Then my head shoots to bills and that meeting and I feel heavy and worn out; I don't know, I guess I'm having trouble staying with it. Can we keep it really slow?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to focus on the sensation of the breath, and for a moment, it brings some calm. However, your mind is still prone to jumping back to thoughts about bills and the meeting. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to anchor in the breath again. As you feel the air moving in and out, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm having a hard time staying with the sensation of the breath, and that's okay." Allow yourself to accept this, without judgment, and gently bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath.

Patient: Okay... I'm saying it to myself: "I'm having a hard time staying with the sensation of the breath, and that's okay." It helps for a beat, then my chest tightens and my mind snaps to bills and that meeting and I feel jittery and worn out. I don't know, I guess can we just stay with one slow breath for a while?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge your experience and accept that it's okay to struggle with staying with the sensation of the breath. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's just focus on one slow breath together. I'll guide you through it. Inhale slowly... hold... exhale slowly... and let's just stay with the sensation of the breath for just one more moment, without any thoughts or distractions.

Patient: Okay... I can follow that one slow breath. It helps for a beat, then this stupid shame wells up and I get hot and angry at myself — like I should've done better. I don't know, I guess staying here feels heavy and I keep wanting to bolt. Can we do another really slow one?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to stay with the breath, and now a new wave of shame and self-criticism is arising. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's go back to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the weight of your legs in the chair, the sensation of the chair on your skin, without judgment or trying to change it? I'll count slowly with you... one... two... three...

Patient: I can sort of feel the weight of my legs and the chair, but my head keeps flicking to bills and that meeting and this stupid shame washes over me and I get tight and snappy. I don't know, I guess... can we just stay here really slow?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're able to notice the sensations in your body, but your mind is still getting pulled back to thoughts and emotions. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's bring the focus back to the sensation of your breath. Inhale... hold... exhale... and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck, and that's okay." Allow the words to sink in, and see if you can stay with the sensation of your breath without judgment.

Patient: Okay... I inhaled and said it to myself: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and stuck, and that's okay." It helps for a beat, then my chest tightens and this stupid shame rushes up—I keep thinking I should've done better and get hot and snappy. I don't know, I guess I'm kind of worn out and it's hard to stay with the breath; can we just do another really slow one?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to stay with the breath and acknowledge your feelings of overwhelm and shame. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it really, really slow. Inhale... one... two... three... hold... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... slowly exhale... and as you exhale, bring to mind the phrase "I am enough" and simply allow it to be true, without judgment or attachment.

Patient: Okay... I tried to say "I am enough," but it just feels hollow and then this stupid shame wells up and I get hot and angry at myself. I don't know, I guess I just can't believe it right now and my mind keeps snapping away to everything I did wrong. Can we... do one more really slow breath? I'm having trouble staying with this.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to notice the emotional reaction to the phrase "I am enough," and it's not sticking. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's go back to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Take one slow breath in... hold... and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm allowing myself to feel whatever arises, without judgment or trying to change it." Allow the words to sink in, and see if you can stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without any thoughts or distractions.

Patient: Okay... I can feel my feet and the weight in the chair, and I tried the breath. It helps for a second, then that stupid shame wells up and my chest tightens and I get hot and snappy. I don't know, I guess I'm having trouble staying with this—my head keeps jerking to bills and that meeting. Can we... just do one more really slow breath together?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're able to stay with the physical sensations and the breath, but your mind is still getting pulled back to thoughts and emotions. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep, slow breath together. Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm exactly as I am right now, with all of my thoughts, feelings, and sensations. I'm here, in this moment." Allow the words to sink in, and see if you can stay with the sensation of your breath, without any thoughts or distractions.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm exactly as I am" just makes my chest tighten and that stupid shame spikes, and then I get hot and angry at myself. I don't know, I guess how is that supposed to help with the bills and that meeting flashing through my head? Can we... do another really slow breath together?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a strong reaction to the phrase, and it's not providing the desired effect. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, even smaller. Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm feeling..." in a very soft voice. Just start with the word "feeling". Let's just focus on getting the word out, and see if we can go from there.

Patient: Feeling... I don't know, it's this tight, hot shame in my chest that makes me want to shut down. I guess I can say it, but it feels hollow—can we just try another really slow breath?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the sensation of shame and the desire to shut down, and you're able to say the word "feeling" without judgment. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, I'll add a tiny word to yours. You can say "this". It's a very small step, but sometimes those small steps can be enough to create a small opening. Try it with me: "I'm feeling this".

Patient: I'm feeling this... it's a heavy tightness in my chest and then that stupid shame wells up and I get hot and angry at myself. I don't know, I guess staying with it just feels hard—can we keep it really slow and do one more breath?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the sensation of the tightness and the shame, and it's still a challenging experience. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, I'll add another tiny word. You can say "in" followed by the word "my" chest. It's still a small step, but let's see if it helps. Try it with me: "I'm feeling this in my chest".

Patient: I'm feeling this in my chest. It's that heavy tight band and then that stupid shame wells up and I get hot and angry and want to bolt. I don't know, I guess—can we do another really slow breath?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the sensation of the tightness and the shame, and it's still a difficult experience. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, I'll add a tiny word to the phrase "I'm feeling this in my chest". You can say "and it is". This is a very small step, but sometimes acknowledging the existence of the experience can be enough to create some space. Try it with me: "I'm feeling this in my chest and it is".

Patient: I'm feeling this in my chest and it is a heavy, hot tightness that makes me want to bolt. I don't know, I guess saying it out loud helps a bit—can we do one more really slow breath?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the sensation of the tightness and the desire to bolt, and it's becoming slightly more manageable. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, I'll add another tiny word. You can say "right now". This is a very small step, but acknowledging the present moment can help create some space. Try it with me: "I'm feeling this in my chest and it is a heavy, hot tightness right now".

Patient: I'm feeling this in my chest and it is a heavy, hot tightness right now. I don't know, I guess saying it out loud helps for a beat, then that shame spikes and I get this urge to snap or leave. Can we... just do one slow breath together?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the sensation of the tightness and the shame, and it's becoming a bit more familiar. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Inhale... hold... and as you exhale, I'll just say "thank you". Just a simple expression of gratitude for taking this time to explore with me.

Patient: I don't know... "thank you" makes me kind of squirm. My chest is still tight and that shame spikes—I'm worn out and it's getting hard to keep going, but I don't want to stop. Can we slow down and try one concrete thing I can do in a meeting next time so I don't snap—like a short phrase or a quick breathing trick?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling a bit squirmish and the shame is still present, but you're willing to explore concrete actions to manage your reaction in future meetings. Goal: Identify a small, value-driven behavioral step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step towards creating a concrete action for your next meeting. What if, when you feel the shame or tightness starting to build, you take a deep breath in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and out for a count of 4? This simple breathing technique can help calm your nervous system and give you a brief moment to collect your thoughts before responding. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay... I'll try it with you. Inhale four, hold four, exhale four — that helped for a beat, then the shame spikes and my chest tightens again. I don't know, I guess a short phrase to buy time in a meeting would feel more doable than just breathing — something like "I need a minute" or "Let me think on that." Can we practice one simple line? I'm kind of worn out but I want something concrete.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're able to acknowledge the brief moment of calm and then the shame returns, and you're looking for a more concrete action to manage your reaction. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a simple phrase to give you a moment to collect your thoughts in a meeting. How about saying "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts"? It's a brief phrase that acknowledges your need for a moment without feeling like you're avoiding the conversation. Can you repeat it with me: "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "I'm taking a moment to gather my thoughts." It feels awkward and a bit hollow, but I guess it might buy me some time. I don't know—could it be shorter, like "One minute"?
