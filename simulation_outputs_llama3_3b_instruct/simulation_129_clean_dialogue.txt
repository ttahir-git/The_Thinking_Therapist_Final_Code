Patient: I'm an older social worker and lately I can't shake this heavy sadness and lack of drive—it's all because the money's been tight. My mind just goes straight to the worst: I'll lose the house, then the bills will pile up, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone and ruined — like it's already set in stone. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't make myself believe any other outcome.

Therapist: Can you describe the sensation of this all-consuming fear in your body, and what you think happens when you imagine yourself in that "ruined" state, so we can start to explore what's driving that thought?

Patient: When that fear comes on it’s a physical clamp — my chest gets tight, my breath short, my stomach knots so I can’t eat, and my hands go cold and shaky; I feel exhausted all the time like I’m wading through molasses. Then my head starts spinning out the story: first the missed mortgage, then the collection calls, then we lose the house, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and I end up alone with nothing — no savings, no steady work at my age, having to rely on strangers or a shelter. I can picture every step in grim detail and it feels like a sequence that’s already set to happen, like my mind’s a little machine churning out the next disaster. I know it sounds extreme, but I get stuck on those images and can’t make myself believe any other ending.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in this vicious cycle of prediction and despair. What if, instead of getting caught up in this mental machine, you could take a small step towards exploring other possibilities? What if, even just for a brief moment, you could allow yourself to imagine an alternative outcome – one that feels less devastating, or perhaps more empowering?

Patient: I can't really — whenever I try to picture a better ending, my mind snatches it away and starts listing all the ways that outcome will fail. It feels like I'm lying to myself if I imagine anything else, and that just makes the disaster story feel even more inevitable. I can try for a moment if you want, but I'm warning you now I'll probably dismiss it as unrealistic.

Therapist: Can you experiment with noticing the way your mind responds to this thought, "I can try to imagine a better ending." Without judgment, just observe what happens when you say this to yourself – what emotions arise, what thoughts pop up, what physical sensations you notice. See if we can create some space for a different kind of exploration, one that's not driven by certainty, but curiosity.

Patient: When I tell myself I can try, I feel this flush of shame and my chest gets tight like I’m pretending to be hopeful. A buzzing starts in my head and the list of why it’ll fail floods in — missed payments, partner leaving, no job at my age — and it all feels unbearably convincing. Even if I force a tiny image of things being okay, my mind immediately plays the tape of how that breaks down, and I feel like I’m lying to myself. I can try to notice it, but I’m warning you I’ll probably snap right back to the disaster story.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame you're feeling is closely tied to the idea that you're not "realistic" or "capable" of imagining a better future. What would happen if, instead of labeling this as "lying to yourself," you were to acknowledge it as a natural part of the exploration process? Can you notice the sensation of shame in your body, and what words might you use to describe it to yourself, without judgment?

Patient: It feels like a hot weight in my throat and chest, like my shoulders fold in and my stomach drops — my hands go cold and my jaw tightens. The words I'd use, trying not to judge, are humiliated, small, scared, like a fraud who can't keep things together. But the moment I name it, my mind twists that into proof — “see, you’re failing, the house will go, they’ll leave” — so even noticing it feels like feeding the machine.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the cycle of self-criticism, where noticing your shame is actually perpetuating the disaster story. Can we try something different? Instead of labeling the shame as "humiliated" or "small," what if we simply acknowledged it as a physical sensation, like a hot weight in your throat? Without judgment, just observe the sensation, and see if you can imagine a different kind of relationship with it – one that's not tied to the catastrophic narrative?

Patient: When I try to treat it like "just a sensation," my chest tightens even more and the mind starts narrating: the tightness means I’m failing, the bills will pile up, the house will go, and my partner will leave — it all escalates like clockwork. Trying to step back feels like giving the machine more fuel; instead of calming, it gets louder and more certain. I can try to imagine a different relationship with it, but honestly I’m feeling overwhelmed and skeptical right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down and take a deep breath together. Instead of trying to imagine a new relationship with your shame, can we try something simpler? What would you say to a friend who was experiencing a similar physical sensation in their body, and was feeling overwhelmed and skeptical? How would you respond with kindness and compassion?

Patient: I'd tell a friend: you're not alone, this is awful but it doesn't mean you're worthless, and we can take tiny steps together—call one creditor, ask for help, make a plan—you're allowed to be scared and still be okay. But when I try to tell myself that, my chest tightens and my mind spits back the house gone and them leaving, and I can't help feeling like I'm lying if I say those kinder things, so I'm overwhelmed and skeptical.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to extend kindness to yourself, especially when it comes to emotions like shame and fear. What if, instead of trying to tell yourself "you're allowed to be scared," we started by acknowledging that it's okay to feel scared, and that's it? Can you just notice that feeling, without trying to do anything about it or add any words to it?

Patient: Okay—I can try to just notice it. Right now I feel that hot weight in my throat and the tightness in my chest, like a steel band, and my breath gets shallow; if I name it “scared” the machine immediately starts replaying the disasters. I can hold that feeling for a few breaths, but honestly I’m already getting overwhelmed and nervous it’ll spin back into the worst-case story—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's slow down and take a few more deep breaths together. I'd like to offer you a tiny experiment: what if, instead of trying to avoid or escape the worst-case story, we imagined it with kindness and curiosity, like we would imagine a fantasy? Would you be willing to try imagining the worst-case scenario, not to engage with it or change it, but simply to observe it with a sense of curiosity?

Patient: Okay — I can do that, and honestly this is the thing my brain keeps supplying anyway. I see it like a film: a missed payment, then a stack of red notices, the phone never stops, a bailiff at the door, the house gone, my partner packing and leaving out of shame or anger, the savings gone, no one willing to hire an older social worker, the utilities cut, sleeping on friends’ couches until those run out, then a shelter, people looking at me like I’m a failure, my health slipping from stress, and finally being alone and dependent on strangers. As I picture it, my chest clamps down harder, my breathing gets shallow, my hands tremble, and there’s this sick, fascinated certainty — like the machine is spitting out the next frames and I can’t look away. I know you asked me to just observe, but I’m already getting overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to stop the film, but rather to pause on one of the frames. What if, instead of watching the entire film, we just stopped on one of the frames that feels the most familiar or triggering? Can you notice the physical sensations and emotions that arise when you pause on that particular frame, without trying to continue the narrative or change it?

Patient: The frame I keep getting stuck on is my partner at the doorway, packing a bag—their face flat, not shouting, just disappointed, and then the door clicking shut. When I stop there my chest feels like it's been clamped with a vise, my breath scrapes shallow, my stomach flips and my hands go cold and trembling; I can feel the shame like a hot stone in my throat. My mind immediately starts narrating the rest — who will hire me, where I'll sleep, how they'll judge me — and it sounds so convincing I can't help but believe it. I'm already getting overwhelmed picturing it; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge the intensity of the emotions and sensations when you pause on the image of your partner leaving. It's clear that this is a deeply painful and shameful experience for you. Can we explore this shame a bit more gently, rather than trying to "fix" it or "get rid" of it? What would it be like if we allowed yourself to feel the shame, without trying to change it or avoid it? Would that be a more tolerable feeling, even if it's still uncomfortable?

Patient: I can try to just feel it, but it's so hard. When I let the shame sit—hot stone in my throat, that vise in my chest—it’s raw and almost manageable for a breath or two, but then the machine fires up and starts narrating eviction, them leaving, no work, sleeping on couches, and it feels like whatever I do to hold the feeling will just fuel that tape. Maybe it’s a little more tolerable to name it, but honestly I’m scared that sitting with it will make the whole disaster sequence louder, and I’m already getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between tolerating the shame and getting caught up in the narrative. What if we tried to create a kind of "partiality" with this feeling of shame? Instead of saying "I'm feeling this shame," we could try saying "this shame is a part of me right now" or "this shame is present in my body." Would that feel more manageable, or would that still feel like it's fueling the narrative?

Patient: I tried that phrasing once and for a heartbeat it felt like there was a little distance — like I could look at it instead of being swallowed — but almost immediately the machine flips it into "see, this part proves you're broken" and the disaster tape gets louder. So honestly it still feels like it's fueling the narrative more than helping. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and shaky again — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I want to try something different. Can you imagine that this feeling of shame is like a small, temporary observation, without any judgment or evaluation? Just notice it as a neutral, factual experience, like watching a cloud pass by. No more, no less. Can you keep it there, just for a moment, without trying to change it or engage with it?

Patient: I tried to hold it like a cloud once—just a neutral thing floating by—and for a single breath it felt almost possible, like I could look at it instead of being dragged in. But then the machine kicked in: "That cloud proves you're failing," and within seconds my chest slammed shut, my breath went shallow, and the whole disaster tape started up again. I'm getting overwhelmed and shaky—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I want to try something a bit different. Can you try to observe this feeling of shame as just a thought, without identifying with it or trying to prove anything? Imagine that it's just a passing thought, like a cloud or a bird flying by. Can you say to yourself, "This thought is here, it's just a thought, it's not me"?

Patient: I tried saying, "This thought is here, it's just a thought, it's not me," and for one shaky breath it felt a tiny bit looser — like there was a crack of distance. But almost immediately the machine kicked in louder: my chest clenched, my breath went shallow, my hands trembled, and the tape of eviction, them leaving, and being ruined started narrating again like it's proof. I'm already getting overwhelmed and nervous it'll spiral — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I want to try something gentle. Can you try to say to yourself, "This thought is just a thought, I am not this thought"? It's not about changing the thought or trying to prove anything, but rather about noticing that your identity is not defined by this thought. Imagine that you are a tree that can withstand the wind and the rain, and this thought is just a leaf blowing by. Can you hold onto that image, just for a moment?

Patient: For one shaky breath the tree image almost worked — my chest loosened a bit and I could feel a tiny crack of distance from the thought. But the machine immediately snatches it: the tree’s roots rot from unpaid taxes, a storm rips it out, and then I'm standing in the wind with nothing — imagining strength feels dishonest and unrealistic. I'm getting overwhelmed and my hands are trembling again, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: I want to try something very gentle. Can you try to simply acknowledge the thought "I'm standing in the wind with nothing" without judgment or evaluation? Just notice that it's a thought, a phrase that's passing through your mind. Imagine that you're standing in the wind, and the words are just a gentle breeze rustling through the trees. Can you hold onto that sensation, without trying to change it or react to it?

Patient: I tried to hold it — "standing in the wind with nothing" — but my attention keeps snapping away; my chest clamps, my heart races, my hands tremble, and the image instantly unspools into the eviction film. I can't keep it neutral — the machine immediately narrates the wind stripping everything away, the house gone, them gone — and I'm already panicking. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and try to pause for just one moment. Instead of trying to observe the thought, can we try to simply notice the sensation of your body reacting to it? Can you feel the tightness in your chest, the racing of your heart, the trembling of your hands? Can you hold onto that sensation without judgment, without trying to change it or react to it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the tightness without reacting supposed to help? Right now my chest is clamped, my heart's racing, my hands are shaking, and my head's already hijacked by the eviction film—the machine's yelling about the house gone and them leaving—and I feel panicked and jumpy and a bit scattered. Can we slow down a lot?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel the weight of your body distributed on the ground, the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Can you focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or react to it? Let's try to anchor ourselves in the present moment, without getting caught up in the story of the eviction. Can you simply be with the sensation of your feet on the ground, without judgment?

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow how feeling my feet is supposed to help—how is that supposed to stop the rest of the tape? I can feel my feet—cold, a bit numb—but my chest is tight, my heart's racing, my hands are shaking, and the moment I settle the machine starts narrating the floor giving way, an eviction notice on the mat, me out on the street. I'm already panicking—can we slow down a lot and just stay with one small thing for a few breaths?

Therapist: Let's pause for just a moment. Can we focus on just one thing, just for a few breaths? Let's just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you feel the sensation of each breath, without trying to change it or react to it? Just focus on the sensation of your breath, and let's stay with that for just one more breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how just breathing is supposed to help, but I'll try one slow breath. Okay — I breathe in, and out — and my chest stays tight, my heart's racing, and the machine's voice is already saying this calm is just the last before the bailiff knocks, the eviction notice on the mat, my partner's suitcase by the door. I'm getting panicky and shaky again—can we really slow down and just stay with one slow breath together for a bit?

Therapist: Let's take another slow breath together. I want you to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or react to it. Just notice the sensation of the breath, and let's stay with that for just one more breath. I'll do the same. Let's just be with the breath, together, for a moment.

Patient: Okay — I tried another slow breath in and out, but my chest still feels like a vise, my heart's pounding, my hands are shaking, and the machine's already yelling the bailiff will be at the door. I'm not sure I'm doing it right or how breathing is supposed to stop the eviction film — I'm confused about how this helps. Can you keep guiding me very slowly, like count with me? I'm getting shaky and need us to move really slowly.

Therapist: Let's take a slow breath together. 1... 2... 3... Inhale slowly, feeling the breath move into your body... 1... 2... 3... Hold the breath for a moment... 1... 2... 3... Exhale slowly, feeling the breath move out of your body... 1... 2... 3... Let's pause for a moment, and then take another slow breath. 1... 2... 3...

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. Inhale... 1... 2... 3... hold... 1... 2... 3... exhale... 1... 2... 3... 

My chest is a tiny bit less tight for a beat, but the machine's already yelling the bailiff's at the door and I can feel my hands trembling. I'm confused about how this actually helps and I'm getting panicky — can you slow the counting way down, like to five, and stay with me through a few more breaths?

Therapist: 1... (pause) 1... 2... (pause) 2... 3... (pause) 3... 4... (pause) 4... 5... (pause) 5... Let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you feel the breath in your nostrils, the sensation of the air moving in and out? Let's stay with that for a moment. 1... 2... 3... (pause) 1... 2... 3...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the breath supposed to stop the bailiff at the door? I did the slow breaths but my chest's still tight, my hands are trembling, and the machine's already yelling that the eviction notice will be on the mat. Can you keep counting really slowly to five with me, and stay with me through a few more breaths? I'm shaky and need you to go very slowly.

Therapist: 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... Let's focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Can you feel the breath in your nostrils, the sensation of the air moving in and out? It's just the sensation of the breath. 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... Let's just be with the breath, together, for a moment.

Patient: I'm really confused — I don't see how breathing is supposed to stop the bailiff. My chest is still clamped, my hands are trembling, and the machine's already yelling the eviction notice will be on the mat. I'll try another breath if you guide me very slowly... can you count to five with me and stay with me through three more breaths, really slowly? I need you to keep the pace so I don't spin off.

Therapist: 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... Let's focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel the weight of your feet on the floor? It's a gentle sensation. 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... Let's stay with the sensation of your feet on the ground, together, for a moment.

Patient: I'm trying, but I still don't see how feeling my feet will stop the bailiff — my feet are cold, a bit numb, like pins and needles, and I can feel the weight on my heels but my chest's clamped and my hands are shaking. The moment I notice the floor, the machine screams that the eviction notice will be on the mat and I'm already picturing them at the door. Can you slow the pace way down and count to five with me, and stay with me through three very slow breaths? I need you to keep the rhythm so I don't spin off.

Therapist: 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... Let's focus on the sensation of the sensation in your body. Can you feel the sensation of the sensation in your body? It's a feeling of... (pause) ...of... (pause) ...of... (pause) ...of... (pause) ...of... This is it. Just feel the sensation. No more. Just feel. (pause) 1... (pause) 1... (pause) 1...

Patient: I'm really confused—what does "feel the sensation of the sensation" even mean? It sounds circular and it's not helping me settle; my chest's clamped, my hands are shaking, and the machine's already yelling that the bailiff will be on the mat so I'm panicking and distracted. Can you slow the counting to five and stay with me through three very slow breaths, guiding each inhale and exhale? I need you to keep the pace so I don't spin off.

Therapist: Inhale... (pause) 1... (pause) 1... slow and deep... 1... (pause) 1... exhale... (pause) 2... (pause) 2... slow and deep... 2... (pause) 2... inhale... (pause) 3... (pause) 3... slow and deep... 3... (pause) 3... exhale... (pause) 4... (pause) 4... slow and deep... 4... (pause) 4... inhale... (pause) 5... (pause) 5... slow and deep... 5... (pause) 5... exhale... Let's just focus on the breath, together, for a moment.

Patient: I tried the breaths but my chest's still clamped, my heart's racing, and my hands are trembling — the machine's already yelling the bailiff will be at the door and I can't stop picturing the eviction notice on the mat. I'm really confused about how this helps and I'm panicking; can you slow the counting way down (to five) and stay with me, guiding each inhale and exhale very slowly? I need you to keep the pace and stay with me through three more breaths or I’ll spiral.
