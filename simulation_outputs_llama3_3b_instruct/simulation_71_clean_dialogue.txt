Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling stuck and directionless lately — like I can't see who I am beyond being unemployed, and after a rough breakup it's just amplified everything. I keep doubting myself and I don't know what actually matters to me anymore. I don't really expect this to magically fix anything, so... how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of uncertainty right now. Can you think of one specific area where you're stuck, like a particular hobby or interest, or a type of work that used to bring you joy? What is it about that area that you wish you could tap into again, or explore in a new way?

Patient: I used to write short stories and get totally lost in them — it felt like the only thing that made me feel like me. Lately, I sit down and the page stays blank, or I spiral into self-criticism, so I guess I'd want that flow back — but I've tried journaling and forcing myself to write and it just doesn't work. How is talking about that supposed to help anyway?

Therapist: It seems like writing is a vital part of what makes you feel connected to yourself. I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to force yourself to write or journal in a certain way. What if, instead of trying to recreate the past, you could start small and explore the discomfort of simply sitting with a blank page? Would you be willing to try writing just one sentence, or even just one word, without any expectations or pressure?

Patient: Alright, fine — I can try writing one sentence, but I'm skeptical it'll change anything. How is that supposed to help when I always just end up calling it garbage and shutting down?

Therapist: So, when you start writing, what happens just before you shut down or call your work "garbage"? Is it a specific thought that arises, or a physical sensation in your body? Can you give me a sense of what's happening right before you pull the plug?

Patient: Usually it starts with this tightness in my chest and this voice that immediately says, "This is garbage, why bother." My hands go cold, I freeze up, and before I know it I’m deleting everything — it feels like all the old criticisms after the breakup and being unemployed just pile on. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help stop it when it kicks in so fast?

Therapist: Those physical sensations in your chest and hands sound very uncomfortable. Can you take a deep breath and try to notice the sensations without trying to label them as "c criticism" or "negative thoughts"? Just observe what's happening in your body, without judgment – would you be willing to do that for just a few seconds?

Patient: Alright, I took a breath — there’s this tightness across my chest, my shoulders tense up, and my hands feel a bit numb. For a second the "this is garbage" voice quieted, but it came right back and felt almost louder afterward. How is just noticing supposed to make it stop when that voice hits so fast and hard?

Therapist: Can you imagine that the "this is garbage" voice is like a persistent alarm in your body, and you've learned to temporarily silence it by taking a few deep breaths and noticing the physical sensations? What would happen if, instead of trying to silence the voice completely, you were to make room for it to exist, without judgment? Would you be willing to try that?

Patient: Alright, I’ll try — though I’m not convinced. The voice is loud and immediate, but I’m letting it be there instead of pushing it away; weirdly, my shoulders eased a little, but the voice didn’t actually soften. I don’t get how letting it exist keeps me from deleting everything the second I don’t like a line — how does that actually help when the urge to bail is still right there?

Therapist: Can you think of what's at stake for you when you feel the urge to delete your writing? What is it about creating something that matters to you, even if it's imperfect or not good enough? Is it a sense of personal growth, self-expression, or something else?

Patient: I guess what's at stake is my sense of who I am — if I can't write, then what am I besides unemployed and the person who got dumped. I'm scared that anything I put out will prove I'm not good enough or just embarrass me, so I delete it to avoid that feeling. But honestly, naming that fear feels fine on paper — how is that actually supposed to stop the panic the second it hits?

Therapist: Let's try a small, concrete step. Can you think of one tiny, imperfect action you could take towards writing, like writing just one sentence, or typing out one word, without expecting to produce something perfect? What would happen if you did that, right now, without any expectations or judgment?

Patient: Okay — I typed one sentence: "The light in the kitchen reminded me of summer once." My chest tightened when I thought about deleting it, but I didn't, and it felt weirdly small and also kind of like a tiny relief. I still don't see how keeping one dumb sentence is supposed to help me get unstuck for real — how does that actually lead anywhere?

Therapist: That sentence might seem insignificant, but what if it's not about the sentence itself, but about the fact that you chose to take a small action, despite the discomfort? Can you imagine that this tiny act of creation, even if imperfect, is a small step towards reclaiming your sense of self and creative expression?

Patient: Okay — I can see that maybe it was more about doing something than whether it was good. For a second it felt like proof I could still make something, but it also felt fragile and like the panic could wipe it out any minute. How is that supposed to turn into... actually getting unstuck long-term? I've tried small steps before and they just fizzled.

Therapist: Can you think of what would happen if you stopped expecting your writing to be perfect, and instead, focused on the process of creating something, no matter how imperfect? What if you were to commit to showing up to your writing, even if it's just for a few minutes a day, without worrying about the outcome? Would that feel like a more sustainable way to move forward?

Patient: Maybe—that actually sounds...reasonable on paper, but I've tried "showing up" routines before and they just fizzle when the panic hits. I could commit to a few minutes a day, but I worry I’ll slip back into deleting everything after a rough day — what would be different this time, and what do I do the moment I feel that urge to bail?

Therapist: Can you think of what would happen if you were to be kind to yourself when you make a mistake or if you don't feel like writing? What if, instead of beating yourself up, you simply acknowledge the feeling and take a few deep breaths? Would that be enough to make a difference in how you approach your writing?

Patient: I get the idea — being kinder to myself sounds good on paper, and when I actually pause and breathe it can soften the tightness for a second. But usually that voice just comes back louder and I delete everything anyway, so I'm skeptical that “be kind” will actually make it stick; how is that supposed to help in the moment? Can we try a concrete, do-able strategy I can use the second the urge to bail shows up, something more than just telling myself to be nice?

Therapist: Can you think of a small, concrete action you can take when you feel the urge to delete your work, something that doesn't require perfecting your writing, but simply acknowledges the feeling? For example, could you try copying and pasting the sentence into a new document, or saving it to a "backup" folder? What would happen if you did that?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saving it supposed to stop me from deleting it in the moment? I guess copying the sentence into a backup folder or emailing it to myself might make me feel a little safer, like it's not truly gone if I panic, and that could give me a second to breathe. But I'm skeptical — even with a backup I might still delete the original and feel just as ashamed, so I don't know if it actually changes the panic when it hits. I could try the backup trick, though, and see if having that safety net helps me hang on to more than one sentence next time.

Therapist: Let's try the backup strategy for now, and see how it goes. Can you commit to doing just that, for the next writing session, no matter what happens? What would it take for you to feel like you've "won" in that moment, and what would that look like for you?

Patient: I can commit to trying the backup trick next time — copying whatever I write into a backup doc or emailing it to myself before I delete anything. A "win" for me would be leaving that sentence there for at least 24 hours (or adding one more sentence instead of deleting), or at minimum saving it and waiting five minutes without deleting. I'm still skeptical it’ll stick, though — if the urge hits and the panic's louder than the safety net, what do I actually do in that moment besides breathe?

Therapist: Let's explore the idea of radical acceptance. Can you think of what would happen if, when the urge to delete hits, you simply accepted it, without judgment or resistance? What would you do, in that exact moment, when the voice in your head says "delete"? Would you take a deep breath, or perhaps do something else entirely?

Patient: I'm not sure I get how "accepting" it doesn't just feel like giving the voice permission to win — how is that supposed to help? But if I had to try it in the moment, I'd do something concrete: pause and take three slow breaths, hit save and immediately copy the text into a backup doc or email it to myself, then set a five-minute rule where I can't delete anything. If the urge's still loud after five, I'd do a tiny physical reset — stand up, walk to the kitchen, splash water on my face, or make a cup of tea — something to break the automatic delete reflex. At least that way the words are safe and I don't lose whatever I managed to make. I'm skeptical it’ll stop the panic, though — why do you think that chain of things would help when the voice is screaming?

Therapist: I think the chain of actions you've outlined – pausing, taking slow breaths, saving, and then taking a physical reset – can help to interrupt the automatic response to the panic. The goal isn't to silence the voice, but to create a small gap between the feeling and the action. Defusion is about seeing the thought as just a thought, without taking it on as your identity. Can you think of a way to remind yourself that the thought is just a thought, even when the voice is screaming?

Patient: Maybe a short, dumb line like "thoughts aren't facts" on a sticky note by my keyboard—or a phone reminder that pings when I open the doc. It sounds silly and hollow when the panic hits, but it might buy me a second to save, breathe, and do that five‑minute rule I said — I can try it, though I'm skeptical it'll actually stick.

Therapist: I like the idea of using a sticky note or reminder to anchor the phrase "thoughts aren't facts". Can you think of a specific phrase or word that resonates with you, something that reminds you of your values or what's important to you in this moment? Would you be willing to write that phrase on the sticky note, and see if it provides a different kind of comfort or reminder for you?

Patient: Maybe "One sentence at a time." It feels less preachy than "be kind" and actually ties to something I can do. I'll put it on a sticky note and set a phone reminder — but how is that really different from what I’ve tried before, and what should I do if I still want to delete after seeing it?

Therapist: I'm glad you like the phrase "One sentence at a time". It's not meant to be a replacement for your backup strategy, but rather a way to add an extra layer of motivation and reminder. If you see the phrase and feel the urge to delete, what would happen if you simply said to yourself "I can come back to this later" or "I'll save it for now"? Would that give you a different kind of permission to pause and take a break?

Patient: Maybe — telling myself "I can come back to this later" could give me a tiny out instead of the immediate panic impulse, and might help me hit save and copy to the backup first. I can pair it with the five‑minute rule: save, copy, set a short timer, then do a quick physical reset if it's still loud. But honestly, when the voice is screaming that phrase feels hollow, so I'm skeptical it'll stick — what else can I actually do in those five minutes if the urge to delete is still intense?

Therapist: What would you like to do in those five minutes that feels connected to what's important to you? Would you like to write something that brings you joy, or simply take a walk, or do something creative? What would happen if you committed to doing something that felt meaningful to you, even if it's not perfect or polished?

Patient: I guess in those five minutes I'd try something that actually feels like me — maybe write one tiny sensory line that makes me smile, step outside for a short walk, or doodle something dumb. But there's this shame that keeps bubbling up and making me want to erase it all, like some failure flashing in my head, so even small things feel risky. I'll try setting a timer and saving whatever I do first, but I'm skeptical it'll be enough — still willing to try it, though.

Therapist: Let's explore this idea of radical acceptance of shame. Can you think of a specific time when you felt shame in a creative context before, and how you handled it? Was there something that you could do in that moment that helped you feel more at peace with yourself? What if, instead of trying to avoid or suppress the shame, you simply acknowledged it and accepted it as a natural part of the creative process?

Patient: Yeah — there’s a specific time that still stings, but I don’t really want to relive the details; I froze and deleted everything and just withdrew. At the time I coped by pretending it didn’t matter, which only made the shame louder later. Once or twice I did try saying aloud “I’m feeling ashamed” and then forcing myself to do one tiny thing (one sentence, a short walk) and it loosened the knot a bit — but honestly, when the panic hits it still feels like nothing will stop me from deleting. How is that supposed to actually help in the exact moment the voice screams?

Therapist: I understand that you've been trying to cope with shame in various ways, but still struggle with the panic when it hits. Instead of trying to stop the panic, what if you tried to see yourself as the context for your emotions? Imagine that you're a river with many currents and eddies, and the shame is just one part of that river. Can you think of a word or phrase that describes you as a whole, beyond the shame? For example, "I am a creative person", "I am a human being", or "I am trying my best"?

Patient: Maybe "I'm trying my best" — it feels more honest than grander labels, but saying it still makes my chest tighten like something's waiting to prove it's a lie. How is that supposed to help when the shame hits and tells me I'm not trying hard enough?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to convince yourself that you're trying your best, you simply acknowledged that effort is already being made? What if you said to yourself "I'm taking steps, I'm trying, I'm showing up" instead of "I'm trying my best"? Would that change the way you relate to your effort, and the way you perceive yourself in the face of shame?

Patient: Maybe — that phrasing feels less like a verdict and more like permission, like it could take some of the all‑or‑nothing pressure off. But when shame is screaming, saying it still feels hollow; I don't know how words alone stop the panic in the moment. I can try saying it when the five‑minute timer starts and pair it with saving and stepping away — can we try practicing that now?

Therapist: Let's practice what you've come up with. When you start the timer, I want you to say to yourself "I'm taking steps, I'm trying, I'm showing up". Say it with me: "I'm taking steps, I'm trying, I'm showing up". As you say it, take a deep breath and make a small physical gesture, like taking a deep breath in or making a small movement with your body. And then, after you've said it, take a moment to save your work and step away. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. "I'm taking steps, I'm trying, I'm showing up." I said it, took a slow breath, saved the sentence and copied it to a backup, then started a five‑minute timer and stood up to walk to the kitchen. It eased the panic a little but my chest is still tight and I'm not convinced it'll stick — can we keep working on what to do if it spikes again?

Therapist: Let's explore what's happening in your body right now. Can you notice the sensation of your chest tightness, without judgment? Is it a physical sensation, a feeling, or a thought? What if, instead of trying to change or avoid it, you simply acknowledged it as a signal that your body is trying to tell you something? What if you asked your body, "What do you need right now?" What might it say?

Patient: I think it would say something like, "Give me a break — don't let this become a catastrophe," or just, "I need safety and some time," meaning a few slow breaths and a tiny proof that my words won't be lost. There's also this undercurrent of "don’t let me get humiliated again," which makes me want to erase things fast. But... how is asking my body that supposed to actually stop the panic when it hits?

Therapist: Let's explore the idea of radical self-compassion. Can you think of a time when you were kind and understanding with a friend who was going through a tough time? How did you show up for them? What would you say to them, and how would you support them? Now, would you like to offer that same kindness and compassion to yourself, even in the midst of panic and shame?

Patient: Once, after a breakup, I sat with a friend and kept saying, "You're not alone, this won't define you," made them tea, and just stayed until they could breathe — it actually helped them calm down. I can imagine saying something like, "You're not alone. It's okay to be imperfect. You showed up," but when that shame spikes it sounds fake and I don't have much energy to argue with it. Can we actually practice me saying those words now, and maybe try a concrete tiny action right after so it doesn't just float away?

Therapist: Let's practice what you've come up with. I want you to say to yourself, "You're not alone. It's okay to be imperfect. You showed up," and then take a tiny action that feels like self-care. For example, you could take a sip of water, stretch your arms over your head, or simply take a few more slow breaths. Can you do that with me?

Patient: "You're not alone. It's okay to be imperfect. You showed up." I said it out loud, took a slow sip of water and a little stretch. It eased my shoulders a hair, but the chest tightness is still there and the words feel thin when the panic spikes. Can we try one more concrete thing I can actually do in the exact moment the urge to delete is loudest?

Therapist: Let's try something more concrete. I want you to take a small, specific action that feels like a form of self-care, and say to yourself "You're not alone. It's okay to be imperfect. You showed up" just before taking that action. For example, you could take a sip of water, make a tiny gesture with your hand, or touch your feet to the ground. What if, instead of just saying the words, you also did something physical that felt nurturing and comforting to you?

Patient: "You're not alone. It's okay to be imperfect. You showed up." I said it quietly, set my feet on the floor, put my hand on my chest, and took three slow breaths. It eased the tightness a little, but the shame's still there and I feel… worn out and annoyed that this is even hard. If it spikes again, what exactly do I do next besides breathe and stand up?
